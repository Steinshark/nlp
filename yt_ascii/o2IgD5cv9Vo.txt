sometimes i imagine myself as a let's say a russian peasant in the 19th century and how the patterns in which people were living were so naive they were true a lot of them were true and were real but they were very innocent and so in some ways they were in very much in danger and so when the materialist secularist narrative comes in people get crushed you know and and i saw that even when i was young i would see people with a very confident but naive faith and then they would go to university and then they would just get crushed and they would go to their first philosophy class and they would just be completely demolished because they had never heard anything like this and never heard any of these arguments and never thought about any of these things in quebec we we had to think of sejet and they had philosophy classes in sijap and i think those philosophy classes were even just designed to like slash the catholicism out of all the quebecers that went through that in the 70s when they were installed and it worked like it totally work the people came in these naive little church growers and then were completely destroyed but what's interesting so now we go through this loop and now we come to let's say this movement this symbolic understanding people kind of re-understanding the role of perception of attention and how it shapes our narratives how it shapes the way the reality manifests itself and once people have gone through that that training what are you gonna how are you gonna take that away from them how are those philosophy professors going to take that away from them i don't think it's possible anymore like i i always say it's like i don't there's nothing you could tell me i don't i mean maybe i don't know i don't i feel like i've heard it all like i feel like there's what is it that you're going to tell me that you're going to convince me no back into that old world i don't see it happening i don't see it happening either this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] i do agree like i think that the change that that's happening and i think john rubiki also has that insight is that the change of perspective or world view that's happening right now it's it's monumental and so you know it is almost i think it's going to be like equivalent to to something like the enlightenment or maybe the renaissance in the sense that the shift that happened and once the shift has totally happened for most people it's just going to become the water they live in they won't be aware of the change i think there's a few people that are aware of the change they kind of see it happening and it's actually painful in some ways because you can almost feel it it was happening to me like i was really feeling it painfully during in 2016 2017 it was very it was painful i was i was sensing like the whole tectonic plates under my feet shifting and it was happening in many ways some of it was political because of the trump election and and all of the craziness online and and these this kind of madness around what jordan was going through and everything but while that was happening i could really feel the world shifting under my feet and it was it was like a kind of existential suffering you know it was hard to describe to people but it was almost like like you feel like you're being ripped apart and you and you and you and and so i felt that now i don't feel it so much because i feel like at least many people kind of bridged the the to the other side of the change so i i don't feel alone too because one of the things that happened for a while is that my brother and i we just felt alone like we we had this kind of intuition about how the world functioned and it was like there was no one around us who who could talk about it but now it's as if now it's become yeah it's it's it's obvious and there are all these people that i think it's almost like these things were preparing themselves in secret for a long time different players you're like john was thinking about it and jordan and all these other people were thinking about things and trying to bring them together then suddenly the moment you know that kairos moment kind of happened then it just snapped together and then we kind of found each other and so that's a that's pretty that's pretty wild you know it is it's interesting that you say that too because i had that sense too that there's almost like this long preparatory period this sort of gestation that something was subterranean for a long time and it was kind of it was being formed invisibly i think and when you look back you can see it it's like you look back and you're like oh you know i think heidegger was talked heidegger was talking about this stuff like all the things that were kind of interest interests us you think well actually there there are some of the modernists that seem to have been intuiting some of it and sometimes a little crookedly or sometimes a little strangely and so and so then but now it feels like it's landing let's say whatever it is those insights that were that that they're landing and they're becoming obvious you know and so something like let's say the way that heidegger described the experience of of the world was something that was just completely obtuse just completely obscure for most people like what is it it's just gibberish they'd read heidegger and they're like they're just gibberish or even the postmodern like actually does have a phenomenological perspective he his all his thinking is is based on that phenomenological perspective so his categories are he emphasizes the margin and you know the exception and the dissemination but he does it from that perspective and so now it's as if it's all kind of landing and now you can i can talk to a regular person and we found language to say it to someone just a regular guy and he's like yeah okay all right no i i like they get it you know and yeah yeah i think that's astounding it is astounding it is astounding and i think it requires i think it's to your point about the kairos i think one of the features as i understand it of kairos is that it requires a certain kind of a certain synchronistic alignment of a lot of patterns to become concentric in such a way that there's an opening there's actually something through which all of this to travel and i think it has something to do with the fact that i think what happens within an individual person is something like what's happening more broadly which is that you just you have to go through this period of suffering such that you exhaust yourself you exhaust yourself beyond the limits of what was tenable and right it's like somehow i'm coming up against the frame of the world that i held and it's just not there's no purchase anymore it's like breath is gone it's finished it's dried up it's like the purgation right it's like something's finished i've reached the end point of myself beyond which there is just nothing yeah and i it's almost as though you have to get to that point maybe whether we're speaking of a person an individual or we're speaking of in a more communal sense right i guess they're co-extensive right that's the whole point of the synchronicity is that the individual in the communal have a co-extensive pattern and that it has something to do with reaching the end of a period of suffering that exhausts whatever the worldview was that was doing the gripping and now it can't grip anymore and some it's like transform or die it's almost like there are two choices yeah like that happening i feel that's what a sense i'm getting from you i think so i think so i it seems like i think saint paul talks about that you know we talked about this idea of the the birth pangs you know the world is in birth banks and that i i think this is almost like a fractal thing like it's something that happens all the time at different levels like you said in individually and and there's this sense like you said a pregation or that the suffering and the breakdown has to has to happen before the the new world is born you know and sometimes it's i mean sometimes it's pretty painful like i i really i think for example that necessarily painful probably yeah well interestingly enough it feels like i've always thought that the plague had probably a lot to do with the copernican revolution like it took a while for the plague to to where the effects of the plague to kind of lead to a change of world but i i've always had that intuition that there was a relationship between the two i mean yeah i don't know it's it's speculation on my part but yeah well it's a good speculation though and and i think i think john has a similar argument actually about the plague too and and but it has something to do with it i mean it's it's such a that's a it's an archetypal motif for a reason right it's like that that somehow that somehow there's a certain we have to die to the possibility of being renewed into a new form of life and form of seeing and that i think something something and i've had my own personal version of that and it sounds like you've had your personal version of that too meanwhile the sort of the gathering that happens on an individual level is somehow participating in a gathering that is of a greater order of magnitude and that when those things become synchronous something very numinous and uncanny starts to happen right that like aporia begins to yield the possibility of light trading it from the outside but that's like that's a pain it's like we it's easy to talk about those things in romantic terms but like phenomenologically and existentially the experience is anything but romantic i think it yeah the labor pains to your point it feels remarkably painful it feels like you're being squeezed through something very tight and very dark yeah but it's also there is attendant to the experience and it and and it's not i don't think it's the whole thing i don't think the the game let's say the play isn't over like the the process isn't over i think that it scales and so in some ways that i think what we're seeing happening is still seeds it's still seeds it's still like because let's say the the old world is still playing out like the the madness of the old world is still playing out and a lot of even what we're let's say what we're doing is feeding on the residues of that old world like we're still we're still feeding off that stuff it's still we still need it in order to kind of even to get the message across like we're using yeah the techniques we're using are part of are part of the issue let's say so so i mean it's kind of interesting because we talk about you know the idea of embodied experience and community and and the idea of connecting you know is let's say john has his his practices and i'm saying people go to church but we're still doing this online we're still on youtube we're still on social media and so there it's it really is i think that's part of the feeling of the being ripped apart to a certain extent is that it's like we're on a bridge we're kind of moving from one world to the other we're not sure how to integrate the old world because in some ways you do have to integrate it and so we don't not sure how to integrate it into this new thing anyway so so yeah so i think that probably is part of why it feels so stretching yeah yeah it does and covid had something to do with amplifying and accelerating it i think because i got this sense and i think a lot of people did consciously or not that it was i think for many of us the first time of becoming aware that we're being lived out by to use an autumn quote by powers that we don't quite understand and that we don't we can't get a perspective on that we can't exactly get a perspective on what it is that's happening we're participating in something that has a presence within and as a presence without and we're being forced to reckon with ourselves in a really fundamental way because the ontology of the world is suddenly shifting from under us and that was i mean i it it makes so much sense to me when i think of that event as a properly symbolic event right that whatever the virulence whatever the whatever the the biological virulence was the symbolic virulence was ultimately the far more potent and powerful thing and what it shows is that these patterns that we take completely for granted have a trajectory that is not entirely known to us and that they're bearing us out to something that isn't quite clear but that our response to it and our way of integrating it has something to do with bearing ourselves out through it it's an incredibly complex thing yeah well i think that for sure for sure covet exposed things is maybe the at least that's the way that i see it it exposed patterns that were already there and so it kind of exposed the isolation and the loneliness and and it exposed also the reddit exposed the system in the sense that the the the system how strong the system is like how powerful the the political system is and how powerful the technological system is and that it made it made it made it possible for people to be isolated even more because i i kept all through covet i kept thinking like if coveted happened 200 years ago we we probably wouldn't have talked about it like people would have died and it would have been sad and we would have buried people and and there would have been like a sense in which there's something difficult happening but i mean it would have gripped the entire world and forced us into our homes for two years because that was only possible because the system was so strong and like you know it revealed the system to us like okay this is the world we actually live in you know so now know what that is and it also revealed this this kind of loneliness or capacity for autonomy you know that that that also is the loneliness like those two things go together like we can live without contact with others for a very long time and we'll be fine physically like we will we will live and we will we could even thrive economically some people thrive quite well during covet in terms of in terms of financially but but so it's like okay so if we're not deliberate about our communities if we're not deliberate about how we're together it's not going to happen on its own because the the situation let's say the needs of the ancient world the needs of the ancient world force people to be together there was no other way you had to be together because if you didn't you would just die but now we've we've set up a world where we don't but we have we need to so how how do we do it so it's like it has something about the the consciousness of the patterns even in terms of symbolism for example which i think comes with the problem of the the problem of a world that isn't integrated naturally and so the fact that the symbolic world isn't integrated naturally like it would in a you know in a tribe in the in the middle of the amazon where they don't have a choice they have to live under these trees they have to make fire they have to you know do these things that are so you know let's say symbolically rich and symbolically integrated that they they probably don't have to think about it it just it just happens naturally but now we live in in the in the technical world it's so strong that it's revealing the patterns to us because we've because we we suffer but we like okay we have to understand how this works and i think the same with community it's like okay so we have to be deliberate about community because we don't have to have community so now what do we do if we don't if not deliberate about it then we then we'll die you know morally like it will die spiritually maybe not physically but right so if i'm getting you right it's like our our whatever is inhibiting our capacity to participate in these patterns these patterns that are more perennial the fact that we're speak we've become so atomized and coveted in some sense exposed and maybe even accelerated that sense of atomization right of being forced back on our moorings independently into solitude and having to reckon with the pos with the anxiety i think it is anxiety of personal responsibility that being so sort of maximally disintegrated draws attention to the need for integration itself because it's like so there's a kind of distension going on and i want but that see that that's so interesting because it actually makes me wonder whether there's necessity in that as part of the pattern itself just as there may be necessity in the particular kind of suffering that a person has to undergo by being so divided against himself yeah so disintegrated that having to become many is requisite for having to be for for the movement into right the logos the gathering back into unity again so i wonder in the same way maybe on a different scale whether this sort of this this this fracturing yeah it is part of the pattern of that movement itself and that participating in that movement requires us to take seriously the responsibility that was forced on us as a consequence of that solitude and the anxiety that comes with it i know i mean i know that happened to me i know what happened i mean virtually to everyone i knew like on a very deep and personal level we were all forced to sort of live with the sum of decisions we made or failed to make right and and there's an incredible despair and guilt at least i felt it that came with that but then it was precisely by turning into that guilt turning into that despair that the possibility of gathering back up again became actually available and and i don't know exactly what to to do with that or how to generalize it but i have some sense that that existential scale of having to re-gather in the face of that distension has something to do with the pattern that's happening yeah chaotically maybe right now but on a greater scale so i i think i think you're you're really on to something you know there's a there's there are a few tropes let's say in in christian theology if you read some of the church fathers they they'll say something like you know when adam fell the human nature was splintered into many in many persons many individuals and that in some ways that was something that was inevitable with the fall but then ultimately was going to be transformed into a regathering that you mentioned and so you that might sound abstract to some people but if you think about the way saint paul talks about sin for example is super interesting you know when you sin let's say you you give in to some thing like you lie or whatever you give in to some passion or some desire that you know is kind of bringing you astray or ripping you apart there's something weird that happens every time is that you actually have an opportunity yes and then you you it's like a little moment of being awake actually sinning is a weird is a weird moment of waking up because you do something it's like you know you're talking and i will send you lie i know you brag about something and you say something is not true and you're like there if you if you're at least somewhat like still you know unless you're completely lost but if you're if you're still somewhat have a little bit of sense to yourself you'll have an eternal moment where you're like why did i say that like what why did i do that and that's and that's an opportunity and so the fall is always an opportunity to to kind of wake up again and i think that that's probably something in general to say if we make that bigger in terms of you know watching certain patterns in society can kind of you know fragment us and atomize us the way you said then that becomes an opportunity to to to do something to do something so it's like it's also it's almost like the the problem of consciousness in some ways it's almost like you know the right it's like the the self-consciousness of the fall leads to this breakdown but then that can be recuperated into a higher state yes where it's not innocence right anymore you're not innocent you're you actually have gone through and now you're reintegrating in a higher manner that's beautiful yeah well said well said well that i that i think that's in some ways that's kierkegaard talks about that and i think his entire concept of anxiety like the sort of this dizziness the vertigo of freedom of waking up into the consciousness of sin not as simply as a precondition but as an infinite possibility that extends out in front of you and so it's like you're perched on this precipice and you're swaying and this sort of dizzying sense the dizzying possibility of being able to sin again is something that can only be resolved by having to shift the orientation of your attention right from something egocentric to something that ultimately that grounds you out and that's an incredibly difficult move to make because then here's a question for you because one of the things i find really interesting is that they're sort of one of the ways in which i think the socratic platonic tradition interacts with the christian tradition in a very interesting way and in some sense needs help from it is that when we have that socratic insight of waking up and getting a moment of lucidity where we we catch ourselves in the act of the sin and we wake up from it and we we may wake up from it and have an insight in such a way that we can reform the relationship we have with whatever is dynamically attracting us in our attention but i think one of the difficulties is that that coming into consciousness that moment of waking up that socratic kind of light bulb there's an attendant guilt that immediately attaches itself to that right so you were saying before it's like when when i come into a new form of life a new way of seeing a new kind of relationship with reality it's such that whatever came before is now unthinkable to me right i can't imagine how such a thing could ever have been tenable but i think one of the problems is that then there is a second order sin which is that i'm now despairing over the fact of having sinned i'm not despairing over the fact of having been guilty yeah i know that somehow the brokenness of the world is a consequence of the way that i framed my relationship to it and there's something that's irrevocably lost as a consequence of my having failed to be myself by being in right relation with what's most real and then that second order despair that that sin that guilt over the sin itself becomes something tremendously inhibitive because then it's almost as though in a kind of weird sort of perverted platonic problem it's like the sin becomes the thing about reality that is most real and and that's like that's a real problem and i think that's one of the ways in which the sort of the socratic tradition kind of comes to a point and it can't go any further yeah because the socratic tradition can can induce the consciousness of sin it can wake you up it can reorient your attention by forcing an emporia on you but it doesn't necessarily have an answer to the largest of guilt that you inherit because of waking up and i think that's why like kierkegaard talks about you know christ as being both the pattern and also the redeemer and that somehow you need both because it's the redeemer that allows for the relief of the guilt such that you can actually refocus and fashion your attention again but that attendance like after covet i think that's part part of what happened a bunch of people woke up but they also found themselves with this debt of guilt of having broken themselves all that time that can't easily be erased anyway i i i i go on and on but i'm just i'm curious to know what you make of that problem and and because it strikes me as something that you've probably reckoned with yeah i know i think you're right and i think like you said the image of christ you know as both the shepherd the redeemer all this image but also the judge at the same time and i think that that you could understand the logos as having two hands right we we talk i talked about i talked about that when we were also in in thunder today right the idea of the of a hand which draws and a hand which pushes away and you know because the logos calls you right it's like it's the point of light that's attracting you it's the it's the reason why you're doing things it's that and then when you when you when you sin you feel the logos as a as a judge because then the distance between you and the logos now is appearing it's like it's like this thing is calling me forward and now i do something which is not in line with you know it's it's it's a it's missing the mark of where i'm going and so now it exposes the distance between me and the and the and the logos but i think that that's why you kind of need both of those it's in balance at the same time because if you you know you do need that wake up moment but then you also need to feel the call and i think that's also why that's why you know love it ends up being the main motor for the whole thing you know this this that that there's love love coming from the logo from above right there's love coming from heaven that that that is drawing you up and grace is maybe also uh the way the christian way to explain that you know it's like in some ways you are dependent on on the logos more than it's not the opposite it's like it's it's actually the source of your life and so it's it's the very fact that you can see it comes from it like it it draws you into it so it's so so that i think that first move right where it's not just it's not just that i see this you know i see god and now it's like okay well now roll my sleeves up and you know and now suffer because it's like i'm so i'm so far i have to go up the mountain i have to you know the kind of this kind of sisyphus idea where it's like all right now roll the hill and roll the ball up the the hill but but i think that if you i think when we understand the logos properly there's a there's actually something up on the top of that hill like it's there's something calling you there's something drawing you into it so it makes the weight light you know it's like that that's what christ says it's like my my yoke is is light you know it because it because it's because it's actually moving towards more reality and so you you kind of are called by it that's right that's right and then i think the question becomes what does it take for the individual to train his ear to condition the receptivity to that call and maybe that's where kind of the that that maybe that's the really properly speaking the existential role of the suffering which is that what it does is it because it it exhausts the inward resourcefulness of your ego it kind of leaves you with no choice right it makes you serious you're sort of so rent apart you're so riven that it sort of sensitizes you it disposes a kind of vulnerability that opens you to the possibility of being called forth by something outside of you and i mean right because there's this there's this idea right right through the tradition of that you have to somehow sensitize yourself to the possibility of god's love yeah and it sounds so easy but it really really isn't especially when your own guilt becomes the measure of everything that's real about you it becomes almost defiant and demaniacal in that sense like you the what you're we're ontological priorities actually favor the sin because it for like these deep platonic reasons it just well this seems to be more real than any possibility of goodness that could exceed it i can't imagine such a thing yeah i don't know in the in the platonic in the platonic systems if people have also developed the notion of of this fractal a fractal way of dealing with this which is in the in the bible or at least what christ's way presents it or you know when you see it in the our father which is you know forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sinned against us and so this idea of practicing grace or practicing compassion is also a way to kind of enter into that past if you can't you can't see the way in which grace can pull you up but then you can actually do that to others yes and when you do it to others you enter into the pattern and i think that it makes it probably possible for kind of grace to act on you because it's like i'm seeing you know it's like i i'm letting something go right someone did something against me i'm letting it go i'm exercising grace and so you know all of a sudden it becomes a possibility it becomes transitive it becomes transitive that's right that's beautiful right so that by participating on on in one aspect of the pattern right you you actually yeah it's it's like you it's like you invoke a belief in the capacity in in being able to take on the opposite aspect to the one that's actually acting out right and people people have to be careful they don't it's not like it's not like it's like a transaction right it's not like okay well i'm gonna i'm gonna do this for others so then i get from that it's rather just embodying something and by embodying it then you party you are necessarily participating it and it's by being related to it i think yeah there you go it's like you enter whatever side of the relation you happen to be on right if it's analogized as it right because it's the same ultimately a fractal of the same pattern you're ultimately relieving yourself in the pattern in such a way that you're assuming a role within it but that also means that the part in the pattern that you play plays host to the whole of the pattern which is what makes it by definition symbolic right when the presence is the whole and so it's it's almost as though because you're embodying somehow the whole of the pattern and the part that you play within it there's they're kind of inculcates a belief and not a belief in the prepositional sense but like a belief and an enacted a sensitization to that pattern that allows you to turn in in in the opposite direction and see it on a different scale and and there's and i think there's also like a there's also the reverse to that and no but i think it's not like i said it's not a system we have to be careful because we can always find counter examples of of this but i i have noticed for example that let's say let's say people who are capable of engaging in let's say in generosity and kind of and kind of giving themselves and a capacity to let's say also try to find the good in others you know in their first response ultimately end up often being also surrounded by that that is that it actually grows and they do end up attracting people that have that goodness and so keep often people end up living in a world that's more full of goodness and the opposite is true as well people who who who let's say act that say dishonestly towards the people around them at some point start to also attract that from the people that interact with them and so they end up in a world of mistrust you know both the way they act but also what they receive from the world and so there's actually like a so people can actually inhabit like you really can have a different worlds just by the way they act and the what they see as how would they prioritize and how they act not just in what they do but when what they receive i don't i can't explain it scientifically but it's definitely something i know but that i've noticed yeah i'm with you i'm with you i notice it too i think i think once you once you have eyes on it like once i mean that's like what we were talking about before once you begin once you begin to to pick up these patterns they're pretty hard to mistake and i think that's what i mean that's why people are so like that i think that's why in part people are so responsive to the work that you do is because once they take this kind of once they take the idea of these sort of mythic structures and they start to put them like a stencil to drop them down into their own ways of living it's amazing the way that they synchronize and and then what's so fascinating about that is that becoming conscious of the way that they're synchronizing invites a participation in them that is more credulous and more faithful because suddenly i don't need convincing of the fruitfulness of doing this it's just it's obvious right and it's obvious on a level that is embodied right it's very visceral and you've gone into it by virtue of having noticed it in such a way that i realize i'm already in a relationship to it for better or for worse or maybe for both at once no i i can see it in the sense that sometimes i imagine myself you know like as a as a peds let's say a russian peasant in the 19th century and and how let's say the patterns in which people were living were so naive they were true a lot of them were true and were real but they were very innocent and so in some ways they were in very much in danger and so when you know when the material is kind of secularist narrative comes in people get crushed you know and and i saw that even when i was young i would see people you know people with a kind of naive faith a very confident but naive naive faith and then you know the they would go to university and then they would just get crushed and they would they would go to their first philosophy class and they would just be completely demolished because they had never heard anything like this and never heard any of these arguments and never thought about any of these things and they would end their university you know in quebec we we had the thing called sejet which is like and they had philosophy classes in sejap and i think those philosophy classes were even just designed to like slash the catholicism out of all the quebecers that went through that in the 60s in the in the 70s when they were installed and it worked like it totally worked because people came in these naive little church growers and then were completely destroyed but what's interesting so now we go through this loop and now we come to let's say this this movement this kind of this more this symbolic understanding people kind of re-understanding the role of perception of attention and how it shapes our narratives how it shapes the way the reality manifests itself and once people have gone through that that let's say that training what are you gonna how are you gonna take that away from them like like how are you how are those site how are those philosophy professors going to take that away from them i don't think it's possible anymore like i i always say it's like i don't there's nothing you could tell me i don't i mean maybe i don't know i don't i feel like i've heard it all like i feel like there's what is it that you're going to tell me that you're gonna convince me no back into that old world i don't see it happening i don't see it happening either i think it's i mean it's a big statement to say it's impossible but it feels impossible it feels impossible because what you're re-introduced what we're talking about is the reintroduction of a kind of contact epistemology and by definition like in virtue of its very nature it can't be unwound by any kind of propositional response and man it's at that level that all of this these institutions and these sort of these these these sort of trenchant mentalities are operating right i mean that's one of the reasons why they're so viscerally unsatisfying after a period of time because it's like i mean that that's that dissatisfaction socratic dissatisfaction with the proposition is precisely what's what's what's divesting us from those institutions in the first place and so when we make contact with something that is real in virtue of the contact itself i don't think there's any amount of debate that can necessarily uproot it i don't know i mean it depends i guess it just it's a matter i mean i'm talking in yeah but you get i mean there'll be there'll be debates about the details there'll be debates about about the formulations there'll be all these debates will happen but the fundamental shift that that that that that that happens you can't you won't i don't think it'll be very difficult to debate that because that's it right that's it and when you because when you take it on especially when you take it on in the inward mythos of your psyche when you start to realize that your very way of thinking is actually populated with these patterns and you start to trace them out in the most personal of ways that can't but induce a kind of faithfulness an attention toward the relationship that is being organized by all of these things i think that's why like you know had that famous interview at the end of his life when someone said you know do you believe in god you sort of he goes like i know like i don't need to believe yeah you know what i mean like i i'm the way i my my contact with reality is such that these kinds of questions the way that they're framed are kind of irrelevant now not enough not in a not in a you know not in a sanctimonious way but just yes somehow somehow the way the relationship that i have with the world has exceeded the scope in which these kinds of questions are relevant anymore and i think there's a kind of anti i think certain people when they go to university i mean even at the very beginning of their careers when they're students there's almost something anticipatory about that that you know it's like i mean i found this i found i mean i started taking philosophy as an undergraduate and i just i i went into it thinking that i loved it and that it was going to be so deeply satisfying and within a couple of sessions i i was like i i had enough right because because it was it had nothing to do with the embodiment of wisdom it had nothing to do with personal orientation they had no existential import right and i think that because of that because of that i think it's capacity to to put sink its hooks into people i think is is pretty dulled you know pretty dulled maybe necessarily so and so how do you see that in your own on your own path let's say how are you integrating these changes in your own yeah that's a good question i think i think i'm at a point now like i struggled with that i've struggled with that for a long time because because i had this sort of i had this this sort of eros for philosophy that couldn't quite consummate itself within the scholarly context which is not not to say there's nothing there's that context isn't valuable on its own terms it definitely is i just found that i couldn't somehow the relationship you know it's sort of like when you you meet someone and you look them you i'd really like to but like we're going to be friends and then you and you try and it's just the friendship just doesn't it just doesn't happen it just doesn't bloom and you want it that's we're going to be friends but you can't force friendship right or any kind of relationship so the relationship just didn't catch the fire just didn't catch and so i was yeah i was left pretty i was left i was left dizzy and i was left wandering and i mean meeting john was i think pivotal for me in that i discovered that the thing that i thought philosophy was actually was there was a reality to it now i found a corresponding referent to it right someone who did that which i thought it always was and and you know that before and after effect that we were talking about before of coming into understanding things the organization of things in a different way happened to me as a consequence of that relationship and still does but how to translate that love and that point of contact into something more concrete that's still that question i think is still very difficult to be honest that's one of the things that i really i was going to say this like one i i i'm very i'm i'm quite inspired by the work that you do for that reason because i think that you have found a way a very ancient way of i mean i took semiotics right that was actually the program my prime main program of study was in semiotics and i got bored with that too because it was pretty much all french structuralism and post-structuralism and you know enough said and but it's interesting to me that what you're doing is you're sort of you're you're actually you're kind of a working semiotician in some sense right you're taking it upon yourself to kind of transliterate the structures that are implicit in things into their their symbolic language and to translate it into a language that makes it intelligible for people and you found a way to do that without needing to root it in the overtly academic enterprise or the overly scholarly enterprise and that for me is a that's a very significant thing like that's a very rare thing and i find that very elusive so anyway this is all to say it's it's i think it's an unfolding story i think i'm getting closer i think i'm getting it took a long it took a long time of it's been gestating for a while but i think i think in consonance with everything that we're talking about of this sort of this this this sense of synchronization that's happening that things are gathering together i feel that also on a personal scale that that makes the possibility they're obviously much more viable now than it has ever seemed before so i know are you are you are attached to academia are you are you involved i don't know what you're no you're not at all so you're not i thought you were involved in university of toronto with john like that you were somehow involved no okay no no i'm not i'm not no i mean i was always it was always it was sort of a foregone conclusion to me that i would take that route but i just i just didn't i sort of i finished my first degree and i was i didn't i didn't have a concrete sense of how i fit in to that world like there were sort of some logistical issues some administrative issues like i was so eclectic in my studies that i didn't really focus and specialize in such a way that made possible a particular course or a particular path i did a lot of wandering and and i mean one of the reasons that i took to john and why we took to each other is because i certain he found a home in that eclecticism and as a way of integrating it together that spoke to me and resonated with me but when you translate that into you know the bodies of universities and how to fit into that body and be part of that body and participate in it to use your your use of body that that was much more of a difficult question so i deferred i deferred the question i deferred it i deferred it and i deferred it and i deferred it and i just kept deferring it sort of like a a long-term extended deferral of the question of what to do about that yeah that's still an open question but but yeah i'm i'm starting to gather that together again i think the next couple of years are going to be are going to be pivotal but but i yeah but i needed a long period i think to figure out like there was some some kind of weird essentialism in my mind about taking that route because it's the only way it's because it's the only proper into which this kind of work in the world that in the way that the world is kind of configured right now i just sort of i just sort of had a narrative sort of yeah a narrative that that's where it would have to be and it took a while embarrassingly a long time really to kind of realize that that narrative was not as essential as i had always believed it to be yeah and so i mean that's one of the reasons i i i i appreciate your work and i appreciate other folks who have who have decided no i'm going to do this work i'm going to take this enterprise but i don't need any of that structure in order to make it real yeah i don't need to be like i don't need to be a scholar to be a philosopher i don't need to like this scaffolding is important and valuable but it's not it's not necessary in the sense that i think i always believed it was and it's hard to do away with a belief like that right because a belief like that is not just a propositional belief it's a premise of the world it's a premise of the way the world functions and so to get to dig down and uproot a belief like that the entire vision of the world needs to change first yeah right yeah it's it's funny because i think i'm not sure what year was i think it was 2014. 2014 maybe 2013 2014 i'm not sure exactly but i i was trying to kind of make it as an icon carver and and i i was contacted by the head of of the yale divinity school i guess and they wanted people to apply to their this fellowship they had which was like an art fellowship or something and i applied to the fellowship and i wrote my proposition of what it is that i wanted to do and then i didn't get in you know obviously but it was funny because when i think about that proposition now it's pretty much what i'm doing now it's like just everything that i'm doing now and and i understand why they didn't accept it because it was like i'm supposed to be an icon cover but then i'm talking about symbolism and i'm talking about like understanding iconography as like symbolic pattern for reality and like i'd like to talk about that and like to interpret stories and i'd like to continue my carving at the same time and and it's just hilarious that at least in my case it feels like somehow that formulation was like a weird seed that i was kind of planting somewhere you know throwing out into the world and then then it happened without the academy and probably better i think in my case it's because i'd have the freedom to to not follow the structures like it's it's pretty heavy i find like that what what academia asks of you to be able to say something is quite heavy in terms of what it what it requires you know the whole model of citation and the whole model of of also fitting it into these very very precise research projects that are becoming more and more precise you know as time goes on because it's like you have to kind of find your little niche and that's why it's astounding that that someone like john is able to even do what he does like that that he's able to find but i think he suffered also he's a rare bird i mean yeah and he has suffered for it for sure yeah he hasn't been able to find that what do they call it the the the the right the path in the university too to to to you know it took a long time for him to be able to find his place yeah so so but it is but it's also frightening to do it outside of the academy because you have that problem like i have that problem i find it funny i love it actually i kind of i kind of have a perverse pleasure when someone tries to introduce me it's always it's always because it's funny i have the same problem i have the same problem i want laboring under a particular occupational identity you you end up you're in this weird intercategorical space it's like what am i i don't know i'm i'm my i'm me but what is that i and i know i can i've noticed that and i've noticed your sort of ironic smirk every time someone introduces you in a way that's a fire you somehow became a monk in thunder bay oh yeah yeah or like i mean i love it even jordan always as i said he's a russian he's a russian french canadian russian orthodox icon carver and i'm just like that's hilarious you know you need to add a few more things to that to make it even more confusing it's obviously that's it's like the fact that people even say that i'm an icon cover now is just hilarious because it's obviously not true anymore i mean it's very but maybe people are detecting that like i mean if we think about it in proper symbolic terms icon carving is in some sense what you are doing in your video right you are rendering a moving image of a symbolic pattern such that people can face it face to face and apprehend it and so in some sense if we if we just oh yeah that's interesting right if we extend the reference i actually think that the title as presented is pretty apt it just requires a little bit of imagination but you know being a tapas in the way that you are i think is actually quite helpful because i think it allows you to straddle like it allows you a certain amount of mobility at a time when that kind of being able to migrate across these worlds and domains is part of the project of transliterating their respective grammars and the way that you're actually doing so it's like one like that's what i want that's what i find so interesting about what you're doing is that somehow the presentation of your title and the nature of the work are somehow there's a there's a continuity there of some kind that is i think important if i can be so no that's it i never it's funny that when you said it i never thought about that but but i'll i'll have to even take more joy in the in the icon cover designation from now on because yeah yeah yeah it's happening in many levels you know something like that yeah totally i i truly think so i truly think so and and maybe that's one of the things that i don't know how how conscious jordan peterson is when he when he sort of equivocates on your title but maybe there's some he has some sense of that too i don't know maybe that's funny i don't know i don't know and so what do you what do you or what are you working on now like what what are the things that are drawing your attention yeah so i mean i'm working on a few different projects with john i'm i've come on as another author his awakening from the meaning crisis lecture series is being turned into a book yeah so i'm on that project that's like taking a big chunk of my time right now is basically i'm i've come on as another author to basically just you know to work on that and to because it's not right they're very a lecture series in a book or just they're very very different beasts and they require a different they you know a different set of tools and so so that's what i'm working on right now we're also doing this dia logos project in many dirt there's going to be a monograph i think we're going to work on but there's also this course that we're we've pulled together with guy sangstock and it's it's still i would say we've done about four iterations of it now and it's going very well and it's still very tentative we're trying to be cautious about you know because this is i mean it's very old but it's also very new at the same time and so we're really just trying to play with different iterations of it formulating this method in different ways kind of trying it out it's a very i think it's kind of a playful process right now of just seeing like what happens what happens when we do this what happens when we gather a bunch of people together to undertake this practice instead of circling like it would be a class on circling it's circling the dna of circling is in it for sure but it's really is a kind of way of simulating and recreating the socratic dialogue i have to be careful when i use these terms which is yeah because socratic like there's there are so many codified versions of socratic dialogue now and they have their trademarks and whatnot okay really yeah yeah i mean when i think of it i just think of plato's dialogues i don't think in that codified sense but the idea is of taking a virtue putting it at the center of a dialectical process and there's a little bit of circling technique in there as well and basically taking that a dialectical structure and trying to build it on itself so that it actually turns into dia logos right so that the process of needing and molding and and co-creating a definition of virtue becomes a way of developing a relationship with that virtue right so the proposition of the virtue right the proposed definition is is kind of it has no it has no propositional value per se all it really is is a kind of is is is basically a log on the fire to kind of get to to get it going and anyway so so we're we're sort of playing around with this and and so far it's going very well so far so far it actually seems to be reliably producing i'm always very i'm always very careful about this because there's something about the spontaneous nature of dialogos when it happens this idea that there's a kind of animesis at work right that somehow the way that we're relating to each other is triangulating to a way of of communing with the patterns that are that and sort of that that gathering together of different aspects of something whether it be a person or a virtue is something that when done between two people with their attention fixed in the middle and fixed on the unfolding of that relationship has something to do with opening to the gathering of that pattern and allowing something to shake shape in recollection such that we seem to discover something and to create it at the same time and that's so really i think what dia logos is properly speaking is it's a way of generating a symbolic process of drawing forth logos and and tracing it out and following it and that's i mean speaking that way is tricky because it sounds awfully highfalutin but it's really just a way of using dialogue and the knowing of one another to to create a way of a way of knowing between ourselves a way of of of of conducting something yeah and if let's say realizing that the that the whole is more than the the parts just having that experience in with someone exactly exactly using the part whether but really the part of a virtue or one aspect of a person to host and presence the movement from the part to the whole right a bonocentric movement right a movement toward the good yeah and that movement has something to do with being able to take that one aspect or one part and use it as a host to as a relationship with whatever is behind it and beyond it and and and so you kind of move from the propositional domain into something far more visceral far more participatory and far more spontaneous than a kind of formal the formal structure of the dialectic is really just like i said it's sort of the logs on the fire you know it's a means to an end really so anyway so that that project is kind of ongoing and i don't know yet what that will become in some ways very much like any given dialogues it kind of it is gathering kind of of its own accord and and each time it seems to get a little tighter each time we refine it a little more and and its future is open i think we want to be cautious about it you know but at the same time there seems to be great promise in it so anyway so those are the sort of the things i'm doing with john and and i've got some some writing projects of my own that are always deferred but that at some point i need to get to so we'll see it's an exciting time though you know there's quite a lot happening it's hard to keep together at once which is a problem i'm sure you have too yeah i just i'm also i have a let's say because i also have this more artistic aspect i tend to have to just i'm trying to decide now what because i let's say i have the possibility of maybe writing a book that would be more like a presentation of the symbolic world you know just like a non-fiction book but then i also really want to write fairy tales and so i it's so the fairy tales are winning i'm sorry for anybody you know who who might have wanted me to do the other one fairy tales are definitely winning and i'm way more excited about writing fairy tales than i am about the other stuff so so that's been taking up that's actually kind of taking up my horizon right now which is i i have this intuition what what i called it apocalyptic storytelling it sounds a little weird but it's about there's something that hap it's about it's a little bit about taking the postmodernism that has just happened and let's say trying to reconsolidate it into something which offers a higher insight so one of the aspects of postmodern storytelling is something like collage it's like there's a collage aspect to postmodern storytelling and it finds itself you know a simple example that is like the marvel universe right so you have all these independent characters that that coexist and then people will paste them together to create more interesting attention and though their qualities will be brought we kind of smashed together to kind of to to create these these crossovers people call them right so so that's actually really a kind of of a post-modern type of of storytelling and then people started doing it in different ways you they did it with fairy tales quite a bit so you have things like shrek into the woods you had something called fables this whole comic book series where they took all these comments they took all these fairy tale characters and they would throw them to together into a story and a story that was usually quite dark and cynical and would kind of expose the underlying supposedly power structure than political patterns that the fairy tales are made of and it was it's actually quite a successful form of storytelling because it's it can be it can give you those inside moments even though they're rather dark insights they can give you insights about that so what i want to do is to turn that back to flip it back where like i'm going to actually take all these characters fairy tale characters also kind of smash them together but use one to reveal more insight about what the other is instead of but insight not in in terms of just political power and and raw that kind of raw stuff that's at the bottom but rather a more a higher insight about how reality works and so it's like you know can i use and and then can i use let's say can i use snow white to help you understand with the fall of adam and eve is without mentioning the fall of adam and eve like without saying anything about the bible but but just saying well it's like there's that apple there's that temptation there's that like what is it what is it is there a relationship between the two so i've been doing that with some i'm not writing the third one and and it's been so exciting for me because it's like the stories for example like i'm writing jack and the beanstalk right now and and it's like i've loved that story since i was a kid but there has been aspects about that that have been bothering me since i was a kid like why is he the main character jack is a thief basically he's a trickster and a thief like what is he doing and like why is he stealing these things from the giants and like what's going on in that story what the hell's going on and so i actually feel like i like i by by writing them i feel like i've gained massive insights into these stories and so i'm really excited to to to kind of bring people along into into these fairy tales and and kind of surprise them and hope they can have higher insights about what these stories are about thanks i'm real that's what excited me right now it's like if i if i could that's probably all i would do is just write these fairy tales oh what a great project well i love that it seems to be a project that's kind of saturated in in a kind of and there's like a winking irony that i'm hearing about it because you're sort of you're trying it's like a project of infiltrating yeah a cultural myth that has been fractured by a particular ideological infection and and working within the fragmentation to re-gather it and find the hidden harmony again yeah but also also it's like and not doing iteration it's not something about like an artistic restoration that i'm hearing that's also has a higher t loss to it so you can you think about it like if you think about like a lot of the fairy tales you know you can see it like people will say it's like oh those fairy tales like sleeping beauty you know it's about puberty it's about sex and it's about like menstruation it's about all these things and and then all the conservatives like no no no no no it's just an innocent story that's just about like a girl falling asleep and a prince and i'm like you know what yeah it is about that stuff and i'm gonna show you what it means like i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna dive in and i'm gonna tell you a story that an adult will read at an adult level and we'll see all the insights and a child will still be able to read at the child level and completely like it'll be fine for them like it won't it won't also scandalize them or or let's say ruin their childhood but it's like i can tell the story in a way that a grown-up will read it and go oh my goodness oh really okay and it's like because you see that in things like shrek where there's all these dirty jokes and tracks and lots yeah but it's like i'm gonna say like i'm not gonna do it just just to like make you feel like you're a grown-up with your little dirty humor it's like i want you to understand more about the deep aspects of of what these symbols are about so yes i'm super excited it's like it's probably the thing that excites me the most oh that is exciting well because it also gives you an opportunity that's like when when i kind of had this experience the the when we were doing the zombies in western culture when i was working with john and phil on zombies one other thing i things i found so interesting is that so many of the attributions the mythic undertones that people proposed as really the real and i know you you did a video on that topic too a little while back that so many of the explanations that are presented and proposed as accounting for that myth are true they're just not comprehensive yeah they're just not sufficient it's like well it's a critique of capitalism it's like well yeah but keep following the scent right it's like capital you know it's like yes consumerism is itself a symptom of something else that is the real object of the of the myth right so it's almost like a lot of these ideological interpretations of the moment they'll find an aspect or a dimension that is true and real it's just not sufficiently true and sufficiently real so being able to being able to kind of weave your way through some of those things that are proposed but to follow them a little bit deeper that what a worthwhile project that's kind of what i'm hearing a little bit and what and doing it in story form like i think that's what's exciting it's you know i i keep saying that it's like there could be let's say in terms of the zombie story like once you realize the zombie story like there could be ways to now tell a zombie story that would not be theoretical there would be no there would be no explanations in it but that would just dive back into it with the insight we have and tell a deeper more profound zombie story and maybe even propose a solution it's one of the problems with the zombie story is that there's never a solution no by definition by definition but maybe there could be an interesting like solution that would be taken from within the mythological frame and not not not something just dropped in but like within the very logic of the of the story that there there could be an insight that could be right right some component that signifies the restoration of the pattern whose conversion is actually being played out yeah i think so i think that that at least at least for me i think that's what's it's like it's also because i've been talking about this stuff for for now i guess five six years and it's like now i also have to do it like i you know it's like i i have to show that it's not just about interpreting stories we gotta write better stories but here's the thing okay so let me ask you this though because this is fascinating but the kind of the kind of the kind of skill it takes to interpret a story and the kind of skill it takes to write a story i think of as very different skills because when you're when you're undertaking an analysis a kind of careful structural analysis of a pattern of a story as you do so well you know you're it's there's a there's a it's a it's a very very conscious very meticulous very very kind of there's a lot of conscious attention being brought to bear on breaking apart its components in order to put them back together again there's a real analytical frame of mind that you have to be in in order to do that but when you're creating something artistically it seems to me like at least with in my own experience it seems to me that you have to yield in order to actually produce something of artistic merit you need to yield the process a certain amount of that process to the unconscious like if it's not spontaneous if it's too over determined by a conscious analytical process i think it will fail some of it has to be very there has to be an unconscious movement toward the creation of something and how so how do you like how does that work for you how does that tension work for you yeah it's i think at least for me it's it's just two different spaces right what is it that it it's completely mis applied but i think still i think it still works so the christ says that you know that the right that the left hand should not know what the right hand is doing right in some ways there's a sense in which you like i always tell people to it like when people are writing stories i i always tell them it's like don't think about symbolism when you're writing a story it'll kill it like you can't think about symbolic structures when you're writing there's you should never do that no no because then you'll fail them right you totally fail like you'll fail in every way like you'll just you'll overthink it you'll try to fit things in that don't fit in the in the thrust of the narrative there's all these things you'll end up doing i think with the way to do it is it it has to be you have to ruminate like you ruminate on on the patterns right and you just kind of let them sit like almost like almost like you know they're fermenting in your in yourself and then that becomes the the wine out of which the story can be told but it's not now it's not a it's not a system it's not a structure it's none of that it's just just it's intuition and then what you can do the way that i do it at least myself is that like the intuition comes for the story then then it then it's like oh yeah that story those elements and then once you've put them down then you can come back with the symbolic mind and then you the symbolic mind is like an editor then you come back and you're like oh you don't first you have to be careful with that editor but you can shift a few things like you can change a few words and say oh if i tweak this word then it's actually kind of more in the direction of what i want but the the actual elements of the story come from a more immediate you know more more immediate thing right right so it's almost like you i mean you have so you have all of this rumination that has taken place because of all of the deep ways in which you've been contemplating all of this over the course of time but then in some sense there's a kind of divine forgetfulness that you have to have it's like i think i think of the way that really good performers like really good actors or musicians kind of describe their process which is that they state they are as studious as they can possibly be for as long as they can possibly be and when then when the time comes to perform they do their very best to throw everything out yeah right and forget they they they find it in them to forget everything it is that they know in order for something a deeper form of recollection to take place right it's a kind of a paradox right you need to have a kind of forgetfulness in order for the animesis to actually happen and that's what i'm kind of hearing from you it's like you you've done all of this work but then in some sense you have to take it i'm thinking of your i'm thinking of your left and right hands again right that that that the that the logos that the that the the logos of judgment that takes has to yield itself to the eros of generosity that gives and that there has to be something a coordinated withdrawal in order for something to actually be brought forth yeah and i think i think you've you've got it right and but i do think it is strange like it you're right that usually it's rare that you find usually you have critics and you have artists right you don't have both at the same time you know and so it's a strange thing i don't know like i don't totally understand it it's possible maybe that also my art suffers let's say that this we'll see we'll see when people will judge them like the story that i write might suffer for my for my over thinking but you know at least for now i'm really excited about them like i'm excited about writing them so i think if it's happening i think if it feels like it's happening with a certain amount of spontaneous energy then i that to me is a sure sign that it's that's somehow the that that has the right bearing right because you kind of know the difference right when you're caught in a flow and something is writing itself through you right when you have the sensation that you're simply the vehicle for something to produce itself i think that's a testament to something that's a more genuine artistic process but when you're trying to have this sort of overweening consciousness that's trying to master yeah it just doesn't matter so i think a way to explain it at least is that let's say it's like if i'm meditating on writing a story or making an image the the inside will present itself in this in story form right it'll present itself as elements of the story it won't present itself as a structure that i'm trying to impose on the story so it's the same with an image like i'm trying to figure out an image then the the inside will present itself as an element in the image and so i think that also helps like just that like to just remain within the the world i think that helps so to not to not be in to not be in danger of trying to just impose this symbolic structure almost arbitrarily over over a story and you see it like there you see hollywood movies where you know they take the hero's journey or whatever and they apply it so formulately that it's just it's actually becomes unbearable to watch it's so broad it's so it looks it lacks the very specificity that is able to presence a symbolic pattern right because it's only with absolute specificity that that can actually happen yeah and there's there's a kind of there's also a kind of messiness you know because let's say the hero's journey it never exists purely it doesn't exist it's like you can you look at these very complex and and stories that have all these twists and turns and and strangeness to them and then you're like oh you look you look at 10 you know you look at 50 of them and you're like oh well here's this sorry here's this like basic pattern like it's it's real it's true it's there but you know it that's not the story like the story has a greediness to it and has a you know in the body into it so you can't you can't just now say well i'm gonna apply this pattern back onto the world completely and it just that's what that yields really no no it has to it has to come it has to come from within the specific conditions right it's like it's bottom up it's not yeah right it has to it has to emerge as a consequence of your interaction with the fundamental conditions that are present it's the the necessity it's that you need the finite necessary end of the dichotomy the infant it end the the possible end that'll take care of itself it's the attention to the necessary details that create the finite enclosure of circumstance that actually allow for that to be accessed right which is part of the beauty of that paradox i think i just finished one of my favorite pieces of of of television i just finished it's called better call saul and i think it's a it's an absolutely it's not it's like a neat it's like an existential neoplatonic treatise when it's all said and done it's just like incredible mind-boggling piece of symbolic finesse the likes of which i've never seen before and you would think and i and i started to listen to all of these sort of background details about the creative process because i thought like who are these people that produce this like the amount of meticulousness they must have and they do from a craftsmanship perspective but when describing it's like they seem to somehow follow the logos such that every turn that the characters take is absolutely surprising but absolutely necessary and clear otherwise it brings me back to this necessary co-identity between creation and discovery inventio right is a word yeah john likes to use that captures both at once right the poesis is such that it reveals what already was and in so doing makes it real and the process the artistic process which is a dialogical process because it's in a writer's room which is fascinating right so it's a dialogical process using a kind of a dialectic to catch a pattern between a group of people and then in that group of people it's almost like a weird seance it's like they catch the pattern of the character from within the conditions that they've contrived and yet there is this sort of top-down pattern that is coming to meet it in the middle and so i listen to an account of of the creator of the show describing the process and someone's asking them like my god did you guys have this all plotted out meticulously and he laughed he said no it's like we were like in the dark with a lantern and we saw two feet in front of us and every step we took we went oh god look at that right it was like they were they weren't contriving anything somehow they found it in them to discover what was necessary about the next phase of the story simply by tumbling over the perspective of the character right i thought that was incredibly that was just a a really beautiful to me a beautiful testament to exactly this process that you're describing right and there's probably like the level to which this comes is probably to where this can go is probably very very high because when you think like when i for example like when i read the the comedia when i read the dante i have the same i have that problem i'm like there's no way this guy could plan this whole thing out in advance this is not possible like did you have massive charts like that would take up entire walls with like connecting all these verses together and and making this like giant spider web that you know is is is matt it's like i i can't imagine that that's what it was and maybe i who knows if he had such a mind but i think it probably more has more to do with that capacity to attend and to and to just be sensitive to to reality and so like you said it just kind of came together in almost like a mystical way yeah you know so i mean i might be wrong i might be but but it's like when you read the when you read some think about you like is how can how can anybody write that it doesn't seem possible i think well and i think the thing i mean i i agree with you i think it's as plausible a way of thinking about it as any other and i'm inclined to agree i'm inclined to think no it he probably sat down maybe i mean i you know when it came to refining the work making it probably more of that top down but i mean i've had the experience myself not in comparison to dante but i've had that experience myself of sitting down and writing something and finding that it was flowing out and then you know after a couple hours go by it's like i look at it and i reread it and this structure comes out i go that like i didn't intend that that just happened right or someone else will pick up on it and i had no knowledge of it whatsoever and to me i mean it's like if i can experience that on this very very modest scale i have no trouble believing that someone with the artistic genius of dante could sit down and write in such a way as to recede his own territory to seed his consciousness to that muse to the to the force of poesis that was working its way through him and to let it right because the the structure is already like i mean it's a priority right the unconscious structures are there i mean i take that kind of union perspective on it right it's like the the the structure's already there it's just about developing the axis with it in order to actually seed territory to it when it's most needful to do so and i think that's the difficult part is getting out of your own way as it were right yeah and then you you can understand why like you know because you mentioned the muses you can understand why it was formulated that way yeah yeah why in some ways it was you know it was almost like an invoking right it's like i'm invoking this because i it's actually i know that it doesn't totally come from my will it's like it can't it has to somehow you know land in me like somehow and then and then then obviously you're part of it like you're part of the creation of it but you need that vertical relationship you know yeah oh yeah and your participation in it i think has much more to do with allowing it to be to let the letting it be the surrendering right there's a kind of self-sacrifice i think that is implicit and necessary in that kind of exercise and then that participates in the greater pattern of self-sacrifice that's required in order to refocus right the that that shift from being much more egocentric to putting yourself in service to a pattern who's unfolding you can participate in but not be singularly responsible for then becomes the purpose right so that little min in miniature that little artistic humiliation of the ego the giving up yourself so that whatever it needs to come out can can i think help to maybe inseminate the faith or the idea that on a greater scale on a more existential level that that's something that's required of us in other ways and the artistic project i think is a wonderful a wonderful symbolic container for that yielding up of you know what comes before us but what ultimately comes through us as well right yeah the midwifery of it oh yeah exactly that's a good that's a good way to midwifery is a good way to think of it yeah listen christopher i think i think it's probably a good place to to to end i agree it's been a great conversation oh thank you jonathan this was a joy this was a joy i was looking forward to it and it did not disappoint and i'd love to do it again yeah definitely we'll have to find a way when i'm in toronto to to meet in person as well again yeah absolutely or or or vice versa oh that's true you said you come to montreal yeah tell me when you're wrong i do so yeah okay so we'll keep in touch and we'll we'll make it happen all right thanks for the conversation thank you jonathan all right you take care all right
