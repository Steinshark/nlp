so this is the emf network operations center this is where we've been building and staging and then deploying the network from all week this is where the switches get configured everything tested sent out with the wi-fi access points decked base stations the gsm team come along later and add their gsm base stations as well this all then goes out to the dart and cloud the dks we call them on site so let's start where people come where they get the internet so we have blanket wired and wireless coverage most people prefer wireless because they don't have to run a cable but it is there there's dart and cloud within 40 meters of pretty much every tent unless you've camped in a very strange area these darts it's it's german for data toilets and we use them because they're basically portable toilets portable loose and inside each is a switch deck base station we used to keep the access points inside but now we have them mounted on poles we find them super convenient because they're basically a waterproof box and there is the potential for things to get wet on a campsite so if we take a wonder up here maybe and take a look inside this one so we put padlocks on the outside just in case but once you get inside it's pretty hard to confuse them for a working toilet there we are an access switch for those who wish to connect by wired ethernet it then also connects to our access point deck base station gsm base station on the roof we also have a light so it's a sequence of individually addressable leds that change color depending on art net broadcast messages so apart from looking cool they're actually a really useful way to see if the network at a glance in that dart and cloud is running or not so one can look across the field and see ah the power may be out there the switch may have a problem and head over and sort it out so from here is a complex distribution network of fiber complex physically not so complex logically each switch in each of these dart enclosed directly connected to our core switch but that's a lot of fiber to run so what we actually do is we run a fiber from each one to a kind of hub darting quote and we use lc couplers just to patch the fiber onto another fiber with more cores and i've picked the wrong one i know i haven't so this looks like an underground splice closure because it actually is an underground splice closure this runs underground three ducts all the way back to our lock dc our data center on site these pop out at a couple of locations on site and we just patch on with couplers to provide a connection to the switch or to the to a switch in a nearby dk if we walk down here i can show you where they all connect logically back to the nog dc so we had two plans for this event one was our normal plan which is to run fiber along the ground and along the festoon lighting which runs through the site that was our plan b our plan a which we really wanted to do because we like to do something a bit challenging and a bit different every year was to run fibre through the ducts on the site and i'm very glad we pulled that off because it's so much neater and so much easier to get where you need to go a challenge on any field is to cool and protect the servers and the switches that we use to build the network with are not dc unlocked data center this is this is the solution we've come up with in 2012 it was a large scouting tent with a literally a 19-inch rack down one end but it kept getting covered with bits of field grass and the like 2014 we had a reefer a refrigerated shipping container which was massive and really cold the problem was it was too cold you couldn't set the set point high enough and it condensed so much liquid it was water blowing all over the servers tarps covering everything not really good so 2016 we decided we'd just rent the same kind of refrigeration unit that the bar used to keep the beer cold which worked out really well the the built-in chiller that comes with it wasn't quite enough because it's designed to keep food cold rather than remove two and a half kilowatts worth of heat so we do actually run our own air conditioning inside so if i can talk you through what we have in here we have our core switch which is this arista here these fibers coming in here are coupled literally onto the underground fibre that we've run through the site so that's our core switch core router this is access for the devices in the data center and on the roof of the data center these are our wireless lan controllers redundant pair of those ups is very heavy ups's automatic transfer switch and some servers that run as a virtual machine cluster that provide all the services that we provide on site so dns dhcp network monitoring that we use configuration management ticketing that kind of thing is all this clothing or is this people how does this work so the container and the air conditioner are rented in but pretty much everything else here is on loan from either a vendor or an organization called event infra which some of our teams set up in the netherlands to kind of hold donated equipment from vendors and store it insure it ship it out to each of these events so it's really convenient to know long in advance that we don't have to start flagging through equipment from the vendors so there's pretty much no flat surface on this site including right here which is why we put a sign saying non-slip map between every device and it's why we have this little bodge here to make sure that the air conditioner doesn't topple over and crush all the servers and fibers and switches we have two ups's redundant pair and we have an automatic transfer switch for any servers that can only take one power supply but as far as i'm aware we haven't actually lost power at all in this area these are our underground fibres one goes off down the site and into those underground closures that are currently in darden clay the other one goes well over a kilometer through other ducts all the way to a green cabinet that we've installed right by the street and that's where our circuit actually terminates we tried to make it as easy and as pain-free as possible for them to bring the circuit in and it worked out really well in the end this will stay here and if we return in 2020 we hope to use it again we hope it will be in good condition we've we've done all we can to protect it i'm taking you a very long way all the way back to the main entrance of the entire deer park right by the main road a rap about a raspberry pi that couldn't have been better i came on the thursday to install the camera up on the hill to do a time-lapse video of the build and then we started receiving deliveries friday morning just before 7am a week later it's unrecognizable we're using single mode fiber which can go 10 kilometers and this is about 1.2 it's a bit shorter as the crow flies but we have ducting that we have to follow through this may look like a darting glow it may look like a portable toilet but is also neither this is actually part of our emergency response plan the mobile signal on site is so bad if the internet connection goes down and we can't get a call out to 999 someone could be sent down to this gate that has a hard line phone inside i'm very proud of this this area all the way up to the toilet up there or the not toilet up there we dug this up in the freezing cold in january installed ducts installed power underground we installed other ducts out to the road literally to the property line here leaving ducts and ropes for the provider to come and pull their fiber through later we installed a concrete plinth and then the following weekend we installed this a proper street cabinet so what we have in here is some power that is permanently on so not fed from our generators kindly provided by easton castle we have fiber coming in from our provider which is then patched into their network terminating device so this is what they use to monitor and manage the circuit in case there's a problem this is the little device we were using for testing this is how we were able to see a month ago that the circuit was done and then we could get a full gigabit it was so reassuring to know that this was going to be ready when we finally got on site but what actually happens now is this fiber the access port fiber goes into this coupler and directly onto the same fiber we just saw up at the knot dc and we also have a ups down here just in case something happens with the power supply it gives us a bit of warning because we actually have that still connected via a different fiber so we know that if that goes down but this still has power then we've lost power and it's just running on the ups so we've got about 10 minutes to get down here with the generator to make sure the uplink stays 2012 we ran wireless point to point 2013 em wave we ran wireless point to point shorter distance in docklands but still point to point 2014 another wireless point to point 2016 we were so lucky to find the internet provider of the nearby business park and make friends with them and they were so helpful but this is ours we built this this will stay here and hopefully we'll be back in 2020 to use it again i think from a network standpoint there are a lot more ducts on site and a lot more manholes that we've only discovered while we've been doing this buildup so there's a lot more options to put more fiber in to make it easier to set up next time and in the future so be great to get some in there [music] once you get inside it's pretty hard to confuse them for a working toilet to get from this year's badge
