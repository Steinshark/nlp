tommy hilfiger was everywhere in the 90s on snoop dogg britney spears and many more not that i cared this may surprise you but i've never really been into fashion now though they're getting into myspace gaming oh and you guys know i love looking at some oh well this is different we have seen some crap from major brands before i mean normally it's fine just a little too expensive but this steaming pile of sweatshop garbage isn't just bad our labs team tested it out and the marketing for this is filled with actual lies and deceit so egregious that it may actually be illegal this is my first time touching it though i don't even know how much this pile of trash cost me you want to guess 100 bucks 150. 150 is that real dollars yes us just like we charged our sponsor thanks to freshbooks for sponsoring today's video freshbooks is an accounting software that is simple and intuitive because time is money save up to 11 hours a week and take control of your business with freshbooks keep listening to find out how you can save 90 on your first four months this isn't the first time that tommy hilfiger has gotten into selling tech they actually currently sell bluetooth speakers and headphones as well as a battery bank but this is their first foray into the gaming space what's different this time is the level of effort we don't have tommy's previous headphones here to comment on their sound quality but it's easy to tell from the photos that they achieve at least the bare minimum they look like they were made by a tommy hilfiger the gaming set well oh man it uses an which one is this the iso layout enter key that's the worst one conveniently positioned for your sixth finger that happens to be a little bit longer than your pinky they can't even manage to make it look anything other than cheap and horrible the really wild part is you've seen what these guys do in their fashion photography and yet no amount of photoshop could make this look like anything but garbage oh my god what are these specs 95 acrylonitrile butadine styrene how is that the very top of your key talking points it's also just abs plastic it's used in literally everything i didn't even think about what abs even stood for why would you why would you type that the mouse is 90 abs and 10 metal i better not find anything other than abs or metal in that mouse what metal headset 10 sponge is this the very top of the product page okay i'm sorry keyboard features easy clean waterproof and dust proof you don't say it says waterproof it does care spot clean will do thomas oh my god alex look this isn't just your regular old keyboard mouse headset this is imported yes they've got a lot more specs actually on the box than they do on the website the gaming headset supposedly offers immersive surround sound it is ps vita compatible why would you mention the ps vita and the nintendo 3ds wait is this thing new this came out in december and yet every mention of a supported console is at least five years old okay i'm sorry i'm actually gonna start looking at this stuff now i found the metal in the mouse metal is this a removable weight system needs actual screws you're getting ahead of yourself there is a removable weight but not that that's not the removable weight you're not supposed to be taking it apart this early wait i'm not allowed to take it apart yet just experience it okay i'll take it apart later it's really heavy for a modern gaming mouse it does have really mushy back and forward buttons the back button has a significantly longer travel hmm wait is this from us i doubt it oh yeah no it doesn't look like there's any screws under there so i don't think that's actually from us and only the finest large connector wire i mean who needs to plug anything into the next usb port over right that's why you have dedicated usb ports on the front of your computer for your mouse i mean it works hey that looks pretty cool backlight for recurrent colors does it just cycle between four colors is there a way to change it no this is actually like a decent rgb controller in here well that's one thing that's good about it can you change the rgb things oh oh no i didn't see a software download is there any way to actually control the rgb that's a feature linus no driver needed no driver needed at all nothing does it have any indication of what dpi you're running at perhaps do these change dpi think they do why are you hitting it a bunch of times because i want to be able to tell but the range is only from 1200 to 3200 so that's not nearly as wide as you might expect on a modern gaming mouse i i'm pretty sure that the dpi adjust buttons are in fact here and here but i guess there's no way to reprogram any of these you better be happy with back forward dpi up and down and left and right click the rgb effect does look really cool though give credit where it's due i mean that's all that matters to gamers right i guess in order to go to the website i'm going to need this keyboard i don't think this weighs much more than the mouse does oh wow i don't recall the last time i saw a keyboard that felt this generic and cheap honestly though you've been able to get like much better keyboards for 30 bucks 20 bucks on amazon for years are these is this a placeholder for where the numblock caps lock and scroll lock lights are supposed to go they didn't even finish putting the legend on it this is the most oem we changed almost nothing thing i think i've ever seen tommy clearly had nothing to do with this whatsoever and that's not a compliment that's an indicator that is just completely checked out of whatever products bear his name good quality silk screen here but unfortunately my x-key is a reflection of my current mood having spent 150 bucks for this permanently depressed can i get a rim shot editor please for that hello is that gonna is that gonna bad boy gonna pop back up hey there we go we got it nice has a dedicated lighting key though i have high hopes for the rgb the effort level is so low not only could they not do their own mold for the usb port housing they couldn't even use the same one on both products so like what you couldn't find a cheap chinese peripheral oem to make both of them you had to find two different ones and then package them together clearly quality wasn't the main concern alex so why not if you want to know they are both from instant microelectronics they're both from instant micro yeah from the same factory so they couldn't even order enough to have them change the housing to be the same try so hard do you know how hard we work to differentiate ltt store products to make them truly awesome if all i have to do is just slap my name on garbage and i can become a billionaire and like why don't i do it how much does he worth anyway oh no oh it's the kind of rgb lighting with static red green and blue leds they don't actually change i was pleasantly surprised by the excellent color mixing on the multiple leds inside the mouse this not so much this appears to be a light diffuser pattern in the mold so that these lights won't be too bright they just didn't put the legend over top of it bigger gaming gaming oh i hate this keyboard now i want to make this abundantly clear i am not shaming anyone who can't afford a better keyboard but if you had the money and you bought this anyway you're an npc yes i mean i'm sorry i'm sorry it's this is facts a rainbow backlight keyboard i mean technically yes a mouse with seven button design i mean yes and a comfortable headset with omnidirectional speaker sound what the  does that even mean that sounds like whoever did the merchandising for this page heard a word once in an audio context and kind of went oh that sounds cool i promise you that these are regular old drivers like any other driver and they fire in one direction because they've got that one thing they definitely don't know they're beautiful no acknowledgment nothing sorry i was looking up what omnidirectional means so that means that the speaker is not beaming which given the performance of the highs they might actually be correct when i hear omnidirectional speaker what i expect is a speaker array that has balanced output in all directions that's what i would imagine omnidirectional speaker means does it say on this at all what the driver sizes oh maybe but it does say that the headphones are 7.3 inches in length when you have to start resorting to the length width and height of your headphones to fill out a spec sheet that contains your headphones your mouse and your keyboard you know that you are scraping the absolute bottom of the barrel but you can look cool doing it oh my god you're right brandon how cool am i right now i only wear the finest brands oh these may be the cheapest drivers that i have ever put on my head listen to this brandon hold on i have to put this onto the mic so that i can show you what i'm hearing right now time that is the difference in air pressure from kind of pushing the drivers onto your head kind of you know mushing the pads a little bit causing the the driver inside the the membrane to just collapse and then pop back out let's get our three our three amigos here which one's curly which one's larry and which one's mo let us know in the comments i've just been doing some math on the whole omnidirectional thing because it bothered me oh somewhere around 11 000 hertz if their driver's side is correct it will start beaming and not be omnidirectional oh so basically they're just admitting the performance so so i'm gaming boys wait i need to plug in the usb port the three and a half millimeter decks is that usb port only the lights it's only for the lights i don't should i be mean to the people who have bought it no it was probably their nan at like hudson's bakery or something yeah yeah that's true okay i don't want you to feel bad if you have these so take all of the crapping on them that i'm about to do as educational i'm not bullying it's education trying to teach you something look at this this has the little holes as though the mic is here is the mic here or is the mic here and they couldn't have the same color braided cables again they're all different what a cynical cash grab this whole thing is i can't even type on this thing oh my god i can't type on this thing i thought it was me but then it did it again it inserted an o yeah it's got it it's got the o in there again no no get my hands get my hands this time we've got screen cap we've got screen cap okay here we go okay didn't do it oh my god i can't i'm now i'm overthinking it no it is not inserting ghost characters it's just really hard to type on that sound though what oh my god look at this who knows what's up why is that when people are googling these are already super warm on my ears because they're just using the cheapest possible pu fake leather and they're already uncomfortable though to their credit they at least did put foam padding on the top which a lot of even reasonably high-end headset manufacturers don't do for whatever reason you gotta give credit to crab rave here you have to be a truly great catchy song to sound good on these the mids are basically non-existent blended in with the base which somehow manages to both overpower everything and yet be inadequate and as for the highs i think they're in there somewhere i don't know about you guys but i'm having a great time sounds like they are so bad i swear to you everything sounds the same gunshot fireball firing fireball hitting it just all sounds the same the mouse is definitely the least crap part of it but that's not much of a bar you know i'm on the record saying that if given the choice i'll take a good mouse and a crap keyboard versus the other way around but this experience taught me that there really is still a minimum bar that you have to reach and this doesn't reach it i'm also on the record recently saying there's no such thing as a bad product only a bad price but i think tommy has proven me wrong you can have both a bad price and a bad product the mouse is only okay in a vacuum and like any product the tommy hilfiger gaming set does not exist in a vacuum this is what we were able to put together for the same total price a keyboard mouse headset combo from brands you've heard of yes we did get some of these items on sale but not mega black friday sale or anything like that like you could easily reproduce our results here let's compare shall we you know what hold on a second first i saw alex walk in with something intriguing this is a keyboard that was included with some lenovo pre-built i would imagine the bill of materials cost for this to be under ten dollars you can normally add those for like five dollars in the config i would like to know how it compares oh do i have to put these back on okay i would take this any day of the week this is what it would take to convince me that this is a gaming keyboard nice low profile keys nice short travel consistent feel from one to the next this is spectacularly awful now let's compare it to something price equivalent first up we've got the logitech g305 featuring their hero sensor and lightspeed wireless dongle that's right my friends lower than wired latency and the convenience of just popping in a new double a battery anytime the absolutely incredible battery life runs out on you it has one fewer button but it uses that one button much better you can reprogram it and it just cycles through the dpis instead of going up or down so it has functionally exactly the same function i can already tell not even going to be close low profile chassis four on-board cam powered reprogrammable switches standard bottom row design with mx compatible hot swappable sockets gatteron red linear key switches and yeah there's a little bit of flex okay this isn't a top of the line keyboard but my goodness is that ever a lot better detachable cable includes a key switch puller and look at that oh is this magnetic if it's magnetic i'm going to be really impressed really nice magnetic wrist rest where's my wrist rest tommy lots of different creature comforts here we've got two different heights for the back feet nice sounding little volume wheel usbc detachable cable real rgb the thing about rgb you don't have to be into rgb that's fine you can just set it to white and forget about it not on the tommy hilfiger it's rgb or it's nothing it's you grope around in the dark and find your keys oh sorry mom didn't mean to send that to you and finally we've got the steel series arctis nova i haven't touched a steel series headset just about forever it can go usbc to c usbc to three and a half mil or usb c to extension to a pop out boom mic love to see it not always hanging around in your face got mute button on ear cup volume control and a lighting button the lighting can turn off no padding on the top we'll see how this elastic fares i mean the bar they had to reach was so low though that is some nice looking foam there steel series oh those ear cups all right here i got to get you the comparison shot brandon playing okay then we got this one one thing that's probably important to mention here too it was like your ears are not parallel and that one you can move the cups like this oh yeah this has like no adjustment whatsoever whereas like oh yeah that's not good oh look at that we've actually got high end frequency response like i might be able to hear where footsteps are coming from what a concept i have never appreciated a proper gaming keyboard this much to be clear this is not the world's best gaming keyboard or anything like that but boy is it ever better oh we're in like a puzzle part that's fine you've probably done enough also better noise isolation in summary our comparison set is not even close gear won't make you a better gamer but at least it shouldn't actively inhibit you from being a better gamer do i get to take them apart now not yet we have a couple of tests to do okay the first it says the chord is 1.5 meters on the box for the mouse i mean the length didn't bother me but did they really try to cheap out on that little bit of copper oh that's not a meter and a half i don't need a tape measure to tell you that uh maybe if we go right from the very end of the plug just to be as charitable as possible here that is 140 centimeters they're 10 centimeters short that's what i always tell my mom hey do you want to have a look at this little data sheet here oh wow you found a data sheet for the mouse is that because on the manufacturer's website they just have this oem mouse no we took it apart and found the sensor and got it from there oh excellent but just note this is what it says the dpi is here 1200 to 3200 yeah oh 800 1200 1600 and 2 000. well that explains the very narrow range that i picked up on i was like is this changing or is this not changing that's a completely different numbers do you know what the best part is what we measured it those numbers are also wrong it's 600 900 1200 and 1500. did you read this no they describe a breathing light mode as four color circulatory discolored respiratory function that sounds like a disease not a feature what's that it's a slide test oh all right slide test time where did you download this from the backlight is supposed to wait backlight breathing the back is this plugged in it's supposed to indicate what the cpi is said to nope guess that was overridden so we're gonna do a slide test it even gets the extra benefit of it oh see you later oh well here hold on hold on no no let's give it every possible advantage okay i'll hold this up like that yeah i mean we want to be we want to be charitable yeah oak you stay you stay complete oh oh yeah that's a lot of drag and this is the one i even said wasn't that bad okay watch this watch this holy crap it completely loses tracking if you try to do a flick shot laughs so that means that you're going faster than this sensor can figure out we'll we'll show you what happens on this wow we spun you can actually control that it's just working do you want to know the absolute best thing about this mouse the rgb now so yeah the input latency of a click on this mouse is on average five milliseconds at most 6.1 what do you think it is for that oh i don't know obviously it's going to be worse i'll say 10 milliseconds hold on let me give me a sec here 20 is it 30 on average 45 at the most really yeah i'd be i'd be able to detect it on a display you give me something with like 30 additional milliseconds of latency but i i can't see it here that's really bad that's two entire frames of additional latency from your input i want to take apart from this i want to take things apart i want to know what's going on with this weight plate in the bottom you could like unplug it first no it's fine what's the worst that can happen the plate appears to be entirely cosmetic and a little rusty oh no oh remember i was saying it was heavy they did it on purpose they're actually they pull the 90s power supply trick here they just put a big hunk of metal in the back of the mouse what the heck are they doing bud it's way lighter how much does this thing weigh did we measure it' grams' grams are you guys out of your minds and look at this pcb is this a modern gaming mouse or is this a freaking science fair project from 1985 oh my god is this hand built holy sh i think it is they're not surface mounting devices these resistors are through-hole mounted this is like literally like like like you could build well there's another lie it says instant right on the controller chip there no no no no that's why the side buttons feel so mushy there's no 90 degree mounted pcb they're not pressing directly on anything they just slide into place above these switches that are actually pressed this way press the button like that okay yeah and it goes like that and then it just like slides onto it wow neat well do you want the final bit of testing that we did for that mouse sure there's two things that you want to test for a mouse precision and accuracy accuracy is kind of like 800 dpi you want to get like 800 dots in an end g305 is fine for that it's like 2.4 off which is like not ideal but the precision is really good you can do the same thing and it's within a tenth of a percent every single time what you mean to say is it's 2.4 percent off every time yes okay this is oh god the accuracy is terrible 2.7 or up to 3.3 off but the variance at best is two percent and at worst is four so doing the same movement a bunch of times is going to be different every single time you do it but at least it's instant it's so cool having a labs team to like test all this stuff for us because if all you're going to do is drop in to do maternal and click a few heads like you could pull it off but if you want to actually get good and do aim training or something like that this is going to prevent you from being able to do that see you later tommy nice knowing you so you see how right there it says advanced anti-ghosting with a infinity symbol beside that what happens if i actually press three keys at once so 27 30 32 it works yeah you have many more fingers or many less fingers than that let's go again oh my god three that's it oh unless you're on a different part of the matrix oh no okay space bar is separate okay so it can handle three per zone it looks like and where are my zones oh no spacebar is in the same zone as tkl oh yeah okay if i let go of d can i hit the space bar is it hitting anything up to a total of six maximum at once so even if i wanted to play liaro okay with my son which is a two player game where you each use one side of the keyboard this would not work that is a game from like 1997. and keyboards back then could handle it just fine latency is also terrible 30 milliseconds show me your secrets cover plate diffusion plate oh wow so it's a diffusion plate but it's also like the switch holder plate and then obviously this is as advertised it's a membrane style keyboard okay and once again the pcb looks like it came out of something from the 80s i love that they put that like anti-reverse engineering schmoo i'm a controller chip nobody wants to reverse engineer this keyboard guys you're taking yourselves too seriously there's your rgb zones edge lit two blue leds three red and two green it's really cool seeing the way the light interacts to form the different colors in this diffusion sheet though was there anything else you wanted to say about the keyboard nope before it goes to the keyboard been in the sky goodbye keyboard finally headset so this is the arctix nova 3 so you can see like a little bit extra mid bass that kind of gets your like gunshots and stuff really nice kind of a strange dip at 5k so maybe not that oh there is compared to the tommy at least my trained ear nailed the headset just basically poo poo across the board yeah so base not too bad after about one case like when you're in your mids where like people might be talking or where there are like feet or gunshots or like kind of anything it just yep i'm not even gonna bother trying to find where the screws are yeah sam our audio engineer actually asked us to take a look at the drivers and see if in production they forgot to take off the plastic that's protective because it's so bad he thinks it might be just manufactured wrong well we'll find out there's the rgb lighting cool kids are dead now okay sure the material is just that cheap tommy you done goofed surely they can't generally be this bad i don't think so yeah nothing can be this bad except
