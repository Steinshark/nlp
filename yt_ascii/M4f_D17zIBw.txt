welcome to this year's vaguely halloween 
themed episode of stand-up maths this year   for hellow-meme we're going to have a look 
at this meme that says an infinite number   of one dollar bills and an infinite number of 
20 bills would be worth the same you then got   the username popinloopy and then a picture of 
the scottish comedian limmy and that's actually   from limmy's video about which weighs more 
a kilogram of steel or a kilogram of feathers   you're right i don't get it one of my favorite 
videos on the internet do check it out if you   haven't seen it and limmy does a lot of live 
streaming on twitch also worth checking out here   they are just expressing confusion and i looked 
into the history of this meme because it's been   passed around a lot recently which is why several 
of you sent it in to me thank you very much and   that original text is from a website called just 
shower thoughts popinloopy then took that and   posted it on tumblr which is why you can see their 
name underneath they added the screenshot of limmy   looking confused and then another user curtdogg 
reblogged that on tumblr and that is where the   comments kicked off since then it's been the 
screenshots been taken of that it's been posted   to reddit but this original reblogging was on 
the 2nd of september 2016. there you are an old   old meme and yes there are a bunch of new comments 
from when it's been put on reddit but let's start   by having a look at some of the original comments 
on tumblr that's not true at all that's literally   just the concept of infinity i don't get it no 
they both equal infinity a number you just have   way more single bills than 20 bills i like this 
post until i started reading the comments i deck   what all this means it ain't though ask math 
tm i'm glad someone finally thought to ask math   trademark and on behalf of math trademark i'm 
going to answer which is why i had these two   stacks of infinite numbers of notes look at them 
go i mean from my point of view they touch a   little perspective gag there for you now i live 
in europe so i wasn't able to get fake us... i   mean real us dollar notes i had to get local ones 
uh and these are real totally not from a prop hire   place i'd like to thank my patreon supporters 
they've literally provided this money there   you go so these are 20 pound notes on this side 
over here and there's a 500 euro notes now a pound   in a euro as of later roughly the same thing and 
so instead of having one dollar notes and twenty   dollar notes where each note here is worth 20 
times the other one i happen to have notes 20   pounds on this side and these are worth 25 times 
as much but the point is every single layer in   this every note on this side this one is worth 25 
times as much and that is true all the way up so   the question now is if there are infinitely many 
of both of these piles are they the same amount   of infinite money or are they different amounts 
i like to get my head around it by imagining   duplicating this pile as in you take this pile 
and you start dealing them out and because each   of these are worth 25 times as much as these you 
deal these into 25 new piles and because there's   infinitely many of these you should have 25 piles 
of infinitely many notes and my post-production   people have told me that we don't need to hire i 
mean acquire any more infinite piles or 20 pound   notes they can just duplicate them in post and 
they say they they can work you know absolute   miracles and post-production they talked a lot 
about rotoscoping cloning at some point they're   going to stop it and blend or something i don't 
know what the point of that is but they told me   they're gonna do some pretty spectacular effects 
over here so now you should be looking at 25   piles and it's the same number of notes an 
infinite pile dealt out into 25 infinite   piles same as this so now every single layer has 
one note on this side and 25 of those across all   the piles so they're worth the same and that's 
both showing us first of all that we can match   these piles up to say that each layer is 
the equivalent value so if they're all   infinitely many layers high they have the same 
value also kind of shows us that multiplying   infinitely many notes by any finite number is 
meaningless because you can just deal these or   collapse them up into as many or as few piles 
as you fancy my only issue with that analogy   is the act of dealing you're only going to 
finish dealing after you've done infinitely   many deals and that's only going to be true in 
the limit it's going to take a very very long   time and we need to be careful when we talk about 
infinity because often you're dealing with limits   and you could as a better way of thinking about 
that start with the complete stack of infinitely   many bills and then just imagine every 25th bill 
sliding out into different piles at once that's   better because then you'd straight away have your 
infinitely many bills in the 25 different piles   and actually originally when i was planning this 
video i thought it'd be quite funny to have two   infinite money guns and just be like shooting 
an infinite number of bills from each one and then i realized well that doesn't work because 
you need to be doing it for an infinite amount   of time and that's going to take a really 
long time i'd get pretty bored doing that   foreign i've gone for these infinite piles so they're 
all just here straight away infinitely many of   them much better still quite expensive right hand 
set is yes it's opposite to multiply them to zero   none of the one dollar bill are exactly the same 
as none of twenty dollar twenty times infinity   equals one times infinity all divided by infinity 
20 does not equal one hmm thinky face emoji i stay   on the safe side and take the infinite amount 
of twenties they're dividing by infinity what   they're trying to divide by infinity why are they 
doing that you can't divide by infinity if you do   nothing makes sense anymore everything breaks and 
it's just cut a drift it's you can prove anything   equals anything it's because infinity is not a 
number people are acting like infinity is just   the biggest number like you have all the numbers 
one two three four in your account and you count   on your count and eventually numbers are just like 
oh i can't even and they stop and then after that   is infinity way at the end of the number line but 
it's not infinity isn't the biggest number it's a   measure of how many numbers there are infinity it 
is the whole number line it's the size of the set   of numbers and because it's not a number you can't 
do arithmetic with it you can't divide by infinity   which now brings us to the main event see if you 
can spot a pattern in these comments but some   infinities are bigger than others some infinities 
are bigger than others not all infinities are the   same nah because some infinities are bigger 
than other infinities one just feels better   than the other wrong some infinities are larger 
than others you have real infinities and then you   have the complex infinities that go beyond human 
comprehension and people seem pretty obsessed   with a specific video hey vsauce michael here 
hey michael vsauce here check out vsauce's how   to count past infinity it's pretty interesting 
uh there's a video explaining the banach-tarski   paradox derived from properties of infinity 
which you might find interesting https colon   forward slash forward slash www.youtube.com watch 
question mark v equals s 86 dash capital z dash   capital c b a capital h capital a the video how 
to count past infinity by michael of vsauce-fame   came out on the 9th of april 2016 less than six 
months before the money meme interesting now when   michael was working on that video he actually gave 
me a call he wanted to talk through infinity make   sure what he was doing was going to be correct 
and precise at the time i just written my book   things to make and do in the fourth dimension 
which has a whole chapter about infinity and i   tell you what because not often you get a phone 
call from a friend saying hey can you talk at   length about a thing you're obsessed about at the 
moment good times but one of the main things i   emphasized in what became a very long but finite 
call was when you're talking about like they're   being infinite amounts of something you've 
got to be very precise and say infinitely many   because the way you refer to infinity in terms 
of a size not a number you've got to be very very   careful and to michael's credit amazing video 
i think it's very accurate i think it's very   insightful i think it's entertaining i think it 
got a lot of people introduced to the notion of   infinity it's uh'.1 million views as we speak 
amazing and so then i was thinking well that's   weird if michael did such a good job on this video 
why are so many people confused about infinity   when it comes to piles of money and why are people 
blaming michael's video i think it's because   like a lot of things people half remember 
stuff and they go for feel and they're not   sufficiently rigorous when they reapply those 
techniques or concepts and this also applies to   a thing called hilbert's hotel which also 
appears it is that door i've just noticed   is that door always been there that's weird 
can i give me one second here i'm just gonna hilbert's hotel is a hypothetical hotel 
with infinitely many rooms and this is   a thought experiment to help get your head around 
infinite sets and matching them up systematically   specifically matching guests with rooms so you 
number the guests and they go into the same room   that has their number and the classic starting 
point is to have another batch of infinitely   many accountable guests show up can you fit them 
in yes you can you get everyone who's already in   a room to move to the room number that's twice 
their original room number so if it was in room   two moves down to room four as they're leaving 
the person from room one is going into room two   it means everyone's now in an even numbered room 
and then you put the infinitely many new guests in   the odd numbered rooms it's a nice visual but yet 
systematic way to show that the infinite set of   infinitely many even numbers and infinitely many 
odd numbers are themselves the same size as having   infinitely many numbers the same infinity and 
that's the irony about this whole thing all these   videos with hilbert's hotel treated really well 
and the point they're making is these infinities   are the same size so you can actually check out a 
much older video that vsauce did many many years   ago and about a year ago on veritasium derek did 
a short nice animated video about hilbert's hotel   i like some of their matching functions it's very 
cool you can see those but i think they're a great   explanation for why these infinities are the same 
so why are people getting so upset about different   sized infinities wow okay so that was a thing but 
the point is people are aware of this notion that   there are different science infinities and then 
when they come across an infinite set they're   not careful enough to see if you can match it up 
to the countable numbers to see if it's the same   as the countable infinity or if it is genuinely a 
bigger infinity and i guess the real issue is just   that doing that matching process is often a little 
counter-intuitive you've got to be real systematic   it's not always obvious i can demonstrate that 
with a semi-famous puzzle about infinity this is   where you've got infinitely many i'm going to use 
uh table tennis balls and then you number them and   you put them in a box so this is table tennis ball 
number one and the only rule is whenever you put   in a square number you take out its square root 
so i've put in one i'm going to take out at square   root one now the only applies if it's a perfect 
square so it's got a whole number square roots on   i put in two that can stay and i'm going to put in 
three no problems when i put in four however four   is a square number so i put in four and i take out 
two and then i carry on i keep numbering the balls   putting them in one at a time and the question is 
if i carry on doing this for the infinitely many   countable numbers once i'm done once i've done 
or infinitely many of them how many will be left   and the surprising answer is zero even though if 
you think about it on every single step i either   put in a ball and take one out so if i put in nine 
i'm going to take out three or i put in a ball and   leave it there so i'm going to put in 10. so it's 
always either staying the same or increasing yet   if i do that infinitely many times either leaving 
the total number alone or increasing it it ends   up at zero and you're like well that that doesn't 
make any sense there's no way that can be how it   works and once again were being tripped up by our 
human intuition because and actually i've kind   of set this up badly because by doing this one 
step at a time i have to do it infinitely many   times and as we established before that would 
take a very very long time so actually i could   have rephrased this to say i put in the first 
ball at like one hour to midnight and i put in   the next ball when there's half as much time left 
until midnight and then the next ball half as much   half as much half as much that means when it hits 
midnight we've gone through the infinitely many   halves and maybe right at the end it's going to be 
chaos it's gonna be balls flying in there's gonna   be balls flying out but we will have infinitely 
many steps and then right on midnight bam   empty box and once again we're kind of thinking of 
infinity as just a very very big number but that's   not how it works we could actually reframe this 
it'll make a lot more sense like imagine first   of all you dump in every single whole number at 
once there's infinitely many of them in the box   and now i'm going to dump out every single number 
that can be squared well that's all of them you   can take any whole number and square it so now i 
dump out all of them at once and by doing it that   way it's way more obvious that you end up with an 
empty box so the issue is if you're trying to work   out how big an infinity is you can't just jump to 
the first conclusion you've got to make sure you   think about it very very carefully technically 
the infinite number of twenty dollar bills is   faster than the infinite number of one dollar 
bills make it rain asterisk shoots singles out   of a confetti cannon asterisk yeah but 20 bucks 
goes to infinity faster and as we've seen from   this meme if people aren't careful they get real 
emotional and actually one time many years ago i   went on the bbc radio 4 program more or less and 
i happen to talk about infinity a little bit i   think in the context of prime numbers and people 
were upset i got an official complaint registered   against me i caught the sound of a man airing the 
preposterous notion that the sum of all primes   approaches infinity they were very upset but it's 
true and i can see where their logic's gone wrong   it's like the square numbers again you're like 
well there are fewer square numbers than whole   numbers as you count up systematically so 
therefore there must be a different sized   set of numbers just like not all numbers are 
prime there are fewer primes than numbers but   you can put all the primes in order and number 
them and so we get bogged down in thinking about   it in terms of counting up gradually and we 
shouldn't be doing it that way we should be   thinking about the whole set at once infinity 
is not a process where you counter count and   counter count and eventually get there it's 
a process of looking at all of it at the same   time so what is a bigger infinity if they are 
different sizes what on earth is bigger than   the countable numbers and it's not fractions it 
feels like it should be fractions because you've   got your whole numbers one two three four and if 
you pick any two of them that are next to each   other there are no more in between like that's it 
they're they're spread out whereas fractions you   pick any two fractions there's always another 
fraction in between you're like ah now we got   it there's more of them because as you zoom in 
there's always more and more and more it's not   just the number line going out however if you're 
very careful you can arrange the infinitely many   fractions to assign them an individual counting 
number each i did a video years ago about the   stern-brocot sequence which is my favorite way 
of doing that on number file you can check it   out and there are other great videos that show you 
how you can number the fractions where you could   no longer number it is once you hit the reels or 
rather numbers that have infinitely many values   in them so i tend to use the reels to indicate 
that because you've got infinitely many decimal   places in derek's veritasium video they had people 
arriving at hilbert's hotel whose names were an   infinite string of a's and b's a very nice way of 
doing it and because you've got infinitely many   digits let's say per item if you go through 
and number them all you can use a clever process   you have a diagonal argument where you generate 
a new importantly infinitely long number that is   nowhere on the list is that infinitely long that's 
important i've had people email me and say well   hang on the integers have infinitely many lead 
zeros and that's true they do have infinitely many   lead zeros but you cannot use them because every 
counting number is finite in length no matter how   far you count how far you go down the number line 
how big your integer is they're always a finite   length there's no infinitely long integer and 
so it means you cannot use infinitely many lead   zeros or change them to make a different integer 
the reals work because there are infinitely many   decimal places trailing off and you can mess with 
them whereas fractions yes they may repeat but   you can represent them as a finite number and so 
that there's it's difficult difficult to grasp but   there are loads of other great videos out there 
that show you this diagonal argument and once you   have these reals that is a bigger infinity but is 
it the next biggest infinity we have the smallest   infinity of the countable numbers we've got the 
reels a bigger infinity but is it the next one up   is there an infinite set that's got a size that's 
between those two well not only do we not know we   can't know it's provably undecidable based on i 
say our current mathematics which is not to mean   what we currently understand is to mean the axioms 
we're currently basing all of maths on which means   the question of what is the next biggest infinity 
after the countable numbers doesn't really make   sense you can either add axioms that force it 
to be the next biggest or you can add axioms   which force it to not be the next biggest it's 
really annoyingly not even a sensible question   to ask which i find absolutely mind-blowing i find 
almost more amazing than the fact that they're   they're well there are infinitely many different 
sized infinities let's not go down that path i   find it even more incredible that the notion of 
ordering them to know which the next biggest is   doesn't even make sense as a question to ask when 
it feels so sensible it's not math trademark in   conclusion same amount of money if you're new 
to the channel thanks for watching a whole video   to get a very thorough and meandering 
self-indulgent answer to the meme same amount   of money although i like the fact i started with 
the meme it ended up ranting about the continuum   hypothesis more about that online and in my book 
things to make it do in the fourth dimension i'll   link to it below of course huge thanks to all 
my patreon supporters people who watch all these   videos all the way to the end thanks for hanging 
around thanks to my patreon supporters all this   money was possible that's such a great sentence 
uh to say an extra amount of thanks because i am   infinitely grateful i'm infinitely many grateful 
meh i have printed out every single patreon   supporter on a piece of paper that fits in the 
money guns i've replaced all spaces in your   names with underscores that's because i'll doing 
this quickly in a word document i didn't want some   people's names to wrap off one note onto another 
one and i've replaced all letter s's with two   dollar signs because i think that's hilarious 
and i'm going to end the video by shooting all   of these names out of the money guns if you were 
supporting me on patreon a week before halloween   your name is definitely in here somewhere you 
may or may not be able to see it that's the   nature and excitement of the money gun experience 
i will also say very quickly if you want to get   involved in whatever ridiculous thing i do for 
my patreon supporters for christmas you need to   be supporting me by the end of november because 
then that's when i start working on christmas   plans so if you want to get involved if you want 
to get the physical card etc make sure you're at   the tier that you want on patreon i'll link to 
it below but now we end some money gun action
