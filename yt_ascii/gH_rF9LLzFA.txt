we have this many body quantum system and we can only view sort of bits and pieces of it at a time that's the bad news the good news is that we can utilize superposition and interference between the states of these systems but in order to be able to solve things faster than than classical computers this type of structure is only amenable to certain problems there's a table here you could make that lists the tasks and you can organize them in terms of whether they're useful in the real world whether they are exponentially faster now by exponential i mean exponentially in the number of qubits so you have a family of problems each of which has a certain size you want to sort n equals two objects three objects four objects five objects where you're a traveling salesman and you want to visit n equals two destinations three destinations four destinations five destinations the time it takes you to figure out optimal way to visit all of them scales with the number of destinations because if you have two destinations you can you know how to do that but if you have 17 it's it's going to be a lot harder right and how does the the time it takes for you to figure out what's the best way for you to cover all 17 destinations scales with seven with the number of destinations you're trying to cover and the third part is have they been realized meaning have they been in some part built in the lab so the first task that quantum computers are famous for is factoring numbers factoring large numbers is what allows you to break your your bank so by large numbers i mean 100 digits thousand digits definitely useful supposed to be faster so you're supposed to be able to do this faster in a quantum computer but even that in fact we don't really know because people in complexity theory people who determine how fast everything is don't actually that they haven't actually proven a lot of things a lot of this stuff is conjecture but the the logic is that lots of smart people have tried and so there's a sort of belief that the factoring large numbers generally is going to be fast done faster on the quantum computer than it's possible to do in a classical computer now p equals np is this little caveat so assuming that these two things aren't equal so this p is basically stuff you can do you can do this stuff on a classical computer pretty easily and and this stuff here is believed not to be doable so as long as this is true then everything is fine so large numbers have not been realized in the lab okay 15 doesn't count now there's another class of like i said this np problem so these are supposed to be hard on a classical computer and complete just means any prop they're all kind of related to each other very useful traveling salesman is one of these they are not believed to be doable faster on a quantum computer again as with the caveat that certain conjectures and stuff are satisfied and they have been realized you can try to realize things that you're not going to be able to do faster just to show that you can do something with your device but it's not going to necessarily give you a speed up now one of the oldest tasks that quantum computers are supposed to be useful for is simulation so i mentioned maybe in the previous lecture that a quantum computer is a quantum system and so is a molecule so is a material so is some high energy set of high energy particles that are colliding with each other and we can use our engineered quantum system to simulate a quantum system we want to know more about that we can't otherwise realize in an easy way like a protein or a material or some set of high energy particles that are colliding with each other so definitely useful can quantum simulation be done faster on a quantum computer than in a classical computer people believe so this basically just boils down to the idea that the stuff you can do using classical physics and randomness classical computers and randomness is not the same or smaller in some sensor doesn't contain problems that you can do with quantum computers and randomness and again this is not something we really you know there's no smoking gun here it's it's sort of a general belief and small systems and maybe even relatively larger ones recently have been realized on quantum devices now have they given us new physics yes there's certain cases where we have learned new physics about quantum system have they helped us solve you know determine useful properties that we hadn't known before that we were able to adapt to the real world and help solve real world problems no i would say no that we haven't been able to go that far but we're on our the hope is that we're scaling up and making our devices more robust and less fragile and eventually we hope to get to a large enough system size so we can actually spit out solutions that are useful for the real for for the for the parts of these problems that are indeed useful for the real world and then the rest of the algorithms there's a lot of different quantum algorithms and i'm not doing justice by kind of shuffling all of them into this this one less the one next entry in the table but i did just want to peel off the three kind of important ones showing that there is something quantum computers are purportedly going to do well that we can't do well yet there are things that they can't do well that we can try to use them for but we're not gonna we're just not gonna probably gain a lot from that there's something that they're supposed to be doing well in terms of simulating nature and that's probably one of the main applications down the road and then there's a lot of different algorithms some of them are useful but maybe won't run faster it's not clear they're heuristics and some of them are not that they do run faster but it's not clear how useful they are so basically you have this trade-off between faster and useful for most classical algorithms and sort of the the one that's really you know smoking gun as smoking as it can get for both useful and faster is factoring and these of course have also been in small instances realized on devices now the types of devices that that i mentioned using atoms ions photons electronics they are beginning to be scaled up to hundreds of qubits but and in a way that we are able to try to maintain the fragile quantum properties that allows us to utilize effects of collapse superposition uncertainty and entanglement however they're still too noisy to be able to do really precise computations and this era of of scaling up to these noisy quantum devices is called the nisk era in our community and this is the era of noisy intermediate scale quantum and all of these devices so far are nisk and in order to really utilize them for super precise computations that actually output you know specific numbers that have to be you know 10 bits of precision 20 bits of precision we really have to make them more robust and utilize extra overhead of encoding information redundantly in processed information redundantly using error correction applying gates in a way that taught is tolerant to errors namely it's called fault tolerance and we also should pick we also tried should try to outline other problems that have the right type of structure to be able to be utilized with quantum interference and harnessed with quantum computers in a way that's faster and and so this area is very much active right now and it's very exciting to watch these algorithms develop we see these waves matter behaves like a wave when you get down to the atomic level which means that all of the here if you even consider thinking of it as a wave which we can you know you don't even have a single wavelength fit in here you
