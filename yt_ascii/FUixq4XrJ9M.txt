hello everyone and welcome in this video we are going for a test drive in my 2002 honda s2000 after i have changed out the differential and swapped the tires for some sticky summer tires so it's a nice warm day sunny beautiful and we've got a new differential in there it is a 4.44 final drive rather than the 4.1 so a little bit more aggressive gearing so starting off how does the new differential feel well just from kind of a quality standpoint you really don't notice that it's there so you know no additional noise no additional vibration super smooth so i'm really pleased with how putty mod built the diff it feels really good and the install went really well so overall you know great quality product i have no issues with it so far as far as the quality from a performance standpoint does it actually make a difference when you put your foot down well i'll be honest you don't feel much and if you've watched my my testing video then you've seen that you know peak g-force is going to be different by about five percent so a five percent improvement and peak g-force in second gear so when you put your foot down you're gonna feel a little bit more than if you had the 4.1 in it overall honestly it's a very minimal difference and like i said if i were to do it again i probably would go with the 4.77 i'm not too worried about the fact that the revs are going to be up a little bit higher even cruising on the highway you know i'm fine with that because this isn't my daily driver i don't take it on the highway all that much so i think the 4.44 is an okay choice i'd say the 477 is better even though i do plan on adding power to this car and honestly you know once you start to add power you don't really need that gearing adjustment as much that said this car revs to 9000 rpm so you've got a lot of space to play with as far as gearing is concerned and i don't think there's anything really holding you back from going to a 477. i went with the 444 because putty mod said you know he didn't trust the build quality of some of the 4.57s out there and he said the 477 was too aggressive if i do plan on supercharging the car so i went with the 444. i think i'd be okay with the supercharged 477. but that said you know it's it's fun it adds an improvement there is a you know mathematical difference physical difference you can measure it so it is quicker it is better just very minimal difference especially for the money you know that you'd be spending in order to buy a new gif it was an expensive differential to buy and you know the install would also be costly if you don't do that yourself or if you need to buy tools for it now there is one difference which i noticed while driving it and that is the the gearing so when you're shifting and what i noticed is when i was downshifting i have to give it a little bit more throttle in order to match the revs and i wasn't sure why of that so i did the math on the gearing and it turns out like let's say for example you're in fourth gear and you're going to downshift into third gear the the gap in rpm is larger with more aggressive gearing than less aggressive gearing so switching the 444 when you do downshift you have to blip the throttle a little bit more because you're raising rpm more and so you know i'll show some data on the screen to show exactly what these numbers are but there is you know a decent jump in rpm that's required if you are going to downshift you don't really notice it on up shifts but you do notice that you have to give it more throttle on downshifts not an issue this has a mechanical throttle it's very sensitive to your right foot as far as throttle input so very easy to rev match it's just something that you will have to kind of get used to because it is different than when you're with the stock 4.1 now as far as the tires this made a very noticeable difference going from those crappy fusions to these bridgestone re 71r summer tires they have so much more grip and you really notice it in in two ways you notice in the steering the steering feels fantastic i thought it felt good before but now it's got a really great response to it so the second you know you start turning that wheel in you get an immediate turn in which is really nice really great steering in this vehicle even though it's you know one of the first electronic power steering systems out there which you know a lot of people say removes feel and it certainly does compared to some of the hydraulic systems out there but with these new tires on it the response is great it's got a really good on center feel good weight to it as you turn in i really like the steering feel as a result of changing these tires and also you notice it in the braking now if you watched my video on comparing the fiat 124 the mazda mx-5 the subaru brz and the honda s2000 and these are four cars that i absolutely love but i was going through you know the different systems and saying my thoughts and braking was the one that i was kind of hard on the s2000 for and i think the reason for that almost purely comes down to the tires that were on it didn't have strong braking and that was purely a result of the tires and so you know i was talking about how the braking it didn't feel that confident confidence inspiring to you know slam on the brakes with in the s2000 and the braking feel you know not all that great honestly it changes dramatically with these new tires i mean it plants you if you put your foot down so really great braking in this car now impressive great feel to it in the brake pedal nice progressive build as you slam down on that pedal or work your way into it so i really like it it's made a tremendous difference going from those old crappy tires to these new tires i have not yet over steered in it like i did on the old tires honestly i don't know if i've pushed it quite as hard because the limit on these tires is significantly higher and so you can corner a bit faster without getting into that oh you know am i going to start to get a little sideways in this thing so huge improvement with the tires and this guy's biking with skis thank you sir for offsetting my carbon footprint and biking up this hill while i burn fuel so overall swapping the differential and putting on these new tires it certainly has improved the way the car feels not a huge noticeable difference from the differential but definitely a noticeable difference with the tires in the amount of cornering grip that you have this is a great corner to illustrate that oh man these tires are great this car is great so thank you guys for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below let's get down in a second you
