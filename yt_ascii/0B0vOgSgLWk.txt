ladies and gentlemen welcome to the biggest chess tournament of 2024 the candidates the candidates is an eight player double round robin which means there are 14 games and the winner of this event will play for the world chess championship now this is the first time in history that the open candidates and the women's candidates are being held at the exact same time and it's the first time in history the candidates is in north america inter tonto canada where i was just for 72 hours i'm going to be posting a bunch of interviews that i did with players i already posted one that i did with hikaro and fabiano we have yan pishi coming as well i did an interview with vishi anan that's super special i recorded a bunch of irl content with chess fans and now i'm back here and i'm making this recap for you and for the first four days of the candidates we're doing a candidate sale on chesley and all my courses are 33% off so get ready to follow this tournament throughout the month of april on channel here we go in round number one we have fabiano carana versus hikara nakamura and i will take you through every single game of the day let me know if you like this format because it's obviously eight games i will be going quickly or if you want me to exclude certain things if they're a little bit boring do let me know fabiano carana opens with the move e4 and if you're wondering who's playing in the candidates you will figure it out by by the end of the recap but i will give you an update every single day last candidates this was the exact matchup in the first round fabiano carana versus hikaru they make people from the same country play each other earlier so that there's no collusion not that they're accusing anybody but it's just what they do and hikaru plays the sicilian defense the most combative confrontational way to play against e4 the second way being the scandinavian but you will never see it in the candidates cuz it's poopy butt c5 and we have an open sicilian and if you're going to play like this you got two choices in yeah three choices in this position you play the nidorf the classical you have the dragon and then you have the classical sicilian with knight c6 iaru plays e5 this is an insane move now for most of you watching you don't get it and that's fine and i'm not insulting you i'm just saying there's a clear disconnect between top level chests and and standard people at home like yourself watching the reason why black goes here is to prevent any piece from going to b5 and this opening is called the nidorf and it survived the test of time you know who would have literally 1,000 lines memorized against the nidorf fabiano hikaru plays the accelerated knight orf allowing bishop b5 check and traditionally this position has been considered quite bad for black like black has to fight back and white is very active now what's fascinating is that this position was reached by fabiano in a title tuesday game this is how online chess has completely transformed classical chess and traditional over theboard play fbi in that game took the knight rotated backwards and dominated that square but in this game he plays a the retreating move bishop a4 which is not as popular gets his bishop kicked out but this square is going to be up for grabs and that is the square that fab is going to try to utilize now you're going to notice the engine gives this slightly better for white cuz it is cuz it's a dubious way of playing this ian but hikaru wants to take fabby out of his comfort zone and the players play a bunch of theory bishop f6 bishop f6 as you see everything in fabiano's position is around the light squares in the center we have opposite colored bishops and he castles but hearu emerges from the opening with a 34 minute time advantage technically it's like 33 and 5 seconds but that's a big deal that is a very very very big deal this is a completely different story from madrid 2022 some of you weren't even born in 2022 that year they played in the first round of the candidates hearo lost this time he clearly has the upper hand and he sacrifices a pawn he gives up a pawn because it really can't be taken because of all this pressure to get the bishop and to simplify the game into an opposite colored bishop position bobby does this rookie w hikaru gives up this takes back on b2 and plays bishop six hikaru is still up 35 minutes on the clock he's playing quickly he's playing confidently he's got the opposite colored bishops and he knows that in the long run this is probably going to be good enough to hold and a draw against fabiano with the black pieces in the first round of the candidates is a very good way to go all right eight eight and a half is the magic number to win the candidates queen d5 but fabby not to be outdone gets in with the queen hikaru now spends 35 minutes on a move 35 minutes probably about five of those minutes were spent thinking about the move and 30 were spent thinking about daffodils or i don't know whatever chess players think about when they're playing chess it it's probably probably not chess so the thing is black's position is on the verge of complete collapse like optically black's position looks beyond garbage i mean i'm i'm not trying to insult what hikaro is doing hikaro took a very deliberate thing in this game he he he went for the position that looked optically bad and he's trying to solve his problems all right but guess what the problems have not been solved hikaru finds a rook sacrifice here by the way a defensive one you can't can't take this because after queen h4 you're under a massive attack you go king f1 i have rook e8 and despite being up a full rook that's checkmate so like you got to be really careful right g3 stops the mate queen h3 falls right back into mate hearo plays rook f2 which is a ridiculous move i mean getting hit with rook f2 is is brutal but fab's still better and not only is fabbi better at this point the engine gave fabiano a winning advantage deep engine analysis here shows that it's not 6 as as this engine is saying but it's like 1.3 but bobby has 12 minutes to make 13 moves because that is the time control of the candidates and the candidates they play five six hour games on the 40th move of the game they get an extra time to play the rest of the game and there's no bonus time there's no bonus time for the first 40 moves so fabi could lose on time if he starts thinking here a lot right and you'll notice hikaro played this move very quickly and fabby said that actually kind of got him a little spooked because he thought he was better he's up a pawn he could start pushing but if he starts pushing this pawn karu is's going to get his rooks right white's king a little bit so he goes here and all the advantage is gone he does this they start trading and despite being a pawn up fobby can't move these two pawns he tries i mean he definitely starts moving them but hikaru is so active here look at this move rook a8 by the way what e he just hung the rook no because then queen takes then queen e2 check and you win the rook back and hikaru this game defended stubbornly won the pawn back and this is just going to be a draw fabbi makes it to the time control and in this position the players agree to a draw you'll notice that they gained some time on the 40th move they gained 30 minutes this one ends in a draw a very big improvement from the candidates of 2022 by hikaro a combative draw with black i have no idea why he decided to make it exquisitly exciting for the fans but a very good start both of these guys now have half a point now nar abasov the underdog 2632 from aeran and not only that i did an interview with him he's a torn acl you're going to see photos of the tournament he's literally wearing a brace he had surgery like a few months ago versus yan pishi yan pishi is a two-time winner of the candidates back toback he's played in two candidates and he's won two candidates and i have a statistics degree which makes me think that he's going to play in his third candidates and he might win it because that's how probabilities work but this game starts out with a queen gambit declined it's an exchange variation excuse me it is not an exchange variation is what i meant to say exchange variation would be if white takes very solid but here's the thing if white wants to play a queen's gambit and do nothing like if white plays a queen's gambit declined right plays into it like this and just wants to do absolutely nothing in this game black has to take massive risk and it's not possible to win and what ends up happening in this game is n plays bishop takes knight and d5 and you will notice yan with the black pieces is up 20 minutes because he played a very solid line like it's round one of the candidates some some players like hikaru get really exotic with it and some guys literally trade every single piece and go home in an hour and this was the position after 24 moves who's to blame i don't know unstoppable force meets a movable object i mean yan just wanted to get the candidates underway and i think kind of so did nj you know a little bit of an underdog story you you don't want to like burn all the bridges in the first game and it's a queen's gamb declin like what are you going to do right and you'll notice n was kind of thinking early like he spent five minutes then he spent another like he spent' minutes on this move right like yan was just sort of doing his thing and yeah i mean it's sort of up to white like if white wants to do this the players agree to a draw after 34 moves right they shuffle around they make a draw okay so nj and nepo have the same score as fabiano and hikaru now we're going to pop on over to the women's candidates alexandra gachina versus katarina lagno this is a another sicilian defense this one bishop b5 this is known as the rosal liimo and here lagno plays a a huge sideline like the whole reason you go here is cu you want to not allow this to be a check which is why it's super weird that in this position you then play d6 anyway but it but it's very uncompromising i mean it's basically it's just the choice and now you play bishop d7 so that if bishop takes knight you take back with the bishop instead of the pawn and now you waited too long so white goes bishop one i'm telling you you're going to watch this as a beginner you're going to be very confused but the entire point is i brought this out here to make you commit to setting up like that now i slide the rook put the bishop there and now i'm going to put two pawns in the center but black is going to stop that but in stopping that black is going to allow me access to these squares which is why i do all of this like chess is very complicated and very tough to understand at a high level and i just told you white wants to play d4 right white wants to get a big center well white plays d3 so gacha down 20 minutes on the clock in the opening but she is securing the control of the light squares in the center and if black is successful at any point in lashing out in the position black is going to have a great time which is why gachina is trying to trade off lago's knight from controlling the center she is able to do that what a move by the way i mean knight f5 is an incredible idea and it's kind of a trojan horse because if you take i'm going to get a big attack which is why she didn't take so the knight went back the knight was on e3 but it rotated this way right now g5 now g going to go for it h5 locking the whole thing down but yeah g oh my goodness that is a crazy maneuvering sequence queen e6 queen d1 and still white is looking to kind of poke and prod but black breaks out both players at around 15 minutes and suddenly it and and sometimes it just so happens in ch is just nothing you can do rook f8 rook e2 and the players here literally just shuffle the pieces and that is the way they make the draw three- time repetition in chess when you shuffle three times or the position repeats three times could the game have kept going from here like night night here yeah lagno could have played queen g5 or queen h4 if this is round seven of the candidates like if this is round eight if this is later in the event the players kind of know their form black will probably keep the game going that's just the truth but it's round one i think a lot of the players are trying to find their footing you know you wake up every day at the candidates and don't want to get zero points it's just sort of the reality so i'm kind of getting the quick draws out of the way gukesh versus vidit this a big one all india match up in the first game this one a tarash this is known as the tarash defense a very aggressive choice and you notice that gukesh does not take the tash is a very forcing line white has the option to clear the entire center black would go here attacking the the the the knight here and black has like some crazy lines like b5 i mean you know if if white goes here black can take and then play like queen a5 check it's not the best way but i'm just saying that's sort of like the little idea in a nutshell but gukesh plays a very solid and sober approach and the position is completely symmetrical after five moves completely symmetrical and this is not good you can't get an advantage here with white cuz black is just going to copy you the whole time so gkes does this and then he does rook a2 rook d2 what the what yeah rook a2 rook d2 this game explodes ges says you know what i'mma put the cannon on the d file i'm going to open up the g file and vid says oh yeah go ahead take my center pawn not only does vidit castle onto the g file he also gives up a pawn completely in the center now it's not exactly a free pawn because this is not vid's idea right this is losing for black that's not vid's idea the idea is that after cd5 black can play bishop e5 target the knight and then get this also black can apparently go here which is completely deranged losing a pawn for nothing but black is better and yeah i mean somehow white's position is bad bishop b2 from gkes and that's what vidit does so vidit finds this idea and vid understands that despite being down a pa he has a lot of activi a file is going to activate the bishop is pressuring this and somehow white just doesn't have a lot of harmony just doesn't have a lot of harmony what is he going to do right white can play like like how does white defend this if white comes over here right we're going to get this bishop d like what is white's plan like if white does this black will just focus on that side of the board like there's no attack which is why just like in a couple of these other games that you are seeing there is a bailout process i mean this looks really really really dangerous queen c2 and vidid is better here i mean he has he the world is kind of his oyster in this position i know the engine says this but practically speaking you can't possibly tell me that this does not look very nice for black but vidit spends a while here and goes here so vidit spent 40 minutes on this move gcash fell asleep at the board no i'm just kidding bishop g4 is a is a nice idea and it's very aggressive but and just so you understand the idea is pawn takes rook c8 attacking the queen and now when the queen step somewhere the rook comes in and white can't defend himself white has three pieces on their home scores on the home scare right so it doesn't work so bishop g4 is actually brilliant idea only one problem this and now that's hanging and that is still hanging queen a3 white can take if white wants to go on a roller coaster ride but gukesh says it's the first round of the candidates so we've reached a position where i can take massive risk but i won't so we're seeing a lot of games sort of peter out right seeing a lot of games like bat1 but players are getting on the scoreboard this is anna muuk from ukraine versus nurul salimova from bulgaria actually funny story about this match nuru beat anna to qualify for this tournament so they played in the women's world cup and this one is a petro okay next game no jokes aside this one was was a weird sideline of the petro where white gives up the pawn in the center and develops but yeah they traded and it's a middle game where white has some activity but white did not get a whole lot in this game white tried and pushed and right around here kind of had an active position like i think nuril was a bit on the back foot it was a little bit unpleasant and white definitely was more active but nuril was defending and i'm really not sure anna could have done much better this is a very very well-timed idea by black making white either open up the position or do what she did in the game which is allow the pawn all the way down but yeah rook d8 strong counterplay trades the pieces and good defense from nuru honestly just a very good first round game for the candidates it's her first candidates i think she's 19 so she's the youngest participant on the women's side the second youngest being vali who is 21 or 22 i think she's 22 and yeah 19 years of age first game is a draw against i mean a perennial top five woman of the last like 10 years and a muuk so really not not much better you could ask for but a lot of draws as you can see like round one was relatively peaceful but the last couple of games are anything but peaceful this is vali rames babu sister of prague brother and sister playing in the candidates versus humpy conu who is a legend of the game i mean she has been also perennial like top player and it's very cool that these different generations are clashing from the same country like for vali i mean i'm not putting words in her mouth that's not my intention but i can imagine maybe humpy was like even a role model or somebody she looked at as the icon of the nation right and this one is an italian where white gets a lot of queenside space italian is one of the most topical openings nowadays h6 is one of the ways to to play and so is g6 you play like h6 g6 white can play in a handful of ways castling is one of the ways but you could also play h6 like way back here like knight f6 d3 h6 this is also another way of playing but okay h6 and then black's bishop is forced back there if you want me to explain that to you i literally can't but this is the entire purpose black is trying to accomplish this move d5 and that is actually this is almost the reason why you you you you know you might castle and and play rook e one first but now that black is able to play d5 you're going to kind of get an more open game a6 a3 and at some point the center will explode and there it goes and then the center explodes the pieces are traded humpy tries to approach on the on the queen side a very nice idea here by vali looking to secure some squares but a well-timed queen e6 and this might look really bad these pawns and i got to tell you they are a little ugly but they do the job and they completely stop any of white's ideas so she goes here instead but pressure was on for a little while but humpy defended very well kicked out the rook and then rotated the knight rotated the queen it was a lot of rotations in this game and as you might imagine pieces were traded nobody's going to win this position and a peaceful resolution in the game by sh versus humpy as well but not in the last two games of this recap this is leting versus tongi and we will end with ali resa fua versus prananda ramish babu leting is the defending winner of this tournament and she she was the challenger she was playing against j and jun and tan also this chinese wave of players they have to everybody from the same country plays in the first round at least they try to this one also starts out with d5 on the third move we saw that in the in this game in the game between aoss of and nepo same exact concept same move order but this time we have an exchange so we have an exchange which is something that did not have in this game right that's why i said it was not an exchange variation and that allowed yan to kind of simplify so leting plays the exchange variation and now we'll play you know queen c2 bishop d3 knight d2 there's this plan but tangi goes here and that is one of the rarest moves in the position which you might look at and go how is that how was that so rare it attacks the queen it looks very natural it looks weird because it allows queen b3 attacking the pawn now this is reason ling j you know she just plays queen c2 she kind of keeps moving but that is a weird place for the bishop especially cuz it could be a target right so h3 and now the bishop goes back to e6 and white just sort of plays i mean white just says all right like whatever you wanted the bishop there and now tanong he plays this trading the bishop so she's looking for kind of an immediate simplification in some capacity right we have knight takes c4 if this was played and then this you can't take it looks like you can queen b before but actually as it turns out you can play like this the the engine actually doesn't really mind it black will be able to get back into the game but you kind of don't want to enter the dra you know the lions then so leting j just trades some pieces plays very solidly and here i thought has an excellent position right she has a great position and i have something in my eyeball so b4 all right rook e8 castles queen g5 this is a threat so white goes here and white plays b5 and ling j is just bulldozing the queen side this is what's called a queen side minority versus a queens side majority it's three pawns versus four and you're just trying to kind of go down that side of the board and break trying to get a4 a5 a6 crack these pawns get in win the game rook e six okay so black is trying to create counterplay while also playing defense now in this position bc is a little bit fast instead apparently this is a little bit better to kind of protect and then maybe regroup but it's a it's a very it's a very tense position bishop f3 and still the position looks completely fine for white white is totally not in any danger queen a5 queen c7 queen h4 but there's nothing i mean there's absolutely nothing but here lei gets a little bit spooked she obviously didn't like something here she didn't like this she did not like the prospect of that move move and what's kind of funny is that rook c1 here is the best move and after bishop h3 you just go queen h2 so it doesn't quite work rook c1 threatens rook c6 so if black plays a6 you take if bishop h3 you take and you're not getting m it and then at the end of the whole thing you play queen h2 right so rook c1 going for this pawn continuing with all of this would have been the right way but instead of that she kind of panics she goes here when 10 minutes she trades the queens thinking well this is solid i can't lose but suddenly it starts to spin out of control black plays very solidly very smart defensive chess and lay just loses a pawn takes this one but she loses that one she must have thought she was going to win one back here but black just is up a pawn and you know the engine is always thinking positions like this are drawish but as the game goes on and time gets low we see move 40 time is added black is winning i mean black is up a pawn and black is going to stop that one and and and and tanong just very slowly methodically look at this move g5 by the way setting a checkmate net king's made it so white has to sacrifice and now it's all over the king is hunted out rook a1 this is check the pawn is stopped king f3 and in this position after h4 rook g8 le resigns because she can protect her pawn g4 h5 take take take and you will just lose this end game crazy dongi wins she beats the defending champion which leaves us with the probably the most exciting game of the round alira fua versus prag the battle of the young the young men and aliva 20 i think or 21 20 i think he's 20 he might be 21 born in 2003 so there's a higher chance that he's 20 than 21 unless he's born in the earlier part of the year but i think he's born in june but i might be wrong anyway and prague is like 12 no prague is 17 he's' spanish pish four and now not just any spanish the open spanish the spanish where you take and everything goes crazy d4 b5 d5 takes bishop e6 cutting edge theory on the board bishop c2 queen e1 oh my goodness unpinning allowing your king to be opened up and oiled up knight bd2 knight e6 the king slides out of the way and you know why the king slides out of the way because the king knows that when this opens up the rook is going to the g file that's exactly what happens and you notice neither guy is thinking much bishop g5 both guys playing on the ideas that they are familiar with the bishop goes there you know why it goes there cuz you're trying to get rid of white's bishop which is a super weird idea but you know what the idea do you know what the actual idea of bishop g5 is do you know why the bishop went out there there to trade because black's bishop was superfluous there was nowhere to put it the black queen wanted to activate but you're not going to put your bishop on c5 so instead you trade the bishop and then you play queen h4 and both guys are implementing the game plan it's a very imbalanced game what is going rook g4 the queen is just hanging around eyes on here eyes on here eyes on the king knight d3 queen e2 and i mean it looks like ali resa is about to just go straight down the board and he's got a 20-minute time advantage but prague well timed f5 a counter strike getting an on pant in but now he brings in his rook ali resa plays f4 the pawn is on the way rook g7 an idea it doesn't work you don't win the queen because this is there but it's an idea rook h6 that's checkmate you got to do something about it how about this move queen playing defense here comes prague with his other rook now here's the thing if this ever goes to an end game like let's just say something like this black is always better black is better because these pawns are terrible they're not good so white really needs to keep pieces on the board the right way rook e one a very very tense game rook h5 now ali resa decides a4 ali resa has half less than half the time of his opponent and he has 12 minutes to make 13 moves you know co els had 12 minutes to make 13 moves remember this guy over here fabiano luigi carana yes his middle name is luig igi i'm not just i'm not just talking about mario and luigi he looks like his middle name is luigi all right yeah tw he also had 12 minutes for for 13 moves and what did f do he started trading because he was like you know what i got to relieve the tension a little bit simplify h res says i'm opening up a new front of attack rook h6 there's there's like really brutal stuff that's going to happen over here rookie two five minutes he has five minutes to make 12 moves there's no bonus time he has five minutes to make 12 moves do you understand 12 moves is a lot of moves and then you might play bullet or blitz that's a lot of moves it's the candidates a lot is on the line rook h3 the queen goes back this is a free pawn but believe it or not it might be better to go here to keep the tension to force white to play defense and maybe even play a move like b4 giving up a pawn to secure the d4 square i mean is a very big moment in this game it's the first game of the candidates do you go all in do you do do you not go all in he takes the free pawn but by taking the free pawn al res jums to c5 oh my god you can't take and the knight is hanging you can't take because rookie e eight you lose your queen rook is game over it's lights out so is alira winning a well-timed strike queen h5 the knight is completely abandoned but maid is still there if the rook moves and the rook is hanging and now the best move is rook eeg g2 bringing in the queen with pressure on the jeep that would have been the best move and prague would have had to find the unfathomable the only move knight e5 giving up the knight completely but the point is the queen is now blocked and then he would have had to find queen f7 giving up a knight completely with rook what is this how is that what what about bishop d yeah but the knight is hanging that's the real problem so if in this position alira had played rook g2 prague would have had to find the only move knight e5 i don't know if he saw it or what but instead of that with low time he goes here knight g5 and the dust settles with a rook sacrifice and a perpetual check in the final position prague is down a knight and a bishop a knight and a bishop but white cannot escape he cannot escape the vortex of checks nobody can defend and the game ends in a draw oh my goodness so seven out of eight games in the first round ended in draws this one was ridiculous most of the games were pretty kind of boring is you know just kind of easing into it the fai hearo game was back and forth hikaro played very practically well in that game posing some problems for fabiano to convert fabi was never endanger in that game but to convert any type of advantage that he had and tanang the only winner of the day leads the women's candidates with one point but you you don't you don't need to know all of that you we got 13 more rounds to go all courses are 33% off during the candidate sale and do check out the interviews i will be rolling out all the interviews with yan pishi i recorded a second one with hikaru vish anand i'm super stoked super excited and you know the drill get out of here
