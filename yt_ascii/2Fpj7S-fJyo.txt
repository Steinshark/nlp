nvidia is reportedly pulling the plug on its gtx branding once a mainstay of the graphics card world going forward it appears that nvidia's products will all be labeled with rtx branding instead but why would nvidia kill off such strong branding that commands tons of mind share in the marketplace to understand this it's helpful to look at some quick history of the gtx brand it first popped up all the way back in june of 2005 as part of the g47 series back then it was less of a brand and more of a designation to let people know they were getting a high-end card as the first ever gtx card the geforce 7800 gtx set users back a princely 600 bucks oh that hurts but outperformed all other cards at launch in demanding games of the time such as battlefield 2 and halflife 2 big era for twos we first saw the more modern geforce gtx followed by a number branding with the gtx 260 and 280 released in june 2008 and gtx continued to represent the mid-range to high end of the market all the way through the release of the geforce 10 series in 2016 with lower-end models getting different designations like gt or gts however there was a significant shift in branding in 2018 when nvidia unveiled its now familiar rtx branding which was created to indicate that a gpu had extra ray tracing hardware built in all of nvidia's mid-range and high-end cards that used the new turing architecture and featured ray tracing became part of the rtx 2000 lineup while lower-end and mid-range touring gpus that didn't feature rate tracing instead became part of the gtx 1600 stack to make it clear that while these cards did have the new generations architecture they didn't have ray tracing or other bells and whistles like dlss due to the lack of ray tracing and tensor cores but since then we haven't gotten any gtx cards based on the newer amper or love lace architectures which are rtx only so why exactly does it seem like nvidia has just given up on producing non rtx cards we'll tell you more right after we thank msi for sponsoring this video msi qd oled monitors are here and they're loaded with features that are sure to catch your i get it m msi okay anyways these new monitors are equipped with a 0.03 gray to gray response time up to a blistering 360 hz refresh rate and some even have type-c ports for alternative connection options with pass through charging and in terms of support they come with a three-year burn-in warranty and their oled care 2.0 technology plus some models are also firmware updatable check out msi's qd oled monitors at the link below although realtime rate tracing was seen as wildly impractical in a consumer graphics card for a split their branding but in addition to that it turns out that lower end gpus actually aren't particularly high margin products and it's not like gamers were exactly lining up to buy discret cards much lower down the product ladder than say a gtx 1650 so it made sense for nvidia to incorporate their much b hooded features into their more value oriented but still viable for gaming products like the rtx 3050 and rtx 4060 and just forgo having a separate non rtx product lineup that didn't really have an obvious place anymore although it will take some time for aib partners to put the remaining gtx 1600 series gpus onto the cards themselves and get them onto the consumer market you'll probably see the last ones leaving the factory later in 2024 maybe one day one of the last ever gtx cards will be worth some money if you keep yours mint in the box can't make any promises though but i promise you i'm so happy that you got here to the end thanks for watching hey like the video if you liked it dislike the video if you disliked it check out our video on nvidia's first everever gpu the old ones and comment below with video suggestions hey and also i just remembered don't forget to subscribe and follow i'm a little sleepy
