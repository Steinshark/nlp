hey what is up guys mkbhd here and welcome to your first look at the iphone 11 pro and the iphone 11 pro max so the roman numerals are gone and these are apple's new flagship iphones so there is already a video up on the iphone 11 the much less expensive iphone for the masses that i think most people will be buying that'll be the first link below the like button i go over all the new features and the more basics and things like that these new phones are nine ninety nine and ten ninety nine to start and they go up from there so they're very expensive and they also put pro in the name which i have mixed feelings about i get it but i have mixed feelings about it ok so what is new well you can clearly see the design is already nearly identical to the 10s and 10's macs same sizes so there are really four main things you need to know here display battery cameras and the matte finish actually start with the matte finish that's it's the most obvious the glass on the back of these pro iphones is now this sort of frosted i would say a very slight texture and a matte finish to it and i absolutely love it and then the camera square weirdly goes back to glossy so it's like the opposite of the cheaper iphone 11 which is a glossy phone with a matte camera square i just kind of wish the whole back of this phone was matte but maybe that's just me they don't have a matte black but they do have a matte space gray along with a midnight green which is like this subtle dark green almost military camo type of green and then there's a silver which looks very bright and gold which is the most familiar one so yeah matte dark grey well it actually might scratch more easily not sure yet only time will tell i gotta use the phone and put his through its paces but matte dark grey i think first impression love that okay so display now if you told me there's gonna be a new iphone pro this year with a pro display i would just assume that you meant it was gonna have 120 hertz high refresh rate promotion display it does not have that but it is a bit of an improvement from the iphone 10s so it's now even brighter bringing a peak brightness up to a ridiculous 1200 nits and creating a 2 million to 1 contrast ratio so awesome numbers and it's the same resolution oled same sizes same notch and everything very familiar-looking display but it's now even more impressive for watching movies and editing photos and videos that type of thing it's a better screen 3d touch is also now gone but i and i think many others weren't really using it much anyway and it's replaced with long presses instead of pressure-sensitive presses they're called haptic presses and they do pretty much all the same things they're calling this new display super retina display xd are so if you're into name-dropping you can call it that i'm just gonna call it a brighter display then there's the battery so on stage apple claimed 4 hours more battery life than the iphone 10s and on the the 11 pro max 5 hours more battery than the 10s max that is a huge improvement and as really isn't coming from much physically larger battery from the previous phone a lot of these improvements are coming from the improved efficiency of the a13 bionic chip inside so not only is it a much more powerful chip like we said in the iphone 11 video but it is much more efficient too and that's where your battery games will come from i mean of course i will have to test these claims and put it to use and see how good it really is but i'm really happy about those claims of much better battery life and speaking of power it now comes with an' watt fast charger in the box finally iphone pro it took a while it took a pro phone to get that but if you want that fast charger in the box the iphone 11 the cheaper one doesn't get that and it is usb type-c to lightning so yeah step in the right direction so that's the matte finish the display and the battery which brings us to the one thing that they spent by far the most time on and that's the new cameras so triple cameras on the back here for the iphone 11 pro and pro max it joins the three camera club so one normal camera one 2x telephoto and 120-degree ultra wide and you can switch between the three of them in the with the buttons if you want or with a slider that sort of gracefully moves between all three focal lengths and they made a big deal about how they wanted to match the quality as well as possible between these three cameras which i really hope is true that sounds great you can do 4k 60fps video from all three cameras which is dope and you can choose to do portrait mode from either the telephoto or the normal camera which is awesome i'm definitely going to choose portrait mode from the standard primary camera way more often now that i'll have that choice and yet we can just generally look forward to better images and better videos coming from computational photography high dynamic range and all sorts of image pipeline improvements that make this quote pro level photo and video camera and then there's a couple other little things i mentioned in like in the last video like better face id and slightly improved water resistance and a little bit more shadow resistant glass but aside from that that's basically it for the iphone 11 pro so when you hear that you don't necessarily think oh there's a whole ton of things at all stacked and added up to make this worthy of a pro level name but it really just feels like they added the pro name because that's what's hot right now maybe that's a maybe that's a rant for a whole nother video but like all these other features they could have added that would have made me think it's fine to name it pro aren't there like there's no reverse wireless charging there is no high refresh straight promotion display there is no usb type-c that would have been kind of pro there is no apple pencil support there is no in display fingerprint reader there isn't even any like special little bits of software that are tossed in to the pro version to make it at least feel more pro kind of like they did with ipad os on the ipad pro like if you're not gonna do any of that apple you know what i've at least felt a little more pro on the pro iphone but you have a big camera focus on putting the camera settings in the camera app instead of keeping them buried separately in the settings app little things like that possibly the most basic thing they could have done really here to show that they're thinking about pros that take all kinds of photos and videos but that's not here either so it's not like yeah it's not a bad phone at all honestly this is probably going to be one of the best performing phones of the whole year might have some of the best battery life of any phone this year and on top of that it'll probably have one of the best displays and i just frickin love that and that finish but i guess it's just my expectation of the word pro that makes me feel like i should expect a bit more on top of that but i guess that's just me that's just the way i feel bottom line here is this to sell you this phone apple is banking on you wanting to take the best photos or videos of any phone they want this to be the best camera in any smartphone it's clear from the presentation and any ad you watch and if you take a lot of videos i think it will be now for photos that's debatable you know the pixel 4 is right around the corner while ways new flagship is about to come out so that's a tougher sell but this this pro iphone upgrade is all about these cameras and as a camera nerd i do love that even if it looks like a kitchen stove on the corner of your phone either way let me know what you think also definitely check out that iphone 11 overview video for a feature overview and to see all those sweet colors but that's been your first look at the iphone 11 pro thanks for watching this one and i catch you guys later peace
