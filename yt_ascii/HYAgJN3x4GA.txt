in this video we'll be deriving an efficient way of determining whether or not at some point p lies within the triangle abc pay attention to this diagram as i move point p around as you can see the blue line represents a facts are pointing from a to b while the red line is a vector pointing from a to c together they describe the position of point p relative to point a perhaps this is a little clearer if i show the red vector starting from the end of the blue vector vector is controlled by a weight variable called w1 and the length of the red vector is controlled by w2 when both of these values are zero that means that point p is at a if i move point p over to b then you'll see that w1 is equal to 1 and w 2 is equal to 0 if i move p over to point c this would of course be the other way around okay so this is an interesting way of describing the position of point p but how does it help us with our task well notice that if i move the point out past the edge ac then w1 becomes negative if i move the point out the other side then w2 becomes negative and if i move the point out past edge bc then w1 plus w2 will add up to be greater than 1 so if we can figure out the values for w1 and w2 we have a very easy way of determining whether or not p is inside the triangle let's write an equation for the coordinates of point p so we can say p is equal to a plus w1 multiplied by b minus a but w 2 multiplied by c minus a so this is just a mathematical representation of what we saw in the diagram i'm now going to write this equation after again twice once for the x axis and once the y axis i'll then rearrange the second equation to get w2 isolated on the left we can then easily take this expression for w 2 and substitute it into the first equation to get a new equation with only one unknown w 1 our task now is to isolate w 1 on the left side of this equation this would be fairly straightforward algebra although of course having this many variables it is quite easy to make a mistake so let's work through this methodically i'll first get rid of this fraction by multiplying everything by c y minus a why i've also multiplied these terms inside the brackets by cx minus ax as you can see over here a len transfer b terms involving w1 over onto the left hand side and take this p x term and put that on the right hand side we can then reduce these two w 1 variables to just a single w one variable by enclosing all of this here in brackets to complete our task of isolating w 1 we can now just divide through by this bit highlighted in red we can now of course substitute this expression for w 1 into our equation for w 2 to be able to find the value of w 2 as well with these two equations we can now see that point p is inside the triangle if w 1 is greater than or equal to 0 and w 2 is also greater than or equal to 0 and w 1 plus w 2 is less than or equal to 1 alright that is everything for this video cheers
