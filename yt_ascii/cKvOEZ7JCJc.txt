hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be talking about the difference between boost threshold and turbo lag two terms which i think are often confused with one another and we'll get started talking about what is boost threshold so this is the engine speed at which you have sufficient exhaust gas flow in order to create boost boost of course being when your intake manifold pressure is above atmospheric pressure so here we have a simple depiction of a turbocharged engine and basically that piston is going to be moving up and down as it moves faster you're flowing a more gas through the exhaust and eventually that's enough gas to spool up this turbocharger and then pull an air so that rpm at which you're producing enough exhaust gas to start this turbocharger spooling up and producing positive intake manifold pressure that is your boost threshold now if we're to look at you know the intake flow going into an engine. that's equal to its displacement multiplied by the rpm you're spinning at multiplied by the volumetric efficiency divided by two that's the number of crankshaft rotations you have per intake stroke so as an example if we were to have a 2.0l engine spinning at 4,000 rpm with 100% volumetric efficiency at 4,000 rpm it would be producing 4,000 litres a minute that it would be pulling in in order to use for combustion so if you were to look at your exhaust gas flow versus rpm it's going to be basically a nice linear line assuming you have a 100% volumetric efficiency and then once you start to build boost this volumetric efficiency increases so if you're about 15 psi volumetric efficiency is now 200 percent rather than 100 percent so very quickly the amount of gas that you're pushing through the exhaust is going to increase and so you're going to see a difference in the curve where you're now producing so much more exhaust flow that that's going to spool up that turbocharger and very quickly you're gonna have significantly more airflow going through it so that is boost threshold now moving on to turbo lag this is the time delay above boost threshold when you are operating at an rpm high enough that you can create boost the time delay between when you open up the throttle from closed to when you actually start to receive boost so the order looking at an engine right here first of all you have your throttle closed but let's say you're operating at 4,000 rpm and your boost threshold is 3,000 rpm you're well above what you need to be in order to create that boost so you press the throttle pedal you open it up it starts to then you know intake more air more air flows more exhaust gases through the turbocharger that starts to spool up your turbocharger you start pulling in more air and then eventually that air passes through this intake through the intercooler through the throttle body into your intake manifold into your engine and eventually you do start to create boost that time delay is what turbo lag is now if you are operating an engine you know in this lower rpm where you aren't above the boost threshold and you floor it you may think okay? i've got this enormous amount of turbo lag because it takes until 4000 rpm when in reality you just don't have enough gas flow in order to spool that turbo up so there's a bit of a difference. i think a good example is the previous generation subaru wrx where you know below about 3500 rpm 3000 rpm, you won't create any boost so you can floor it and nothing happens you have to be above that in order to actually feel the boost and feel that torque coming in and then once you are above that the car still does have turbo lag so you floor and you still wait for all of this to occur for the turbo to spool up and then for that intake air to reach the engine so hopefully that kind of gives you a bit of you know a better understanding of what these two terms mean and you know the understanding of how they actually affect how the car performs if you guys have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave them below, thanks for watching! you
