recently the people's republic of china banned the export of rare earth magnet production technologies for national security interest note not the particular rare earth magnets themselves the technologies that produce them there are' rare earth elements the 15 lanthanides as well as yetrium scandium and lutidium they have wide technological and commercial uses most of these use cases are small the oec values global rare earth metal compound trade volume in 2021 at about 2.7 billion but they are vital that's why we call them the vitamins of the tech economy but one use case in particular stands out to me over all the others magnets and china's tech export actions hint at their strategic importance in just a few years china won a near complete monopoly on the production of these unexpectedly critical magnet materials and alternatives cannot economically compete in this video let us take a look at the special economic power of these rare earth magnets but first i want to remind you about the newsletter check out the newsletter to read the entire scripts for previously released videos including those you might not have seen before the sign up link is in the video description below i try to put one out every week maybe two alright back to the show magnetism is important because it helps facilitate the conversion of electricity into mechanical energy and vice versa a permanent magnet is a magnet that is always creating its own magnetic field without needing an additional external influence this is in contrast to an electromagnet which uses an external electric current to generate its magnetism because of this permanent magnet based systems offer certain power and space advantages a three millimeter rare earth magnet can produce the same magnetic power as passing 13 amps through a copper coil furthermore an electromagnetic coil can take up to five times more space than a permanent magnet base solution though this is dependent on the engineering permanent magnet based systems have their own shortcomings too but their power and space advantages make them widely used in electric motors hard drives power hand tools lasers and various components for motors and actuation it is estimated that 20 to 35 percent of the world's rare earth production is used for producing permanent magnets for motors for the most part available rare earth supplies are more than sufficient to meet current demand the concern is about handling the coming demand growth from new energy technologies like wind turbines electric generators electric vehicles and so on for instance the international energy agency estimates that demand in the year 2040 will be three to seven times higher than what it was in 2020. we have known about magnets for millennia but these powerful permanent magnets are recent inventions up until the 20th century the best permanent magnets we had available for commercial use were high carbon steels tungsten steels and later cobalt steels then in 1932 the japanese scientist tokoshichi mishima announced the discovery of a class of iron-based magnet alloys known as alniko magnets called as such because they're mostly made from iron plus aluminum nickel and cobalt alniko magnets were cheaper than cobalt steel and had coercivity many times better than the best cobalt magnets deals coercivity measures how well a magnet can sustain its magnetism in the presence of another magnetic field practically speaking how hard it is to demagnetize alniko magnets were soon joined by the ferrite magnets which first hit the market in the 1950s they are not as powerful as the el nico magnets but are way cheaper and have even higher coercivity these magnets dominated the permanent magnet market until the arrival of the rare earth magnets so now it is time that we bring the rare earths into the story as you might have heard most of these rare earth materials are not actually that rare this has long been known they shouldn't be called rare earths more like dispersed and not so rare earths they are actually quite abundant in fact depending on your metric i'm using the estimates made by kenneth bar balance on environmentalchemistry.com cerium is the 25th or 27th most common element in the earth's crust at about 68 parts per million so literally speaking cerium is more common than copper and three times more common than lead neodymium is a little bit more rare but not so much so with about 38 parts per million this makes it more common than more frequently mentioned elements like uranium tin arsenic germanium iodine and even nitrogen the nitrogen bit is a bit of a trick though there's way more nitrogen in the air than in the crust anyway these rare earth elements are realm the big problem is economically extracting and refining those reserves into something useful the first known refinement of a rare earth's element was performed by the swedish chemist carl gustav mosander he took a mineral called serite dissolved it in acid and then tried to separate out the various elements this method allowed him to discover lanthanum in'39 an impurity in cerium nitrate over the decades refinement technology improved in'75 scientists could produce cerium and lanthanum metals using electrolysis these efforts were spurred along in the'80s when we discovered the first significant commercial use for a rare earth element the incandescent light mantle the mantle is a metal fabric bag that gets heated in a flame once it enters into the flame it shines very brightly in the visible spectrum such mantles were commonly made from rare earth oxides and salts like thorium and cerium oxide this use case was not particularly big but in 1903 mantle inventor carl r von welsh back and austrian patented an alloy for sparking those lamps this alloy was made from 30 iron and 70 mish metal which itself is a mixture of the rare earth's cerium lanthanum and neodymium the alloy is no longer necessary for general lighting as it used to be but is still utilized has the flint in disposable lighters coming up to the 1940s many chemists tried to refine these elements using chemical methods like thermal reactions fractional crystallization and fractional precipitation the rare earth's elements tend to have very similar chemical traits especially their solubility for this reason these classical methods as they are now called can still work for a specific element or two but are generally acknowledged to do iffy work in 1942 researchers at the ames laboratory of iowa state university discovered a new set of methods to refine these rare earths at scale from their intermediate ores we call them the modern methods the lab was founded by rare earth expert frank spedding at the behest of the us government to produce pure uranium for the manhattan project ames soon however branched off into metallurgy and other materials research including rare earths there researchers discovered the ion exchange method the ion exchange method uses an ion exchanger substance an oxide or a resin to essentially swap the ions it has with the ions in a particular mixture in doing so we are separating out rare earth element ions ion exchange had been used in the manhattan project and was released to the science community in 1947. then in 1950 three american researchers advanced the use of solvent extraction to refine thorium and rare earths solvent extraction pulls out a particular element out of a liquid by relying on differences in the solubility of substances between itself and another liquid this is an immense simplification the actual process can have hundreds of repetitive steps each using an immense amount of chemicals and water solvent extraction has turned out to be far more scalable though we know little about how companies actually do it ion exchange is today only used for specific unique situation rare earths for electronics needs sweden norway australia and south africa were early sources for cerium and other rare earths but not particularly good ones but then in 1949 the u.s bureau of mines discovered a large deposit at mountain pass california about 50 miles away from las vegas the mountain pass mine was and still is north america's only economically competitive rare earths mine the mine is single-handedly responsible for stabilizing rare earth prices from 1958 to 1971 growing in line with american economic growth at one point it produced over 90 percent of the world's supply the wide availability of the rare earths allowed us to find new applications for them for instance in the late 1960s we discovered that adding rare earth silicides gave us high strength low alloy steel a stronger and more corrosive resistant steel than carbon steels then in the 1960s scientists at wright-patterson air force base discovered the first big rare earth magnet a combination of the rare earth samarium with the transition metal cobalt sumerian cobalt magnets dominated the market for several decades until political unrest in the democratic republic of the congo disrupted global cobalt supplies in the late 1970s researchers in the united states and japan looked for cobalt-free alternatives thus coming across a new more powerful magnet the neodymium iron boron magnet discovered independently in 1983 by sumitomo later hitachi medals and general motors this magnet saw better commercial adoption because it was stronger and neodymium and iron are far more plentiful than samarium and cobalt production quickly expanded in the late 1980s has hard drive makers adopted it for use in their products it is used for motors and engines as well though manufacturers often need to add another rare earth element dysprosium to help it tolerate higher temperatures in 1985 american demand for rare earths collapsed after new environmental legislation removed lead from gasoline at that time the biggest demand consumption for these rare earths was for petroleum fluid cracking catalysts these fluids are used by refineries to convert petroleum into gasoline and other goods at the same time new rare earth sources were discovered over in the people's republic of china the most significant of which is the majestic bayern ebola mine in china's inner mongolia is the world's largest known rare earth's mine the gawar oil field of rare earths it was first explored and developed in 1927 as an iron mine but in 1935 geologists discovered rare earth minerals monzonite and bass the nasite at the mine starting in the 1960s the chinese government sought to extract those rare earths out of them is a rather complicated mishmash of up to 14 rare earth minerals so it took 20 years to figure out how to separate them which involves among other things a complicated processing step known as rare earth dressing or ore dressing in 1979 the bao toll research institute of rare earths discovered an acid roasting process where we cooked the minerals alongside an acid like sodium hydroxide in order to decompose them into simpler compounds it is only after this is done that we can employ a method like ion exchange or solvent extraction to pull the elements themselves out of the intermediate compounds in 1980 china exported the first rare earths purified via ion exchange to japan which attracted a great deal of attention from 1979 to 1989 rare earth output grew at 40 percent a year their scale not only allowed the chinese to produce more product at lower cost but also make them at industry-leading purities in 2002 the mountain pass mine closed due to economic pressures leaving the chinese with an extraction monopoly the mountain pass mine has recently reopened due to american concerns about supply chain resiliency especially regarding products that eventually go into defense systems though ironically most of those raw materials are still shipped over to china for refining china's mining dominance sparked a brain drain other players up and down the rare earth supply chain relocated out of the united states and japan into china an example of this is magna quench an american defense contractor that produces neodymium iron boron magnet powder in 2003 they moved their entire operations to singapore closing their indianapolis office then in 2004 they shut down their last factory fired 450 workers and shipped all the machine tools to china they're not alone in 2011 even hitachi medals then the world leader in magnet production shifted their production to china in response to china's export bans on rare earths particularly dysprosium you might then think that these companies still do magnet related r d in the u.s right however a patent analysis done on rare earth-related research found a decline in american-based rare earth's patents while non-american patent filings surged today the most widely sold rare earth magnet is the neodymium iron boron magnet the sumerian cobalt magnet comes second the rare earths are critical and valuable component for both these magnus contributing just 20 percent of the weight but 30 to 50 percent of its overall value china's technology export restrictions on rare earth magnet refinement and production are reminders of its continued grip on parts of the value chain outside of simple extraction their minds might produce less of the global supply as new mines in australia or vietnam come online but chinese facilities still refine and manufacture over 90 percent of the world's rare earth magnets china's 2015 magnet production reached 126 000 tons a near 50 times increase from its 2 550 tons in 1997. and these are world-class high quality magnets across a wide range of specs and an extremely competitive prices having access to plentiful amounts of rare earths lets the chinese extend their manufacturing and innovation advantages for example the creation of cerium magnets that replace neodymium with the more plentiful cerium cutting down material costs this industry growth is fueled and strengthened by china's burgeoning demand for new energy systems like wind turbines and electric vehicles beyond the geopolitical concerns we might not want to stake the entirety of our green energy future on neodymium and dysprosium for one thing these rare earths are expensive a practical rare earth-free system would have material cost savings in the range of 30 to 66 percent another thing is that removing them would substantially improve the technology's greenness greenhouse gases calculations are very fuzzy so take this with a grain of salt the one analysis published in 2015 notes that the neodymium iron boron magnet with dysprosium added can make up to 30 percent of the greenhouse contribution in an electric motor despite being just five percent of the weight judging the full environmental impact of these processes is challenging as we don't have deep visibility into their production much of what is done in a trade secrets like with semiconductor manufacturing so what should we do one option is to reduce the amount of rare earths used in the magnet itself particularly in dysprosium which is far rarer than neodymium but is necessary in order for the magnet to operate properly at higher temperatures a second option would be recycling some 99 of the rare earth scrap from old hard drives evs and wind turbines is simply discarded the neodymium iron boron magnet recycling technologies are undeveloped and currently economically infeasible in other words the yields aren't great and we don't have enough scrap right now to make the work worthwhile and the political legal and logistical shortcomings are also significant it is a similar issue as to recycling ev batteries do we have a good way of putting these back into the ecosystem at scale alniko and ferrite magnets used to be the dominant permanent magnets in the market before the rare earth magnets came along can they be modified to replace the rare earth magnets but unfortunately alniko magnets suffer a high risk of demagnetization in other words low corrosivity this makes them unlikely candidates for high power density electric machines ferrite magnets are far weaker than the rare earth magnets there are only a tenth as strong and they also suffer low coercivity but interestingly their coercivity rises at higher temperatures that gives them an advantage over the neodymium iron boron magnet which suffers the opposite with some careful engineering to avoid demagnetization we can produce some workable motors news recently came out in december 2022 that hitachi metals the original inventor of the neodymium iron boron magnet is working on ferrite-based magnet alternatives the fact they're working on it and feel comfortable enough to announce it i think means something it should also be noted that china is the world leader in alniko and ferrite magnet production but they don't have as strong a hold on it with a 50 share in alniko and 60 share in ferrites motors without permanent magnets do exist for items like cars and wind turbines we can use an induction machine or asynchronous motor these use an electric current to generate the necessary magnetism to operate properly wind turbines are more ideal for these induction machines since we have fewer space concerns but they can work in cars too tesla famously used a copper induction machine for their model s car but then switched to a permanent magnet base system for the model 3. in march 2023 they announced that their new ev motors would not have any rare earth magnets in them perhaps they're using ferrites two other electromagnetic based motor families exist and will have high potential wound rotor motors and switched reluctant rotors renault has used the former for the renault zoe cars perhaps someday a game-changing alternative can be brought to the market people are working to make it happen and i commend them for it alternatives are necessary but right now not enough people care and permanent magnets are still the most economically viable option china's big wind turbine and electric vehicle industries represent huge demand markets that will continue to drive innovation much like the computer assembly markets of asia drove semiconductor innovation downstream so for now i think china's grip on the permanent magnet market is unshakable all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the channel sign up for the newsletter and i'll see you guys next time
