[music] hey what's up guys mkbhd here and welcome to the iphone 10 revisited so the iphone 10 release date was around six months ago so half a year it's midway between the cycle and of course when it first comes out there's a ton of hype everyone's riding high on that hype of the newly designed fresh once in a generation iphone 10. even at that time for a thousand bucks at the end of my review i did say for people who know what they're getting into it's probably worth it now that that hype has died down though and we've actually used it and put it through its paces and had our fair share of issues or non-issues this is time to revisit if it's worth the thousand bucks or not so really all the story is about that design you know finally a new iphone with a different design after year after year after year of the same thing for more than a decade our intention has been to create an iphone that is all display a physical object that disappears into the experience [music] this is iphone 10. so really after hearing all this from apple kind of feels like okay this is the way things are going to be from now on you know this is the beginning of the future of the iphone from here on out we're going to have these bezel-less screens we're going to have this top of the line state-of-the-art tech again finally in the design department so it's worth taking a second look at first of all the name iphone 10. everyone calls it the x so i'd say the name hasn't held up that well but apple doesn't really care about that the same way they didn't care about people calling it the itouch naming is whatever it's the iphone 10 but the hardware it has held up great so this is the second iphone 10 actually that i've carried since it came out and i'll get more into that in a second but every phone wears a little bit different with different materials you get different things happening pixel 2 for example people thought it might stain after a while in white it didn't stain but the coating has worn off and it has this sort of aging scratching thing going on on the side so iphone 10 is glass and stainless steel so it's doing pretty well as expected the glass accumulates small scratches over time just like any other phone that's been normal and the stainless steel band if you carry it naked gets tons of you know little micro scratches no matter how good you take care of it you're gonna put it in and out of your pocket all the time it almost gives it this texture that gradually looks a little bit different day after day from when you had a new phone but still no bend gate or anything this is definitely a well-built phone this is iphone 10 but like i said this is my second iphone 10 and the story of that i've told this before is this i broke it not that i broke it but it was on the top of a counter and it buzzed enough times with notifications to slide to the edge of that counter it is definitely one of the slipperiest phones of all time and eventually it fell off fell about five feet and cracked and shattered the glass now you're not supposed to drop basically any phone from five feet but no matter how durable the glass is like i said in the review a glass phone is still a glass phone it's very much more breakable than things other than glass so that's just the way it is plus it doesn't help that it's super slippery i wouldn't be surprised if this is the number one most cased phone ever anyway the one thing we we pretty much know about apple products is they usually age pretty well i'd say pretty gracefully now six months isn't that much it's half a year so we've gotten a couple ios updates since it came out i expect many more for the couple of years to come apple tends to be pretty good about that i don't have many concerns that iphone 10 will continue to get those and this is also now the first iphone to come out since apple said that they would start allowing people to choose between clock speed performance and battery life that's when the phone starts to age so that'll be interesting to see how it plays out but really when i say it's aged gracefully i mean that like as fast as tech moves now and with the number of phones that have come out since six months ago iphone 10 is definitely still the second or third best smartphone camera on planet earth it's definitely one of the most capable as far as power and will be for a while that a11 bionic is a beast and aesthetically like i've said it has held up well now okay we're six months in and there is no red iphone 10. there's a red iphone 8 and 8 plus and they are really really red and they look great but there's no red iphone 10. i am in the camp that really wishes we had one the best speculation i've heard as to why we don't is they possibly couldn't do the band around the outside the way they wanted to so in the red iphone 8 not only is the glass back this vibrant ferrari red but the aluminum sides of the phone were also matte red to match but the iphone 10 has stainless steel sides so the guess is that they couldn't find the process to make these stainless steel bands as red as they wanted to it's obviously darker on the space gray iphone and lighter on the silver but red would have been nice so i don't blame them for i guess maybe not wanting to do red back dark band and actually that kind of would have that would have looked pretty nice you know what i take it all back i actually kind of would have wanted to see a black side band with the red back apple either way today we still have the space gray and the silver i actually personally like the silver to carry more because it shows less fingerprints apple never really shows like the sales numbers of which one sells more i would venture to guess it's not a big difference so okay what what about the problems that we've had what about the downsides of iphone 10 well from the review the holding up the phone to the side and getting your finger in the corner of the photo you're taking that stopped real quick tons of phones now have those cameras in a vertical stack now it's basically become the standard in the last couple months so that's no problem lock screen controls that's something i talked about still can't be changed but that's an ios thing i didn't expect a ton of customization to just be added so that's no surprise it is what it is just like ios's notifications just like no headphone jack just like all the other stubborn little things about the iphone that's just the iphone you get used to it all the gestures i definitely got used to them they didn't take long to kind of rely on as they become like my new default for interacting with an iphone it feels more natural for a display that goes right up to the edges to have swiping gestures from the edges so it starts off as this really convoluted complex system but with the small bezels it actually feels more correct but then face id face id i've gotten used to but it is definitely still my most frustrating part of iphone 10 and i venture to say i'm probably not alone so it hasn't gotten faster and with this first gen hardware i don't really think it's going to get much faster i think it's about optimized for what we have so that just means there's always going to be that split second delay for unlocking your phone it's not even that long it's not even half a second it's a split second but it's longer than touch id so you notice it and i still notice it but what's more annoying is just when my phone is on a table just on a table in front of me when it's off axis like this like most of my day when my phone is on my desk in front of me having to lean into the frame for the phone to kind of see your face is kind of annoying i think the only way for apple to solve this would be just by making the array of dots wider angle or just a little bit more downward facing for some reason that's still something i haven't really adapted to or gotten used to it still annoys me so it's face id when the phone is on a table could be better and then the notch the glorious infamous top notch i got used to this notch pretty quick as i said in the review it just kind of faded away since it's not a major part of the ui most of the time and as you've seen many others have added a notch to their phones since then and many will continue to do so i made a whole video on the state of bezels in 2018 bezels and notches definitely worth a click now on iphone 10 it's a big notch like there's no way around it i don't watch videos full screen with the notch in there i actually shrink them down so i don't miss anything that's just the way it is now pretty much every app i use now has been updated in a way so they just embrace the notch it's just blank space ios developers have always been pretty damn responsive so that's awesome but at the end of the day it is a big notch and i wish it was smaller but since they are pushing for this whole bezel-less future and you do have a really tiny bezel around the whole rest of the phone i don't mind it but that actually naturally brings me to the conclusion which is what about the next iphone like we just have a lot of people just bought this phone which is you know this new form factor it's got the notch at the top it's full screen bezel-less but they just paid a thousand bucks for it and there's a very low chance that people spend a thousand bucks two years a row on a new phone so what's apple going to do with iphone 11 i guess is what it's probably going to be called 11. there hasn't really been a whole lot of leaks about this next iphone in fact all we really got was a leaked internal memo about leaks which is kind of amazing but really it's inevitable that we get a new iphone in september and we're wondering what apple's gonna do with it but as of right now i'm hoping for two main things one a bigger screen version and two a smaller notch i can't stress enough this notch is huge compared to others in fact iphone 10 might have right now the biggest notch of any phone that has one tons of phones have come out with smaller and smaller notches i have no choice but to hope that the sensor technology improves and we can make a much smaller notch on iphone 11 and then i say a bigger screen version like iphone 10 is about the size of iphone 8. it would be awesome to have a phone the size of iphone 8 plus that's also off screen so we kind of have this sort of a lineup of a medium and large iphone 11 maybe throw an iphone sc2 in there somewhere we've had all kinds of rumors about the way it might line up but at the end of the day that's what i'm hoping for is those two main things i gotta say iphone 10 has held up really well which is not easy to do the thing is it's at the top of a really premium category the 800 900 price point this is not an impulse buy for most people getting it but i think the people who are buying it who know what they're getting into are willing to accept the little flaws the little things that are stubborn about the iphone that aren't quite all there and it's been pretty great for the most part so i think a lot of people are still satisfied so let me know what you think have you picked up an iphone 10 are you waiting for iphone 11 or are you somewhere in between let me know what your thoughts are until the next one thanks for watching talk to the next one peace
