- do you know what time it is? - [jared] is it wishtery tech time? - ooh, yeah that might be the most
annoying intro we've ever done. (jared laughs) are you feeling lucky? - [jared] i'm feeling lucky. - we always gotta start with
a blitz buy and 50 items. 50 items, that's... - [jared] too many. we can't buy all 50. - [austin] optical 2.4 gigahertz,
foldable wireless mouse. - [jared] dude, you have
to get the z flip mouse. - four bucks. okay. 3.5 jack mini microphone is a microphone that plugs into the
microphone jack on your pc. it looks like a boom mic. - [jared] what in the? what? - dollar 68 though. how could i go wrong? the wish algorithm has read my mind, knows that if i'm not
thinking about pokemon cards, thinking about my z flip. i got a folding hinge, pretection, magnetic kickstand case for z flip 3. what color should it get? green, black, pink, purple,
wheat or white. wheat? - [jared] white it is. hey austin, your shoes are
looking a little dirty. - wishtery tech yeezys. - [jared] well, did you
find something good? - [austin] got fake boobs for some reason? - [jared] oh, that's a good alternative. - i found some sport-550s for 14 bucks and the black and
white's actually not bad. it doesn't look very yeezy though. but then again, i guess
i'm not trying to fake it, i'm just trying to make it. - oh.
- oh. - this is cool. okay. okay. okay. so the upgraded, ultra thin card, 2.4 inch handheld video game console. now what's getting me
here is this thumbnail 'cause this thing is about
as thick as a micro usb port. it looks super, super thin. also clear screen. they blurred the screen,
they called it clear screen. - [jared] what? - 19 bucks, rechargeable battery. let's give it a shot. (austin guffaws) - [jared] oh no. amd-
- oh. - xfs, not xfs.
- uh-oh - rx 570 gpu box. (both laugh) $3, man. you're a gen z'er. is that fair to say? - [jared] i...sure, i will take that. - did you ever have a mood
ring when you were growing up? - [jared] oh yes. - what ring size? - [jared] austin, you're married. anyone should know this, it's you? yeah, that's the right size. - [austin] nine, a dual
cooling fan attachment for the xbox series x. - [jared] oh, oh, we don't...no. - eight bucks. think about it, jared. my xbox series x runs
three to five degrees warmer than i'd like. - [jared] i will let you have this. - thanks jared. appreciate you. thanks for supporting me. a hadskable switch for 266 bucks. $266 actually is a reasonable price for a refurbished switch,
but what's hadskable? - [jared] norwegian for trust
me and buy this product. - i'm feeling pretty good now. we might just have all the things we need for this episode of wishtery tech. hey, jared. - what's up? - [austin] i got you something. - what is this? - [austin] oh, you'll find out. (carnival music) - what is this? why are you giving this to me? - [austin] i just, i saw
it and i thought about you. - how do i look? - [austin] you look
like i need to make sure your girlfriend never sees this video. - you know, the most
awkward part about this is that my grandmother's dead. (explosion booms) (both laugh) - yo. i caught that one and
you better be impressed. shoes from the artist
formally known as kenny east. - [woman] is now kanye west. - so let me get rid of these adidas. - [matt] i like how you
just went down three inches when you took off those shoes. - yeah, matt, it's called
taking your shoes off. - [ken] do they smell like wish? - payless.
- payless. - payless.
- yeah. yeah. i figured. - you think kanye would
sign my fake yeezys? - [matt] nope, no. - look at this. look at this. look at the style i've
got right now, friends. look at that. $40. wish.com. all right. i've actually finally learned
how to do something well, which is to catch packages. so as we all know, the
xbox series x is a console that through all of the
the hard hours of work that the microsoft engineers put in, clearly is in need of a cooling fan. okay, so it has two
little fans on it, right? and it's powered by a usb port
on the back of the console. so if i plug it in
here, you do lose a usb. i mean, it does fit pretty well. you still have access to
all of your other ports. so let's see how loud the
series x is from the front. so it is about 40
decibels, which to be fair, there's definitely, like
this room is not dead silent. now i'm going to turn on the fan. about 45 decibels. it is loud. i cannot with my ears, i
cannot hear the series x when it's running in normal circumstances, until it gets really, really warm, and even then it's still pretty quiet. this fan, i can 100% hear without a doubt. like it's just properly loud. all right. so this is economy, is the
only description on this one. - [ken] yeah, that's the whole economy. - it's the whole economy?
- yeah. - so that means it's inflating every minute as it floats away? plug and drive obd 2
economy chip tuning box. 15% fuel save for benzene cars. i've wanted to try one
of these for a long time because these sell. i see them every time we do wishtery tech. how much was this, matt? - [matt] $8, when you factor in shipping. - this is without a
doubt absolutely a scam. now that my cars ecu has been remapped, let's see how much of a
difference it really makes. (car revs) - [ken] you didn't even test anything. - there was so much extra
power, i couldn't even help it. i think i just saved myself
like a hundred miles per gallon. - [ken] in what world? - i'm gonna go and save some more fuel. i'll see you later. (car vrooms) what? are you just
giving me all the items? - [ken] rapid fire. - i'm gonna go with the big one first. oh, it did show up. my galaxy z flip 3 case from wish.com. i truly believe it is the greatest device ever crafted by human hands, which is why i'm going to cover it up with this ugly purple
case that cost me $7. - [matt] way more than that. - $13. - [matt] way more than that. - $24. - [matt] $21. - mm. okay. - [ken] you could have
bought a real case for that. - i will say this is
now the chunkiest device that has ever been crafted. i love my z flip, so i'm not gonna carelessly
toss this around the room, but what i will do, i'll do a pocket test. and that looks like a
normal z flip, right? - [ken] z flip fade right there. mm. - people doubt me that i
use a z flip every day. well, my pants don't lie. - [matt] i just don't like that. - okay. we've got the ring. - [ken] oh. oh. - matt, do you take this ring to... - oh no, wait. (austin laughs) - is this actually tech? - [matt] no, it literally
says mood ring, fyi. - oh wait, there's a screen. there's a screen, matt. - [matt] 34 is showing up now. so it's showing us that
like the body temperature. so you would know if i had a fever. - i look at your ring. hey ken, you look a little clammy today. let me check your ring to see if you- - i look a little clammy. - this, my friends, is a microphone. now the photo on wish showed
this plugged into your laptop. this is gonna be great. oh, it doesn't even see it. so this does not work on my laptop. huh? i'm gonna try this going into a phone. so this is what it sounds like to use this high quality wish microphone connected to my phone via an adapter. so this isn't what it sounds like to use this high quality wish microphone connected to my phone via an adapter. all right and this is what it sounds like just using the microphone on my phone. is there any difference at all or did we just get scammed by wish? all right, and this is what it sounds like just using the microphone on my phone. is there any difference at all or did we just get scammed by wish? - [matt] i still think that
you were using the phone- - the phone microphone. matt, this 100% doesn't work. no, ken, we don't even
have to test anymore. it's a bipole, it's not a tripole. - [ken] that's what we're
trying to say. that's what- - it's literally not
connected to anything. - [matt] yeah. yeah. - wait, wait, wait. (high pitched buzz) test. test. test. - oh, god.
- test. - oh god, it sounds awful. (high pitched buzz) - hello and welcome. that sounds horrible. that had a little bit more
of a meaty thud to it. oh my goodness. it finally happened. i've been trying to purchase game consoles on wish for years now. is this actually a nintendo switch or is this a brick inside a box? (rocks thud) so they obviously have
resealed it, which is fine. yeah. fair enough. this does look like a red box switch. doesn't have any more performance
than any other switch. what it does, compared
to the launch switches, is have a whole lot more battery life. so if we really got a
red box switch for $270, that's a pretty reasonable price. - woo, okay, we've got
an actual switch here and it is a dash oh one, so this is an actual red box switch. okay, we ordered a cheap
nintendo switch on wish and got a essentially brand new switch. this actually might be the time we didn't get scammed on wish. let's go. let's go. we got ourselves a nintendo switch, boys. what are we gonna do with it now? i never make wishtery tech episodes assuming that we actually get
the things we're asking for. i think we can finally say
for the first time in years, we did not get scammed on wish. - [matt] erm, actually. - no, don't take this away from me, matt. - we paid about at
least 30 to $40 too much compared to other outlets
selling the same sku. ebay's got it for 235, 240. walmart's got it for 227. - [ken] i wouldn't call that a scam. i think there are people that would see it and be like, wow, that's
actually not a bad price. it's just, could you do better? yes. but i don't think that's a scam. - you know, you could have
just held your tongues and i would've been really happy. you didn't have to crush
my spirits like this. this, my friends, is a
revolutionary piece of technology. hidden in my hand, you can see a mysterious item of technology. oh look, it's a mouse. $8 well spent, my friends. - [ken] that's the microsoft
arc, but just cheaper. - all right, i now can successfully mouse, and then when i'm done,
straight in the pocket. - [ken] who takes a
mouse with them like that? - you know one problem with this? (plastic cracks) (matt laughs) thanks from watching. i appreciate you. am i just trying to fill time while ken shoots b roll in the background and i've got the camera all to myself? absolutely not. but the thing is, sometimes
it's really important for me to be able to talk to
y'all and have a great time and give you exactly what's on my mind because realistically, it's important that you know that i love
you and care about you and i'm not just begging for you to subscribe to the channel and ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling button. - [matt] i'm gonna go
ahead and dibs on this one. - i remember what this is. - [matt] i've wanted one of these forever. - hello friends. - [matt] oh god. we have daft punk at home. - i am graft dunk. boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. badum, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom. badum, boom, boom, badum, badum. i am basically ready to cameo on madeon's next live show. - [matt] it's just the lowest bar of cool. - what, wearing a wish
shirt with fake yeezys and a visor isn't cool to you, matt? - i will defeat gi joe. (laughs) - what?
- that's all i really wanted. it's gi... score...like. - uh-huh, yeah, go ahead. what were you saying? - the bad guys from gi joe. - oh yeah, yeah, yeah, the
movie i definitely watched. - [matt] no, the cart... - oh yeah, the cartoon. yeah, that one. oh, the mini games player. so this was $30. puts it in a tier of what's
probably gonna be trash. we've got ourselves an on off switch. the a, b, x, y, start, reset, speaker, 2.4 inch display, a very
pleasant green color. i'll say it is so small
that it is not ergonomic. like my fingers and my
hands are basically squished side by side right now to get this. okay, so it does have a
bunch of emulators on it, which is good 'cause i don't think you can actually load anything up. (electronic game music) speaker's not great. space invaders, there we
go, now that, all right. dude, i mean, this is actually loaded up with a lot of fairly decent games. the latency also is really reasonable. i'm legitimately really
surprised with this. it actually is good. 20 bucks. - [matt] it was 20 bucks, but then you pay 10 bucks shipping. - [ken] 30 bucks, not bad. - this is actually, legitimately, one of the best little
emulators i've ever tried. oh, that's heavy. all right, friends. - [matt] we saved the worst for last because everyone would click
away as soon as they saw these. (laughs) - [matt] whoa, whoa. - found some pokemon cards. - [matt] so supposedly,
this was a two pound lot of just trading cards. oh boy. you paid $65. - i did not pay $65 for this. - [matt] no, this is by far
the most expensive thing you paid for other than the switch. - i'm learning some stuff here. see one mans treasure
is another man's trash and i mean the other way around.
