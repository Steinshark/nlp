so if you saw my previous video you'll know that i just got my brand new 16-inch m1 max macbook pro in this video we are going to be testing this thing the mission is to build a basic app with this computer and see how it does compared to my previous one and i am still traveling here in paris this video is basically going to be like a very strange combination of a travel vlog in paris and me coding an app with my new computer whenever i get the chance it could be an absolutely terrible and strange video but it could also be interesting so in one of my previous videos i started using this javascript framework called chart.js to visualize some data it's pretty neat i really liked using it so for this app the idea is to use that framework to visualize the bigger runtime of some algorithms essentially i would allow the user to input a javascript algorithm and then i would run the algorithm for different input sizes and then visually plot the times that it takes to run those algorithms it should be pretty easy to code for simple algorithm display might be very hard to get it to work really well so we'll see how we do so if you're creating a lot of coding projects and you actually want to show them to the world one thing that you definitely should have as a developer is a portfolio website but you might think that building a whole website is something that's very difficult but it's actually not and that's why i'm really excited to talk about today's video sponsor hosting it hosting is a world-class website hosting service with more than 29 million users worldwide and it's honestly the fastest way for you to get a really nice looking website online even if you have no experience building websites before let me just show you how easy it is once you sign up you reach this landing page then all you have to do is click setup and answer a couple of questions around the type of website you want to build and your experience level and whether you want to build it using wordpress or something like html css and javascript and then if you choose wordpress you just choose a theme from here then all you have to do is customize it a bit and then you can have your own amazingly green website even if you've never made a website before and the reason i personally chose hosting here for my website is just because you can have everything that you ever need to build a website in one place and the control panel is extremely easy to use and i also get access to a free email with my new internetmadecode.com domain so that i can separate my personal and business email with no additional cost so if you want yourself a website definitely go to hostinghere.com and use to go internet make order at checkout to get up to 91 percent off thank you for hosting here for sponsoring this video it's time to go [music] so [music] so i've just been doing some work now i had some ideas for my app i've been coding it up and my first impression of this laptop is that it's an absolute beast and for coding purposes it's absolutely overkill like what i had before like the macbook air m1 is absolutely good enough for coding mainly i got this because i also do video editing on this and i do a lot of heavy stuff so i just really needed the power the first thing i'm noticing is just that the screen the screen is like massive and it's not only massive but the quality of this screen is like insane like the color depth or like whatever the technical term is so my current state of this project is that i use these date function in javascript basically get the time when the function starts and then you get the time and the function ends which will then give you the time that it took to execute the function and then i'm going to simply run the function at different sizes of input for now i'm just console logging these things will work properly so i'm going to start making the visualization next probably at first it's only going to allow certain types of functions but yeah that's that's the idea right now [music] wow [music] [applause] [music] i'm not trying to become like casey neistat or anything but come on did you see that day of course i had to run now i'm gonna take a shower and i've got like six no seven hours until i need to go to the airport i'm just gonna try to get some work done and make progress in my coding project i'll do that or alternatively i might just literally fall asleep because i am super tired that's probably what's gonna end up happening yeah that's exactly what ended up happening i ended up oversleeping missing my bus to the airport luckily there was a second one that was still arriving before my flight then essentially i go to the airport i was so ridiculously tired i had no time to finish my app so before i finished editing this video i did manage to almost finish it the only issue i have is that i haven't figured out how i can allow the user to input a function now i'm just running this visualization using some test function for example this one which i know to be a linear time algorithm but nevertheless i did already get hosting for myself of course at today's video sponsor hosting here all i had to do was click on manage then import website zip my files and upload them now what you just saw is live on the internet but the bigger point of this video was to talk about my experiences with the new laptop so let's just talk about that so as i said for programming specifically this thing is absolutely overkill the real reason why i got it was because i need the power for my video editing it literally looks so nice and the screen is so big it's so like the colors are so incredibly deep it's like in general it's much nicer to look at it i've already been finding that i'm more likely to actually start working because working with this computer because it's so insanely powerful just such a pleasure so that's one sort of unexpected benefit that i've been seeing already now obviously i'm in a very fortunate position where i make some money with this channel already so i'm able to use some of that money to fund purchases like this which will then sort of be a reinvestment back into this channel even if that's not the case like if you're using a tool as much as i use a laptop it's worth investing in it anyway those very minor inconveniences like something lagging or your programs taking longer to open if you have to face those annoyances every single day sort of the image that you'll then have in your head of the process of doing that work is that oh i'm gonna have to deal with the lag again like oh this is gonna be annoying whereas if you're working with a computer that's an absolute pleasure to work with your the image that you have in your head of the process of working is that it's actually nice it's like you want to work obviously if you don't have money for a super nice computer then it's absolutely fine you can do coding in anything but if you do have the money if you are able to invest computer i think it's always worth to do but yeah now i am fully in the apple ecosystem completely retired myself built desktop pc you might call me an apple fanboy and you'll be absolutely right i am a bit of an apple fanboy this leak the minimalist and i'm all about like having a nice minimalist whether it's setup or process like not having too much clutter and like that's sort of what apple is all about so that's why i'm such a fan of their products in general i am an apple fanboy but my bank account is definitely crying of the almost 4 000 euros that i spent on this thing thanks for watching all the ads and thanks for hosting and for sponsoring this video but yeah anyway as i said this is really an investment into my coding and in this channel stuff that i do all the time anyway so for me personally this is worth it but for a lot of you honestly one of the cheaper models is probably gonna be much better value for your money there's gonna be a full full thoughts around this macbook video coming soon let me know if you enjoyed this sort of vlog style format this in my previous video a sort of experiments doing more vlog style videos i have no idea if you guys like them so if you do make sure to let me know and if you want to find out why i had to travel all the way to france to get this laptop make sure to watch this video next if you haven't done so already
