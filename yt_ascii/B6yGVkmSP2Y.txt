[music] hey guys today i want to do something kind of fun so if you've ever watched the social network i was just watching it and i paused at the hacking scene and i thought you know i used to be really baffled by this like what the hell is going on i thought wouldn't it be fun to do an episode where we actually do that hacking before i start i want to say he doesn't really hack anything in some essence there is one there's one website he does hack but the rest of them it's just publicly available images and all he does is download those images and he comes up with unique methods in order to download them that's exactly what we're going to do let the hacking begin oh that didn't kind of hurt all right so let's look at some of the things he does he gets drunk which we're not gonna do they come up with the idea to do it don't try this at home let the hacking begin first on the list is kirkland they keep everything open and allow indexes in their apache configuration so a little w get magic is all that's necessary what is indexing indexing is this really simple way of navigating websites now that web technology's come quite a long way most websites in fact like i hardly i don't think i've seen a website in years that allows you to do this but i'm going to create one really quickly see i'm creating a server locally really quickly just so that i can show you exactly what he's talking about it's not on this port it's on this port all right this is what it is this is what it looks like directory for and you can navigate the website like this is the home page this is where the images are are kept and what you see on his is he goes to images or photos female so he can you know specify exactly female that you know that he's looking for i doubt that a website would actually have it based on a mail folder in a female folder it'd probably be more likely to be in like floor one floor two floor 3 but it's a movie child's play next on the list is elliott they're also open with no indexes and apache okay so you can't access the website that way i can run an empty search and it returns all the images in the database in a single page then i can save the page and mozilla will save all the images for me i don't think i have to explain that one he does an empty search gets all the images saves the page lowell has some security they require username password okay i'm not going to read out this whole one this one's pretty is actually pretty cool so what he does is he assumes that lowell doesn't own user information they they don't have like your harvard.edu username password so nowadays you would probably have that but he's assuming that lowell doesn't have access to to the the user's harvard account all lowell knows about is the usernames is the user's username and student number so if a user was to try to enter that site and say hey my username is jason goodison and my harvard password is hunter2 they wouldn't know if the password's hunter2 or not because they don't have access to it so what they do instead is the username is the username and the password is just the student id so that's it so he guesses he he uses somebody else's username and student id which is not which is public information right and he gets in it's a smart guess further in level he says they're separated into different pages all the pictures are separated into different pages he's too lazy to go through and save each one that's fine writing a perl script to take care of it i would use python but yeah that's fine he's basically just you know changing the url so he's going like lowell slash i don't know page one and then he's he's requesting page two and page three he's doing it programmatically instead of having to do it manually that's not that hard you could do that really easily adams has no security but limits number of pages number of results to 20 page all i need to do is break out the same script i use on lowell and we're set again nothing groundbreaking here dunster's intense not only is there no public directory there's no directory at all this may be difficult i'll come back later that one yeah it sounds difficult if there was a different place on the internet where you could find everyone's name that wouldn't be such a big deal because you could search for them programmatically one at a time but when you don't know anyone's name that's that one because becomes really difficult next one they're a little better they still make you search but you can do an empty search and get links to the pages with every student's picture it's slightly obnoxious that they only let you view one picture at a time all right fair enough so he breaks out the same script he just programmatically goes to the links you can use wget to do a lot of this stuff so i'm gonna show you exactly what we're talking about let's go to techintern.com all right so we got this image here this is where the podcast is i mean you can find it on any podcasting app but we host it here too and we got all of these images we've got this image all right let's use wget okay so let's do it we get wget dash r dash p dash r means recursively so we want to go down a few levels on the website make sure that we search the entire website not just the front page [music] we want to save it dash p in the images folder we want to do j peg we want to do jpg we want to do png and then we also last but not least want to do nd no directory we want to save all of the we want to save all the pictures into one file we don't want to keep the directory structure that the website has and then last but not least we just put the url in there let's see there we go things are starting to flood in sweet that's it so most of it most of it was w get at the end of the day now you could probably use curl nowadays you wouldn't use pearl you would use python you wouldn't use wget you would use curl and that's about it see it's really not that complicated and he doesn't the only hacking he does is guessing that username password combo which was really smart but that's it so i hope you guys enjoyed this episode i'll see you in the next one
