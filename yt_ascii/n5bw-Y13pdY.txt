so i want to tell you about poncelet's porism which is a theorem which blew the minds of 19th century mathematicians. um, it was a really exciting moment, a lot of people tried to come up with their own proofs. i'm not going to explain the proof, i just want to tell you what it's about and maybe a little bit about why it's so cool and surprising. and i have to admit i don't know what a porism is, some people call it poncelet's closure theorem, but porism is so cool that that's what we're gonna use today. 
- (brady: you don't know what a porism is?)
- i don't know what a porism is. (brady: we'll google that. but it means like a theorem or a-)
- probably, i, i don't even want to venture a guess - it could, it could mean anything. so you start with two conics, so like two ellipses. let's say one is inside the other. and what do you do? you start with a point on one and you draw the tangent line to the other one through that point - one of the tangent lines. and it intersects the other conic at some point. and now you can take this point and draw, well, we already have one tangent line through this point and the second conic, but you draw the other one. now you get a third point, and you keep going. you draw the tangent line and you keep bouncing around. eventually, maybe you close up. all right? so suppose you close up. 
- (brady: so you might get back to where you started?) yeah, so you might get back to where you started, after some number of times bouncing around this picture. you might not. but here's the theorem. so suppose you eventually get back to where you started, so you started at this point and bounced around a lot, and eventually you come back. then the same thing happens if you start at any point. so all you have to know is that if you start here, you bounce around, you come back; well what happens if you started here? the same thing would be true. you'd bounce around a bunch of times and eventually you'd come back to where you started. so that's poncelet's theorem. (brady: and i guess by extension if you don't come back to where you started that's also true for any point?)
- that's right. because if it was true for some other point then, well, you would know there's some point where you start and bounce around, so for your original point you'd also, by the same theorem, have to bounce around and come back to where you started. (brady: okay)
- so that's the result. so, okay, so why was this so exciting? i'm not going to say much about the proof but the reason why is that the proof used some objects called elliptic curves or elliptic functions, which were really exciting at the time. and everyone had to come up with their own proof of this using elliptic functions or elliptic curves. and people were still doing that as late as like the 1960s or 1970s including some of the, you know, giants of algebraic geometry. (brady: so that was the shiny new toy of mathematics at the time?) yeah, and i think it was just really exciting that there's some, you know, fairly elementary statement you could make that you could apply these really fancy new tools, these really exciting and, you know, beautiful objects to study and prove.
- (brady: was the first proof) (using that or was it already proven and then people came along and said i bet we could do that with elliptic curves?) yeah, so i think what happened was poncelet's proof didn't, uh, didn't intrinsically use these ideas or didn't, he didn't know maybe he was using these ideas. and then a little bit later jacobi came along and he was like, oh i know how to prove this using elliptic integrals. but this was right at the beginning of the time people were starting to understand elliptic curves which actually came from some interesting calculus problems called elliptic integrals. and so, uh, i think the excitement came from, you know, people looking at poncelet's proof and realising, oh, there's something really beautiful happening here. 
(brady: do we know what properties of the ellipses make a joining star) (and what ones make them not join? or is it just a random thing?)
- yeah, so in fact, there's, there's some, uh, some really beautiful geometry hidden here. associated to these two conics there's a sort of diagram like this. so it's a, some kind of parallelogram where you think of these sides as the same, and these sides is the same. so actually this is one way of thinking about an elliptic curve. there's a picture like this and also is associated to it a little arrow, so a vector. and here's another thing you can do, just like this, another kind of operation you can perform on a picture like this. you can add the vector to itself. so you can do this and then do this and well, maybe you get here, but that's the same as this point because we said these two sides were the same. you can do this and do this and do this, and that's the same as this point, which is the same as this point. and the way we can tell if you wrap around and get to where you get is exactly, this, if the same thing is true on this picture. if once you add this vector to itself enough times you get back to where you started. so this is the associated elliptic curve.
- (brady: i don't see the link between the parallelogram and the-) yeah, it's - i haven't told it to you. 
- (brady: oh, okay!) yeah, so in fact i can say a little bit about it. so what you do is you identify this with the - let me give the comics names. so this inner one is c and this one is d. so you identify this with the set of points c and d where c is a point of c and d is a point of d, and the line through c and d is tangent to c at point c. and it turns out there's a natural way to go from this set to this parallelogram. in particular it has this kind of addition law on it. (brady: so if i said to you, daniel i want you to draw two ellipses) (that will work, that will create this cool property, you would use that?)
- i would try to reverse engineer it, that's right. (brady: okay, cool. it's funny,) (when you started talking about elliptic curves, you didn't draw a single curved line.)
- that's right, yeah. so, so, - an elliptic curve people often draw as looking like, something like this. so that's the, the real solutions to an equation that looks like this. but uh, if you instead you look at the complex solutions, you get a picture like this. so and, so in fact this is, if you, uh, think about gluing this side to this side, and this side to this side, you get a doughnut. and what's this picture? it's well, this loop goes over here and this one is kind of some shadow of a loop over here. (brady: okay. yeah.)
