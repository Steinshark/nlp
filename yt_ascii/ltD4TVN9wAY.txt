all right what's up mkbhd here welcome to the first pc that i have built in i have to look this up nine years so i've made a lot of videos about computers and we've had pre-built pcs in here but i've never actually built one from scratch since 2013 which if you look back was actually a hackintosh but we don't talk about that i'm gonna be doing this again with a bunch of parts here and i have decided i'm only going to be using youtuber merch here to build it so i've got the desk mat here mkbhd.com i've got a knife because we've got some unboxings to do this is the jerryrig everything knife you've probably heard of it it's pretty sweet it's actually the sharpest knife i own and then we have this video sponsor yes actually the linus tech tips screwdriver both in the creator edition and the regular edition but shout out to linus and the team who have been working on this for apparently three plus years to put this together which is pretty sweet so let's take a look at this one let's unbox the screwdriver oh we got the nice linus orange colors in here so there it is feels very solid and you've probably got some bits in here so it comes with all 12 of these bits here and you can store all 12 of those bits up here in the top that's really satisfying nice yeah this is made in partnership with megapro tools who has tons of experience making tools like this and there's a magnet in the shaft so if you have trouble like grabbing a screw that should be no problem i'm probably gonna use the phillips a lot i'm just gonna preload that oh i forgot to mention we are gonna be doing a quick giveaway stay tuned to the end for a little bit of details but this is a creator edition of the screwdriver and the only thing that means for me is it's red and black which is a special little bit of a colorway so you got the stealth matte black version and you've got a red and black version i'm going to give these away again we'll talk about it at the end actually for this video i'm going to build this pc with the red screwdriver to be that much more special it's so when i give it away you'll have a 101 that built this pc but if you want to get one of these in the standard colors yourself you can you can go to lttstore.com and pre-order yours today so i've got all the parts over here let's just go through them one by one [music] all right so first up we've got the case this is corsair's 4000x it's a midtower pc case and it's pretty simple it's 130 bucks it's got some fans in the front tempered glass rectangle nothing crazy it's just going to be a standard high end pc build then next up i think it's important to introduce the motherboard and the cpu we're using this is an asus pro art z690 you can see a pretty sweet black and gold box here which is using intel's 12th gen chip here intel core i9 so we're going to pop that in there and i'll go over all the details as we start to install them but i'm just going to give you the quick run through the all-in-one liquid cooler for the cpu it's corsair's h150i it's got a bunch of fans and it's really solid we'll get to that when we install it then i also have here our ram 64 gigs of ram from g-skill and also a bunch of m.2 ssds they're very fast we've got two four terabytes and two two terabytes yes the board has enough to support it and i'll install them all in front of your very eyes and then last but not least here is we'll get to that this is our power supply so asus 1200 watt modular power supply and a bunch of our cables here modular power supply means of course we're picking our cables and our gpu might look a little bit different as you can see that's an intel arc a70 we've talked about nvidia and amd in the past this is a little bit of a different option but i think we'll start with the motherboard this is our board this is asus's new pro art motherboard this comes with three months of adobe's creative cloud for free so you can kind of get a sense of who they're aiming at with this board all right wow it's got some heft to it it's a very solid board i want to put together as much of the computer as possible on the board here in front of me before i try to put it in the case so i'm going to put the cpu in i'm going to put the ram in i'm going to put the ssds in and we'll see about the cooler how much i can do before i actually have to start cable managing and putting it in the case all right so here is our cpu this is intel's core i9 12900k i haven't seen cpu packaging in a while and this is definitely much fancier than i remember so that's pretty cool twist to open this is the fanciest very nice very nice i mean at the end of the day it's a cpu and a plastic case but you know this is nice presentation so i'm gonna not even take it out yet but i'm gonna open this latch here and this will open i'm going to line up that arrow we see on the bottom corner with the arrow that i saw here on the bottom left corner i'm just going to place that down right there so then i'm going to push this cover down push this down and our cover pops off and our cpu is installed all right i'm gonna do ram next i think the ram is probably some of the best looking stuff in the inside of a pc especially if it has lights on it which this one does so we've got two sticks of memory here these are two 32 gig ddr5 memory sticks and you could go double it up in the future i only have four slots on this board but that's fine and i'm going to make sure i install dual channel memory in the appropriate slots on the board here it's a good crunchy sound when you do it right beautiful we've got our ssds our incredibly fast m2 ssds and on this board we have our pci slots but then under these we have our m2 ports i'm gonna just use a screwdriver and pop these open what should i use here i'm gonna go flat head to unscrew these so there's the first m2 slot if you told somebody in 2013 when i last built the pc that you could get a four terabyte drive in the palm of your hand i would not have believed you i would not have believed you trying to tell me that is four terabytes those pins connected they are seated cool and then i'm just going to push this down to the screw here and then use that to lock it in place that's actually super easy all right so we've got a bunch more i actually don't need all these drives but i'm going to install some more anyway so this is the bottom this is the last two m2 pcie 4.0 slots i assume they're next to each other so actually what's interesting now is these drives have their own heat sinks in their little covers as you can tell so my job now is to peel off this cover and pop the heatsink back on and that'll be good for the drives i'm going to take this move to the side and start working on the case i'm going to go power supply and then we'll go from there i'm going to save [music] this peel for when it's done that'll be my reward so okay with the door off and we can see what sort of a canvas we have to work with it's got three fans here space for the power supply down here this is a hard drive bracket but we don't have hard drives in this build we have literally terabytes of ssd so i think i should just be able to take that out yeah matter of fact let's take that out so let's come from the back take this other panel off and make space for the ss or for the power supply but let's take this bracket out the way oh thumb screws i was about to thought i was gonna have to use a screwdriver again actually that's pretty tight there we go okay [music] this is the part where it gets fun because i it's been a long time like i said since i've built a pc power supply yup solid metal all the rog stuff is so consistently rog like the rog phone looks like the rog monitor which looks like the rog power supply which looks like the rog graphics cards i mean these things are consistent so as a modular power supply it of course comes with a box of cables i'm not going to be using any of these but it does have your main power cables and all that good stuff but we're using some cable mod cables as you already saw i also just noticed this just like the rog phone there is a screen on this power supply but the thing about this screen and this case is it's going to be sitting in there blocked by the door so you're not actually going to be able to see it but that would just show you i guess the amount of watts of power you're drawing so here these are the cables we're going to be using with this power supply cable mod pro series cable kit so the last time i built a pc i definitely just used the included cables with the modular power supply these oh these look way better nice and these are specifically matching these are for this power supply which is sweet there's a little air intake at the bottom so we know the orientation of the power supply in the case which will be like that and then all the cables will come into the case and be routed up the back through here so let's start by attaching them okay so this is actually kind of nice it's labeled right here so these two are for the motherboard this is gonna go here which means this is gonna go here fan down oriented correctly let's line her up all right so now that we've got the cables in the power supply power supply in the case i'm just going to check to make sure all of our parts fit swivel this around so you can check with me so the board's obviously got its spot up here it's going to be oriented that way i'm also going to double check this cpu cooler which is pretty i don't know it's pretty big we'll see if it fits in this case and hoping oh this is a three fan three times 120 it's a 360 ml radiator this case is not designed to fit those it'll only fit a 240 we're gonna get a little bit creative with this one since there are three fans in the front that's still big enough for a 360. so i'm gonna replace the three front fans with this radiator should still work i'm gonna have to take fans out take the front off it's a little bit extra fun this is what pc building is all about unfortunately we'll have to put the tubes at the top to get it to actually fit and connect that's you're not supposed to do that but i don't know ltt inspect this build with this exact config so i'm gonna make the best of it luckily i have my handy ltt screwdriver which makes this all super easy so now i'm gonna put these fans into this radiator typically don't want to put the cables or the tubes at the top but we're making do with the parts we have so now next up i'm going to put this back plate behind the motherboard which is going to help us put the cpu cooler on and then i'm going to put the motherboard in the case so i've got to line up all of these spots okay it's actually not too hard see this is nice magnetic screwdriver holds onto the screw pop into the corner i wonder if anyone's ever built a pc and it just went perfectly and our motherboard is now seated so then our next step here i've got it all ready to put the cpu cooler on the cpu get another one to go leave it there screw it in okay this is the final major piece which is the gpu this is the this is the different one as you guys have probably seen over the past few years amd versus nvidia wars raging on as far as discrete gpus and then when you see an integrated gpu it's typically a good intel one they're jumping in the game of discrete gpus and this is the arc a770 it's going to feel somewhere in the range of an rtx 3060 or 3060 ti maybe you can see the fans on the outside it's matte black it's kind of a pretty simple looking card if you ask me and i'm going to be putting it right in this top pci slot here and this is a this is the rgb controller cable so i do have some pins to get this guy to light up oh is that the light right there probably there you go oh all the way around nice and it's a dual slot card so i'm going to take the top two out that should do it so now i gotta line these up and listen for the click yep [music] i like that there's a lot of matte black going on in this build and it speaks to me and i'm very happy with that gotta plug it in in fact we gotta do a whole bunch of cable management and cable plugging in nobody really wants to watch me do that so with the magic of video editing let's fast forward a couple hours all right here we are as you can see this is the finished build and spoiler yeah i did go a little bit beyond that plugged some things in booted it up for the first time and got everything working but i am happy to say the pc works it's alive i do want to deliver those last few peels that i promised [music] i'm pretty proud of the way the red and black aesthetic turned out so here we are now that it's fully booted i feel like i learned a lot both about building a pc today in 2022 with all the new and interesting parts we have here how clean we're able to make it look obviously having the m.2 ssds in here keeps it looking particularly sparse there's lots of clean open spaces airflow moving through here but also just remembering back in the other pcs that i built which were for very different purposes the hackintosh was very much a hack like one of the things i remember about it was we literally couldn't turn it off or it might not turn back on again like that type of thing this is just an all-around high-end fun great daily driver matter of fact we got forza on here already all right in the controls i can change video settings to 1440p [music] and on high at fps that should look pretty good and now we're way up at 90 to 100 fps so you guys might remember the we tried some of this crazy forza demo at on 8k on that machine on the super high-end main gear this even at 1440p on high settings which looks incredible i'm pretty much locked at upper 80s lower 90s fps suffice to say this this intel card can definitely handle some pretty solid gaming so this is the screwdriver i will be giving away this exact one it's one of one in this red and black colorway i will leave all the bits in it this is the exact bit i just used to finish this build and all you have to do is check the description and that could be yours that's been my first pc build in a really long time and i'm glad i did it thanks linus thanks y'all for watching i'm gonna get back to gaming catch you guys the next one peace [music] [applause]
