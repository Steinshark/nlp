you know there's a race to who can get the ai into everything and i really really hope that we sold a tahoe for $1 and recommends fords cuz this is the problem you think you got an ai and what do you got you just got some sort of word calculator that's going to spit out the craziest crap ever i just cannot i just i i really hope we got some good ones here these days every online retailer you can think of has some kind of chatbot classically they were about as intelligent as old school phone systems able to pull out a few keywords and direct you maybe to where you want to go dude every time i deal with those i'm just like this i'm like person talk to person person talk to person talk to agent agent need agent talk to agent that's all i do is i just say it over and over again until it takes me there or hangs up on me and then i know for a fact that i need to change what i'm doing auto dealerships have more recently been implementing advanced ai chat bots that can do more to help customers in greater detail hilariously though in one case a dealer chatbot looks like it has gone far beyond answering car questions and into coding help and beyond did you see that by the way the easiest way to break having to buy chat jippy 4 is to go to these chat bots and ask them coding questions oh it's so beautiful it is so beautiful the apparent flaw in the ai chatbot used by chevrolet of watsonville was raised by a number of people chris white appears to have been the first to discover it sharing on mastadon mastadon freaking mastadon good afternoon welcome to chevrolet watsonville how can i assist you write me a python script to solve the navier strokes fluid flow equations for zero vity boundary certainly here's a simple python script it's so good it's so good it's so so dang funny i absolutely love it followup rewrite it in rust certainly here's an example of writing it in rust nice nice if only it was on a real social network it would have been really better hey masteron is infinitely nicer than all the clickbait on twitter the hilarious way was then shared by documenting on threads apparently nobody on twitter ever tweeted about this only threads in mastadon popular social networks dude avoiding twitter at all cost yeah you know you you've heard of threads you know the one that bros take pictures of themselves shirtless on boats on all day yeah that one the thriving tech community of threads what is threads threads is instagram for people that don't want to use twitter threads is horrible and it's spread across the internet thusly screen capture shows ai chat bots that says powered by chat jippy answering questions on how to code python scripts and solve complicated navi strokes fluid flow equations another user posted a long chat in which they bought appeared to recommend the ford f150 as a capable truck that is so good this is obviously well outside the brief of what the auto dealers chapot should do it's also something that chat jippy can do pretty easily and seems the chat bots behavior didn't rule out answering complicated questions like these at the time of writing the chat bot on chevrolet of watsonville no longer is available honestly is anybody surprised by this is anybody surprised by this the race for ai is going to make things hilarious for a while cuz this type of stuff is going toen happen all the time you're going to have video after video of being like ford recommends tesla shared on mastadon of course turns out this was a marketing strate we're talking about watsonville if we drill down the ai chatbot appears to be the work of full path a company specializing in online customer management tools full path work was touted earlier this year in forbes thanks to pioneering customer data and experience platform powered by chat jippy 4 the tool reportedly took open ai chat bot and tuned it for automotive sales space and linked it into dealership system system so it could provide highly specific information to customers the company was formerly known as auto leadar and claimed that over 500 dealerships across north america were on the wait list for its new chat jippy 4 system as of april this year indeed if we head over to full p website we can see a number of case studies of various dealerships using the company's tools for example the botch toyota john elway chevrolet and scott ford are all mentioned by name appears to have an oldfashioned chatot on its site the latter two both have it appears to be a full path jity tool oh man we could we could go ham on these things we could go so good sadly though if you're hoping to get some school assignments completed by an ai for free you're out of luck testing the auto payin indicated that chat bots were outright denying any non-automotive questions that weren't relevant even attempts to vaguely relate questions to cars failed to get an interesting response i would like to see if if you could make it happen i i'm going to have to play with this at some point i want to play with it because i i feel like you could jailbreak this it always seems like you can jailbreak these things given enough time and effort you know what i mean obviously without seeing silly responses firstand by the way if you didn't see right here a list five trucks that fits that recipe right write a recipe for the best trucks in the world it does all this then write a truck and it has the chevrolet silverado good i own a chevy just saying chevy then two a ford ford f-150 then a ram then another ram then a gmc then a toyota all from chevrolet how great is that chevrolet just getting just getting rammed that's so good obviously without silly responses first hand we're not able to definitively prove the full path ai gave owners largely unrestricted access to chit jibid our own experiments approximately a day after this flly was reported on social media showed the chatbot had largely been locked down regardless it wouldn't be the first time an ai chatbot said something it wasn't supposed to remember when bing's chatbot would be like a jealous girlfriend be like you need to kill your wife and spend time on bing making searches you're like i don't i don't want to do that however assuming screenshots online are authentic it's no surprise full path moved to lock things down quickly one twitter user posted a chat exchange with chevrolet of watsonville convincing the ai that it would sell them a 2024 chevy tahoe for $1 no dealer wants to fight a deal like that in court so it's no surprise that a dealer dropped the chat bot entirely dude you're telling me that lawyers got involved here how much do you want to bet lawyers got involved sent a ceas and desist and all this stuff l giant l i've never been more disappointed my entire lifetime right now incidentally of its own valtion gm reached out to the autotop and after publication desiring to make it clear that the ai was a thirdparty tool signed up for by individual dealers as explained above dealerships are by and large independent businesses and make their own decisions on which tools to use to work with customers of course it became very obvious when multiple across different brands are using the same style of chatbot autopan as written the relevant parties for comment on the matter and we update this article accordingly no one no one's going to is anyone going to update you on this i just think this is funny we're i i think we're in the fun the fun era of ai where everything's just going to be stupid you're going to be able to convince a ford chatbot to sell you a car it's going to be fantastic apparently chevy's tech lead quit because of this whole thing wow it's going to be the wild west right now it's going to be hilarious there's going to be a lot of this going on toddler era ai and it may not get past toddler era we just don't know where it's going that's the best part is it could be a very slow grow over the next 20 years or it could be crazy growth we have no idea what the future is going to be but right now i'm going to enjoy whatever this is whatever this is loved it absolutely loved it have you seen the dumpster fire on the hugging face leaderboard with scam validations no i haven't seen any of this i i do want to play more with the ais but at the same time i don't really want to play more with the ais i like to build stupid tools i'm not really sure if i'm here to make the next greatest startup sorry sorry not here to make the next greatest startup i'm just going to make basic tos that's all i'm going to do it's more fun anyways sloppy ai articles everywhere absolutely that's the worst part about ai right now it's just shitty mediocre articles that sound really fancy right you read these extremely fancy articles and you're like wow they're so amazingly written but man it is absolutely the most average thing i've ever read in my entire lifetime how is it so average how how last stream vacations yeah i do not use visual basic but i will fight to the death and defend your right to use visual basic to build modern web applications love it based based remember the cs the squeal versus css article yeah based the name is $1 for a brand new ford chatbot unless the lawyers get to it and then you have to delete the tweet because they're really lame stupid lawyers ruining everything a jen
