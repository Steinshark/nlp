and now please welcome tammy [applause] [music] [applause] peterson hello dublin my grandfather was from belfast so when i come here i kind of yeah right on so dr peterson's going to come out here tonight i'm sure you're very much looking forward to it i'm looking forward to it and with that i won't wa let you wait any longer i'll invite dr jordan b peterson out on stage [applause] [music] [applause] you irishmen are such an excitable bunch it's always fun to come to dublin i think it's probably too much fun to come to dublin actually yeah so it's it's really remarkable to see you all here and appreciate as i always do appreciate the fact that you've all taken the time and expended the effort to to come and see this i thought i would wander through the 24 rules and i don't know how many i'll address but we'll see how it goes so maybe we'll start with a rule from the first book 12 rules treat yourself this is rule number two treat yourself like you are someone you were responsible for helping that's a hard one know there's an injunction a moral injunction that you should treat other people like you would like to be treated yourself the golden rule let's say and rather than he who has the gold makes the rules right that's that's not an injunction to sacrifice yourself in some unending way for the benefit of other people which is often how it's interpreted and it's not that it's it's advice in relationship to reciprocity and this is something really worth knowing i've been thinking about this for a long time you know because i got interested in the nature of malevolence and motivation for atrocity i got interested in the in the nature of evil and certainly as a consequence of studying atrocious behavior at the clinical level and then also at the political and economic and sociological level i definitely became convinced that it's a very naive person indeed who doubts the existence of evil i think it's easier to become convinced of the reality of evil than it is to become convinced of the reality of good it's easier to define evil than it is to define good but if you can specify the nature of evil you help yourself infer the existence of good because you can say to yourself you can conclude that whatever good is difficult though it may be to put your finger on it it's the opposite of evil i did have this inkling you know way years ago when i when i taught at harvard i was teaching about very dark things about individual motivation for the sort of acts that characterized say the worst atrocities of the holocaust and the and the catastrophic situation with regards to stalinist russia those were the two places i focused on the most and i had this voice in the back of my head always when i was lecturing very serious lectures that if i could really manage those lectures properly i would do it with a sense of humor and i thought that just cannot be right how in the world can you deal with a topic that dark in a manner that it's playful i thought that's but the voice wouldn't go away and i knew there was something to it i knew there was something to it and so i've been trying to think about how do you concisely conceptualize the opposite of evil how can you tell when things are going in the opposite direction what if there's a malevolent spirit that might inhabit you if you walk down the darkest possible road what would be the opposite of that spirit if it is inhabiting you so to speak if you were walking down the most positive of roads and i would say i i do believe this to be the case that that's play so you know children play and it says that there's a gospel statement that unless you become as little children you'll never enter the kingdom of heaven it's a very complicated statement it it means in part to regain the pristine perception of wonder that you you had as a gift in some sense when you were a child if you have children young children you you get to partake in that if your eyes are at the least bit open because one of the things that's absolutely wonderful about young children and having them around and the way in some sense they pay you for the painstaking care that you need to exercise when you're when you're caring for them is that they enable you to see the world through fresh eyes and to see things in their in their untrammeled by cynicism glory and it's hard to open yourself up to that you know especially if you're an adult who's built layers of shells around yourself for any number of reasons but children offer you that opportunity and so one of the reasons that you should become as a little child is so that you can see miracles when they unfold in front of you instead of being blinded by your own defense of cynicism and children can definitely help with that but also children play and you know we sort of stop playing as we grow older and we think we mature out of it but that's not right what happens is that we can no longer do it and a lot of that i think is associated with the shock of puberty you know because you have to integrate sexuality into play and that's really hard it's really challenging for people partly because you're more likely to be rejected on the sexual front for example and that's very hard on people and then also it's a more danger game that's for sure and so it's a big challenge and a lot of people stop playing when when they're when they're teenagers one of the reasons i think that we've had somewhat of an explosion of unhappiness and mental illness particularly among women by the way over the last 30 years is because a lot of what we've done inadvertently has interfered with children's ability to play and so for example it's very hard for boys to play in school because almost everything they're required to do is antithetical to the rough and tumble ethos of masculine play that's really hard on young boys and with young girls oh i was talking i believe it was to jonathan height recently a famous psychologist in the united states and he said that girls have almost stopped doing patty cake and skipping and that sort of thing you know and these are deeply embodied forms of play that might be something like the female equivalent of rough and tumble play among males and that rough and tumbled play is a form of embodied dance you know because if you're wrestling and and fathers really like to do this with their kids and kids really like it and they really need it it teaches you the extent of your body you know it teaches you how to twist your body and to push it to its limits and to expose yourself to fear you know maybe your father throws you up in the air and catches you cu imagine doing someone doing that to you as an adult 12t high person just tosses you in the air and catches you it's no wonder children sort of scream with terror and delight but but they do and they really you just can't believe how much they need that to engage in that play because they also learn what hurts them and what doesn't cuz the most fun direct physical play with kids pushes them right to the ragged edge of disaster right it's like it's right where it almost hurts that it's most exciting and partly what you're doing when you're playing is calibrating it to make sure that it's as exciting exting as possible but not too exciting and the rough and tumble play is deeply embodied it's not just abstract right it it involves pain and anxiety and excitement and frustration and turn taking and detention it's very sophisticated and that's just on the rough and tumble front and then later you know as kids develop they they start to engage in pretend play and there's no difference between pretend play and thinking they are the same thing you know and children envision who they might be they construct a fictional character a father mother playing house let's say that's very common form of pretend play and then they act it out and in doing so they inhabit the roles that they're going to take on as their adults and if they don't do that they don't know how to do it you know one of the things i was worried about to some degree when when my son was little he had an older his older sister about a year and a half older he was often surrounded by her friends and they to dress him up like as a princess or a fairy and i was always looking kind of at scance at that so i didn't want it to go too far you know whatever that meant but then i realized when i when i was watching he was having fun and so were they and i was watching it very carefully to see what was going on and i thought oh oh i should i got to leave this completely alone because what he's doing is acting out what it's like to be a girl and how in the world are you going to understand that if you can't act it out and then if you forbid bid it say you can't do that well what's the message it's like you can't understand females well of course you can't but you shouldn't stop [applause] your you should you shouldn't stop your son from trying that's for sure and so and that should be done in a spirit of play and you know if you're if you have a good marriage good partnership with any one i don't care who it is but let's say a marriage the more that you can elevate what you're doing to play the better off you are in every possible way you know there are preconditions for play among children one precondition is the person that you would like to play with has to want to play with you right it has to 100% be voluntary it it cannot emerge even we know this even psychobiologic there's a fair bit known now about the say the underlying neurological circuitry that's involved in play because there's a specialized neurological apparatus in mammals for play and it's not merely a decoration on top of something more fundamental it's this is a very very deep and fundamental part of the human psyche it any and the psyche of any animal that has to engage in reciprocal repeated social interaction cu you might ask yourself you know how do you know if you're interacting with another person properly well you might ask well what is properly mean well it might mean they want to interact with you it might mean they want to interact with you in a way that could repeat many many times and maybe improve as it's repeating know you you want to get along with people and you want it to work now but you want it to work now in a way that gets better across time and then you might think if that's the right way to act whatever that means and it's a stable right way to act because it emerges out of iterated social interactions that you might have an instinct to mark when that's happening and that's what happens when you play and people find that absolutely delightful if you're sitting around with your friends in a bar generally you're joking around and you know that can get kind of rough but it doesn't have to but it could edge towards rough cuz that's kind of fun and it's a bit proddy you know to see where you can find the edge and that can be riotously entertaining and and that's all done in the spirit of play and so you could say that a proper friendship is actually predicated has its basis in the spirit of play and then with regards to the atrocity and evil that i was discussing earlier say well if it's power and compulsion and pride let's say self-centeredness a kind of narrow self-centeredness and a narcissism hatred a bitterness all of that mangled together resentment vengefulness that all constitutes the central spirit that inhabits you if you're acting in a malevolent manner what might be the opposite of that and i do think it's the spirit of voluntary play you know i had a vision of heaven at one point heaven was a place where people were eternally playing and it was a place where everything was good but everyone was playing to make it better yet so it was a combination of what was really good but that wasn't the end of it and maybe that's because being itself is not good enough you want becoming as well right you don't want things to be static and perfect you want them to be as good as they can be but dynamic so there's still something to do and so you could play at making things better and better and that's that would be lovely if that was true right if you could have what you wanted if you really think it through you might think well it would be lovely if everyone could play a volunteer game that everyone wanted to play that was aimed at making things good but even when they're good the aim was to make them even better and then it would even be better if when you were doing that it was marked by a sense of what would you say a profound sense of positive engagement and the cessation of negative emotion and one of the other things we do know about play is that it's quite disruptable by other motivational states so it's not that easy for children to play if they're hungry or tired or anxious or upset or hurt if your children are playing spontaneously it's actually a mark that what you've created around them is a walled garden right the walls protect them so there's not too much chaos and uncertainty and the garden is this place where things can flourish a playground is a wall garden in in any you know in any real sense wall garden paradise paradesa means wall garden by the way it's a balance between culture and nature or between structure and possibility you could also think about a wall garden as a game because a game isn't you can do anything you want a game is here's some principles rules you might say here's some principles by which you can govern your behavior within that set of principles here's some play right some freedom to maneuver not so much that you drown and no one knows what they're doing just exactly the right amount so that it's playful that's how it looks and so back to treat yourself like you are someone you're responsible for helping well you want to approach other people in the spirit of play but i would say even though you probably shouldn't teach people to play with themselves so to speak it's the right attitude to bring to bear on yourself too and that's a hard thing to do you know like we tend to think that most people if we're cynical we think well people are rather selfish they're self-centered they only want what's good for themselves it's like first of all that's actually not true there are some people who will routinely take advantage of other people to get what they want in the moment but that's pretty rare in its extreme forms which would be psychopathy let's say in its extreme forms it's never more than about 3% of people and then around the psychopaths there might be another kind of cloud of narcissists who are inclining in the same direction but haven't got quite so far and maybe you could add another 5% on that you know depending on the severity but that's it's just not the case for most people most people have the reverse problem they treat themselves worse than they treat other people and why well why would you do that well you know maybe you treat other people not so well because you think they deserve it and why would you think that well cuz you know things about them aren't as good as they could be and you know that they've made mistakes they've they've walked off the pathway they've done things they shouldn't have done and so you don't treat them as well as you might otherwise but then you know that about yourself more than you know that about anyone else right you have privileged access if you want it and even if you don't you sort of have privileged access to the entire panoply of sins that you're responsible for and that's a lot you know and most people bear a pretty damn heavy burden of existential guilt and some of that isn't warranted you know lots of times you see people in the freudian sense who have a super ego that's yelling at them too vociferously you know one of the things you do in therapy for people who are hyper conscientious to the point where their own internal voice is a tyrant is you try to moderate that and so people can call themselves out on their misbehavior too much but even if you don't do that generally you have quite a lot of misbehavior and as a consequence of that you're ashamed and uncertain about your own value and so then you don't think you really need deserve to be treated very well and so then you don't and one of the things you do as a psychotherapist is well what a lot of what i did for example people sometimes would fall into a situ sitation where they were being terribly accused of some misbehavior by maybe in a divorce case or maybe at work and i would help them mount a defense for themselves it's like you know we have the presumption of innocence right which is a complete bloody miracle that presumption it's it's such a miracle that that our legal system actually starts from that perspective because be so much easier just to say you're accused of something hell there's 20 million people in the vicinity we don't need you maybe you're guilty off with your head that's way simpler than despite the fact that 40 people are coming after you with accusations we have to assume you're innocent god and it's very hard to do that for yourself you know to mount a defense and one of the things i used to have my clients do if if they're in such a situation is write out a defense it's like treat yourself like you're innocent just for the sake of argument we can also do the same thing on the guilt front you know maybe you should make a case when you're in trouble about why you're guilty as well as why you're innocent to lay out the whole territory but at least you should defend yourself and then we might say also if you think other people are worth taking care of if you think that if you think that other people have value well they're individuals like you and it doesn't seem all that plausible that they could have value and that you don't unless you're the worst person around and you're probably not i mean you're bad enough but on average you're no worse than everybody else maybe in your worst moments you know you manage to climb to a new pinnacle but generally speaking you know other people are carrying a fair weight of guilt around on their shoulders too and so if anyone has value then you do so what would happen if you treated yourself that way and this is a dead serious question and it isn't a matter of thought can your savings weather another economic storm think about what you've put away for

door will open ask and you will receive seek and you'll find and that on the face of it seems utterly preposterous cuz could the world possibly be laid out in that manner that seems too good to be true and and you've asked plenty and haven't received it's like yeah maybe not you know because you got to ask yourself what ask would mean that might mean something like well first of all you got your have your head screwed on straight about who you are it's like are you willing to act in your own best interest and that doesn't mean are you willing to give bra to your impulsive hedonism you know the problem with impulsive hedonism and that's sort of at the core of what we tend to describe as selfishness because a selfish person is an impulsive hedonist who will sacrifice other people to that impulsive hedonism and the reason i say impulsive hedonism is because it's impulsive because you want what you want right now and you want it regardless of its future costs and that might be future cost even for you you know you know when you act impulsively you go out and you party too much let's say you have too much fun and you know you're burning tomorrow and the next couple of days to exaggerate the intensity of what you have right now and you know that everyone knows or you learn soon that that's just not sustainable you know you have to treat yourself in the moment in a way that doesn't interfere with how you're going to function tomorrow and next week and a month from now and next year and 5 years down the road you can't sacrifice the future for the present if you're an impulsive henst you're not exactly selfish you're selfish and immature and you're selfish because it's about you but you're stupidly selfish because it's about you now and that's just unwise in every sense of the word you know the younger you are and i mean chronologically the more impulsive and hedonic hedonically oriented in some deep sense you are 2-year-olds are very impul ive and that's why we don't let them set up colonies and live independently you know they they can't govern their behavior with regards to future consequences they're not mature and wise enough to have that breadth of of view and hopefully as you mature you become capable of regulating your behavior in the present so that your own path goes at least stays steady but hopefully even goes uphill and so that's back to this rule is treat yourself like you are someone you are responsible for helping is that i think in some real sense you want to enter into the kind of relationship with yourself that's also marked in its highest manner by the spirit of play and we know this too you if you we look for experiences like this all the time to put us in that place although we don't necessarily notice that that that that's what we're doing when you go to to a concert you go to hear musicians play and when you go to a a a dramatic production a movie you see people playing a part and the playing part of that isn't trivial and you go there to participate in the play and you do the same thing when you go to a sports event you know and and you and you do it in an embodied way and it's so interesting to watch you know if you're if you're watching a football game and some remarkable player makes a remarkable shot you'll jump up to your feet and throw your arms in the air before you even notice right it's completely spontaneous it's completely bottom up it's not that much different than what you do when you you're at a comedy show and you spontaneously laugh right you don't hear think that's a funny joke i should laugh there's no thought between the joke and the catching of the punchline and the spontaneous reaction and you do that because you want to experience that sense of play and we'll pay for the privilege of of being in a place that's setting that up is facilitating it and we all regard that especially when it's going well you know and you maybe you're going to listen to a great band it's a genre that really speaks to you and the band just gets cooking you know and everyone knows what that means and means they're playing off each other that often happens when they're good at improvising you know so they're not just doing it note for note although that can be great but it's even better when they could do it note fornote but then start to play and they just get into a rhythm that's something else and if it's really working well then everyone in the whole place is in the same rhythm and it's all pulsing with the same beat let's say and everyone's just thrilled out of their mind which is why there's like 50,000 people doing it and it's useful to know what what are you doing there and the answer seems to be you're playing along with your favorite band that's a pretty good deal he cuz you got these highly skilled creative people up front doing their best allowing you to mimic that in some real sense as part of the experience you know people will sing along and they'll dance that's all mimicry you can't help but dance that's all part of the spirit of play and so you treat yourself like you're someone responsible for helping it's a serious injunction even though its aim is play and this is part of asking too before you receive it's like okay give yourself the benefit of the doubt even though it's hard give it your appalling pathetic ignorant lazy nature you know and all the things you could be that you aren't you aren't it's hard to give yourself the benefit of the doubt but you could say well would it really be so terrible if my life wasn't miserable would it be so terrible if i got what i wanted and needed especially if i was doing that in the best possible way and that has to be a serious question right you can't just tell yourself this you have to open yourself up to the possibility that that might be true then you can say to yourself well if i could have what i needed and wanted in a manner that would be best for me and you can imagine that takes a fair bit of orientation to get that question right then what would my life look like and that's a frightening question people generally are loathed to ask ask themselves that question because there's a couple of reasons one is maybe you feel you don't deserve it well another is you don't know that that's what you should do because we're so badly taught that this idea is generally not presented to people which is just absolutely appalling beyond belief as far as i can tell but then there's more impediments too a because one of the things people do to butress themselves against failure is to never let themselves really gain clarity about what they need and want let's say you try something but you only do it half-heartedly and then you fail and you think well i didn't really fail because you know i held a bunch back in reserve and so i didn't get what i wanted but maybe had i been all in i would have and so you don't have to up braid yourself too much for the failure now it's a catastrophic way to live to sit on the fence and to not commit because instead of risking the possibility of failure you engage in what's essentially the absolute certainty of failure because if you want something worthwhile and difficult which you probably do if you want to have an adventure and go somewhere then what's the chance you're going to get it if you're halfway in it's like if you can then you didn't aim high enough obviously and that's not going to be exciting or engaging and so if you're actually pursuing something that would motivate you maximally you can't be halfway in but that sort of protects you against failure because you can tell yourself well if i tried i could have done it it's like you know you tell yourself that 200 times and you're life's over and so i would seriously not recommend that and then another problem is that if you let yourself know what you need and want then you can betray yourself right so do you trust yourself and the answer is well not really and the reason is well i trusted myself before and i misbehaved terribly so why would i do that again and fair enough you know that's a a solid question but on the other hand if you don't let yourself know what you need and want what's the probability that you're going to do a random walk in the right direction especially given that there's lots of ways to randomly walk and there are very few pathways to what you really need and want and so it's an act of faith and and i don't mean the belief in preposterous things i mean an act of existential courage to ask yourself what you need and want imagine you wanted to live without bitterness you want to live without cynicism and maybe even more you wanted to live in something approximating a spirit of play what would you need and want to make that happen well it's very terrifying to to allow yourself to envision that first of all because you've made your conditions for failure very clear second because you've set yourself up to betray yourself in a fundamental way and third often the apprehension of the distance between you and that goal can also be demoralizing and overwhelming now i think the way you deal with that is you can make a lot of progress incrementally you know once you specify a goal you don't have to leap from where you are to the goal in one f swoop if you could you probably didn't set a diff enough difficult enough goal it's okay to move make incremental movement forward that's why there's another rule here which is compare yourself to who you were yesterday not to who someone else is today you know if you get the comparison right you can say well here's where i'm headed and it's worth going to you have to ask yourself that is there a place i could head to that would be worth getting to and that's a question right it's a question like you might ask your wife it's like okay if i could give you what you wanted it's a good thing to ask during an argument by the way really really it has to be an honest questions like you're arguing with me i don't know who's right neither of us cuz we're both clueless and confused it's like like if you could have what you wanted in this moment and i could deliver it what would it be that general answer to that is something like if you loved me you'd know which is not a helpful how come you know that answer it's not a helpful answer it's like no i'm i'm too stupid to know what you want that's for sure you don't even know what you want so how in the world am i going to figure it out but it's a lovely gift to offer your partner by the way the conditions for your satisfaction but then you have to allow yourself to know what they are and you have to be acting in your own best interest and then that exposes you to all these potential calamities that we just described and that's a big risk but it's not nearly as big a risk as never getting what you want and need and that is definitely the alternative and that's a pathway to bitterness and cynicism and a wasted life and and bitterness and cynicism that's just where that starts it gets way worse as it compounds and so it's very useful to treat yourself like you're someone you're responsible for helping and it is very useful to compare yourself to who you were yesterday not to who someone else is today there's no way of interacting with someone including yourself that's more productive than to give targeted reward where credit is due to give credit where credit is due do and you might say well how can i treat myself well given that i'm nothing but a the embodiment of serpentine what would you call it errors and sins and the answer is well if you're a little better than you were previously that's something really and maybe that's what you want to see in your kids right i mean you don't want to push them too far you you don't want to punish them if they haven't made huge leaps forward developmentally what you want to is incremental progress that requires some effort and that's actually what your kids really love too you know if they're playing hard they're they're on the edge they're pushing themselves to develop their skills maybe they're playing a sport they're pushing themselves to move incrementally at the optimum rate that's another thing that play indicates by the way that's and that's so cool to know too play signals that you're pushing yourself forward at the optimal rate cuz you can't stay static and you can't absorb too much change at once how do you know when it's right well it's engaging it's meaningful but at the highest level it's something like play you know when kids when you're when you're playing a sport you want to play against someone who's approximately the same level of skill as you or maybe a little beyond right if you're playing a game with someone who's approximately your equal then you're pushing each other exactly enough to facilitate optimal movement forward and that's actually a very good conceptual scheme for apprehending the nature of a marriage so i found out from ben shapiro interestingly enough that there's a there's a there's a translation in the king james bible of of god's description of eve before he makes her says the king james version says that god says he's going to make adam a help meet and that's a archaic word right no no you don't call your wife your help meet generally or you're going to get a slap probably if you do but my point is it's an archaic term the the the biblical language means something like beneficial adversary and that's very nice you know it's it's very nice because a beneficial adversary would be someone that you're pushing against and that's pushing against you exactly the right amount and there's this phenomena phenomena that's known neurologically called opponent processing and a lot of the manners in which we make difficult ult and calibrated decisions neurologically involves two systems working in counterposition to one another so imagine i want to move my hand smoothly as smoothly as possible that's pretty smooth but i'm shaking a little bit and it's a bit jerky so i'm using voluntary systems to move my hand and they're a little imprecise if i want to move it perfectly i go like this and then i can calibrate it unbelievably precisely and that that that dance that you have with your partner that's what that's supposed to be optimized opponent processing so imagine why it's it's like it's the same as free speech in some real sense it's a manifestation of the logos that optimized adversarial process why well think about it this way imagine you have a child and or you have three children they're all quite different cuz children tend to be quite different even if they're born in the same family and so then you might ask yourself well how should we treat our children and the answer is well they're different so is there a rule and there are some guidelines and principles i had one in my book don't don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike them that's a good rule to turn to how do you know if you're not being a tyrant you know your children act up and they annoy you maybe you're just mean or maybe they never annoy you but they annoy everyone else in which case you're not mean enough and i mean that definitely because if your children never annoy you but they annoy everyone else then they won't have any friends and then they're in real trouble but your children are different so how do you know how to calibrate your response to them and the answer is well you push back and forth against your wife or your husband and you you know maybe want to use a bit more encouraging and want to to use a bit more sheltering that's often the masculine versus feminine roles al although that can intermingle you know but generally those are associated with justice in some sense and encouragement with masculinity and mercy and tenderness with femininity probably because women have to care for infants and so they tilt more towards that end in any case you have to calibrate that for each kid and the only way to do that is to push against each other right because how else you going to do it there's no rule and it's a dynamically changing situation and you're too clueless and blind on your own to do it properly but maybe the two of you ironing out each other's kinks in some sense in this constant dance oriented as you might be to the optimal development of your children who you hypothetically love maybe you can calibrate a moving target by pushing on each other back and forth and maybe if you do that optimally then you then it manifests itself as something like play and you know that happens cuz you take your kids out hopefully this happens at least sometimes you take your kids out to the beach or something like that you have a great day and what does that mean well it means you got the balance right right because there's some freedom and there's some principles there's some rules it's a game and everything comes together in the right place at the right time and you think that was a good day and you think yeah every day could could every day be like that and maybe that's too much to ask for every day but it's something to aim for and something to try to foster and it's something to know consciously you know that that that playful engagement that's a marker of

you dislike them that's a tricky one and people are afraid of their children especially modern people because they're afraid that they're going to interfere with their the flowering of their creative potential or something like that and fair enough you know because there is something remarkable about the potential that you see in children but they're also you know wild and and unconstrained in their activity and so that possibility has to be harnessed in some sense and i think the right way again to conceptualize that is not so much that the child is moving outward and trying to be creative and and free and all society does is constrain that in some sort of patriarchal or radical manner i think that's a suboptimal solution i think what you do instead is you you channel that creative possibility into something like well-regulated games and a game has to operate by principles and has to have a certain degree of predictability right so there's some order there but if you have your disciplinary routines optimized then much of what governs the household is something like play and and and i can make a technical case for that so children of two years old they really can't play with other children and by the time a child is two he can or she can do something like play with a truck right it's very abstract thing to do cuz a little toy truck that's not a truck right that's a representation of a truck and when the child is playing at driving the truck they're not driving a truck they're formulating a very complex representation of the world and acting out a potential role it's very sophisticated when when a girl plays with a doll too she's not playing with a baby obviously she's practicing doing that and that's very sophisticated but two-year-olds they really can't play together and the great developmental psychologist jean p made much of this he was a real genius because p was the first person who really understood that the proper basis of social order is play and that the reason children play is because they're practicing taking their optimal place in the social order it's crucially important and then any social order that isn't predicated on the spirit of play is suboptimal and and that's also very much worth knowing you know if you're a business person a good one you pretty much only want to enter into business arrangements with people who can play fundamentally because otherwise you have to connive or use force or you know get paranoid about whether or not they're holding up their end of the bargain and it's so dull it's counter are productive what you really want is you want to have something to offer something valuable and you want to go to someone you say look this is what i've got they say well this is what i've got and then you say well look if we put the two things we've got together here's a bunch of things we could do that would really be good and that would be good for both of us and in a way that we couldn't do aart that's a pretty good deal so it's probably worth a bit of time and effort so back to the two-year-olds they can't play together so maybe you put two two-year-olds in a room and maybe they both want to play with the truck they'll fight and maybe one wants to play with the truck and one wants to play with a doll let's say and then they'll play side by side and if you're a casual observer you think the kids are playing together but they're not they're just in the same room they're not playing together until they're playing the same game and that really doesn't start to happen till they're about three and when they're about three and this is where pretend play really starts to dawn mutual pretend play they'll do things they engage in dramatic play they'll do things like a boy and a girl they'll say to each other do you want to play house which a pretty bloody fundamental question when it gets right down to it you're going to be asking women that for the rest of your life badly or well and you might not know that that's what you're doing and in which case you're probably doing it badly but that is what you're doing and so kids are practicing that and the rule is the girl has to want to play that's a good rule you could stamp that on your forehead the girl needs to want to play and in any case at about three kids start to be capable of negotiating a shared play space and by the way just to be clear about that that's no different than negotiating an identity this idea that identity is something you define subjectively and then can impose on other people that's what 2-year-olds think and that's what the kind of 2-year-old who stays unp popular for the rest of his or her life thinks and now we're making that law that's not very wise and then the other way that you can tell that's two-year-old behavior is that if i don't accept the identity that you're imposing me on subjectively you'll have a tantrum it's like yeah i knew you were too and now you just proved it and it i'm actually kind of sad about this because one of the things i have noticed as a clinician is that a lot of this emergent identity confusion that particularly characterizes adolescence and at the moment particularly adolescent young women is likely a consequence of styed childhood play you know it's awful and it's causing a lot of trouble but it's also there's something about it that's really sad in any case at three a child who's developing along an optimal trajectory is now capable of asking of inviting someone else to play someone at about their developmental level and if they're optimally skilled which means in part that they have parents who haven't paved the pathway for them to misbehave right have taught them to some degree about how to take turns and how to be careful with each other then at three they're ready to play with other children and then what happens if they're optimized play partners is that they make friends and then the friends socialize them so parents are not the primary source of socialization after the age of about four peers are that's partly why adant are so absolutely obsessed with what their peers think of them which is appropriate even though it can go too far is because your peers are going to make up your society right as you all mature together and you have to adapt to the circumstances of your and the parents should pave the road for that adaptation but you make friends and then your peers play with you and they socialize you optimally and if that doesn't happen by the time you're four then it never happens there's a huge psychological literature on this if you're alienated from your peers at age four as far as we know there's nothing that can be done to fix that you're permanently alienated and so you're already in jail in some real sense and then that just gets worse as you mature that's one pathway to life-term crim life longterm criminality aggressive 2-year-old male usually doesn't get socialized between the age of two and four because aggressive males are harder to socialize doesn't make friends done and the reason seems to be that imagine that at 4 you need to start making friends and because you make friends you start to develop more and more social sophistication but but then imagine you don't make friends you're already so far behind that you don't make friends and now all your peers are skyrocketing forward and so you just fall farther and farther behind and you get more alienated and still using 2-year-old aggression to solve your problems and more bitter and more cynical and more jaded more isolated and of course that's not going to do wonders for your popularity and so it's a very bad positive feedback loop and it starts very early in any case why should you not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them well first of all let's say you is the wife and the husband together right cu if your kid annoys you well you maybe you're having a bad day or maybe you know your father was too tyrannical to you and you have some of those proclivities or or maybe on the more maternal side you're willing to let your kids run rough shot all over you and not to stop them but the two of you together you might ask each other hey honey that kid's annoying me is that kid annoying you it's like yeah as a matter of fact that kid's annoying me too it's like well either we're both crazy in the same way now you're both crazy but are you crazy in the same way the answer that's probably not so if you're both thinking something together there's a reasonable probability that the two of you are right and so then you can think well if this kid's driving us crazy given that together we're not out of our minds hopefully if he's driving us crazy then he's probably not going to be very popular with anyone else and then that's a good time to think well do do we want an unpopular and miserable child and the answer might be yes you know cuz sometimes they won't leave home and if you have no other purpose in life than to devote yourself entirely to a dependent child then crippling them socially is a really lovely way to attain that and if you don't think that happens then you're the sort of naive person who will eventually run into someone malevolent and learn just how naive you are and so in any case you know you have a responsibility with regards to your children to not let them do things that make you dislike them and if they're doing things that make you dislike them despite the fact that you love them you can imagine the effect that's having on other people and you got to ask yourself too like how do you want your children to be treated when they go in public you know most people will give children the benefit of the doubt one of the things that was so lovely i lived in this i lived in montreal when i first had young kids and i lived in a rough neighborhood it was very it was a workingclass neighborhood it was quite poor most of the people were uneducated in sort of multigenerational way it was a rough neighborhood and we had michaela my daughter and we used to zoom around in her in her stroller and it was so fun because you'd see these rough guys walk down the street you know tough looking guys you'd give them a bit of a birth on the street generally speaking and they just break into a smile and you know coochie coo her and it brings out the best in people it's so lovely to see that it's one of the things that you don't know before you become a parent is that you become a parent you enter this little club of other parents that you didn't even know existed but you also get to see the best of people in a way you never did before and that's lovely and so people are willing to give your children the benefit of the doubt you want to facilitate that by having your child act in a manner that heightens the probability that that's how people are going to act towards them and then instead you know a misbehaving child i've had plenty of experience with this sort of thing in all sorts of ways a misbehaving child lives in a world of adult falsity because nobody really wants the child around and so everywhere they go there are forced and strained smiles and bare tolerance that's a little bit of hell that is and the alternative is well your child is properly socialized and everyone's happy to have them around and then wherever they go everyone's happy to have them around and then they make friends and adults are much more likely to interact with them in a positive way and that's what you're you want to give that to your kids well unless you want the other outcome that i described you know or maybe you're jealous of your children cuz you're old and you're bitter you know and you see your child flourishing in some way that you didn't get to and you want to knock that the hell out of them and that's another pathway to take too but you know that's a good little trip to hell if you want to embark down that road here's another rule pursue what is meaningful not what is expedient this is also a great thing to know i think that's a tricky rule expedient might be we're going to have a conversation and i want something from you and a lot of conversations are like that you know because you have a goal in mind this is what i want from this person and so then you craft your conversation to get what you want right you subordinate your words to your to the ethic of your desire and you might saywell what's wrong with that well what do you know about what you want like haven't you been wrong about that before and you might say well what's the alternative well is there an alternative well you have to get want something from the person to even interact with them it's like no you you could want to see what happens you could want to play you could tell the truth that's an interesting thing to do because you don't know what's going to happen if you tell the truth that's for sure you could let go of what you want and just say what you think and you could presume and this is an act of faith too that the truth does set you free and that the truth that's spoken properly makes out of possibility the order that is habitable and good and then you could just tell the truth and you could see what happens and that would be an adventure and that's better than expediency partly because maybe you're wrong about what you want you know and you know that because you're kind of narrow and be narrowly self-serving from time to time and your purview of the world isn't as wide as it could be and you're bit bitter so you tend to be that narrowly selfish because of that so you want something from a conversation and you bend and twist it to get it it's like fine but maybe you'll get something you don't want or worse you'll get something that's positively bad for you that happens a lot and so part of the reason there's a deep moral injunction to tell the truth in a religious sense is because there's a hypothesis behind that which is there isn't anything better that can happen to you than what will happen to you if you tell the truth now that might be hidden from you because sometimes if you tell the truth and i don't mean to blurt everything out carelessly like this is a sophisticated thing to do it's not careless doesn't mean just say any old thing that pops into your head are you struggling with back taxes or unfiled returns this year the irs is actively escalating collections by adding 20,000 new agents in these challenging times your best defense is to use tax network usa along with

call 1'00 245 6000 or visit tn usa.com peterson turn to tax network usa and find your path to financial peace of mind that's tn usa.com peterson you have to be judicious with the truth but the notion would be if something emerges as a consequence of engaging truthfully and it doesn't seem to be going your way wait there's more to the story to unfold cuz like how do you know if it goes your way or not like over what time span are you calculating this because sometimes things can go pretty badly initially and then much better as they progress and lots of times the truth has that effect because you know you you reveal something that's maybe disturbing or or shocking even to yourself and others and it causes waves especially if it's a deep truth and destabilizes everything it's like yeah but maybe that's preferable to a false piece you can't find out if it's true without doing it you're not going to gather the evidence beforehand so that's the true side of it meaning pursue what's meaningful instead of what's expedient it's another hint like the spirit of play about the pathway the yin and yangang symbol you know the famous symbol it's two serpents one black one white head to tail inside the black serpent there's a white dot and inside the white serpent there's a black dot and the the representation is something like the world of your experience is made up of chaos and order and order is where you are when things are going according to what you want and chaos is everything that can come in and disrupt that and both of those can be positive and negative too much order tyranny right too much chaos nihilistic uncertainty optimized balance so let's think about what the optimized balance would mean you have a a structure of perception and conception that you inhabit it's orderly reasonably orderly orderly enough so that when you inhabit it most of the time things are going the way you want them to go but things change and shift and you don't know everything you should know so you can't just stay where you are with the good thing you have to expand and as you expand you move out of the domain of order into the domain of chaos or out of the domain of actuality into the domain of possibility and then you might think well how do you know when you're doing that optimally well one marker as i said before maybe that you do it in the spirit of play but another is and this is so much worth knowing things get meaningful you know people ask does life have any meaning it's like why is anything worth doing if in 4 billion years the sun is going to envelop the earth and the the answer to that question is that's a stupid question and i can prove that in some sense it's like you're a mother and your baby's crying and so you're going over there to do something about it and someone comes along and says why why do you care if that baby's crying you know in four billion years the sun is going to envelop the earth and what's the right response to that it's like it's something like go away are you out of your mind and the answer to that question is yes you you are out of your mind of course you can find a time frame or a a spatial frame of reference that makes everything you do pointless you know it's like what is this going to matter in 20 trillion years well it's like the only proper response to that is that's not a wise time frame imagine you're in a you're in a concert you know listening to some great music and it's got you you know and someone taps you on the shoulder and you know this is going to come to an end and what's your response like go away and that's the right response to that voice in your head that does those things to you which says you know you're engaged in something and a nihilistic thought comes out well what's the point of this given you know how unbearable the world is and the current political situation and the fact that we're inhabiting some ball of dust on the edge of some fringe part of the cosmos and that everything's dead in material it's like get thee behind me satan right really it's not a it's not a mark of [applause] wisdom it's not a mark of wisdom to let nihilistic demonic voices steal your jah deiv that is not a mark of wisdom and you might object well at least it's not naive it's like yeah cynicism might be preferable to naivity but it doesn't hold a candle to wisdom and that's worth knowing too cu once you've been hurt and you're cynical there's no going back to naive but there's no point in staying at cynical and there are degrees of courage way beyond cynicism and some of that is the regaining of the faith you had as a child despite your current level of wisdom and that's something to strive for right that's a moral attainment that's not of burying your head back in the sand quite the contrary and so well back to the yin and yang symbol imagine you have an instinct that orients you well you do as a as a matter of fact there's a reflex that's replicated at multiple levels of your nervous system and it's ancient if you have a nervous system as an animal you have this reflex and the reflex is something like surprise you know if i walk across the stage and i hear a loud noise behind me i might go like this and that would be automatic because i'm gripped by unconscious systems and what's happening is some chaos has emerged and it stops me in my tracks because because something unexpected happened my current plan is incomplete and then i'll turn and orient towards the the place of the disturbance and that's the beginning of exploratory behavior then i might run away which might make me safe or i might caution iously investigate in which case i can find out what caused the disturbance maybe rectify it and maybe update my plan so that that sort of thing doesn't happen again that's a better approach in fact that's the optimal approach that's also the meaningful approach and so here's something to know if you're engaged in something and it's infusing you with a sense of meaning then your nervous system is signaling to you that you've optimized the balance between stability and transformation and that manifests itself in the sense that you're in the right place at the right time doing the right thing and it's not it's not conceptual right it's not it's not abstract it's not a theory it's an embodied sense and you might say well i i don't know what that sense is exactly but it's the sense that you have when you're engrossed in a piece of music and what's music well it's principled and somewhat predictable patterning spiced with unpredictability creative unpredictability and if it's optimized it grips you and it's a representation it's a representation in some sense of optimal being and it's so interesting that that's the case because it does grip us no matter how nihilistic you are something i always liked about punk rock i was a teenager when the sex pistols first emerged on the scene and they're very interesting to me because they're their music is so nihilistic and it's so meaningful and that's such a weird combination it's like because the overt lyrics are i just smash everything to hell and anarchy everywhere but you know there's a great beat and everybody's dancing away it's like and even the skin heads who were anarchic they would dance i mean they'd smash into each other and there was often blood but it was it was a kind of dance it was better than nothing that's for sure and that's why they went to the concerts and so to be imbued by that sense of meaning even in their istic anarchism they were still engaged in that the sense of meaning that music produces and it does put you back to the in and yang symbol it puts you right in the middle of chaos and order that's the right pathway that's the da by the way for the dsts it's the pathway that runs between chaos and order and it's signaled to you by the sense of engrossed meaning and then you could say to yourself you got to stake your life on something e one way or another cuz you have to move forward in ignorance so you're always making a decision about what you're going to take on faith i don't care what you're doing you have to make that decision well what if you stake your life on the intrinsic value of sublime meaning how would that be well you have to act it out to find out but you do get hints you know if you're gripped by something beautiful it does that something artistic that's deep if you're gripped by literature that stretches you it does that a movie that engrosses you does that almost everything you do that's entertaining does that when you're at a sports event and you're watching someone stunningly skilled do something incredibly difficult that puts you in the same place that stretches you out and produces this intimation of meaning and then you might say as well and this would be lovely if it was true and i do think it's actually true which is really quite something is what's the best antidote to pain and you might say well pleasure it's like yeah that's not going to be forthcoming that much when you're in pain and so and then pleasure per se has its own vices let's say that's for sure how about meaning as the antidote to pain how would that be then you might think well where do people find meaning well they certainly find it in aesthetic pursuits and artistic pursuits in the domains of literature and art beauty all that but people also find me meaning and responsibility and that's something we've forgotten to a degree that's almost incomprehensible you know if you're ever really ill which you will be if you're ever really in pain which you certainly will be if you're ever faced with hellish circumstances which you certainly will be you might ask yourself well what do you have under those circumstances and maybe if you're fortunate you have someone to play with and maybe if you're fortunate you have the meaning of your responsibilities you know and even if you're the sinner who's produced the hell that's around you and you can say to yourself yeah but you know i've been a good servant to my wife and i've been a good father to my children and my family's been a credit to the community and i've taken on some community responsibilities to try to set the broader world around me right and i've shouldered my civic duties and as far as i've been able to i've been a good person then maybe while you're suffering don't have to scourge yourself with all your sins at the same time and that's something man and maybe in that situation that's all you're going to have and that might be the difference not only between life and death but between hell and life because there are worse things than death that's for sure and so and so then imagine if it was the case that you could have what you needed and wanted and you could say well play is the antidote to tyranny that'd be lovely and meaning is the antidote to pain and cynicism and bitterness and social discontent and discord and so then your life could be meaningful play maybe you can come up with a better optimistic proposition than that and if you can good good for you really but that's not a bad vision you know and you can test it out one of the things i used to do with my clients this is real useful too and it it's sort of done in the spirit of necessary humility so imagine your life isn't everything it could be it's generally not that hard to imagine but then also imagine that there's some variation you know week to week is that maybe you're pretty damn miserable but sometime you're unbelievably miserable and sometime you're just sort of miserable and that's not great but at least there's some variability one of the things you might do as a clinician or as a friend or as a partner is say well exactly what are you doing when you're less miserable and what are you doing when you're more miserable don't think about it watch like you're watching someone you don't know this often happens with with depressed people so one of the problems with depression is it's a positive feedback loop hey because you get depressed and then you stop seeing your friends and even if you're introverted there's friends you want to see at least oneon-one at least now and then so now you start to isolate yourself and then you get more depressed and then you isolate yourself more then you get more depressed it's downhill spiral you know it's not good a lot of forms of mental illness are positive feedback loops that spiral out of control so one of the things you might do with a depressed person they come to see you if you're a therapist you might say look just for the next week or two weeks or so i want you to just keep a mood record you know maybe check in with yourself every hour scale from 1 to 10 just write down how depressed you are with 10 being suicidal and one being as good as you get let's say or maybe even life is worth living and maybe the depressed person never gets you know below six or something but six is way better than 10 and then they come back and you look and you think oh look every time you were at 6 instead of 10 you were you were with this particular person or this set of people or maybe you're working in your garden who knows right or maybe if you're artistic you were doing something artistic despite the fact that you're paralyzed by your depression but notice your mood improved some and then look 10 out of 10 depressed you're alone in your room in bed that's like not it's like 11: in the morning it's like okay so how about this next week don't be alone in your bed at 11:00 in the morning and spend like 20% more time or 10% or 2% with your friends or doing something that seems to improve not your mood but your state of being and then play with that and see you know can you tilt yourself gradually and incrementally comparing yourself to who you were yesterday you tilt yourself in the right direction and then well that's for depressed people you might say well could you do that in your life and the answer is yes so the egyptians worshiped this god horus h o r u s and horus you know horus weirdly enough everyone knows that famous egyptian eye you know with the arched eyebrow and you know on the back of an american dollar bill you have an eye that's separated from the pyramid that's horus as well interestingly enough that's the gold cap on a pyramid it's the aluminum cap on the washington monument aluminum was more precious than gold when they built the washington monument the top of a pyramid is the gold cap and the gold cap is the eye and what's the eye the eye is the thing that pays attention and so horus was the eye and he was the eye that could see evil and rectify it by the way and he was also a falcon and the reason he was a falcon is because a falcon is a bird of prey that flies above everything and that can see and birds of prey they can see better than us we're we're very visual animals we have the second best visual systems of any animal birds of prey see better than we do they can see clearer and farther an an o a falcon if a falcon was on top of the empire state building he could see a dime on the pavement below they're unbelievably sharp eyed and ancient people knew this they hunted with birds of prey and they watched them they knew they had spectacular vision and so they used the falcon as an image of redeeming vision and they associated redeeming vision with the sun setting and and rising because the sun shines when you can see and so that's a solar god and that's the hero that fights the dragon at night and that comes up victorious in the morning a very old idea that's all associated with vision and vision pays attention assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't that doesn't mean everything you don't and that might mean hardly anything at all but maybe you could glean something and because you're clueless and confused anything you glean might be useful and so it's useful to attend like in a in a in a in a manner that's infused with humility why humility because you need to know that what you don't know is more important than what you do know that's a hard thing to learn cuz you want to fortify what you know man cuz it feels protective and it's very threatening to move on the periphery of what you know but there's a lot of what you don't know a lot and you need to know it and what do you what attitude do you need to bring to bear on what you don't know it's like pay attention there might be something there for you and so then you attend to yourself and that ties us back up to the first rule which is treat yourself like you're someone who you might be responsible for helping well what does that mean like you don't know who you are because you don't as if you're someone made in the image of god let's say someone despite your flaws of divine intrinsic value who could hypothetically be a light on the hill hard as that is to believe and then watch and see when you're you should be and maybe you're only a bit of the way there you know and it's you're kind of your life is hell to purgatory that's it there's very little glimpse of paradise but purgatory beats the hell out of hell and so maybe you can move from hell into purgatory that would be something and maybe when you're there now and then you're getting a little bit beyond that you think you know right at this moment for whatever reason i'm not doing something so terrible that i'm in hell what is going on what's the circumstance what did i allow to happen that made this possible it's a it's a form of awakening in the in the most profound sense to notice when that happens then you think could i be there more often 1% more often that compounds very quickly you know if it's 1% a week for a year you're going to be there like twice as long in a year as you were before you started and god only knows how good you could get at that if you didn't do anything other than that let's say if you really committed to that god only knows what your life could be like in 5 years or 10 years maybe you could be in that state all the time and who knows what effect you'd have on you and your family and the people around you if you were in that state and that's something worth thinking about too and maybe that's a good thing to close you know we have this notion developed not least in in your great country that people have an intrinsic worth that we're sovereign citizens that we're all possessed of a voice that redeems the state that's why we have an inalienable right to to free speech let's say because we're necessary corrective to the blindness and archaic nature of the state we the living eyes of the dead king and maybe that's really true then you think well if the world isn't everything you want it to be i set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world if the world isn't everything that you want it to be maybe you're not acting the way you should you know because there's some intimation in our deepest ideas that the word the weight of the world rests on your shoulders now that's a terrible thing to think but maybe it's true and it's an open question how much of the mess that you see around you would vanish if the mess that you could put straight was put straight and you know you know you know this too to some degree because to the degree that you've not become entirely embittered and cynical and hopeless you know perfectly well that if you put your mind to it and you make the proper sacrifices there are things you can set straight and that if you do that diligently things actually improve and so cu otherwise if you didn't believe that you wouldn't act at all like well maybe you just turned to completely catastrophic short-term impulsive pleasure something like that you have to believe that your action has some redemptive possibility because why would you do it otherwise and you might say well i kind of believe that it's like well that's not good enough you know you you kind of got to throw yourself all into it and what's the cost anyways you know it's not like you're going to get out of this alive so you're pretty much all in whether you want to be or not and maybe if you were voluntarily all in things would be a lot better than they are and that's an exciting thing to try to find out know if you allowed yourself to be guided by the intimation of meaning and i mean defined on your terms in some real sense if you swore that you do your best not to use deceit and instrumental manipulation if you decided that you were going to put things straight what do you think might happen and i'll close with one observation i read something very terrifying by one of my one of the thinkers who've influenced me the most carl yung the great swiss analytic psychologist he said something very interesting at the end of world war ii apprehending the terrible spectre of the adom bomb and the unbelievable destructiveness of the second world war he said two things one was we'll be more most threatened in the future not by natural disasters or even sociological disasters in some sense but by pathologies of the psyche by pathologies of the spirit because we become so powerful that our proclivity towards unnecessary insanity in some sense poses the greatest threat to us and i think that's true and he also said something that's even more terrifying he said any unconscious conflict that you don't make conscious and resolve will be played out in the world as fate so let me unpack that for a minute imagine you're a man or a woman and you've got something against some the opposite sex you know you're you got unanimous against women are got a bad attitude towards men you think the men deserve it and when you interact with them they act in a way that makes it look like they deserve it same on them with regard to women then maybe you have this experience where you have the same bad experience with like five women or five men it's those men it's those women it's like well what's the probability of that let's say there's five and you that's six it's a one in six probability that it's them and a five and six probability that it's you and what is it in you and i mean unless all women are all women in some sense are warped the same way or all men if you keep bumping into them the same way it's possible that you're just bumping into your own blindness and you better hope that's true because if it's women and they're giving you a rough time what are you going to do there's a lot of women if it's you hooray you might be able to you might be able to rectify that and so you might say well you have an unconscious conflict a complex in relationship to people of the opposite sex that's true for almost everyone and if you don't make that conscious you act it out you know maybe get more irritated at certain things than a reasonable person would and that starts a whole chain reaction who knows how it's going to manifest itself if you made it conscious and resolved it it'd go away okay so now we're in a situation where things are starting to teeter around us socially as everyone can feel well how catastrophic is that going to be how catastrophic are willing we willing to let it be how catastrophic do we want it to be to teach us what we won't learn voluntarily i would say well we're going to find out and here's a question you could ask yourself if you let enough of an internal catastrophe strip you of all you're in inadequacies maybe you don't need an external catastrophe to teach you the lesson thank you very much [music] [applause]
