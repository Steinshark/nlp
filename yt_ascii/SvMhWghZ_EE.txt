[music] hey what's up mkbhd here samsung had their foldy event today which means i get to show you the phones that i got to play with behind the scenes a little bit before they came out which is as we expected two folding phones so we've got the galaxy z fold three with a better cover screen more durable folding glass s pen support it's got an under display selfie camera i made an entire separate hands-on video with this phone it'll be the first thing to hold that like button definitely check it out it's really nice but then also there's this guy the z flip three and while honestly this feels like a less surprising pretty modest update comparably of all the folding phones this is actually the one that i feel like i'm most likely to start recommending to regular people they've made a lot of good calls here so the z-flip and z-flip 5g have been out for a little bit what were people asking for from a new flipping phone so a better bigger cover screen a high fresh rate main screen and lower the price a little bit okay check check and kind of check so let's just start with the price the flip 3 is going to start at 9.99 which is its lowest ever price it's the lowest price of any of their folding phones but the baseline version of it now has 128 gigs of storage where the previous flips all had higher prices but they all started at 256. so they've made a lower priced version thus having a lowest ever price but you can see how they've sort of turned that narrative a little bit i still think 999 is pretty clutch though because while it is definitely still expensive it's now in line with some other regular flagship smartphones people are going to be considering buying it just happens to be the one that's folding in half so i'm happy to see this lower price but the inside screen the folding display which is still the same size and aspect ratio is also now 120 hertz which is great everything is now benefiting from being super smooth and you can always turn that down to 60 hertz if you want to literally feels like the iphone will be the last flagship to go higher fresh rate but that's the conversation for another day and all of this is wrapped in a design refresh that includes a larger and more functional cover display going from that tiny 1.1 inch screen from before to a 1.9 inch cover screen now it's not quite the huge 2.7 inch screen on the razer but this is a much bigger window and it makes a huge difference so by default it's still just going to be showing you the time which is the same as before cool plus you get the battery and the date but now swiping over to those different widgets and quick actions is way more functional and comfortable now it's not that tiny postage stamp size screen you've got music controls alarms timers and they're now an actually usable size and so this is the stuff you don't always want to have to open the phone to get to but the most important thing is notifications so if you swipe to the left of the time you get all the notifications on your phone and yes you can read more than one and you can actually swipe to dismiss individual notifications and you can actually manage them properly from the outside display that is beautiful so you can of course dive into the settings and customize a little more of what happens on this outside screen samsung's built a bunch of neat time animations so if you want a little more color or if you want to keep it clean or maybe you want multiple clocks for different time zones there's a lot to play with here and then you can even add or subtract widgets you don't use so i know i'd probably add in the weather widget and the calendar for myself and you can reorder them all of that is great and you always know what to expect when you swipe so overall that's a pretty big usability improvement for the outside screen on the flip of course it can still be your camera viewfinder when taking photos with the primary dual cameras it still shows you the phone number the name of whoever's calling you all that good stuff is still here just bigger and i don't know about you but i'm kind of liking this new dual tone design honestly if you didn't have any logos on it like if you just told a younger version of me that this was a folding pixel i probably would have believed you it kind of looks like the aesthetic from that panda pixel 2 but the sides are a little bit flatter too which definitely helps with modernizing it a bit and it feels good in the hand plus the new hinge is improved again and it's improved to the point where the whole phone is now ipx8 water resistant which is pretty sweet that means you can dunk the phone in water drop it in a puddle or spill something on it momentarily and it'll be fine which is cool now ipx8 does not mean dust resistant unfortunately the stuff that usually ends up plaguing folding phones like the grit and stuff that gets in the hinge can still make it through there so it's not certified to block that stuff out but it's cool to see a watertight seal but also they tossed in some better speakers this time so the original flips just had this one not that great speaker at the bottom and the earpiece now flip 3 actually gets a much improved speaker in the same spot and there are dolby atmos stereo speakers now so new gorilla glass invictus on the back same fingerprint reader on the power button this is nice this is a nice package this is a really nice folding phone design in 2021 now this doesn't go as far into the high end as the fold three so it doesn't have s pen support even though it does have 30 stronger screen protector on the inside folding glass and it also doesn't have the under display selfie camera it still has the hole punch but as far as the most reasonable folding phone put together so far in 2021 i mean this one i think this one takes the crown it has the flagship specs snapdragon 8 and 8 gigs of ram it has flagship cameras a standard and an ultra wide the battery is the same size as last year so that could be the only concern now that we just got high refresh rate but then putting this all in nicely designed water resistant refresh at 9.99 to me this has serious potential and even if this doesn't turn out to be the one that a lot of people start buying the trajectory is pretty good of getting down that price and making it as close to a regular phone as possible but all that being said i still have to test this phone i'm going to be reviewing it very soon so make sure you subscribe to see that if you haven't already and of course check out the fold three because you might be into that bigger more high end more interesting look again it's the link below but either way that's been it catch you guys the next one peace
