hello everyone and welcome in this video we're talking about how the mercedes g-wagon we are in the all-new g550 is capable of going up a 100 slope and first thing first if you're wondering what's up with the weird camera angle it's because of this really steeply raked windshield so i'm able to put it in this awkward position and hopefully you can still see me but it's an awesome feature of the g-wagon that has this really flat on aerodynamic but amazing visibility windshield besides the point how does it go up a 100 percent grade and so i think the first thing to address here is that a 100 grade does not mean you're going straight up it actually means you're going at a 45 degree angle so grade percent greatest rise over run so it's the same height over the same distance that gives you a 45 degree angle okay so how is it capable still a very impressive feat to go up a 45 degree angle and part of what's interesting is what happens at 45 degrees so if a core is just sitting there on flat ground and it's trying to accelerate forward the maximum force that it's able to accelerate forward with based on the tire's grip is a function of the tire's frictional coefficient and the normal force pressing down on that vehicle so the weight of the car that gives you about one g your cars are able to accelerate from a grip standpoint at about one g the tires have about one g of grip a frictional coefficient of one well what if you're trying to go straight up well if you're trying to go straight up your maximum force that you can accelerate upwards with is equal to that coefficient of friction times the normal force well your normal force is straight down you have nothing to grip so your force that you can accelerate upwards with is zero so what happens at 45 degrees well then we're perfectly between those two scenarios dead flat and dead straight up so the force that you're able to accelerate happens to be the exact force that's pulling you backwards so you're in this stalemate when you're at a 45 degree angle where you can't go forwards and if you let go of the brake you're going to start flying backwards so that's the interesting thing about a 45 degree angle now how do we know if the g wagon can actually go up that 45 degree angle well it needs to be able to accelerate it needs to have a coefficient of grip greater than one so it needs to be able to accelerate greater than one g and we can figure that out with a fun little test okay so in order to go up that 45 degree angle we need to have at least one g of grip or a frictional coefficient of the tires of one so how do we know whether or not we have that well we're going to do a little test and do a little math in order to figure it out so i'm going to be using a v box here which we can measure breaking distance so if i can break and measure the distance and find out if my acceleration is greater than one then i know i have more than one g of grip within these tires so we're going to be stopping from 60 miles per hour and with the equation distance equals one-half velocity squared over nobody cares we can figure out that 120 feet is our magic number here so if we stop from 60 miles per hour in less than 120 feet then we have more than one g of grip with the tires we can do the same thing with 30 miles per hour so i'm going to do that as well if we can stop in 30 feet or less from 30 miles per hour then we have one g of grip if we're over 30 feet or if we're over 120 feet from 60 miles per hour then we don't have 1g of grip and as a result we would not be able to climb a 45 degree angle so that's what we're gonna test right now okay let's do this wow okay so the results are in we stopped from 60 miles per hour in 130 feet so not quite one g breaking but from 30 to zero it did it in 32.5 feet so very close and we had a very slight elevation decline we were going downhill about one meter from 60 miles per hour down to zero so a little bit of a decline which would give us a bit of a disadvantage and the fact that it stopped from 30 to zero and 32.5 feet is very close to 30 feet so that indicates to me that it's close to that 1g threshold and the v box does say that the maximum deceleration g-force experienced was negative 1.029 now unfortunately all of this has been irrelevant because i learned that the tires on this car right now are not the original tires that come with it so it comes with pirelli scorpion zero all seasons and right now it has some falcon all-terrains on it as a result of a off-roading event that this thing is about to participate in so those off-road tires likely have less on-road grip than the all-seasons that come stock with it which probably puts it over that little edge you know 32.5 is what we're at we wanted 30 and we got 32.5 so very close in braking i believe it is possible which i'm impressed with by the way because i assume something this big wouldn't be able to stop so quickly so heavy 5500 pounds and yet it was able to do it and i think with the original tires and unfortunately it just doesn't have them on it i do believe it would actually be able to break in greater than one g of deceleration and thus provide us what we need in order to climb a 45 degree incline from a grip standpoint okay so with the assumption that it has enough grip and you know it's got a transfer case that can put it in a low range and tons of torque so as far as having the torque to do it that's not going to be an issue this thing has plenty of power twin turbo v8 and you can multiply that through a crazy amount of gearing in order to accelerate up it so it's got the power to do it it has the grip to do it but will it tip over so that's the final question and so the way that you can determine whether or not a vehicle is going to tip over at a certain angle is to look where its center of gravity is so if you draw a 45 degree angle and you stick the g wagon on it and it's trying to climb up it if you take the center of gravity and draw a line straight down from it if that line going straight down falls outside of the vehicle's wheelbase in other words behind that rear wheel then the thing's just going to tip over backwards and so it actually won't do this in the g wagon it's got that big heavy engine up front and the center of gravity is low enough so your center of gravity is far enough forward and low enough down that it won't actually tip backwards at a 45 degree angle now if you were sideways on that 45 degree angle it would in fact roll over in fact the angle at which you can drive without the thing tipping sideways is 35 degrees which still for an suv is pretty impressive so that is pretty cool now if the vehicle were purely two-wheel drive it wouldn't be able to do it because you need all of the grip available so there's a little bit of weight on those front tires and you need that grip so because it has the four-wheel drive and you're able to lock all three differentials you can send grip literally wherever it needs to go that final element of you can crawl up it because you have all of the grip available to use to propel you forward versus if you had a two-wheel drive vehicle and you're on that 45 degree angle unless all of the weight was on those two rear wheels otherwise you wouldn't be able to do it because even that small amount of weight on the front wheels would mean that you don't have enough grip your frictional coefficient total for the car combining between the rear and the front because you can only accelerate with the rear wouldn't be enough to actually get you up it so the g wagon is actually super cool and as much crap as it gets for being you know the the mall crawler or the you know the beverly hills wagon that's out there that you know it's it's a rich people's suv toy that's never going to go off-road and honestly like that's fine with me i don't think you should really off-road these things even though they're extraordinarily capable simply because of how expensive they are if you want to go break stuff outside then just get yourself in a wrangler and you know things can break and it's not as expensive to replace but as far as suv goes i absolutely love the g wagon and there are very few suvs out there period that ever get me excited like this is my favorite this is as good as an suv driving experience gets and not from like a driver's perspective of oh this is fun to go around the track it's going to be a terrible vehicle if you're going to try to track it but it's just a joy to drive and there's there's kind of four things i think that make it really great first of all is the capability and i know i said you know you shouldn't go off-road in this thing because it's too expensive and i still believe that but if you were to the amount of capability that this thing has is incredible you've got 9.5 inches of ground clearance you've got a lockable front rear and center differential which means you can send torque to absolutely any wheel if just one tire is on the ground and the other three are in the air you can send all of the torque to that one tire on the ground it has really great approach departure break over angles it can ford through quite a bit of water it now has an independent double wishbone front suspension and ultimately you know you combine all that the ground clearance the really great four-wheel drive system and you put a nice set of tires on it and you're going to go wherever you need to go it's going to be quite capable in pretty much any scenario the second reason i absolutely love this thing is its presence so you look at it and like yeah it's a box but it's still a very iconic box and there's nothing else really out there quite like it perhaps the suzuki jimny is like the baby cheap version of this and i love the suzuki chimney it's one of few cars where i look at it i'm like yes i want that thing and if they sold it in america i would absolutely buy one because it's just a cheap g-wagon essentially you know none of the luxury but all of the the kind of off-road cool 2500 pound vehicle i mean this literally weighs more than double a suzuki chimney which is insane but the presence this this thing has is insane i mean you you look at it and it's just like this thing was built to find and james bond like that's its destination and its journey and its mission in life is to find him james bond this thing is evil it has presence on the road you look at it it's like yeah it's a box but it's an evil box and it's here to destroy you the sound that the locks make when you lock it i mean you're in a bank vault and the sound of the doors when you close them they kept that the same so much about this feels like the last generation g-wagon and i love that about it you know they didn't change the things that didn't need to be changed and that that makes it such a cool experience i mean you get in modern cars today and you close the door and it's kind of this just flimsy clink and it closes shut this you actually have to try you need effort to close these doors and it's a very satisfactory thud when you do actually close it the third thing i love about this suv is the driving position and the visibility so sticking this you know vertical windshield is not ideal for filming and it's not ideal for aerodynamics whatsoever and i've also found out it's not ideal for bugs bugs smash into this thing constantly i've gotten out of the car and had to clean it a couple times to get rid of the bugs that just go splat right on the windshield because it's just a flat surface flying through the air everything in its path again evil but the visibility is amazing you know exactly where all four corners of the car are when you're looking around here you've got excellent visibility the seating position you're really close to the windshield you see everything and i love that so many suvs today were willing to sacrifice visibility in the name of aerodynamics and in the name of style and in this case yeah the aerodynamics suck but styling wise this thing looks awesome and you still have great visibility and finally what brings it all together and just sells this package is the engine mercedes twin turbo 4 liter v8 is just exceptional it has very little lag this thing weighs 5 500 pounds and goes zero to 60 in 5.6 seconds with a 416 horsepower 450 pound feet of torque v8 engine the engine sounds awesome you've got the side exit exhausts you get to listen to it when you want to and you get to hear this incredible engine and it barks at you and spits out flames but then when you you know put it in comfort mode it backs off completely it goes to a really high gear you hear nothing at all so it can be both worlds it can be that evil rugged thing where you hear everything or it can go into its quiet mode and you can just sit back and relax now so i don't seem like i'm just endlessly gushing about how amazing this thing is here's one thing about it that sucks pretty much if you if you look at this suv from a driving dynamic standpoint it's awful like the steering response is horrible the thing's kind of a boat and it just kind of slowly wiggles around the road and there's nothing you know responsive about it at all now they have increased the steering response from the previous generation but i mean you can move the wheel so much and so little happens as far as which direction you're going so the response of the steering from a driving standpoint it's bad and yet nothing about that bothers me when i'm driving this thing i don't feel like i need it like yeah the entire car rolls like 45 degree angle every time you make a turn and that seems absurd like why would a car ever do that and yet when you're in this like with the sound with the visibility with the entire experience all packaged together you don't really mind so i think i just said that i was going to give something negative about it and then managed to find a way to turn it into a positive thing and that's just what this vehicle does to me i absolutely love the mercedes g-class it is such such a cool vehicle so that's what i have to say about it i think it's great that it can go up an incline plenty of other vehicles can probably do the same you just need the grip and the tires to do it and the center of gravity and that kind of stuff but it's cool nonetheless to think about and do a little math on thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below i am going to put this back into sport mode get into manual shifting mode and have a little fun here on a mountain road and a g wagon because that makes sense right
