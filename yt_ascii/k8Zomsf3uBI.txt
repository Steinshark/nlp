let's start with the basics so you've also formulated a fascinating principle of the free energy principle could we maybe start at the basics and what is the free energy principle well in fact the free energy principle inherits a lot from the building of these data analytic approaches to these you know very high dimensional time soon as you get get from the brain so i think is interesting to acknowledge that and in particularly analysis tools that try to address the other side which is a functional integrations on the connectivity analyses on the one hand but i should also acknowledge it inherits all awful lot from machine learning as well so the free energy principle and is just a formal statement that the the existential imperatives for any system that manages to survive in a changing world is can be cast as a an inference problem in the sense that you can interpret the probability of existing as the evidence that you exist and if you can write down that problem of existence as a statistical problem then you can use all the maths that has been developed for inference to understand and characterize the ensemble dynamics that must be in play in the service of that inference so technically what that means is you can always interpret anything that exists in virtue or being separate from the environment in which it exists as trying to minimize variational free-energy and if you're from the machine learning community you will know that as a negative evidence lower bound or a negative elbow which is the same as saying you're trying to maximize or it will look as if all your dynamics trying to maximize the complement of that which is the marginal likelihood or the evidence for your own existence so that's basically that you know that the free energy principle of it but even take us sort of a small step back or as you said the existential imperative there's there's a lot of beautiful poetic words here but to put it crudely it's a it's a fascinating idea of basically just of trying to describe if you're looking at a blob how do you know this thing is alive what does it mean to be alive what does it mean to be it to exist and so you can look at the brain you can look at parts of the brain or you this is just the general principle that applies to almost thing and yeah and you system it that's just a fascinating sort of philosophically at every level question and the methodology to try to answer that question what does it mean to be alive yeah so that that that's a huge endeavor and it's nice that there's at least some from some perspective a clean answer so maybe can you talk about that optimization view of it so what what's trying to be minimized to maximize what a system that's alive what is it trying to minimize right you've you've made a big move to make big moves but you've assumed that the things the thing exists before the in a state that could be living on nonliving so i may ask you or what lysis is you to say that something exists that's why i use the word existential it's beyond living it's just existence so if you drill down onto the definition of things that that exists then they have certain properties if you borrow the maths from non-equilibrium steady state physics that enable you to interpret their existence in terms of this optimization procedure so it's could you introduce the word optimization so what the free-energy principle in it's sort of most ambitious but also most deflationary and simplest says is if something exists then it must by the mathematics of non-equilibrium steady-state exhibit properties that make it look as if it is optimizing a particular quantity and it turns out that particular quantity happens to be exactly the same as the evidence lower bound in machine learning or bayesian model evidence in bayesian statistics or and then i can list a whole other you know list of ways of understanding this this this key quantity which is a bound on on surprisal self information if you know information theory there are whole there are a number of different perspectives on this contry it's this basically the log of probability of being in a particular state i'm telling this story as an honest and attempt to answer your question and i'm answering it as if i was pretending to be a physicist who was trying to understand the fundaments of non-equilibrium steady state and i shouldn't really be doing that because the last time i was taught physics i was in my twenties what kind of systems when you think about the free energy principle what kind of systems are you imagining it's a sort of more specific kind of case study you know i'm imagining a range of systems but you're at its simplest a sim a single-celled organism that can be identified from its eco nation or its environment so at its simplest that that's basically what what i always imagined in my head and you may ask well is there anything how on earth can you even elaborate questions about the existence of a a sim as single drop of oil for example yeah what but there aren't d questions there why doesn't the oil why doesn't the thing the interface between the drop of oil that contains an interior and the thing that is not the drop of oil which is the solvent in which it is immersed how does that interface persist over time why doesn't the oil is dissolve into solvent so what special properties of the exchange between the surface of the oil drop and the external states in which it's immersed if you're physicists say would be the heat bath you know you've got a you've got a physical system an ensemble again with about genomics ensemble dynamics an ensemble of it of atoms or molecules immersed in a heat bath but the question is how did the heat bath get there and why is it not dissolved how does in maintaining itself exactly what actions is it i mean it's such a fascinating idea of a drop of oil and i guess it would dissolve in water wouldn't dissolve in water so what precisely so why not so why not why not and how do you mathematically describe i mean it's such a beautiful idea and also the idea of like where does the thing where does the drop of oil and yeah and where does it begin right so i mean you're asking the questions deep in a normal area but what you can do you see sorry this is a deflationary part of it can i just qualify mounds there by saying that normally when i'm asked this question i answer from the point of view of a psychologist we talk about predictive processing and pretty decoding and the brain is an inference machine but you haven't asked me from that perspective i'm answering from the point of view of a physicist so you you know the question is not so much why but if it exists what properties must it display so that's the deflation in part the 300 please we're in the 300 principle does not supply and answer as to why it's saying if something exists then it must display these properties that's that's the other sort of the thing that's on offer and it so happens that these properties a must display are actually intriguing and have this inferential gloss this is this sort of self evidencing gloss that inherits from the fact that the very preservation of the boundary between the oil drop and the not oil drop requires an optimization of a particular function or a functional that's that defines the presence of the existence of of this order which is why i started with existential imperatives the it ism it is a necessary condition for existence that this must occur because the thing the boundary basically defines the thing that's that's existing so it is that self-assembly aspect it's that for the you hinting at in biology sometimes known as auto poiesis in computational chemistry with self-assembly it's the what what does it look like sorry how would you describe things that configure themselves out of nothing the where they clearly demarcate themselves from the states on the soup in which they are immersed so from the point of view of computational chemistry for example you would just understand that as a configuration of a macro molecule to minimize its free energy his thermodynamic free energy but it's exactly the same principle that we've been talking about that thermodynamic free energy is just the negative elbow it's the same mathematical common construct so the very emergence of existence of structure or form that can be distinguished from the environment or the thing that is not the thing necessitates the you know the existence of an objective function that it looks as if it is minimizing it's finding a free energy minima and so just to clarify i'm trying to wrap my head around so the the free energy principle says that if something exists these are the properties it should display yes so what what that means is we can't just look we can't just go into a soup and there's no mechanism if free energy principle doesn't give us a mechanism to find the things that exist is that what it what's implying is being applied that you can kind of use it to reason to think about like study a particular system and say dude does this exhibit these qualities that's an excellent question but when's the daad after i have to return to your previous question about what's the difference between living and nonliving things actually society so yeah that maybe we can go there you kind of drew a line and and forgive me for the stupid questions but the you kind of draw a line between living and existing yeah is there an interesting sort of distinction distinction yeah i think there is so you know things do exist grains of sand rocks on the moon trees you so all of these things can be separated from the environment in which they are immersed and therefore there must at some level be optimizing their free energy taking this sort of model evidence interpretation of this quantity that basically means their self evidencing another nice little twist of phrase here is that you are your own existence proof you know statistically speaking which i don't think i said that somebody did because i love that phrase you are your own existence proof yeah so it's er existential isn't it you would have to think about there for a few days yeah the view that's a beautiful line so the the step through to answer your question about you know what's it good for big girl on the following lines first of all you have to define what it means to exist which down as you rightly pointed out you have to define what probabilistic properties must the states of something possess so that it has so it knows where it finishes and then you write out that down in terms of statistical independence is again sparsity again it's not what's connected or what score elated or what depends upon what it's what's not correlated and what doesn't depend upon something again it comes down to the the deeper structures not in this is as hierarchical but the suddenly the the structures that emerge from removing connectivity in dependency in this instance basically being able to identify the surface of the oil drop from the water in which it is immersed and when you do that use that you start to realize well there are actually four sub kinds of states in any given universe that contains anything the things that are internal to the surface the things that are external to the surface and the surface in and of itself which is why i use a metaphor a little single-celled organism that has an interior and exterior and then the the surface of the cell and that's mathematically a markov blanket just a pause i'm in awe of this concept that there's the stuff outside the surface stuff inside the surface and the surface itself the markov blanket it's just the most beautiful kind of notion about trying to explore what it means to exist you're automatically i apologize this is a beautiful idea but came out of california so that's i changed my mind i'd take it off so sorry anyway so what you were just talking about the surface about the marble and so this surface or this blanket these blanket states that are this you know the because they are now defined in relation to these independence's and your walker what different states internal blanket or external states can which ones can influence each other and which cannot influence each other you can now apply standard results that you would find in non equilibrium physics or steady state or thermodynamics or hydrodynamics usually out of equilibrium solutions and apply them to this partition and what it looks like is if all the norman normal gradient flows that you would associate with any non equilibrium system apply in such a way that to their part of the markov blanket and the internal states seem to be hill climbing or doing a gradient descent on the same quantity and that means that you can now describe the very existence of this oil-drop you can write down the existence of this old up in terms of flows dynamics equations of motion where the blanket states or part of them we call them active states and the internal states now seem to be ana must be trying to look as if they're minimizing the same function which is a lot of probability of occupying this but these states the interesting thing is that what would they be called if you were trying to describe these things so what we're talking about are internal states external states and blanket states now let's carve the blanket states into to sensory states and active states operationally it has to be the case that in order for this carving up in two different sets of states to exist the active states the markov blanket cannot be influenced by the external states and i already know that the internal states can't be influenced by the external space cousin the blanket separates them so what does that mean well it means the active states the internal states are now jointly not influenced by external states they only have autonomous dynamics so now you've got a picture of an oil drop that has autonomy it has autonomous states it has autonomous days in the sense that there must be some parts of the surface of the oil drop that are not influenced by the external states and all the interior and together those two states endow even a little oil drop with autonomous states that the because if they are optimizing their variational free energy or their negative elbow their model evidence and that would be an interesting intellectual exercise and you could say you can even go into the realms of pants psychism that everything that exists is implicitly making inferences on self evidencing now we made the next move but what about living things i mean so let me ask you what's the difference between an oil drop and a little tadpole or a little larva nor plankton the picture which is painted of an oil drop just immediately in a matter of minutes took me into the world of pants is where you you just convinced me it made me feel like an oil drop is a living a certainly an autonomous system but almost the living system so as a capability sensory capabilities and acting capabilities and it maintains something so what is the difference between that and something that we traditionally think of as a living system that it could die or you can't i mean a yeah mortality i'm not i'm not exactly sure i'm not sure what the right answer there is because they can move like movement seems like an essential elements should being able to act in the environment but the oil drop is doing that so i don't know easy the mall drop will be moved but does it inner of itself move autonomously well it or the surface is performing actions that maintain its structure you're being too clever i was out of service asserted by a passive it'll all dropped as a sitting there yeah and the bottom of the top of a glacier i guess what i'm trying to say is you're absolutely right you here you've even nailed it it's movement yeah so where does that movement come from if it comes from the inside then then you've got i think something that's living what do you mean from the inside what i mean is that the internal states the can influence the active states that we're acta states can influence but they're not influenced by the external states can cause movement so there are two types of oil drops if you like there are oil drops where the internal states are so random that they average themselves away and the thing can not on a bounce on average when you do the averaging move so a nice example of that will be the sun the sun sony has internal states and there's lots of intrinsic autonomous activity going on but because it's not corded because it doesn't have the deep in the millennial sense a hierarchical structure than the brain does there is no overall mode or pattern or organization that expresses itself on the surface that allows it to actually swim it can certainly have you're a very active surface but on mass at the scale of the actual surface of the sun the average position of that surface cannot in itself move because the internal dynamics are more like a hot gas they are literally like a hot gas whereas your internal dynamics are much more structured and deeply structured and now you can express on your mark of in your active states with your muscles and and your secretary organs yo nam ik novice system and its effectors you can actually move and that's all you can do and that's something which you know if you haven't thought of it like this before i think it's nice just realize there is no other way you can change the universe other than simply moving whether that moving is articulating my with my voice box yeah or walking around or squeezing juices out of my secreting organs there's only one way you can change the universe it's moving and in the fact that you do so non randomly it makes you alive yeah so it's that non-randomness so that the that's what so he's a and that would be manifesting we realize in terms of essentially swimming essentially moving changing one shape a morphogenesis that is dynamic and possibly adaptive so that that's what i was trying to get out between the difference from the oil drop in the little tadpole then the tadpole is moving around its his active states are actually changing the external states and there's now a cycle an action perception cycle if you like a recurrent dynamic that's going on there depends upon this deeply structured autonomous behavior the rests upon internal dynamics that are not only modeling they data impressed upon their surface or the blanket states but they are actively resampling those data by moving they're moving towards chem it's a chemical gradients and chemotaxis so they've gone beyond just being good little models of the kind of world they live in for example an oil droplet could in a pan psychic sense be construed as a little being that has now perfectly inferred it's a passive nonliving oil-drop living in a bowl of water no problem no but to now equipped that oil drop with the ability to go out and test that hypothesis about different states and beings so we can actually push its surface over there over there and test for chemical gradients or then you start to move to much more lifelike form now this is all fun theoretically interesting but it it actually is quite important in terms of reflecting what i have seen since the turn of the millennium which is this move towards it and then inactive and embodied understanding of intelligence and you say you're from machine learning yet so what that means this this sort of the central importance of movement i think has yet to really hit machine learning it certainly has now diffused itself throughout robotics and perhaps you could say certain problems in active vision where you actually have to move the camera to sample this and that but machine learning of the data mining deep learning saw simply hasn't contended with this issue what is done instead of dealing with the movement problem and the active sampling of data is he said we don't need to worry about we can see all the data because we've got big data so we need nor movement so that for me is you know an important omission in current machine learned and clara machine learning as much more like the oil drop yes but an oil drop that enjoys exposure to nearly all the data here single to be spaced as opposed to the tadpoles swimming out to find the right data for example it likes food that's a good hypothesis test down let's go and movin ingest food for example and see what not you know is that evidence that i'm the kind of thing that likes this kind of food so the the next natural question and forgive this question but if we think of sort of even artificial intelligence systems we just painted a beautiful picture of existence and life so do you do you ascribe i do do you find within this framework a possibility of defining consciousness or exploring the idea of consciousness like what you know self-awareness and expand it to consciousness thing yeah how can we how can we start to think about consciousness within this framework is it possible yeah i think it's possible to think about it whether you'll get again i'm not sure that i'm licensed to like question you i think you'd have to speak to a qualified philosopher to either get a definitive answer that but certainly there's a lot of interest in using not just these ideas but related ideas from information theory to try and tie down the the maths and the calculus and the geometry of consciousness either in terms of sort of a minimal consciousness iii even less than a minimal selfhood and what i'm talking about is the ability effectively to plan so have agency so you could argue that a virus does have a form of agency in virtue of the way that it selectively finds hosts and cells to live in and moves around but you wouldn't endow it with the capacity to think about planning and moving in a purposeful way where it countenances the future well as you might announce you might think an ant's not quite as unconscious as a virus it certainly seems to have a purpose it talks to its friends on route chewing its foraging it has a different kind of autonomy which is biotic but beyond a virus so there's something about so there's some line that has to do with the complexity of planning yes that may contain an answer i mean it would be beautiful if if we can find a line beyond which you could say look being as cautious yes it would be these are wonderful lines that we've drawn with existence life and consciousness yes it will be very nice what one little wrinkle there and this is something i've only learned in the past few months is the notion the philosophical notion of vagueness so you're saying it would be wonderful to draw a line and i had always assumed that that line at some point would be drawn until about four months ago and the philosopher told me about vagueness so i know if you've come across this but it's a technical concept and i think most revealingly illustrated with at what point does a pile of sand become a pile is it one grain two grains three grains or four grains so at what point would you draw the line between being a pile of sand and a collection of some of the grains of sand in the same way is it right to ask where would i draw the line between conscious and unconscious and it might be a vague concept having said that i agree with you entirely i know systems that have the ability to plan so just technically what that means is your your inferential self evidencing by which i simply mean the dynamics literally the thermodynamics a gradient flows that underwrite the preservation of your oil droplet light form are described as a canvas who has an optimization of molag bayesian model evidence in your elbow that self evidencing must be evidence for a model of what's causing the sensory impressions on the sensory part of your surface or your markov blanket if that model is capable of planning it must include a model of the future consequences who your active states or your action just planning so we're now in the game of planning as inference now notice what we've made though we've made quite a big move away from big data and machine learning because again it's the consequences of moving it's a consequence of selecting those data or those data or looking over there and that tells you immediately that even to be a contender for a conscious artifact or you know a as its strong ai or general it'll know then you've got to have movement in the game and furthermore you've got to have a german team model of the sort you might find in say a variation or two encoder that is thinking about the future conditioned upon different courses of action now that brings a number of things to the table which which now restart think more those who've got all the right ingredients talk about consciousness i've now got to select an among a number of different courses of action into the future as part of planning i've now got free will the act of selecting this course of action or that policy or that policy or that action suddenly makes me into an inference machine of self evidencing artifact that now looks as if it's selecting amongst different alternative ways forward as i actively swim here or swim there all yes look over here look over there so i think you've now got to a situation if there is planning in the mix you're now getting much closer to that line if that line whatever to exist i don't think it gets you quite as far as self-aware though i think you and then your you have to i think grapple with the question how would formally write down a calculus or a maths of self-awareness i don't think it's impossible to do but i think you would be pressure on you to actually commit to a formal definition or a mumbai self-awareness i think most people that i know would probably say that a goldfish no pet fish was not self-aware they would probably argue about their favorite cat but would be quite happy to say that their mom was self-aware so i mean but there might very well connect to some level of complexity with planning it seems like self-awareness is essential for complex planning yeah do you want to talk about further graphing you're absolutely right again the line is unclear but it seems like integrating yourself into the world into your into your planning is essential for constructing complex plans yes so i'm mathematically describing that in the same elegant way as you however the free energy principle might be difficult well yes and no i don't think that well perhaps we should just can we just go back that's a very important answer you gave like i think if i just unpacked it you know you'd see the truisms or you've just you've just exposed or as bad but let me so yeah iii i'm mindful that i didn't answer your question before well yeah what's the pre hundred principle good for is it just a pretty theoretical exercise to explain non equilibrium city states yes it is it does nothing more for you than that it can be regarded as cuz i'm a arrogant but you know it is of the sort of theory of natural selection or a hypothesis of natural selection beautiful undeniably true but tells you absolutely nothing else you know why you have legs and eyes and you know it tells you nothing about the actual phenotyping and it wouldn't allow you to build something so the free appraisal directly then by itself is is as vacuous as most tautological theories and by tautological of course i'm talking to that you know the theory of naturals the survival of the fittest and once the fittest doesn't survive while this cycles the fitter in disc around in circles is in a sense the free energy principle has that same you know deflationary tautology under your under the hood it's yeah it's two ago it's a characteristic of things that exist why they exist because they minimize their energy while the minified when you as i finish it'll say exist now you just keep on going round and round around but the the what the practical thing which you don't get from natural selection but you could say has now manifest in things like differential evolution or genetic algorithms and i mcmc for example in machine learning the good thing you can get is if it looks as if things that exist are trying to who have density dynamics and because of their optimizing a variational free energy and a variation of free energy has to be a functional of a gerund to model a probabilistic description of causes and consequences causes out there consequences in the sensorium on the sensory parts of the markov blanket then it should in theory possible to write down the generative model work out the gradients and then cause it to autonomously self evidence so you should be able to write down oil droplets you should be able to create artifacts where you have supplied the objective function their supplies the gradients and supplies the self-organizing dynamics to non equilibrium steady state so there is actually a practical application the free energy principle when you can write down your required evidence in terms of well when you can ride down the journey model that is the thing that has the evidence the probability of these sensory data or this data given that given that model is effectively the thing that the elbow of the variation free energy bounds the approximate s-- that means that you can actually write down the model and the kind of thing that you want to engineer the kind of agi odd artificial general intelligence that you want to manifest probabilistically and then you engineer or artwork that you would engineer a robot an a computer to perform a gradient descent on that objective function so it does have a practical implication now why am i witching all about that it did seem rather than to yes so what kinds of j so the answer to what it would it be easy already hard well mathematically is easy i've just told you all you need to do is write down your your perfect artifact probabilistic in in the form of a probability model probability distribution over the causes and consequences of the world in which this thing is immersed and then you just end near a computer and a robot to perform a gradient descent on that objective function no problem but of course the big problem is writing down the generative model so that's where the heavy lifting comes in yeah so it's it's the fall and the structure of that journal team model which basically defines the artifact that you will create or indeed the kind of artifact that has self-awareness so that's where all the hard work comes very much like natural selection doesn't tell you in the slightest why you have eyes so you have to drill down on the actual feeling time the actual giant ear model so with that in mind what did you tell me that tells me immediately the kinds of gentle models i would have to write down in order to have self-awareness what you said to me was i have to have a model that is effectively fit for purpose for this kind of world in which i operate and if i now make the observation that this kind of world is effectively largely populated by other things like me ie you then it makes enormous sense that if i can develop a hypothesis that we are similar kinds of creatures this is in fact the same kind of creature but i am me and you are you then it becomes again mandated to have a sense of self so if i live in a world that is constituted by things like me basically a social world a community then it becomes necessary now for me to him further it's me talking and not you talking i wouldn't need that if as on mars by myself or if i was in the jungle as a feral child if there was nothing really if there's nothing like me around there would be no need to have an inference that a hypothesis are yes it is me that is experiencing or causing these sounds and it is not you it's only when there's ambiguity in play induced by the fact that there are others in that world so i think then the special thing about self-aware artifacts is that they have learned to or they have acquired or least are equipped with possibly by evolution jarrett of models that allow for the fat there are lots of copies of things like them around and therefore they have to work out it's you and not me that that's brilliant i've never thought of that i never thought of that that the purpose of the the really usefulness of consciousness or self-awareness in the context of planning existing in the world is so you can operate with other things like you and like you couldn't it doesn't have to necessarily be human it can be other kind of similar creatures and some absolutely we would view a lot of our attributes into our pets don't waste them or we try to make our robots humanoid and i think there's a your deep reason for that that it's this much easier to read the world if you can make the simplifying assumption that basically or me and it's just your turn to talk and i mean when we talk about pairing when you talk specifically about planning the highest.if manifestation or realization of that planning is what we're doing now i mean the human condition doesn't get any higher at least talking about the philosophy of existence and kind of the conversation but in that conversation there is a a you know a beautiful art of turn-taking and it mutual inference theory of mind i have to know when you want to listen i have to know when you want to interrupt an to make sure that you're online i have to have a model in my head of your model in your head that's the highest the most sophisticated form of generative model where the generative model actually has a gentle model something else is gently model and i think that and what we are doing now evinces the kinds of geritol models that would support self-awareness because without that we birdly talking over each other or we'd be singing together in a in a choir you know where which is probably not that's not a bridge analogy for what i'm trying to say but you know we wouldn't have this discourse yeah what dance of it yeah that's right dallas to have as i interrupt i mean that's beautifully put i'll really listen to this conversation many times there's so much poetry in this and in mathematics let me ask the silliest or perhaps the biggest question as the last kind of question we've talked about living in existence and an objective function under which these objects would operate what do you think is the objective function of our existence what's the meaning of life what do you think is the for you perhaps the purpose the source of fulfillment the source of meaning for your existence as as one blob in this soup i'm tempted to answer that as a physicist free energy i expect consequent upon my behavior so technically that we are and we get a really interesting conversation about what that comprises in terms of searching for information resolving uncertainty about the kind of thing that i am but i suspect that you you you you you want a slightly more personal and financier and but which is can be consistent with that and i think it's reassuring it's simple and harps back to what you were taught as a child that you have certain beliefs about the kind of creature and the kind of person you are and all that self evidencing means all that minimizing variational free energy in a net in an inactive and embodied way means is fulfilling the beliefs about what kind of thing you are and of course we're all given those scripts those narratives very early as usually the form of bedtime stories or fairy stories a i'm a princess i'm gonna meet a beast who's going to transform a baby a prince and the narratives are all around you from your parents to the to the friends to the society feeds these stories and then then your objective function is to fulfill exactly now the narrative that has been in cultured by your your your immediate family but as you say also the sort of the culture in which you made you grow and you create for yourself i mean again because of this active inference this is an inactive aspect of self evidencing you know not only am i modeling my environment my ecognition my my external states out there but i'm actively changing them all the time and it still isn't doing the same back we're doing it together so there's a a synchrony that means that i'm creating my own culture over different time scales so the question now is for me being very selfish what scripts were i given it basically was a mixture between an einstein and shark holmes so i smoked as heavily as possible try to avoid too much interpersonal contact yet enjoy the other fantasy that the the you know you're a popular scientist who's gonna make a difference and it's like a quirky way so that's what's where i grew up on my father my father was an engineer and love science and enough he loved real sort of things like sir arthur and his space-time and gravitation which was the the other the first understandable version of general relativity and he so although all the fairy stories i was told as i was growing up were all about these characters i'm keeping the hobbit out of this because i was quite nervous there's a journey of exploration suppose it's not so yeah i've just grown up to be what i imagined a mild-mannered sherlock holmes slush a lon star would would do it in my shoes and you did it elegantly and beautifully carl was a huge island talking today was fun thank you so much for your time don't thank your shame you
