foreign [music] i almost can't believe we're finally here i've reviewed so many products over my lifetime on youtube that's almost ridiculous and the question always comes up in the background well marquez when are you gonna make design your own product right so two years of materials work and design work and basically a lifetime of inspiration later i'm actually holding the thing this is the first one it's called m251 why is it called 251 you might be asking good question i'm glad you asked so this is still a collaboration after all i could have all the ideas for shoe stuff in the world but i still need someone to build the shoe so adams is the company that's come through for me on this one they've had their model triple o and then model 001 they've inhaled some of the most comfortable shoes of all time and i agree but this would be something completely new for both of us the length of my first ever youtube video on tech yeah that one was two minutes and 51 seconds long a new beginning and that's also sort of a new beginning [music] now if you know me you already knew i like shoes but i'm not suddenly a shoe designer out of nowhere so the idea was that i would take all sorts of bits and pieces from different shoes that i like shoes that i've worn shoes that i've seen and try to combine as many of that in one place as i possibly can so the lightweightness of nmds the silhouette of jordan ones things like the the soul and the elastic laces of adam's shoes and the little bits and details and tiny things from blazers and off-white collabs and so we went through a lot of prototypes and a lot of things like that to sort of accomplish that put them all in one place so the process was really fun actually and we went through as many combinations as possible and went through a ton of different ideas and designs we're trying to figure out what was possible and what wasn't in a shoe we have a lot of older prototypes that we didn't go with that had things like fitment issues and support issues and material issues and we went through and basically adams could tell me like this will be possible versus this won't be possible this will be more expensive versus this won't be more expensive and so all the different parts of the shoe had to come together from our combination of expertise and my taste it was one of the most fun processes i've ever gone through and then the other part of that was i literally got to wear them around and start testing them so once we got working prototypes like this one i wore for weeks literally started showing up in videos by accident just because i was just daily driving these things every day testing my own creation so we went through dozens of samples over two plus years i mean this is a long process where like we have an idea for a youtube video and we can make that in a couple of days this is something that's been in our heads and in the background for a long time but we finally have come to a final version and i really really like it and i'm now excited to like get you guys to actually wear it and try it yourselves so now i can review my own product actually i'm really excited for other shoe reviewers to be able to do that but what i can do is tell you all about it so the silhouette is pretty simple right it's not fully high top but obviously not a low top either it's a really comfortable daily mid and this upper is a combo of synthetic leather and then we actually have a recycled mesh fabric that's a nice balance between breathable and supportive and i took a lot of samples to get that right and if you're curious development wise this soul was actually the hardest part so i'm on my feet all day my job as a video producer in this studio does involve a lot of walking it's a lot of moving around and crouching and kneeling and all kinds of stuff like that so comfort is a high priority so this outsole has to be supportive enough to actually function and hold up the shoe so it doesn't collapse but also still be soft enough through the midsole that's really comfortable and this bottom sole is proprietary it's all very i don't know camp together super nicely we also did something a little bit interesting just if you see the the shape along the side so this is a little bit structural it's a little heel to toe drop so if you're used to wearing shoes that are a lot flatter like jays or converses you will notice and feel a bit of a difference with this shape and it's really good there's a copper lining in here that's naturally antimicrobial which does help prevent odors which is awesome my signature and size stamp is on the tongue we've got this loop on the back too which is actually functional and that's where we put the atoms logo which is the top one here and the mkbhd parallelogram in the same style and of course the elastic laces underrated a lot of people don't know about these but you can sort of just treat them like normal laces maybe tie them a little looser or tighter and then they flex a little bit to support your foot as you're moving around there's little details like the new york city tag the 251 is stitched even taking it apart even the soul is a custom designed and it kind of cups your foot a little bit and is soft as well all this stuff is awesome i really couldn't be happier with how these turned out now if you get these you have to promise me one thing wear your kicks i i am such like there's this whole culture of like you get shoes and then you have to like baby them and take really good care of them for proper resale value no no you gotta actually daily these and like wear them out and put them to work i still get i still get roasted on instagram for like crouching down in a picture and then the toe boxes crease and then all the comments are like what are you doing you're ruining your shoes no wear your kicks crease your kicks wear them in all four seasons i'm gonna be dailying these things we put a lot of work into the engineering of them to be able to do that so winter spring summer fall snow mud you'll be able to see mine on social media getting dirty as i wear them a ton we love that so i'm gonna make sure these are available as worldwide as we possibly can and maybe you'll even see me pop up in a retail shop once in a while to help just get the word out about them and i hope if you get them that you wear them too so this 251 is an exciting new beginning also i've been waiting a long time to do this [music]
