corruption hypocrisy greed what the pandora papers expose about the super rich is that it's not about whether you're democrat or republican it's not about whether you're black or white it's not about whether you're from the north or south what it's about is whether you have 50 million dollars to put in an offshore bank account and not pay taxes on because it turns out we have 2.94 terabytes to prove what i could have told you in about three seconds it's a big club and you ain't in it listen guys welcome to the 10 million dollar studio you know the saying okay we have been playing checkers while the super rich have been playing offshore tax evasion i'm not gonna go into all the details of the pandora papers as you guys probably know it's the third installment from the the icij international consortium bunch of journalists working super hard to do a ton of work that you should go read the original source material of i'm just gonna tell you the big high level takeaways okay because i'm not here to to read 2.94 terabytes for you okay i'm i'm gonna be here a long time if i try to do that instead what i'm gonna tell you are the high level details and then guys do your do your civic duty and go read it or do what everyone else does and don't but i think you should know this basically the pandora papers is just a continuation of what we've kind of known for a while from these icij guys as i said third installment panama papers paradise papers maybe you've heard of it a bunch of people lost their jobs a journalist even got fired for leaking this information it just exposed the super rich did sort of what we knew they were doing all along they aren't paying taxes ladies and gentlemen that's right left or right apparently when you pass a certain threshold of wealth you become violently allergic to paying taxes because it's not just the guys on the right who are all about low taxes that aren't paying it's everybody it's not just the people who are for corruption you know those pro-corruption politicians that always come out there and put their platform on pro-corruption it's not just those guys that are hiding their money illegally it's actually sort of everybody take for instance this man the czech prime minister andrej babis he promised to fight tax evasion and increase transparency and surprise surprise the man evaded taxes himself apparently in 2009 he bought a french estate through shell companies in tax havens but that's okay because when in france buy an offshore friction state i don't know this man's so rich that they're even calling it a chateau at this point dude you're not even in a mansion it's a chateau of course he didn't disclose it didn't appear on his taxes so they asked him about it and he he declined he declines to answer but it's not just the czech prime minister who sucks turns out everyone sort of dies jordan's king abdullah apparently also is the guy who promised to end corruption that's the funniest thing a politician could ever say they always end up surprise surprise corrupt anyways apparently he while daddy usa was pouring financial aid in he was funneling it back out to a bunch of property yeah well we were spending money on him he was spending money on us accumulating some a luxury hotel empire to rival the hiltons i mean this man was spending money like no tomorrow all the while getting up on his pedestal and preaching how people need to be stop being corrupt i mean how do these people honestly live i really do believe i mean i know this is crazy this is tinfoil this is not true but i believe that politicians are a different breed of human how can you stand up on a stage and say hey we need to stop taxable we need to stop corruption all the while you got the guys going out and buying these secret tax haven properties for you it's completely insane and if you'd like proof of that we also have the kenyan president as well flexing the weird lies that only politicians seem uniquely capable of listen to what this joker said it is time to get tough on those who seek to use positions of power for their own personal gain this guy that this is this is the anti-corruption hero of kenya now of course this man who's against using his personal position of power for personal gain somehow is the richest man in all of kenya which is kind of hilarious you can see it right here he's he's literally the bill gates over there but yeah he's he's against corruption and of course it turns out surprise surprise the man is buying up offshore islands offshore private private private villas you know probably some chateaus to get in there with it it's like they can't help themselves they're incapable when they get in positions of power of just that you know i put my hand in the cookie jar but finally we get to see them unmasked for what they are that's why these files are so important and why these people are absolutely crapping themselves right now i mean look let me be honest with you guys people like this people with this much money they don't have a lot of problems just could if anyone who told you that money doesn't solve any problems it's not it's not true they're sitting there on their little french chateau drinking some wine but you know what does make them actually worry the one thing that does is this kind of stuff when when the rest of the world gets to see them with their pants down and gets to see once and for all how corrupt these jokers are left right front center and honestly it's unbelievable to me that these people expect the rest of us to pay our fair share of taxes while these guys with way more money can't even do it even the even the politicians don't pay their taxes the politicians who preach at you of paying your fair share or say that the super wealthy need to pay their fair share while they own like 20 private islands i mean i don't want to be too doomer about this but i really do not believe that that many people in this report are gonna go to jail maybe that's a little cynical but it just always seems like these guys always slink out untouched all of a sudden you know cause when you're rich is it really a crime is it really a problem and you know what i think is most telling about these types of investigations which i really do believe are deeply important right but what i think is that a lot of times not much happens from these sure a few people's heads might roll yeah like you know people might lose their job and stuff but very very rarely do any of these people go to jail for what they've done very rarely do we ever arrest anybody why because suddenly when it's a super rich person having to deal with another super rich person and locking them up all of a sudden that sounds crazy it's crazy to think that we'd ever criminally punish any of these people for what they've done be they're they're sort of the legal crooks if you will but meanwhile you know a poor person steals from from a gas station everybody loses their mind right that's that's what we got to crack down on throw that guy in jail for 2000 years but all of a sudden you steal money from the government you steal money that way this this this offshore way you're rich dude don't worry about it dude we got your back it's so telling the super rich protect the super rich that's just the way of the world so i'm just gonna go out and say it my takeaway from this whole thing was that yes the super rich are not paying their taxes surprise surprise but even more than that i think what this really exposes is that this isn't about whether you voted red or blue whether your boy is going to show up on these tax havens it's about how much money you got on your checkbook so i don't know if people are ever going to wake up and realize that the game is rigged but it is because the same thing we saw them doing in 2016 is the same thing we find them doing a few years later and it's the same thing we find them doing today so if you think this is gonna stop i don't know you might have another thing coming but i do have to give a huge congratulations to the journalists who got this published this is true journalist work i'm very proud that we still have people who are this willing to put their lives on the line of releasing this stuff because it is absolutely dangerous to leak this sensitive of documents about this powerful of people and the fact that a team of journalists got together and worked on this stuff i think is a true testimony that we do still have some hope i mean yes it is a little black pill but the fact this stuff still gets out there still does have some impact is at least what warms my heart at night so that's basically it i just want to do a quick quick reaction of this because i saw it go live i knew you guys would wonder what the internet detective thinks about corruption at this magnitude and yeah it's it's kind of weird it's kind of like a legal kind of scamming is what you ultimately find we usually talk about illegal scamming but there's very legal scamming going on as well and you can look no further than the pandora papers maybe we'll do a few stories on it as more of them come out but with that said thanks for watching i will see you guys
