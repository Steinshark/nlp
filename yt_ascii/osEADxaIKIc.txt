- planes and these
multidimensional spaces, how difficult of an
idea is that to come to, do you think, if you
- yeah. - look back in time?
- yeah. - [interviewer] i think,
mathematically it makes sense, but i don't know if it's intuitive for us to imagine
- right. - [interviewer] just as we
were talking about, feels like calculus is easier to
- i see! - intuit.
- yeah. well calculus, i have to admit calculus came earlier,
- (chuckles) - earlier than linear algebra. so newton and leibniz were the great men to understand the key ideas of calculus. but linear algebra, to
me, is like, "okay!". it's the starting point,
'cos it's all about flat things.
- (chuckles) - calculus has got-- all the complications of calculus come from the curves, the bending, the curved surfaces. linear algebra, the surfaces are all flat, nothing bent in linear algebra. - (chuckles)
- so, it shoulda come first, but it didn't. and calculus also comes first in high school classes,
and in college class, it'll be freshman math,
that'll be calculus. and then i say, "enough of that!" like, "okay, get to the good stuff." and
- (chuckles) do you think linear
algebra should come first? - well it really--i'm okay with it not coming first, but it should. yeah, it should. it's simpler! - [interviewer] 'cos
everything is flat (chuckles) - [guest] yeah everything's flat. well of course, for that reason calculus sort of sticks to one dimension, or eventually it'd do multivariate, but that basically means two dimensions. linear algebra, you take
off into 10 dimensions. no problem. - it just feels scary and dangerous to go beyond two dimensions,
- well-- - that's all (chuckles)
- (chuckles) if everything is flat, you can't go wrong.
