[music] what's up mkbhd here and this is the iphone 12 and the iphone 12 pro the ones a lot of people have been waiting for but also the controversial ones a little bit because of this new unboxing experience but you all know this was coming apple knew this was coming let's just get right into it also by the way by the time you see this video i will have been using and testing these new iphones for a couple of days now some into the review process so definitely make sure you subscribe to be able to see that right away as soon as it comes out and also if you're under the shirt just shout out mcbhd.com but here we have the two new smaller boxes and we also have some other stuff too that we're going to get into that's sort of also part of the iphone 12 story but we'll get into that in a second but here you go this is the new smaller iphone box everybody's talking about that also other iphones will start shipping with and we might as well get inside and see why it's smaller let's start with the iphone 12 product red for this one and it really is pretty striking visually just to see a box that's like half the volume it normally is because it's half the height and as you get inside you can see the phone is right on top face down the footprint is basically the whole box with a little bit of padding so i imagine the pro max box will have to be a little bigger and then maybe the mini box is even smaller but we might as well get to that plastic peel it's pretty simple this time and right away that is the product red iphone 12 looking not actually that red but i'll get into that in a second but let's finish the unboxing we do have the cable here usbc to lightning the only other stuff in the box is the paperwork which is all in this little half-sized pamphlets the product red sheet the sim card removal tool and a single sticker so just just one white sticker with the iphones now and that's it no wall brick no headphones just a phone and a cable in a box basically all right let's take a look at the iphone 12 pro same exact size phone so same exact size box just all black now since the pro phones are all with these dark themes so the black box with blue accents for the pacific blue phone but yeah once you get inside phone's right up on the top and the contents of the box are in fact the same no special fancy colored stickers for the pro or anything and no product red sheet obviously just a phone and a cable and that's the unboxing for iphone 12 and iphone 12 pro so the controversy just to address it right off the bat is the the no charging brick in the box apple's defense of it is it's it's an environmental benefit meaning they won't have to ship all these these chargers and materials that are just going to end up in landfills anyway because people already own charging bricks fair but the thing is the wall brick that they're talking about that they've been shipping with the iphone since the beginning of time that everybody has already is the usb-a wall brick and they're shipping a usb-c cable with the iphone 12. the only people that have a usb-c wall brick are people who bought the iphone 11. so most iphone 12 buyers that only have the usb a wall brick will have to also go out and buy a usbc wall brick which apple will conveniently sell you so you can see how that looks either way this is my first look at the new iphones in person actually feeling them in the hand and i gotta say i am definitely a fan of the updated like industrial design they look and feel great to me really solid a little heavy actually the boxy sides are everything i wanted as far as taking inspiration from the ipad pro or even iphone 4 or iphone 5 errors of phones antenna lines near the corners super tight tolerances a flat screen pretty minimal camera bump but not zero i think they would have looked even better with usb-c at the bottom but you know i guess we're never going to get that but generally the square sides make it i think more grippable like some people may find it a little a little bit sharp actually at first and a little less comfortable but hey people out here are putting cases on every phone so i guess i shouldn't look too much into that but i think it looks nice it also happens to stand up on its own so that's pretty sweet what i will say though is the iphone 12 pro has the glossy stainless steel sides and the iphone 12 has the more matte aluminum sides and i honestly prefer the aluminum sides like the fingerprints you catch on stainless steel don't look great it's the same reason i don't want the stainless steel apple watch i feel like it's just a little bit neater it's also a little bit lighter these phones are the exact same size and i mean exactly the same like cases that fit one fit the other but the iphone 12 pro weighs 192 grams thanks to stainless steel and an extra camera and the iphone 12 weighs 162. basically i wish i could make like a hybrid between these two builds because i also like the satin on the back of the pro phones instead of this glossy back and i also don't i feel like this isn't really red like apple's actually notorious for always changing up colors so you never quite know if one space gray is the same as another space gray but the same thing also happens with product red and this is the least red product red i've seen so far from every angle it looks much more peach like like red orange or coral but yeah now you know a lot of people were wondering what the extra cutout is on the right side of that phone underneath the power button since all the other buttons are on the other side and that is just the cutout for the 5g antennas because yes all of these new iphones have 5g and that'll of course be examined in the full review and other than that i mean you probably already recognize everything about these phones it's still looking very much like an iphone same notch up at the top but of course the much better looking oled display on the iphone 12 that essentially matches what we've seen on these pro phones so these two phones are as expected very close to each other in a lot of ways likely on purpose and i'll get to the price analysis in the full review video but i want to dive into something a little more that's actually new with these which is magsafe so all these new iphones now have magnets in the back embedded in the wireless charging coil for compatible accessories they're calling it magsafe so they're bringing the name back and there is potential for a whole world of new mag safe accessories that slap onto the back of the phone with magnets right now i don't know about you but my first question when i saw this was huh okay that is going to depend entirely on how strong these magnets actually are so now that we have it how strong are they and what do they like to use well what better way to visualize what's happening here than some good old-fashioned magnet paper so this is what happens when you put magnet paper up to an old iphone iphone 11 there's nothing really here except down here at the bottom which is actually just the speakers in the bottom of the phone so when you put the magnet paper on an iphone 12 boom you can immediately see these concentric circles and then these lines straight down them for alignment so anything that's going to work with magsafe and slap onto the back of the phone and align itself has to line up with these and i just happen to have some magsafe accessories here as well so the most important one of course being the magsafe charger which is this thin little hockey puck attached to a wire with usbc at the other end it's not a super long cable it's three feet and the puck itself basically resembles like a giant apple watch charger it's flat it's metal on the outsides it's white plastic on the inside and it just slaps onto the back of the phone like this it's actually pretty much precisely centered over the logo so it's an easy spot to find and it's firm but obviously since it's just a circle it doesn't align with those other three lines underneath so it can spin freely which is kind of neat and when you get it connected i believe there's an nfc chip inside that tells the iphone what accessory it just connected to and plays an animation on the screen accordingly so when you connect just the mag safe charger you get just this little circular magsafe charging animation and it's charging at 15 watts cool then there's accessories like this magsafe wallet that they showed boom it has all the corresponding magnets inside to match up with the alignment of the iphone and when you connect it it just kind of snaps onto the back in place again somewhat firmly but it's not super strong and then it just plays the appropriate animation so just to show you it knows what accessory was attached there's no extra settings or info on the phone but it just it just knows then same here with this whole magsafe case it's a full case that has the magnetic coils inside and you can see again those magnets super clear as day and when you put it on the phone the whole screen lights up because it knows a whole case is now on the phone now just in case you're wondering why would you need a whole magsafe case what's the point so if you have the iphone and the magsafe case you attach it shows the animation realizes the case is on a specific blue animation which is cool for the case and now you can still attach that puck onto the back of the phone and you're gonna charge through magsafe so it's going through the case so that's the benefit of the compatible case and yet still if you have this little wallet accessory and throw it on the back here of the case it still recognizes through the case what accessory is happening but if i try to charge through the wallet and the case it actually still magnetizes but it doesn't charge so it seems like the limit to how many accessories i mean of course the wallet is magnetically shielded because you don't want to have the cards inside get messed up but even if you put a second thing on the back i don't think that would be very efficient so yeah one layer of having a case on your phone and still using magsafe fine that's good but yeah i think that's the limit too so anyway my take on magsafe is it's it's kind of cool but not quite as cool as i was hoping mainly because of the strength of the magnets it's it's a little loose now we'll see if third-party accessory makers can use stronger magnets in their accessories to better attach to the iphone but i was imagining something like a car mount may be coming out where it's just holding it up with magnets but if you go over a bump like this magnet's not going to hold it up so i'm i'm curious how that goes with with accessories you really want to stay attached but even look at this this is the the wallet mount which you'd really want to stay attached but even with this wallet case putting it in my pocket it can easily just pop right off just slide right off and that's your wallet that's like the one thing you definitely want to for sure stick to the phone the strongest right so we'll see we'll see what this ecosystem brings another fun fact though this is still technically it's all chi it's a chi wireless charger so if you have another android phone with qi wireless charging it actually magnetizes to the back and wireless charges many other android phones so if you're into that you can buy apple's wireless charger and troll apple and take pictures of your android phone wireless charging with magsafe every phone's had magsafe guys but anyway that's that's it that's the first impressions and hands-on like i said i've been using these phones now for a couple days so the review is in the works but let me know what you guys would want to see in that video and of course there's a bunch more coming up because it's tectober that's just what's going on right now so that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
