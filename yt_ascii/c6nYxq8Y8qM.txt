android has been with us for about 15 years now and it runs on around three billion devices way more than even windows so today we're going to look back at every version of android ever starting out with 1.0 which came out way back in 2008 in an innocent time it looked a little something like this with the first mass-market android phone being the htc dream featuring 256 megs of storage an actual physical keyboard and an incredibly life-like display that slid away from the main body you get that satisfying kind of click sound we hang up but unsurprisingly not everyone wanted an easily breakable sliding screen so it was good that android 1.5 cupcake released in 2009 introduced support for auto rotation as well as an on-screen keyboard it also allowed for third-party widgets setting the stage for everyone and their mother to come out with a weather forecast on your home screen we got android 1.6 donut later in 2009 which gave quality of life improvements like better scaling for different sized phones as well as text to speech support but 2.0 eclair came later that same year and represented a bigger improvement that introduced multi-touch support and a large suite of photo editing features as well as an incessant ad blitz for the og motorola droid the next year we got android 2.2 froyo which allowed you to use your phone as a wi-fi hotspot and also supported adobe flash for as long as that was relevant and he could even play animated gifs yes i say gifs marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of human society this was followed by 2.3 gingerbread later in 2010 which provided resolutions up to 1366 by 768 along with support for nfc signals and the all-important selfie cam honeycomb or android 3.0 graced us with its presence in 2011 and was actually a tablet only version that introduced a whole new ui design and support for browser tabs and multi-core processors the next version for phones though was android 4.0 ice cream sandwich that one further refined the user experience bringing us swipe to dismiss as well as face unlock which some people actually thought was an unnecessary gimmick but you know it definitely is not a gimmick things that will make your phone less annoying we'll tell you how the next version did that after we tell you about our sponsor freshbooks the invoicing and accounting solution that's built for owners and clients freshbooks

those stupid freemium games 2013's kitkat or android 4.4 helped with optimizing android for lower end devices as there were plenty of phones out that didn't run android all that well but android 5.0 lollipop from 2014 was a bigger deal as it gave us notification cards similar how notifications are handled today this was part of google's push to get their new design language material design onto phones which was supposed to provide visual elements that were cleaner and more intuitive 2015's release was marshmallow 6.0 which gave us support for biometric unlocking via fingerprint can't believe they didn't have it before and usb-c support so we no longer have to fight to insert the cable the right way 2016's android 7.0 nougat didn't have a creamy center but it did give us a split screen option for displaying multiple apps as well as customizable settings icons in the notification shade still with us we're getting to the more modern area of android now with 2017's 8.0 oreo that brought us picture in picture i guess the little screen is like the oreos filling who wrote this along with wider color gamuts and even a self-repair tool called rescue party that could save you from getting stuck in a boot loop android 9 pie from 2018 was the last version to be named after a tasty dessert unfortunately and brought a refresh of material design disabled notifications from apps you habitually dismissed automatically and introduced notch support which is something i know all of us are waiting for with bated breath 2019's android 10 is the oldest version that's still supported at the time we wrote this video and not only did it make our lives easier with simple gestures like swipe to go back which i actually use instead of the buttons but it gave us the long requested system-wide dark mode so that we can obliterate our retinas a little more slowly android 11 released in 2020 clamped down on privacy by restricting when apps could fetch your location and made accessing payment methods and smart home functions a bit easier by holding down the power button but 2021's android 12 gave us another privacy boost by mandating a green indicator whenever the camera or microphone is active alongside a major redesign called material u and aside from the stupid name it looks like it'll be with us for quite a while as a way to distinguish android from its major competitor ios so that's every version of android ever until of course android 13 comes out and we'll have to do this whole video all over again because we're completionists like that thanks for
