hi sean really great to be back on computer file 
we are in the lab again i think a few or maybe   about a year ago you were down here i can't quite 
recall if the instrument was running at the time   but what we're actually going to talk about today 
is based very much on this paper i wish i could   say it's or a paper it's not our paper it's by 
a group led by this guy alex could turian sorry   alex if i've got your name for not pronounce your 
name incorrectly at least you're not stuck with   moriarty for a surname interconnected single atoms 
could make a quantum brain and we're going to talk   about this there's an awful lot of physics we 
need to get through and sean hangs his head back   in pain the camera's not drooping oh 
sorry we'll try and condense our physics down last video we did shows on neuromorphic 
computing which is about trying to take the   type of computing that happens in here rather than 
the sort of on neumann architecture which is what   happens in there and use that to do processing 
because there are certain things our brain does   incredibly well that silicon doesn't do so well 
and vice versa when this particular title popped   up in my physics world institute of physics 
feed it obviously repeat my interest directly   they've basically made neurons out of single 
atoms which is really really quite remarkable   not only have they done that they've got single 
atom neurons and then they've also controlled the   connections between those atoms and the way those 
atoms talk to each other so they've also built   artificial synapses again effectively using single 
atoms so this is really quite remarkable we've got   neuromorphic computing pushed all the way down to 
the atomic level and that work is is based around   an instrument called the scanning tunneling 
microscope now we've talked a little bit about   this before i bored brady harren's ears off over 
on 60 symbols about scanning tunneling microscopes   this is a scanning tunneling microscope all the 
stainless steel surrounding it is because it's in   an ultra high vacuum we're manipulating individual 
atoms we want to have this controlled environment   as possible we don't want lots of contamination 
we're actually working with silicon and if you   were to prepare silicon in air it will oxidize in 
a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a second   so we have everything in ultra high vacuum and a 
pressure comparable to that you have on the moon   and actually in real time what you're seeing 
here these are atomic rows of silicon these   little holes are where atoms are are missing and 
we along with a number of other groups have been   embedding machine learning approaches like 
convolutional neural nets and there have been   lots and lots of videos on computer file about 
convolutional neural nets we've also actually had   a number of very helpful conversations with mike 
pound who i know many of you will be familiar with   on taking machine learning ideas embedding them 
into the scanning probe microscope and instead of   us sitting there laboriously preparing that probe 
we're training the instrument using reinforcement   learning and strategies along those lines to 
actually get the tip in a state where it gets the   best possible image without us having to sit there 
and babysit it for hours days weeks months on end   in a nutshell sharp probe atomically sharp 
you bring it in close to a surface and when   i say close i mean within an atomic diameter 
or so there is a means of doing that 60 symbols   you move it back and forth and you measure 
some type of interaction be that a current   and the tunneling in scanning tunneling microscope 
comes from the fact that it's a quantum mechanical   effect called tunneling that happens on the 
atomic scale or a force and we're now at the   point where you can measure the force and not just 
measure but exploit the force between single atoms   and that's what they've done here they've imaged 
and controlled right down to the single atom level   after that long introduction we're going to 
talk about this particular paper and what i'm   going to do is try and summarize it down to what 
the key ideas are so the paper itself is here   nature nanotechnology an atomic boltzmann 
machine capable of self adaptation   so what's a boltzmann machine well boltzmann 
is an incredibly important physicist   mostly because he thought about the 
statistics of physics he thought about   matter in terms of its component atoms and the 
dizzying bewildering array of gazillions upon   gazillions of atoms you you know try to count 
up the molecules in this room so that makes it a   statistical problem in terms of how those atoms 
interact because you know trying to follow the   trajectory of an individual atom or an individual 
molecule if you have to do that for 10 to the 23   some of you might know where that 10 to the 23 
number comes from in terms of a mole of material   if you have to do it for that number of molle it's 
an impossible task so you think about it in terms   of statistics and that was boltzmann's genius was 
to think about the atomic draw comparisons between   i'm not sure comparisons raw parallels between 
statistics the atomic nature of matter and also   how energy is distributed and that's absolutely 
key his ideas were soundly rejected by some   of the key figures in physics at the time 
particularly boltzmann was one of the first to   really accept the reality as would wear 
of atoms we've been vindicated long before   those images appeared in terms of the evidence 
for atoms but you know he would be blown away   we're seeing individual atoms on the screen we're 
seeing rows of atoms there so where does the   boltzmann machine's idea come from the boltzmann 
machine idea is really clever and physicists   really like it because it involves taking the 
ideas from physics in terms of the distribution   of energy and feeding that into a machine learning 
process in physics you have what we'd call an   energy landscape the simplest possible energy 
landscape is think of two hills with a valley   in between we have a ball it's at the top of 
the hill we let go of that ball what happens it   falls down the hill to get to its lowest energy 
state and actually there are very very few physics   questions that cannot be answered with well the 
system wants to reach its minimum energy state   if you want to use that at dinner party at some 
point or in the pub please feel free to do that   pretty well any question can be answered with that 
of course the devil is always in the details but   it's the system wants to get to its lowest energy 
or what we call the ground state you can think of   much more complicated landscapes energy landscapes 
with lots and lots of hills and valleys and it   doesn't just have to be gravitational potential 
energy if we're talking about atoms and molecules   for example it'll be a type of energy that 
describes how electrons behave which is very   much not gravitational energy and so what we do 
with a boltzmann machine is we take that idea of   minimizing the energy and we couple it across so 
we draw a parallel with trying to find the optimal   solution to a problem so we have a particular 
energy cost or an energy gain associated with   following some trajectory or other and what we're 
searching for in both cases is the minimum energy   state or the optimal solution and that's that's 
where the boltzmann machine idea comes from we're   borrowing from ideas from physics and importing 
those into machine learning what we want to do is   we want to model the brain what do physicists do 
physicists are very reductionist and for example   this is a big wet squishy thing with lots of very 
strange weird stuff happening so what we want to   do is reduce down so the question to ask yourself 
is what do we have in the brain we have neurons   and we have synapses could we have a neuron which 
is basically one atom so we want something whose   state we can change so how do you change the state 
of an atom though is an atom's an atom an atom is   an atom but what's inside that atom inside are the 
electrons so you can change for example a really   simple ways you could have a potassium atom or you 
could have a potassium ion where you've added or   subtracted a charge or you can rearrange how 
the electrons are organized in that atom you   can change the electronic configuration 
leave it neutral but change the electronic   configuration that's a brilliant question 
shown because that's exactly what they've done   in this paper they've changed the state of the 
atom by changing the electronic configuration now   so what we have is the possibility of having a one 
or a zero but also we can flicker back and forth   between those two we can go once it runs stay in 
one state go to the zero state for a little while   go to the one states do the zero state these are 
individual cobalt atoms we don't need to go into   the gory detail of this what we have here are 
individual cobalt atoms what we're imaging here   with our scanning probe microscope is actually 
effectively how the electrons are distributed so   although it's an atom and you might think of an 
atom as a little billiard ball actually what the   stm is sensitive to is the configuration of the 
electrons can you give us a two sentence what's   in an atom for people who haven't like me have 
forgotten so the the traditional model of the atom   two sentences is showing you asking me for two 
sentences on the atom physicists like to reduce yeah the typical model of the atom which 
is called the bohr model which is unbelievably   wrong but it's helpfully wrong is that you've got 
the nucleus at the center of the neutrons on the   protons and you've got the electrons spinning 
around outside it's not how it works quantum   mechanically we don't have these well-defined 
orbits but we certainly have that nucleus at the   center and then the best way of thinking about it 
is you've got some distribution of that electronic   charge right which is effectively like a cloud 
around that nucleus what they're doing here by   is by using the tip and changing the voltage 
on the tip they're changing that that cloud   with that electron cloud and effectively what 
you're imaging there is that electron cloud so   they basically have a two-state system they've 
left to its own devices it flips back and forth   between zero and one right so now with about equal 
probability our energy landscape in this case   is like that right so we've basically got the 
zero state and the one state in terms of what   the atom is and the configuration of the atom is 
bouncing back and forth between those two states   which is why you're getting high current 
low current high current low counter high   current logan and to use the physicist term 
it's stochastic or it's random it's bouncing   back and forth between those two states and so 
in one state let's see call this the zero state   it looks like this in the other state it looks 
like this and that's because the configuration   the electrons in the atom is changing so this 
is our basic model of a neuron right but that's   one so when you bring two of those atoms together 
like this what they then find is that you have a   larger number of different current values or basic 
unit our basic neuron is a single cobalt atom   and that cobalt atom can be in either a zero or 
a one state we're measuring and monitoring what   state that is in by looking at how current flows 
through it from the tip that's above it the zero   state we get a low current in the one state we get 
a high count it doesn't matter which way around   we label those now when you bring those you 
bring two of those atoms together they start to   to affect each other they affect the probabilities 
and now you've got instead of having just two   choices you've got two atoms you've got four 
choices they can both be in the zero state   this one can be in the zero state this can one 
can be in the one state this can be in the one   state this can be in the zeros here or it can both 
be in the one state you've got two bits right so   effectively you've got two bits and indeed that's 
what they see they now see that the current   has four distinct levels or a number of distinct 
levels yeah four distinct levels which is what   they've plotted out then you can add more and you 
can i build up the complexity of your system but   physicists love this idea because it links to 
boltzmann and b it's as reductionist as you get   it's we've broken it down to single atoms instead 
all that wet floppy stuff with gazillions of   bloody atoms widely flopping around in molecules 
we've got an atom on a surface in ultra high   vacuum that we can probe right down to you know 
the electronic configuration that's the type of   thing that physicists love and when that connects 
to computing it's really neat they've even gone   a step further so that's our neurons what they've 
then done is they've basically built in artificial   synapses which is nothing more than an additional 
atom and they bring that additional atom   in and that controls the linkages the weighting 
of the link between those those two neurons   and then they've even gone on further and they've 
actually got this thing to learn to some extent   in that it can detect or remember the voltage 
that's been applied to it by the tip because   that changes the weightings of the connections 
between the neurons it changes the synapses   so that the system can learn 
about its previous experiences and so on we can't do a lot of interesting things 
with this image after just one set of convolutions   but we're getting there so this 
one is starting to be transformed   some of them are noisier than others purity atoms 
in that sample what happens in the real sample   is you have a voltage and 
that generates an electric [manual publish of auto captions]
