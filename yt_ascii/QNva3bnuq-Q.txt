alright guys in this video i'm going to show you 12 of the greatest android mods i've come across all year i think you're gonna like this video so let's get right into it first up we've got jb lock now which allows you to hold down your home button to turn your screen off pretty useful if your device is on table or just in an awkward position and you don't need to root your phone to use this volume control is a handy little bar that hides just above your navigation keys and when you use it it adjusts overall volume not just notification volume and not just media volume all of it to me this is better than the way android traditionally handles volume if you're watching a video on low volume you probably also want any message notifications to also be on low volume substratum is a powerful customization tool but one that would normally need your phone to be rooted but there is a workaround called andromeda which i've used on my note 9 to get it working without this and i've got to say the flexibility gives you over the way your device looks is a lot of fun for example as you can see here you can install a dark mode making all of your menus first party apps as well as whatsapp go dark which not only looks cool but also saves battery on oled screens because black pixels can be turned off frost is a really interesting new way to use facebook as you can see i've got a dark mode running on the phone now but really that's only scratching the surface of the customization on offer here and the app also automatically removes irrelevant and sponsored posts and allows you to download videos directly we've actually seen quite a few different applications like this but battery - is my number one go-to battery indicator once enabled it creates a little notch in a design of your choice at the top of your display which shows your battery percentage and the benefit of that as opposed to having a in your status bar is that it can display across any application as well as change color to indicate when you reach certain percentages now this one is really for the people who are using a flagship samsung smartphone if you find that you're a big user of the edge panels then edge volume control is a bit of a no-brainer once you install it no matter what application you're using on your smart phone you just swipe from the right and you can change all your different volumes separately on the fly so for the people who hold their smartphones in the bottom right like i do this stops you having to reach up for the volume buttons eq phi is brilliant one of my favorites on this list it is a global equalizer for your smartphone it works on spotify too and all i really did was drag up the bass and the mid sliders to compensate for the high pitch speaker output on most phones unseen allows you to remain well just that if you're the kind of person who wants to read your incoming messages straight away without the pressure of feeling like you need to reply then once installed unseen will collate all your messages from all your social medias and allow you to view them here without alerting the other person as someone who loves to work quickly and get things done on time i really appreciated talk faster it's a plug-in for whatsapp that allows you to adjust the speed at which voice messages playback all you need to do when someone sends your voice message is hit the share button and then share it with the application and this little pop-up will appear which allows you to play it faster or even slower and with the option to skip silences for those of you who aren't massive fans of google assistant this mod is a way to get some slightly different functionality out of it once enabled it allows you to remap the action that would have previously bought up the google assistant to quite a few other different things for example you could make it turn the flashlight on or you could use it as a shortcut to open up any one of the applications installed on your phone touch bar is something that i could only get working on about 50% of the phones i tried it on but when it works it's quite a neat solution to making a lot of the commands that are normally at the top of the screen much more reachable it's inspired by the macbook pro touch bar which means you've got volume you've got brightness you've got all your quick settings as well things like airplane mode as well as cellular data then we've got auto phi a way to get your smart phone to read out notifications for you it's pretty handy if you're tryna watch a video or listen to music while at the same time making sure you're keeping up-to-date emails a run meanie testing the new order by mark for android what i would say though is the whilst it's great at reading out short whatsapp messages it's slightly less efficient when it comes to amazon order receipts that might come to your email but you can set it up accordingly alright guys really appreciate you watching till the end if you are new to the channel as always would mean a lot to me if you could smash that subscribe button my name is erin this is mr. who's the boss that'll catch you in the next one [music]
