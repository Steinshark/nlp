passed in 1995 singapore's maintenance of parents act as a filial support law that requires adult children to pay a monthly salary or allowance to their elderly parents like many other countries in asia singapore is aging extremely rapidly the government is working to avoid a concurrent surge in elder poverty various societies throughout history have passed laws like these as a potential solution in this video i want to look at singapore's experience in legislating filial support but first the asianometry patreon early access members get to see new videos and select the references for those videos before their release of the public it helps support the videos and i appreciate every pledge thanks and on with the show singapore's population is one of the fastest aging in the world in 1957 less than four percent of the country's people were older than 65 years old by 1990 the number more than doubled to six percent in 2021 it has risen to 14 alarmingly the proportion has added six percentage points from eight percent to 14 in the past 10 years and with the city state's total fertility at 1.1 births per woman the elder population will rapidly continue to rise current estimates find that by 2050 that number would be a staggering 40 percent singaporeans live some of the longest lives in the world in 2020 the average expected life a span at birth in singapore was about 84 years good for them but we need to also acknowledge that as people age they require more intensive care while simultaneously losing much of their earning capacity how are we to provide for our elders as they age this is not a singapore only problem policy makers around the world are struggling to figure out how to pay for the increasing costs of elderly care in a time of working age population decline one idea that many countries have adopted are called filial support laws these create a statutory duty for adult children to support parents who cannot take care of themselves a modern westerner might find the concept of such laws a bit uncomfortable i know i certainly felt a bit weird about them yet laws exist obligating parents to take responsibility for their younger children why not in the opposite direction filial support laws are not an original idea in fact the west has been passing them for centuries ancient rome likely had such a law back in the 3rd century and england and the united states have had had these laws on the books back in the 1600s for instance let's take the u.s state of virginia it shall be the duty of all persons' years of age or over of sufficient earning capacity or income after reasonably providing for their his or her own immediate family to assist in providing for the support and maintenance of us or her mother or father he or she being then and there in necessities circumstances people back then had such a way with words didn't they the virginia statute allows the adult child to defend themselves if they can present quote substantial advance of desertion neglect abuse or willful failure end quote but has western countries transitioned to government-provided safety nets like medicare and social security these filial support laws have become less relevant england repealed their filial support laws back in 1948. in the 1970s the virginia law was amended to reduce that responsibility if the parent is eligible for public benefits under medicaid while many american states still have these laws in their books they are largely left unenforced furthermore legal scholars have significant questions about whether or not these laws can even be enforced under western constitutions singapore has generally sought to avoid creating a western-style welfare state there are practical financial reasons for this just look at how much it costs to maintain such a safety net in the united states dot net cannot be maintained without higher taxes which the singaporean government believes it cannot easily impose without damaging much of its attractiveness as a place to do business but singapore's founding leaders also believed that western-style welfare systems would encourage laziness and sloth amidst their specific population my asian dad would nod in agreement how do the elders maintain a livable income most elders draw from a portfolio of sources first salaries from jobs second corporate pensions or investments third transfers from their children or other close family fourth transfers from the government singapore sought to encourage elders and future retirees to build up the first three income sources such that to avoid the fourth one thus a series of social programs reinforcing them first is the country's retirement savings plan the central provident fund board or just cpf it is a compulsory savings fund that receives monthly contributions from working age people for elders with bottom twenty percent low incomes the cpf offers a supplementary quarterly cash supplement the silver support scheme or sss second singapore's housing and development board also offers a lease buyback scheme eligible older singaporeans can monetize their home equity and turn it into cash a big deal for most elders since most of their wealth exists in the form of their house third the government took steps to make sure that the elderly can still earn their own money in asia many elders worked long past the age where many westerners retire and their salaries are a critical anti-poverty measure in 1993 singapore passed the retirement and re-employment act which sets the minimum retirement age at 60 and later 62. this protects the elders from losing their jobs solely on the basis of age employers are required to offer re-employment so that the elders can continue working up to age 67. up to 55 percent of singaporean elders continue working in 1984 the government set up a committee to study how countries took care of their 60 plus year old elders this committee noticed that taiwan and israel had filial support laws on their books and recommended that singapore passed them too it triggered a significant debate between policy makers one group felt that such laws would help resist creeping individualism in the singapore youths there was concern that the youths would adopt the western approach to elder care that the state is in practice solely responsible for it despite some support for the idea another committee believed that the law was then unnecessary in a 1983 survey it was discovered that over 95 percent of the elders were receiving money from their children without the need for a law very few parents who asked for such money were rejected when surveyed most children say that they wanted to support their parents out of their own desire policy makers were concerned that this sentiment might change if there was a law in the books requiring it this second committee also brought up another issue that would be a consistent point in the debate asia has filial piety as one of its cultural values and legislating such a squishy thing made a few people feel uncomfortable with the passing of such a law be an indication of a breakdown in family values in singapore would it attract undue attention from the west inflicting damage to singapore's image and implying a failure in society some 10 years later in 1993 however policy support started to gather for exactly such a law existing on the books interestingly it was not because of a surge of news stories on elder abuse or the like it was because of attacks that year the singapore government was poised to pass a goods and service tax it would likely affect a great deal of middle-aged elders cutting into their income in singapore the president can appoint a few members to parliament unaffiliated to any party one of those members professor walter woon suggested afilio's support law as a way to help the elders afford this new tax wounds reasoning goes like this despite the high percentage of children already giving an allowance to their parents there inevitably will be some dodgy individuals the law needs to be able to handle those situations when they inevitably come up following woon's reasoning they act specifically states that it is not intended to promote filial piety or love it is instead about accountability and providing a safety net for the five percent or so of elders who do not receive financial support from their children in his words this bill has got nothing to do with filial piety at all the law cannot legislate filial piety any more than it can legislate love between husbands and wives or parents and children the aim of the bill is to provide a safety net a filial piety fails if you aren't a fan of your asian parents which i am guessing is not uncommon this law does not require you to love them but you do have to support them the law also reinforces an aspect of singaporean culture that the government has repeatedly preached self-reliance the individuals should take self-responsibility and if they were to fail in that the community will not be around to help them has implemented in 1995 the maintenance of parents act mandates that adult children must pay a monthly allowance or lump sum to each singaporean parent over the age of 60 if needed a 2016 survey found that 74 percent of adult singaporean children over the age of 25 gave an allowance to their parents that proportion fell to 70 in 2019. if the adult children refused to do their duty then the parent can sue their child in a special tribunal a third party was also set up to bring cases on the elder's behalf the case goes before a special mediator who reviews the circumstances including whether or not the parent in question quote unquote morally deserves support for instance if the parent has previously abandoned their child or abused or neglected their parenting duties then that obviously has to be taken into account later in 2011 the law was amended to make it mandatory that elder parents first seek conciliation with their children at the office of the commissioner for the maintenance of parents before they can go before the tribunal the act now being in the books its usage has been relatively sparse prior to 2011 about 170 cases a year went in front of the tribunal adding the conciliation process helped steadily reduce the number of those cases to new lows per the ministry of social and family development in 2021 110 cases were lodged with the commissioner this is up from 2020's low of 98 but a decrease in the annual caseload numbers from 2017 to 2019. however one should also mention that elderly singaporean parents even those in financial hardship are reluctant to take their adult children to court this means that the visible statistics might far under count the actual number there is more to elder care than just the financial aspect there is also a lifestyle and health issue too elders require more health care services than the youth there are more frequently hospitalized often due to chronic diseases or conditions with no cure and when they do they tend to stay in the hospital longer 21 days or more these tend to create hospital bed crunches and spates of high occupancy rates despite government initiatives to limit the cost and effort of long-term care family members rather than institutions are still first in line to bear the brunt of these changes currently there is no filial support law handling these physical efforts and it is unclear whether singapore or any country would be able to legislate them in the past 20 years india and china and bangladesh have passed their own filial support laws it is a reflection of new needs in asian countries for supporting the elderly without layering on potentially back-breaking financial responsibilities onto the government elder poverty is a very real thing living in asia i cannot help but feel for all the elders i see here working labor-intensive menial jobs but at the same time i do wonder if the filial support concept potentially accelerates the societal aging process by robbing peter to pay paul it is something for other countries to consider all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the channel sign up for the newsletter and i'll see you guys next time
