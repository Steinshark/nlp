and we seem to be live hello and welcome to this smallish panel on inclusion and diversity and i think we're gonna start with a small introduction round so that you know who everyone is and so let's get started so amiens my role is more as a technical moderator chandler is a bit in the role of you know scheduling and moderating a bit with me and also you know having opinions on diversity it has two and then we have the panelists and unfortunately everyone from the panelists could come there were a few cancellations so that's what we have right now maybe we have a few people join later i will bring them in if that's the case otherwise let's get started with the introduction so that's already mentioned my name is chandler but just so you all know why i'm here i think diversity inclusivity and equity are some of the things i really care most about in the sql quest world and i'm just really happy to kind of support the three fabulous panelists we have here and i'll kick off introductions and i think tina why don't you why don't you lead off with introductions yeah sure hi my name is tina i'm super special c plus plus developer for about six years now it's not my first job i did something before i'm not that young i work for the rosen technology and research center and yeah we do online expect the inspections of oil and gas platforms so that's what i'm doing fantastic for the records it was my first job and and so i have no experience at all it's really tragic patricia why don't you introduce yourself yes hi i'm patricia wells i'm a superstar developer and working in superplus for 16 years and it was my it was my first job with seattle but i haven't doubled another witches as well and i work for a company that i co-founded which is called turtlesec which does consulting in like the area of pro like between programming and security in various programming languages and and i've worked at developer software working in the upper browser and vivaldi working on the vivaldi browser and even made some telepresence systems at cisco so yeah fantastic why don't you introduce yourself hi i'm hannah and also my first job and i'm working in six plus i think it's now 13 years probably i'm not sure exactly and i work in avast and we we are also sponsor of like diverse data exclusion initiative on this conference and i think ends know the exact number yes you are mute and thank you for the sponsorship from avast and hannah of course and yeah so we have 38 if i calculate correctly no 39 yeah i think 39. 28 students and 11 support tickets so that's 39. and then i want to you know we have another panelist which has arrived welcome philippe you have given a talk at the conference and agreed to join the panel so we're just finishing the introduction around and the gorgeous years yeah please introduce yourself oh we may have lost internet yeah it looks it looks like possibly lost internet okay we will we'll add fleet back if we can yeah so is that why coach all right ah and it's back philippe please introduce yourself possibly uh i'm sorry i'm having a little bit of trouble okay i'm having trouble with my internet connection i don't know why why it's working not working right now so my name is philip mulonde i am from angola it's a country in the south of africa i hold a bachelor's degree in software engineering from the st petersburg technique university from russia and i'm currently a master degree student in ai on machine learning at the same university yes i think that's all fantastic so the audience should have some questions but yeah so i don't want to wait for the audience to have questions so china do you have like an opening question absolutely i'd love to just hear from from each of the panelists just you know a a short the the most recent experience that you've encountered it can get work it can be you know just interacting with the broader industry or community where kind of people's inclusive behavior had had a positive impact on on you just like whatever the most recent time you remember someone doing something that really made you feel included made you feel welcome in in participating in kind of a professional context who wants to to go for something they remember that was that yes patricia that was that was basically i've been fighting to norwegian technical newspapers for about two weeks now so maybe not me positive i was i was aiming for positive experiences yeah exactly that's why i didn't put my hand up now i have to say that i have to say yeah i have i have been fighting the two major technical newspapers in norway for the past two weeks but the the large majority of the technical community in norway across all programming languages have have been extremely supportive so so i've hardly had any pushback if people have agreed with me on on my points which was basically publishing anti-women content is is not something we do in 2021 in the tech industry and they should just stop so so so basically i have to say that on the whole even though it was it was a fight that i know a lot of men even were afraid to do a lot of men dm'd me saying that this was too scary for them to do i did get a lot of support behind the scenes and and publicly so so i would say that that is a good sign at least unfortunately these are you know the largest technical outlets in norway so it's still you know anyone else have a a memory of something that where they just felt like they were included or welcomed what is worth patricia i'm just counting through the support you got i think the sport is really wonderful there hannah go ahead i'm not sure i recently like it's actually actually a year and a half or something we start big dni active activity in alaska and we are actively pushing people to think about things differently to fight bias and from at the moment i don't have like any anything personal but like the percentages of people staying is like certainly much bigger for women and so it's like objective measurement like so that's that's positive i think that's fantastic so it's not it's not like in vain these activities not just mentoring but also like actively creating positions for universe pushing managers you don't want to just hire seniors you want to also hire universe and you want to teach them so yeah that really helps and i can see difference it's small steps anything everything not sure it's not too recent but ever since i joined the hash include discord server i felt like very included in the superspace community or at least in this part of the super sports community and they all encouraged me to give talks and i'm still very new to that and still very nervous but i think it's up internal was in an amazing experience and also my employer is very supportive of me doing this and yeah so that's what makes me feeling that's fantastic so i'll i'll ask my my other kind of prompt question but this is this one if you just like top first thing that comes to mind like if there was something that you could kind of ask uh colleagues or or people you interact with professionally to to stop doing not something big and serious but like a little thing that you know bugs you in some way they're sometimes called microaggressions but it can just be something that annoys you and and you know you really would like for people to take an extra effort to try and avoid what would that one thing be i have three okay honey you can have three go for it okay first stop using them like female developers that's annoying me really much second stop using guys hey guys you guys and third that's my like my my my small fight stop removing accents and their critics from names so if something on something like on some pages and please type it in asking only no my name is a is long not short i if i say guys at some point here please call me out on it i i'm i'm now really worried i'm gonna mess this up but i'll try i will be trying who else has something they would just like to kind of you know politely ask people to to you know take down a set tina go ahead yeah i have something but i noticed a lot with mostly with new colleagues but also when i joined my team because i'm the only woman in my team people assume i don't know anything it's it's i know they don't mean badly it's fires i know that but i want people to be more aware of that and if a man joins the team with the same experience that i had back then they are believed right away that they can do the job and it was not the case for me yeah patricia what a 1 000 i could walk into a team with 10 years of professional experience and i would be treated as less confident than a newly grad guy that didn't program sleepless plus in his life it's it's ridiculous and so and it's happened again and again and again so so being assumed not competent being assumed that you are are not there as as a developer that you are in some other role and yeah being not being listened to being a you know talk down to ignored oh yeah all of those things yes very much but as a as another person in the room i would say having like in in a meeting i've had all of these things happen to me a million times i almost never had a guy say that's not okay but i've had a bunch of guys go to me privately after the meeting saying oh what they did to you in the meeting was not okay and that's that's not enough you have to i had to sit in it so you should sit in it with me you know i have to always sit in it so you should sit in it with me on occasion right so so so definitely if you see a woman being being treated this way in a meeting instead of like feeling bad silently inside they say you know what what she said that that was really good we should definitely talk about that or excuse me i'd like to hear what you know her finisher sentences because that was really interesting just like oh yeah i think it's great that you you're bringing up the point that tina had earlier you know there are many ways of of lending privilege as as a as a powerful person in a room and it doesn't have to be very confrontational it can so so so taking some tricks out of the bag and making sure that you like tilt tilt that that power balance a little bit that that is definitely something i think everyone could do absolutely yeah i have like some additional to the story because just recently some recruiter like convinced me to like to talk with them so i talked with them and we talked and they said to me and after two years you will move from to some more senior or from from junior role like yes yes it happened to me just a few days ago so yeah it happens everywhere and every time every every time and to everyone i don't know i don't know oh my god oh oh sorry yeah and they told me they are looking explicitly for people from possible community from conferences and i particularly like looking for people from the standards committee for the programming language for a junior role that is i think that is that is a challenging week yeah i was going to see if philippe's internet is is behaving maybe i suspect the ta indians have been working on on internet connection and seeing if they can fix it let's let's let's go to the first i think uh audience question here yeah if you can hear me ah we can yes we can do yeah thank you yeah yeah i said so philippe do you have a either either a positive inclusive experience in memory or something you'd like to kind of ah oh we've lost him again oh all right i think we should go to the first audience but was an audience question then yeah so the first one right here what is your opinion on safe spaces can a space only be safe for a specific set of people eg when estrus by pocket trans when they stay in that group doesn't that make things worse because they are not included with everybody else okay patricia okay yeah i did my my physical okay i've been thinking about this lately actually because i i do i'm before the pandemic i started doing like a a conference here in norway and one of the things that i did which a lot of men here found weird is that i said that you you couldn't have a man on stage like there was no men speaking at this conference they're only women speakers but and then they were like oh then i can't come and i'm like why and i was like no then it's a woman-only conference and i'm like okay so do you say that to women that go to conferences where they're only male speakers and they were like so so i basically said yeah you there will be no men speaking but everyone is everyone is allowed to be like come welcome i want you to come i want you to see these amazing speakers and so that is one context right i spent like a lot of time like promoting women to as as speakers and in in all sorts of ways in this conference but it wasn't a conference that was only for women but at the same time men are used to a lot being in context that are technical with only other men like it happens all the time we and and that and i know because i walk into these rooms as the only woman so so i know there are many rooms where there are only men in tech but as a woman they're only there so rarely i will walk into a room where there are only women we have to construct those kinds of rooms and and that is true for for a lot of like minority groups in tech that they have never actually sat in a room and looked around and like these people look like me you know so so these two things are not opposites they're complementary sometimes you need to walk into a room with other people like you just to let your shoulders down for a little bit you know just to breathe and and other times we want to go to get together and and showcase to each other that you know and and so so so for me these things are not opposites they are are complementary and i don't think one should rule out the other okay so that would make sense anything you want to add on this one i yeah i heard somewhere i don't know the exact numbers but i heard somewhere that men feel outnumbered by women if like the if the woman percentage is like 40 or i think it wasn't even 40. if i think it was less and men feel outnumbered and we can only change that by having more women and more other diverse people in those spaces because that feeling they get uncomfortable just like 30 women also in in the room they get uncomfortable and there was a study somewhere don't quote me on that yeah so but we can only change that if we have a more diverse audience and i think it's beneficial to everyone i have colleagues that came up to me and told me that they're happy that they have at least one woman in the team because it changes the team dynamic and the men are also in the meetings that is nicer and not that competitive with each other and yeah so i think it would benefit everyone hannah anything on this on this one particularly the idea of safe spaces that are only for a single group i think patricia said it all but like by creating something which is additional to everything else we are not substanting anything from the rest i love the point that the spaces and safe spaces are not a zero-sum game we can have we can add more of them especially virtual spaces like this you can have more of them fantastic i yes how about a second question from the audience sure and just let me add that you know we have enough open spaces so i think that safe spaces are quite fun to have it's not like that we have to replace everything with them and of course they're not inclusive because they have a different definition you know for for certain group for definition i have an interesting question from jonathan o'connor i am active in both of the i'm active in both of the chess and c plus communities however i know almost no lgbtqi members of the chess community whereas i know quite a few lgbti people in the super plus community do you think the superstars community is accepting of difference interesting question hannah i saw your hand go up first yes okay okay i think it's getting better i don't know chess community but it's getting better go ahead so so i think pre pre hash include not so much but but that i think had to do with a lot of people being isolated in their respective companies and teams and you know and and then having a community where that was important and and and and meeting other people that were like you in in in all on many axes many times i think has has helped in people feeling less alone and isolated and finding community and also like even if it's virtual like it's a discord really that's like the major part of the community we still can meet each other at conferences you know and and if you're an attendee and you've been on like in in the discord and then you go to a conference and then there's like a hash include dinner then you can go to the dinner and you can talk to these people and you have you have you know them you know so so you have an idea on how safe they are but also you have it's often in a group setting so it might feel much less isolating so i think that the the crossover between the hash include discord and and real life is really important fantastic and i'm crossing my fingers that philippe's internet connection remains stable tina did you have a comment on on kind of the the chess community versus people's plus community dynamic and inclusivity in the super plus community not really i have no idea about the chess community the feeling that i have that it's even more male dominated as the secret boss community which might be a factor into this but before i agree with patricia before i got involved with the hashing huge community i didn't really know any like trans people in the institute's community or even gay people it's yeah just like a safe space for them and for us fantastic it's super it's super awesome to hear all of the kind of impact that include has had across the super plus community philippe i don't know if you you heard all of the question but we're trying there was just a question about whether seals plus was accepting of differences for the kind of lgbtqi community especially in comparison to the chess community but if you wanted to jump in on this one i really don't have a i don't know another side that's why i think i will not be able to comment to this one i don't know the chess community sure what do you think kim do you have another audience question we should go to here yes we do but let me shortly also comment on this i think that has a lot to do is trust and you you don't see the sexuality of a person other like like skin color or something so there might be probably more diverse chess players out there than you think and there's some other sportswear that is very well known like soccer or football so let me see what's the highest uploaded question what is your view on employing senior people in terms of age in a developer role whose death skills are up to date and who have a long record of experience in terms of skills abilities roles i'm asking for the perspective of h discrimination that's a fantastic question if leave since since you are most recent joining the panel why don't you start us off here then just read the question again what is your view on employing senior people in terms of age in a developer role whose death skills are up to date and who are have long record of experience in terms of skills abilities etc and you know what like from the perspective of age age discrimination i'm just with the question very well because what's my this age so what let me just question again is to see if i really understand the question it's about employing old people or senior people in terms of age but i think that should be yeah it it's actually a really important question because i am a person that like to think about the future a lot because i like to be ready in order to avoid surprises so and i like to look around the world and to see how we treat different people based in different brexits and something that really worries me a lot is about getting old because i don't see that the world is really working to to to or to include all people i mean if you look at movies look at music you look at every kind of entertainment that we have today is only for a certain kind of age so we are really excluding old people and it's not only about software it's actually in general right it's there is few things that is being done in the world in which the target is all people are actually thinking to address all the people's in general so i think it's really important because these people are full of experience and the experience is really important in terms of software development and for myself for example when i'm studying c plus plus learning new kind of technology i like to understand technology from the point of view of evolution i don't care about the state in which something is today i like how these things evolved and how why the thing is what it is today for example and i think all people are the ones that have the answers they were in the field they know everything and if they are really active in the field they have out they probably have almost all the answers that we need so i think it's really important to put these peoples in the team because even though technology i say we have new technology but the foundation of this technology are all techniques even the new techniques that seems to be different are just evolution of all techniques and these people should be there because understanding something is for me at least i like from the evolution point of view that's why i think these people there is no reason actually to take someone for a position just because they are old right i think it's more advantage than actually anything else after my own heart ah fantastic answer does anyone want to try and follow up hannah please yeah i think there is no difference regarding age sexuality gender race in terms of like logical thinking analytical thinking so if you want to be super engineer whatever you want whether you are you can be the engineering and you should be allowed to do it and if you are not then it's bad patricia go ahead yeah no i i really i really like philippe's point about about bringing different experiences to our teams because we are are making software for the world we're making software for everyone from children to all people from people of all different nationalities and languages and having teams that that represent these perspectives means that we will we will be notified and and have in mind things that we wouldn't otherwise so i i think he i think he spoke very well so i don't really have anything to add other than to say it was awesome yeah i tina just an opportunity if you want to jump in too yeah i don't think i have anything meaningful to add i just agree with everyone that everyone brings some something unique to the table and we shouldn't exclude anyone fantastic yes how about another audience question you muted the answer we have a very similar question what do you think if health conditions disabilities i think it is enough what do you think of health conditions disabilities when it comes to recruiting staff for your team most of the time not being able to relocate results results in a strong no which is strange to me as a superstar's developer as simple as developers are hard to hire that's a reference to my own token this morning and developers can work and remote right so it's always a good question i think it's also very relevant right now coming out of a global pandemic tina do you want to start us off here yeah i think i think companies should be more open for remote work i see that companies were had a had it easy to switch to remote work during the pandemic but now they're switching back to going to the office and i don't really see a reason for that other than i want to see my developers in the office and you know need the control need to see them if i don't see them working they're not working yeah i think for most of us working remotely worked really well and i don't see the need for most programming jobs to be on site who wants to to chime in on this one well okay so i i yeah so i so remote work is one type of accommodation and but i also think that we should support different types of accommodations and so so so one one thing i i i've been i've talked to some people with with a chronic illness or or some kind of of of a challenge that is is it takes up a lot of time and energy in their lives and and then we need more support for people working part-time people being able to to flex around their health and and so and also to to have the the opportunity to to just rest when they need to rest and so being just like flexible about you know i need to take a week off because my health is bad right now but still get paid because we all need we all need to to to support ourselves and i think and and the thing is it's like yeah you have like for me i i've had three children in my life at each time with different types of health issues which means that in different parts of my life i have been disabled for periods of time and so so people are not necessarily always permanently disabled and they are not necessarily disabled in the same degree over time either so so being able to to to trust people more and i think that comes back to what tina said about you don't have to look at people to know that they're working if you can't really trust your the people that are working for you then then you're you're probably not a great boss [laughter] so maybe you shouldn't do that you should hi if you hired these people then you should trust these people and and i support them so that they can do their best work fantastic could not agree more hannah anything you want to add or felipe oh sorry philippe get it wrong go for it yeah i think it is uh it's an important question because i am from angola as i said is a country in the southern africa in the south of africa and i'm currently in russia so but i have connection with friends that are in my my country that will talent people but they struggle a lot to get how can they say to to get a job right remotely and i think what even when the opportunity is not only to work remote in remote mode when even the company is trying to help developers to move to the country where the the the companies it's not only the problem i'm not here to defend any company i'm not trying to justify the behavior but what i'm trying to say is that the government also need to do something right because it's a very bureaucratic process to relocate someone and i will say here my experience for example when they include c plus plus for example give me the opportunity to attend akuku conference in london in bristol in uk well i had everything to get the opportunity to be there but my my visa was rejected and i don't know the reasons why but maybe because the profile is where you come from so it's not only the for the point of view of companies is i think it's more systematic than we think so i think the government and companies need to work together in order to do something similar another give it a second in case you can you can reconnect yeah i have something to add not like from like it's kind of systematic but it's like it's small thing from in my apartment oh like yeah phillip is back yeah please finish i'm sorry i'm starting to have a problem yes for example there is a deep mind for example it's a very nice company for example but for them even if you want to work remotely you need to be in the in the place for example and this is i don't think it's the problem only the company i think i kind of have i think that deepmind is a very diverse company but i think that here the problem is the government that is to rule the company in order to only even if it's a remote position need to be the the person need to be in the country so that's my answer for this question fantastic yeah i just wanted to say about small things which like blocks people from like working in office if they want if there is like some disability they for example we had quite a big problem with heavy doors have a doors in the corner in the office oh yeah yes and it's really hard to convince responsible people to do something about it because for them it's not an issue but for one maybe two people it's a big issue and [music] yeah and it makes them really like hard to work there for for them to work there and they will say like to friends they know but also like people talks about these problems and it's sometimes even it's like small things can be problematic like in terms of inquisitivity so absolutely big in little things from governments to doors all of these different things one thing i will say is uh at a big company that has not always had a great reputation for remote hiring i've been at least happy that my part of the company is increasingly trying to just embrace flexibility some people want to be in the office and so we're trying to get the offices open for them some people don't want to be in the office and so we're trying to make sure they can do that and i think i think kind of increasingly taking a flexibility prioritized mindset is a great way to to strike a balance here but it is hard and it takes work and it takes work at all the levels from doors all the way up to governments so it's all all this is fantastic i yes what do you think about getting the next audience question i think i think we could get to a new one you're muted though i can't hear you again now you can hear me yes i would like to hear a bit more from philip about the his active person organization called association of angolan programmers if i got that right and we don't often have a guest bridge you know is from africa as i assume so that's something we knew which i see like i had just been also a speaker from benin at meeting embedded so i would like to hear a bit about that perspective thank thanks for for the question when it was like two years ago i attended the cpp russia conference and i meet a lot of people there's important bryce and many other folks from the civil place community and it was a really wonderful a wonderful experience and it really touched me a lot and because i really realized that we as a student we i think when you are surrounded by people like those folks for example the opportunity to learn is amazing because it's a very strict but it's really well enough you can start finding patterns here that is really important for for your career for example you can see what the way they behave the way the the things they speak for example and the world conference environment is really is very inspiring and being close to chat with these people that are in the field that are working from the things that are driving the world is really important and have really high impact on people and being there with these people touched me a lot so i decided that well i need to do something with respect to that with people from my country for example and you know i'm from angola for example and of course there is issues towards education for example and very recently even the president come out and saying that education in the country is not really okay so this kind of thing this kind of problems i say okay i cannot solve everything but maybe there is things that i can that i can do in order to also help others so i start the association of angolan programmers it's a really right now because there is not enough resources like time for example i'm only working creating leave a conversation with experienced developers in order to bring them close to angolan programmers and people interested in computer science to bring them to to give them the steps that they need sometimes in order to achieve in order to start new different paths in computer science it's also important for me because i want to diversify the technology that we've been using in my country for example most of people there are more in mobile development and some are going now in ai others and web development but there is not a lot of people in system programming for example so that's why i'm actually trying to bring people from different field computer architectures system programming and the goal now is really to when i bring someone is for them to give us the steps for someone to start like to show the power to show the career in two hours or one hour so the more people from africa and from my country can start diversifying the fields on where they are and they're also the the the problem there's also another problem that i want to solve is to synchronize people in for example to have how can i say is to is to to help them to i'm just i'm missing the word here to to use but it's kind of you start a project with someone and these people is really experienced in this field and you can actually how can i say you can help younger people that want to start for example you can pick a project you can suggest and we in angola we try to you can propose a project we in angular we try to filter the best person that fits in that position so that you can walk them and give them some experience and give them more practical experience on the field that you want to drive this person so there is a lot of goals a lot of goals would that you want to achieve with this association it's only at the beginning but there is a lot of work and if you here want to give a talk want to ah to to help want to help with the project you just need to contact me right if you know for example that you have a project that you can mentor i actually fund the world if you can mentor an angolan student in order to up to to help them evolve in this in this particular field just contact me and it will be more than welcome that's fantastic all right shall we take a question from the audience yes i quickly replaced the twitter account to the to the audience in the chat then how do you approach management regarding chronic disease health issues when you're expected to pass through go for it patricia go for it okay maybe hannah can do this one okay okay i actually have chronic migraines and i told my manager and if he didn't accept like but sometimes i unable to work i would probably find a different manager because it's their their job to like enable me to work and if they are feeling that they are bad i like it right to the point they're not doing it they're bad patricia yeah and and i didn't and it's an illusion right it's like you you can't power through you're sick if there's it's like the only thing that's what's going to happen now it's going to get worse so so so it's not it's not a solution it's it's it's an illusion so so no people need time to heal they need time to take care of themselves and need time too and this doesn't you you have chronic health issues but you have the same same problem with burnout right there's no way to power through burnout you're just powering down the same hole so it's not going to work powering down the same hole is a very very uh on the nose expression yeah i also think you shouldn't have to power through anything not just because of your own health i mean what's the most important but also how good is the work going to be i mean you know if your manager has any sense then they should know that the work isn't good if you're not well and it's best for everyone if you get well first and then go back to work philippe anything you want to add here yes again i think some companies for example we talk a little bit about my experience for the first company i work for we kind of needed to every day get a report of what we did what we work and even the hour that we work at i think it's i don't think it's complete it's it's it's really okay because i think when you give people goals that you give them enough time to work on you don't need actually to to keep controlling the person every activity that the person does can really help a lot of people that have this ability i think there is days that as we can work a lot i think that is they that there's sometimes you can in one day maybe you can do the work of a week for example and and actually when you only give the go okay you have this time and you need to be to bring a result in this amount unless a certain amount of time is really more reasonable than to come out oh every day i want to see you doing something so i think if you want to help disabled people i think this kind of policy that we need to start using because i think goals are more important than starting to controlling people every day because even sometimes people just they didn't produce they didn't actually make a lot of progress today but sometimes you will force people to to come out with some kind of lies that struggles because so that you can not report them as a not making progress for example and i don't think it will just cause more harms than actually help so i think i think i think it's time for for us i don't i'm not saying that there's no people work on research in this particular field but i think it's becoming really more important to to to have more people work and doing research on the way we work because actually it's really really really important and it's not only also about doing research but managing companies start to listen to these people right because we it is really important because the the product is not more important than the people so that that's what we'd say yeah uh one thing i also want to mention here right like if if i philippe you mentioned some days you can do different amounts of work some people at some times can can do different amounts of work too and one thing that i think is also super important is even if you feel like you can power through maybe you'll be successful at powering through and doing something but i also think people should think about the impact that has on everyone around you because it can distort expectations and now everyone feels like they have to power through and then and you know you don't want to do that sure maybe you can do it successfully once but eventually you burn out right or someone else will burn out and it still has a negative effect so i just think that it could even be a really bad example to do and and i wish people would think about the examples they're setting can i just add more more one point actually this i was chatting with a friend again it was a week ago and we're actually talking about maybe i'm not saying that we actually need to do that but i think it's time now without controlling the requirement for a particular job i think it's actually getting out of hand for example i think people start exploring people now building job requirements and people for for example for countries like me for african and other countries development that start accepting the job because they need food they need to eat they need to provide and there is no one fighting for this kind of people because if they don't pick the job they will be jobless for example and the requirements that these companies are putting in one person is it's it's it's really it's too much it's really so much and i think no one is doing nothing and i think it's becoming even worse because i think the computer science is development and the stock is becoming bigger and companies are refusing to bring more people to divide the stock and they want to boot that to put out the burn in a single person and i think it's not okay and it's the time to start really giving attention to this particular point absolutely i yens how about we we try and find another audience question just to keep keep things moving here so this is the final question we are reaching like seven o'clock and in an hour we have the armor so what can seacrest bus meeting do to support diversity possibly not only during the meeting tina do you want to start this off oh no honestly go for it yeah go for it representation representation representation that's all probably we need i okay i want to add to that because i spoke to somebody about that recently and the the problem like somebody said like oh yeah we need role models and stuff but sometimes you just need the binary of knowing that such a person exists you like like for me if i can see as someone as that is more senior than me that is older than me that is in a different life a period than me being doing this job being successful or or or being happy and and and succeeding that means that that is possible right because i don't have a lot of those people that i can look to and say okay i can be there is a future where i can be a grandmother and coding right i want that i want to see that because there is so little of that and so that goes back to the age discrimination as well sometimes you feel like like all all female developers die at the age of 30. it's like it's like what happened to them i don't know they disappeared so so we need we need representation and we need representation that is intersectional so you so it's like we want we want to see women and we want to see older women but we want to see black and brown women we want to see women of different cultures and religions with head scarves without head scarves we we need to see someone that is similar to us enough that we can think okay that's it's possible for me too because we don't have that so so we need someone and oftentimes all it takes is like one person it's like that person okay it's possible right so so yes representation representation representation i remember you seeing on cppcon i think it was 2007. and it was like yes same i'll flip yes i think not only meet c plus plus i think we can generalize a little more discussion to other conferences also i think there is particular conferences i'm not saying about meeting black lives matter i won't say names over here but it kind of see kind of a pattern right the speakers are almost the same and well it's a little bit hard to to talk about these kind of things and i think we these we need to start giving or maybe looking for for more people and i think for example meeting c plus plus and other conference they need to start motivating more people because if you start actually having the same people all the time or the majority is the same well you need to start looking to find out what's the problem right maybe the problem is not because they are not qualified or there is the problem is not all that they don't are good speakers maybe the problem is other right maybe there's something that is real that is not actually really part of the reality that they are that that they are afraid so i think the conference people need to come out with more guidelines on how to to get accepted on this conference and how you can start for example i think it's also part of the conference people to start actually breaking this try to do some some research to find out what's the problem because having the same speakers all the time or the majority because you can see oh there is this conference you can know which the speaker will be automatically so i think it's not it's not helping too much yeah patricia you gotta follow up go for it yeah no it's it's very much related to to what he said earlier actually for another question we we we have an opportunity to mentor to to to to train and to help people and to practice so that they can become speakers to to nurture them in that way and and and i think that is is extremely important and giving them the support but also giving them the opportunity right and and that means both the opportunity to learn from from senior people who have lots of experience in this but also giving the opportunity to get on stage and do it and that goes back to some of the things that philip said earlier about about access when it comes to national access like you have to be able to get a visa for the conference to speak at the conference right yeah and sometimes that means maybe it's a time issue so some some countries the visa process is so long that by the time you get ex like from acceptance to the conference is too short for you to actually be able to do the visa or you are not able to do the visa and then it's like what can we do to provide access for people who are not who who will not be able to physically attend maybe we can provide a way for them to to do remote presentations or or or so it has to do with like like looking for solutions like he said to the challenges right so i i'm just basically reiterating what he said already i want to i want to try and give tina an opportunity for the last word here and then i think we have to wrap up uh from what jensen said between the last word go for it yeah i am basically a believer everyone as my perspective as i as a relatively new speaker i noticed as well that the conferences have the same speakers over and over and it is really intimidating because you know they are good you you know the speakers are good and people are coming to the conferences because of the famous speakers and so this is really something that is hard to get over if you want to start speaking that conferences couldn't agree more it's fantastic and i think we're working to close this out so well maybe maybe also say something about that so i have been experienced with experimenting with online communities in the last year and what i see is that this has attracted a worldwide and very diverse audience that would not have been included otherwise and i think that by the next year like one year later we'll see a lot of that more coming to fruition you kind of have to to offer something for those people to to come to learn to build up on and i'm exploring like how to do lightning talk so that people don't have to give a full talk at the beginning and also then of course yeah we we have we have you'll be in berlin a track for new speakers and as philippe mentioned yes other conferences meaning crossbus is still the only conference which has the tickets for which are free for students and for support which i can do which i always have done and in the last two years was a pandemic it was a lot easier to offer that thanks to the support from hana and her sponsorship from avast and now let's you know let's let's close the panel on something positive can we just you know like add like a like like what what did you see change in a positive way within the recent time [music] frame [music] regarding this like what did you notice like how was it in the past how is it now what is what is better for you whole people think briefly i will say what what's better for me it's better for me being on panels like this where i just get to like make these these wonderful people talk about all of the amazing stuff they're doing i patricia you had a hands so i know you're ready to start go for it it's it's sort of related to that and and and i think to a lot of the things latina also talked about earlier about when we went into the pandemic a lot of employers but also conferences and and media had to go into some kind of online mode and and i think we've discovered that that actually granted access to a lot of people who haven't had access before and and i hope going forward that that lesson means that we won't go all the way back we we have realized that there were opportunities that we discovered in this process the end and then that we can maybe maybe when we go back to to to hope like post post covid that we are more in a hybrid mode where where we can we can still have a an online online experience where people can access the conferences even though they can't physically travel and that's true for even like if you're from if it's expensive to travel but it's also like if you're not you're you're for health issues you can't travel or or if it is if it is your you know you can't because of family issues maybe you're home with kids or dogs so so there are many reasons why traveling might not be something that you can do but but being able to still participate and being included in the kind of hybrid event and a hybrid kind of working is something that i have hopes for in the future because i think we've shown the the upside so hopefully i think i think charlotte wants to to help hannah respond here maybe no we can't hear you hannah sorry i think she doesn't want me to other and i think she wants to beat that any other positive experiences folks want to share before i think i think people are starting to understand some people at least not everybody they roll in order to to have a more diverse community and i think it's something possible that have been seen lately more people are starting to realize that not only the government it's not only the company that they also are important to make the environment healthy and i think it's it's it's something that have been seen and i see people they are not only in one stage some people keep evolving toward this mentality and i think it's really good i think people trying to realize that it's something to keep learning to keep learning to keep learning and i think it's the positive thing that i've been seeing lately absolutely tina did you have anything you wanted to share i'm not sure to be honest yeah i think yeah everything was already said right like that i think i think we're all done here and a huge thank you to all four no now five of our of our fantastic panelists as as charlotte has has joined and he answered for hosting this panel it's always a pleasure to see all of you and to be here thanks to all of you and we'll see when we do this again and yeah so i think i'm gonna close the live stream then and thank you for to to the audience for listening thank you for the questions they were great and then yeah there was a little technical error that i showed you like 90 minute panel but that's a bit too much for people on a panel so i don't want to go that that way and was that thank you and we're gonna see us then in the armor with gabi at the full hour that's also like the reason he was last year in in the panel and i would have loved to include him but i thought he's giving an armor like just an hour later and maybe you know not put him too much there so and then that's that's it and i'll stop the stream bye
