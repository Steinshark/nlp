i'm gonna do a google coding interview in a children's language and if i can't finish three problems in one hour i have to drink a raw egg on top of that for every test case that fails i have to do a full shot the strategy first is to get comfortable with this what the [ __ ] is this look at this there's we've got a cat over here we've got a bunch of blocks in scratch you don't write code you have to drag in blocks and add them together like legos invert a binary tree oh my god okay how are we setting alarm for one hour 8 39 p.m see you then let's get started take a look at this freaking cat can even do okay he can say hello invert binary tree how do i make a class is this a class scratch is not object oriented that makes this problem like three times harder because i'm gonna have to store everything in an array make a list we'll call it nodes nods good good good this is unfair i have to do the setup for the test cases low-key this is actually gonna be really difficult you have to do is iterate through the levels invert the levels one by one it's basically breadth-first search inverting the list let's code it there's no return statements in this language we have to just set a global variable and then that's it that's that's what you have to do the thing about racket is you can accidentally rack it radiant slip don't worry racket's useful it's not working oh no guess let's restart it where'd everything go what the while this idiot re-implements all the code he just lost let's check in and see how i'm doing in question two we need two softballs or else i'm drinking an egg okay okay okay okay okay since again we're doing a binary tree we're gonna be storing it in an array and each child is at two times index and then two times index plus one oh my god won't let me type again okay honestly scratch wants me to drink an egg so question two is a low ball but how much time is left over for question three let's head back to question one and find out this is gonna get us the end of the level and then we're going to replace it with the beginning of the level we're going to move inward we're only going to do this for half of the length of the row ready here's a moment of truth definitely not working this happened one or two more times like such a bad programmer his egg is not gonna go down well i forgot that arrays are one index it's not a real programming language a lot like matlab so it works that worked two seven four nine six five one oh take that larry page take that sergey brin okay someone's getting a little cocky let's jump back over to question two to see how much time we have left for our final question moment of truth is this gonna work we didn't say anything [music] oh my god i meant to put a knot here i have to take a shot for that two right that's good four all right now one okay now five six and now nine icing my veins up that was actually really simple that was almost too simple but we're back in it left how much time on the clock 15 minutes so it all comes down to this next question if the next question is a low ball we're golden oh does scratch maps this doesn't have hashmaps but i need to keep a hashmap of the visited places i'm gonna have to define the grid before i program the problem i've got 12 minutes and i don't even have my hash back one hour is up time for the punishment i'm doing it again you
