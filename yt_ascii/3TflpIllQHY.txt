- this is 50,000 orbeez. this is 200,000. this is 400,000. how many orbeez is that? - that's a million orbeez. - yes, that is 1 million orbeez. and it is only 1% of our orbeez. that's a weird flex. - but okay. - there's a million orbeez in every box, and we have a hundred boxes. 49.6, 49.7. - 49.8. - 49.9, 50 million. where has enough orbeez to fill
up all of the united states? dude, these things get like
30 times bigger with water. this is 100 million orbeez. - are you sure? it looks kinda like it's 99,999,984. ow! - and now we're gonna take these 100 million orbeez, and we're
gonna put 'em on the tarps back here in the backyard,
wait for it to rain. and we have so many orbeez, that it might literally
overflow this fence. we might not be able to contain them. - whoo, orbeez! yeah! whoo! whoo! - so now that we've proven we
have a hundred million orbeez, we're gonna fill this pool, and this entire backyard with them. pewdiepie will have as many subscribers as we have orbeez here. within like a year. i'll make sure of it. [music] yurm yurm yurm [music] [music] yurm yurm yurm yurm yurm yurm [music] [music] yurm yurm yurm [music] [music] yurm yurm yurm yurm yurm yurm [music] [music] yurm yurm [music] [music] yurm yurm yurm yurm yurm [music] [music] yurm yurm yurm yurm yurm [music] [music] yurm yurm yurm yurm yurm [music] it's the next day. thanks to daylight savings time, it got dark pretty early. but the ones we did put in
the pool, got ginormous. so this is pretty awesome. these 30 orbeez fill up, like,
about the palm of my hands. and we have 10 million of these. - noted. - so we still have 97 million orbeez, and we're gonna lay 'em on these tarps. it's going to rain for 10 hours tonight, and hopefully the rain
will land on the tarps. all 97 million will get big,
and this backyard will be full. let's do that. so garrett, how many orbeez do
you think we put in the pool? - probably like a million. - i know. and look how many, that's only a million. wow. - aren't they pretty? - those are really pretty, actually. - go on and give 'em a touch. - you like that one?
- yeah. - dude, these orbeez are slippery as- anyways, forget about him. we're gonna keep filling up this pool. - dude, that is like so many orbeez. that is a hundred thousand orbeez. - there's a couple million orbeez in here. yeet. - if you yeet one thing
that has been yoted, the yeet gods will help you. yeet. - yeet. yep. - no, don't do it. - we have a new helper. - bless you. - i can't throw the bucket. right, jake?
- right. - 'cause you guys got mad at me last time. - well, at least he got- oh, there goes the bucket. - i'm sorry, it slipped. i didn't mean to. - he took the bucket. - no, you.
- i didn't- he threw the bucket. - it was him. - he threw the bucket.
- it was him. - who do you think threw the bucket? - him.
- dad. - what?
- you did it! - what? - it's about 10 hours later, and the whole backyard
is covered in orbeez. see that right there, chris? what is that?
- orbeez. - what is that?
- orbeez. - what is that?
- orbeez. - the entire backyard is full with un-grown orbeez. the plan is to cover the
entire backyard, orbeez, like i told you before. and then when it rains,
it'll fill 'em all up, and we'll come here tomorrow, and all 100 million orbeez will be huge. which is enough to
literally fill this backyard up to like, right here. or maybe right here.
- right there? - between those.
- okay. right here. - we still have like
20 million orbeez left. so let's go ahead and
start dumping them out. whoa. and they're not even big yet. and they already cover all this space. like they're literally
gonna go from like that, to like that. soft to hard. - what else gets soft and hard? pretzels. - i'm gonna do a trust fall. i'm gonna entrust my life
in these orbeez' hands. - whoa, got some slippage there. - all right. woo, woo. - oh, whoa, whoa, whoa! - it feels like i'm laying in macaroni. - oh, yeah. - oh, this actually feels really good- oh, it's still warm. oh! oh, my- - we just planted a chris. - it feels like i'm being buried alive. - you are. - no, do not, do not. ah, who is this? your is on my- ah, i can't breathe. i can't breathe. i can't breathe. - get off, get off. - ah, i can't breathe. - i need more, i need more. more, more. - whatcha fishing for? - well the pool is full of orbeez, so now we gotta take all
these orbeez outta the pool to make room for new orbeez. - wait, so this isn't candy? - no, it's not candy. - have you been eating it? - no. - all right, guys. so we have all 100 million orbeez laid out across the backyard. it is supposed to rain tonight. so we're gonna go to bed, and
when we come back tomorrow, all these orbeez should be big. dude, imagine if all 100
million of these are full size. - it's gonna be a party. - or maybe our calculations are off, and the rain won't do anything. - let's pray to the rain gods. - jake, do the rain dance. - rain dance. oh, he's got an umbrella too. - that that's a fortnite dance. all right, we quit. - all right, you ready? - i'm legally blind.
- we'll catch him. - oh- - oh.
- oh, god. - hey.
- that was weird. that was weird. don't do that.
- i wanna try that. - i had a panic attack instantly. - the second he went in, he looked like he
regretted his entire life. - i did, dude. i felt it, and then i went to go up, and i was like, "oh, no, i can't." - three, two, one. - why? - three, two, one. - oh, my. - did it hurt your- - yes. - oh, orbeez . - a wave. - first one to get outta the
pool gets a thousand dollars. - hey chris, gimme 500 bucks, i'll help you out right now. chris wins! chris, high five. - high five. - our friend garrett here,
has no regard for his life. so he is gonna try to
snorkel in the orbeez. is it working? - no. - dude, it sounds like it's working. - keep doing it. - ah! - so we can confirm
snorkels work on orbeez. - just don't let your
snorkel go under the orbeez, or you're gonna be breathing orbeez. - next, i'm gonna ride the boogie board. not to be confused with the boogie bomb. stupid little kids. in theory, this should work. - so what went wrong? - i think it just didn't like me. here, chandler. it might like you. land right here. - ah! all right, orbeez squad, roll out. - contestants, are you ready? - for what? - have you trained your
whole life for this? - probably.
- yeah. - see this pool, the outside? - yeah. - first one to do two laps
gets a thousand dollars. - yeah, you have to stay in the pool. - what'd you say?
- stay in the pool. we have so many cheaters. - warning, warning. - warning, warning. chris gives up. all right, it's down to these three. - wow. - chandler, offer half the money. - i did. - go, go with the wind. - why would you do that? - go, go. - yes.
- chandler wins. - he offered me 750, and i took it. - i like to think my parents
were teaching me how to swim. - that's good. - do you think your dad would be proud? can we get his dad on the phone? - he'd be so proud of me right now. dude, i'm exhausted. - hey, chandler's dad. chandler just won a competition. - let me guess. - well, are you proud of him? - it depends on what he did, man. - he swam two laps around a pool. here, let me show you. there's your son, look how beat he is. - what the- - yep. he swam two laps in a
hundred million orbeez. he would've won a thousand dollars, but he had to cheat and
give jake 750 to win. - yay! - dude, you gotta be kidding me. jake, let me get two of that, man. - jake, he wants 200 of it. - all right. - next is the tight rope of death. whoa, chill, chill, chill. okay, ah! this is not a pit of orbeez,
this is a pit of flames. - you've made it halfway, telephone. - hey, you made it. - chris. - you. - i hit with so much force. - in the pewdiepie video, we found out garrett wasn't
subscribed to pewdiepie. - oh, no! - so, because of that, he must
walk the tight rope of death. if he falls down there,
he's a t-series fan, and he is banished from the land. if you make it here,
pewdiepie will forgive you. this is his one chance at redemption. - you good? - save me to me.
- no. you must save yourself.
- ah! - pewdiepie has forgiven him. your sins have been atoned for. jake, it is now your chance-
- pewdiepie. - -to atone for your sins. - jake, jake. - remember, you fall, you're banished. you make it, pewdiepie has forgiven you. will you be forgiven of your sins? if pewdiepie's on your side- - hey.
- that looked easy. - how you doing, buddy? hey, it's my friend. oh, no. oh, my. oh.
- i'm getting molested. what is that kowalski? kowalski said if you're a
true lover of pewdiepie, you can walk on orbeez. right now, take a step. - believe in the orbeez. oh, he don't believe. - all right. well, he, yeah. you're a t-series. everyone, he's part of t-series. get away from us. - yeah, get, go away. - they're fighting back. - oh, no. - victory! - all right, guys. y'all wanna get some sushi? - yeah, let's go get some sushi. - let's go get some sushi, guys. see you, jimmy. - 24 hours that- - ah! that was like a javelin. - the orbeez are on fire. - that smells so bad. - throw it, throw it, throw it, throw it. - i got hit.
- i got hit. honestly, i was expecting the orbeez to go like, . we're gonna do the try cracker. that sounds racist. try firecracker. there we go. go, good dude, look, the smoke never ends. - we get it, bucket, you vape. - i can confirm, there's smoke. can you confirm there's smoke? - definitely smoke. - in today's science
class, we learned that if you throw orbeez on
firecrackers, you don't die. hey, jake.
- hey. - i got a present for chris. chris, i got you something. here you go, some lotion. . is this a dead meme? - no, we've only been using
the same joke for five months. - ah! ah! - i think chandler deserves to get thrown in a pit of orbeez, though. - oh!
- oh, my god. - shh.
- it's okay. - ah! ah! - this is the weirdest
thing we've ever done. - we love you, chandler. - you want to hit that. - home run. - oh, god, we got a streaker. oh my goodness. - security.
- security. - get him down. - you know, you're
allowed to wear clothes. just thought i'd let you know. - that's no fun. - to be honest, not enough of you guys are buying my merch, so i can't
afford to feed my children. so i'm gonna have to just
give 'em some of our orbeez. here's your rations for the day. - thanks dad. - here's your rations for the day. - yes. - is there not even enough for me? - there isn't enough for you. people don't buy the merch. i wanna feed you, but i can't. - where do they go to buy the merch? - shopmrbeast.com
- this isn't good, dad. - well, tell them to buy some
merch so i could feed you. eat it, johnny. let me try it.
- this isn't good. it's not good. - here, garrett, it just needs
a little bit more orbeez. - yeah, yeah. - wait, i need some orbeez. - ah, let me get it. oh, my god. - this took many days to
film, and was very expensive. like, all our videos. so i'd appreciate it if you subscribe. 'cause like, that helped boost
my self-esteem, you know? - will it help boost your bank account? - no. the more subscribers i
get, the more i spend. so actually, the more subscribers i have, the less money i have. - ah! buy this shirt. also, i'd like to reiterate,
i don't know if i have, but these are biodegradable. we're gonna pick 'em all up. and whatever we don't pick up, they're not bad for squirrels. - 'cause we all love squirrels. - we do. i like squirrels more than i like vikings. - i quit. - also, our next video, is us destroying this house right here. so, be on the lookout for that. we're gonna fill it with slime, and completely destroy the entire thing, and then buy them a new house. but they think we're just
here playing with orbeez. because we're supposed to be,
like, picking up the orbeez. but instead, we're gonna
destroy their house. it'll be a good video. when you see a video titled, "destroying my friend's house
and buying him a new one", click on it. or i'll punch you. - like it. - i mean it. all right, now you can leave. [music] mr. beast oh [music] [music] mr. beast oh [music] [music] mr. beast oh [music]
