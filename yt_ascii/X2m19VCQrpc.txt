whether it's a splash screen on your monitor when you boot up your pc or a sticker on something for sale at a big box store you've probably seen that familiar blue energy star logo it feels like home let's be honest energy efficiency probably isn't at the top of your list of concerns when choosing a gadget to buy but it must be appearing everywhere for a reason right so energy star is a us government initiative introduced by the environmental protection agency all the way back in 1992 and although it's an american creation the program also exists in canada switzerland japan and taiwan the idea is to label energy efficient products from light bulbs to pcs to even whole buildings and even if you don't care about the environment because it's got too many bugs or whatever the certification is also designed to help you save money on your power bill so and the program does this by setting specific standards for different product categories so let's go through what this means for you starting with pcs and their power supplies this one will be pretty easy to remember for any of you who have built or upgraded a computer before an energy star certified pc has to perform at least at an 80 plus bronze level this means it has to run at eighty-two percent efficiency at twenty percent or a hundred percent load and eighty-five percent efficiency at fifty percent load if you're all squared away with your pc but you're in the market for a tv instead energy star follows a more complicated formula to determine if it's compliant given that power sucking crt monitors are obsolete the requirements are fairly unforgiving a 55-inch tv can't consume more than 57 watts and a 65-inch tv can't use more than 69 watts nice and even though most tvs these days still connect to the internet even while they're turned off energy star tvs can't use more than 3 watts in this state but let's say you found your soulmate finally on okcupid and it's time to go out and buy a washer together energy star quantifies these with something called energy factors numbers that are calculated mostly based on how much energy they consume per pound of clothes these energy factors aren't really useful for consumers but certified washers are supposed to use 25 less energy and one-third less water than non-certified models while certified dryers should save you about 20 on your power bill we'll tell you more right after we thank oracle for sponsoring this video oracle's celebrating pi day on march 14th with a global developer premier event focusing on innovative fun and highly technical content it's all about developers talking to developers with highly technical demos labs giveaways and fun activities geared around what developers want to see oracle will show you what you can build using oracle cloud infrastructure and what they contribute to the open source space so learn more and register for oracle's pi day event today using the link in the video description so you know how your parents were always yelling at you to turn off the lights to save money light bulbs have been a focal point for change in recent years we went from old school incandescent bulbs to those spring-looking cfls to modern leds in a relatively short amount of time pretty much all new led bulbs are far more energy efficient than older technologies whether they're energy star or not the difference is you're supposed to expect energy star bulbs to actually last as long as they say they will on the box at least fifteen thousand hours and retain a certain percentage of their original brightness over time they also can't draw more than half a watt when they're turned off daddy like but you'll need a place to put all this stuff so maybe you'll end up looking into an energy star house through better insulation ceiling and windows as well as more efficient hvac systems they should be between 20 and 30 percent more efficient than non-certified homes but how do you know that all this stuff actually meets the stated energy targets i mean it did used to be the case that products could be certified without testing which doesn't make any sense but now testing of all products has to be done in an approved lab before they get the energy star badge and random off-the-shelf testing is also done to make sure companies aren't sending in cherry-picked products or slacking after they get the certification okay sounds good but is paying extra for energy star gadgets worth it in terms of how much power you'll save the answer is it depends energy star products will certainly use much less power than devices from 20 or so years ago but when comparing modern products to each other the differences between compliant and non-compliant models may or may not be all that compelling check and see what energy prices are like in your area and exactly how much power each product consumes before shelling out more money just to get something labeled energy star i don't want any of you to buy a 2 000 fridge just so you can save two bucks before it dies because the wi-fi craft itself fridges have wi-fi now hey that's it for this one thanks for watching guys like a video if like a video
