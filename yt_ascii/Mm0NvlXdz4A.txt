[music] hey what's up mkbhd here and as you probably already know apple held an event this week their usual september event where they only announced two things not an iphone and not an iphone so once we collectively got over that you know it will be a dedicated iphone 12 event likely sometime in october but what we did see at this one was new apple watches and new ipads now it's tech timber so we're gonna get to it all eventually but what i do have here for you is a first look at apple watch series 6 and also we'll touch briefly on the new apple watch se so this is everything that's new and lucky for us it's pretty simple now the new stuff actually starts with the unboxing where you're going to get mostly the same packaging as a previous generation apple watch but this time you'll notice besides the watch itself and the band it comes with half the charger is missing so it comes with the cable that you need but no usb wall adapter and that's now sold separately and apple notably tacked that into the environmental section of their presentation kind of like i predicted in my video about how the iphone 12 will probably also not come with a wall adapter to save money i mean to save the environment from all the e-waste caused by them consider this lack of a brick in the box basically writing on the wall for the next iphone anyway then you get to the watch itself and aesthetically on the outside the only real change that you will notice is the colors and that's because that's the only real change on the outside the materials are the same the sizes available are the same but you do have some new colors now there's blue gold graphite and yes this product red that we have here now i personally still like to do my accent colors with the band more than the watch itself i've always had a black apple watch and like i don't think i'd want a red apple watch all the time like every single day but hey maybe you can rock that maybe you can make that choice if you want to some people could i could see wearing the blue like every day it's not so bad but it looks familiar new color that's simple and then on the inside really the tech improvements are the new s6 chip and a couple new sensors so the s6 chip really feels like apple's silicon team continuing to make strides flexing on us again they've always been really good with efficiency and they've made another step in that direction here so it is a dual core chip in here based on the a13 bionic and thanks to an improved efficiency it'll let them crank up the always-on display to be twice as bright as the series 5 and keep the same battery and performance and i've been messing around with this for just a couple hours on watchos 7 and i do think they've tightened up a lot of the animations so it actually feels faster snappier because the animations are shorter but really i think that was the goal is to keep the battery life at a day and a half because that's important that's what it's been for so long and now the watch does sleep tracking so people really need to find the right sliver of time in the morning to charge it up and not have it die and the series 6 watch will actually now charge up faster as well so it'll go from zero to 100 battery in about an hour and a half which is it's not blazing fast for anything but it is an improvement it's better than no improvement at all and of course most things charge their fastest from zero to like 75 percent so that'll be shorter so then those new sensors i mentioned which you can kind of see if you're looking at the bottom of the watch or if you fire it up and start to do a new measurement and that's because there is a new blood oxygen sensor so it's literally using infrared photography to measure the color and therefore the percentage of oxygen in your blood it's pretty wild i gave it a shot i consistently get a pretty normal reading which i guess is a good sign now of course the stipulation is it's not medical grade it's just kind of there to inform you generally of where you're at like you probably by yourself won't think this is a reason to get the apple watch series six but it's here and it's cool that it works and then there's some other quick hits five gigahertz wi-fi support now in series six there's also now an altimeter using barometric air pressure to tell you your elevation down to the foot which means it won't work on planes but whatever could be cool for hiking or skydiving or david blaine but yeah that's pretty much it for series six not that dramatic of a difference but whenever you see new colors on apple products people tend to go pretty into it with the color stuff and i can see people making a pretty big deal about that so some of the bigger apple watch changes that i've just kind of been wondering about lately like when are they going to do a different shape like maybe a more round version when are they potentially going to add qi wireless charging support are they ever going to do that to enable more compatibility with other smart wireless charging pads or maybe a future version of air power are they ever going to do truly open third party watch faces and have a whole watch face store none of that big dramatic stuff is happening with series 6. now i do like that watch os 7 keeps slowly adding a few more watch faces and there's some more cool ones here again with third-party plugins via complications the way it's always been but again this isn't like dramatically changing anything you still have most of the customization you'd be used to for an apple watch refresh but maybe more interesting than the watch itself actually is these new bands they announced so these these these are some stretchy they call them solo loop bands and essentially they're the really clean minimal seamless bands that they've announced alongside the series 6 watch and so basically as you can imagine fitting is really important with these so to get the right one they have a fitting document on their site you can print out use a credit card to make sure you printed the right size then you cut out this loop and use this to wrap it around your wrist to figure out your apple watch size and then you can go in and order your solo loop band in that size and if all goes well then you can attach both ends to the watch and you can put it on just by stretching it over your wrist every time instead of having to do all the hard work of opening and closing a velcro or a buckle i would say just from my experience if you're if you're between sizes i would say go for the more snug one because it'll be a little tighter at first and then you can break it in and eventually get it your size instead of one that's too big and then just always a little bit too big but those bands are going to be 50 to 100 bucks the braided ones here are 100 bucks so i probably wouldn't recommend getting these but the 50 just clean ones that are stretchy and clean i just like stretching them pretty minimal and the apple watch series six price is staying the same but speaking of prices i also should touch on there is a new apple watch se and that's starting at 279 which is pretty sweet and as you can probably imagine just based on the name the apple watch se is the new old new apple watch that makes sense right but we've seen this formula before basically the apple watch se is an apple watch series 5 more or less there's no blood oxygen sensor there's no electrocardiogram there's no always on display but for a lot of people who don't need most of those things this is a great deal for a watch it's much faster than the series three it has the bigger screen sizes from the new models and it even gets an always-on altimeter so that's a lot of smart watch for 279 i can see this being one of the more popular upgrades or even a gift i think for people this holiday season which is probably a big reason apple's deciding to drop it now but there it is that's pretty much everything you need to know that's different about this apple watch versus the others there's of course the watchout stuff coming to all apple watches there's of course the family sharing stuff which is kind of interesting low-key also appearing across apple watches but hey if you didn't already like apple watch this won't change your mind if you already loved apple watch this won't change your mind you're still going to love it to me i'm still in that mode where i'm thinking about the more nebulous big picture thoughts what are they going to make a circle that type of thing but either way let me know what you think if this is the apple watch for you and that's pretty much it tech timber is just gonna keep rolling thanks for watching this one catch you guys the next one peace
