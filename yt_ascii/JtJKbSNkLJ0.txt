hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about five reasons not to buy a manual transmission vehicle in other words five big disadvantages of manual transmissions and while i personally have owned many manual transmission vehicles and i hope to include others in my garage in the future it can't be denied that there are real benefits to an automatic transmission over manual transmission engines and so we are sitting inside of the dodge hellcat red eye which only offers an automatic transmission it's got nearly 800 horsepower and yet they only offer an automatic transmission much like the dodge demon which this shares an engine with so the first big disadvantage of manual transmissions that i want to get into that relates to this car here and especially you know at a drag strip or for a performance reason is launching and so when you think about launching with a manual transmission or an automatic transmission an automatic transmission uses a torque converter and torque converters have torque multiplication and so what this means is when the engine is spinning so if i spin up the engine and i have it in drive but the rear wheels obviously aren't moving then there's a difference in speed between that torque converter and the transmission and that difference in speed trades efficiency for torque and so what it means is you can actually nearly double the torque output for that moment when you have your engine spinning up and your wheels not moving whenever there's a speed differential you're trading torque for efficiency so you're heating up that fluid you don't want to do it for a long time but you get more torque in a manual transmission it's just a one-to-one because you have that mechanical connection you have the clutch plate the clutch and the pressure plate and the flywheel all sandwiching together and so it's just a one-to-one you don't actually multiply the torque so if you were to take two identical vehicles one manual and one automatic from a launch from that very beginning especially with vehicles which aren't traction limited not really the case with 800 horsepower here but especially the case when it's not traction limited you can actually have greater wheel torque with the same vehicle in that automatic transmission because the engine is spinning up but the transmission isn't so that torque converter is multiplying the torque that goes to the wheels now continuing with the theme of launching so number two we're talking about how hard it is on your transmission to launch the vehicle so manual transmission you rev up the engine you drop the clutch and you're either doing one of two things you're slipping the clutch and that's saving you know the shock from hitting your transmission or you're not slipping the clutch so you don't damage your clutch you either spin your wheels or get it to hook up nice but either way you're sending a shock through your entire transmission a big shock load with an automatic transmission you put your foot on the brake you put your foot on the gas it loads up that transmission and then you let go and you can start accelerating and this isn't going to be as tough on the transmission because as you release your foot from the brake it eases into the throttle and so you know that torque is already loaded up in the transmission and it's easy for it to then start accelerating it's not this big shock load that you're placing on the transmission now that doesn't necessarily mean that you can't damage an automatic transmission by launching it it's just that it has that torque converter which is a fluid coupling so you're heating up a fluid and eventually yes you could get that to hot but you're using a fluid to take the brunt of that work rather than the transmission itself when you dump that clutch and then it's all that force is going through your entire drivetrain so with an automatic transmission it's a much smoother process of sending that torque to those rear wheels now number three is crawling and so if you don't have a low gear range in your manual transmission vehicle it's very difficult for it to crawl because it's based on your first gears ratio and so at these low speeds if you want to travel at a really low speed to 3 miles an hour say you're sitting in traffic or you're off-road and you need to just drive very slowly to get over an obstacle it's very hard to do that with a manual transmission the way that you do it is by slipping the clutch and so you're doing that by wearing the clutch rather than just having a fluid coupling like an automatic transmission which has a torque converter and it's not hard on it to just inch forward now obviously if your car does have a low gear range then you can crawl and manual transmission vehicles but this is usually only common on off-road vehicles and even still there are plenty of off-road vehicles which don't offer it you know lighter duty off-road vehicles and also you know for for everyday driving those cars won't have it and so driving on the road if you're in traffic if there's inclement weather let's say there's snow or ice and you need to kind of crawl up a hill at a low speed you know then depending on the scenario you know having the ability to be able to crawl can be very beneficial and unfortunately with manual transmissions that simply means wearing out your clutch more than you would want to now number four is one of the more obvious ones and that is shift speed so automatics are not only faster because of torque multiplication but they can also be faster because they shift faster and simply put computers and modern automatic transmissions even the 8-speed you know traditional automatic here which uses planetary gears is much quicker than a human is going to be for shifting gears so whether it's a dual clutch or today's modern automatics oftentimes they're going to be much quicker than a manual transmission as far as shifting gears now i don't think that's that big of a deal but if you're looking for pure speed it is a disadvantage so in a racing environment you know manual transmission isn't really gonna offer you that advantage of shift speed and part of the thing is i mean it takes a certain amount of time to move your foot in and out and it takes a certain amount of time in order to move that gear lever forward or backwards and so that time is time that a computer you know isn't you know it's not a human it's not using human reflexes and speed to do it it's using mechanical reflexes and speed which is just so much faster and so you know even this and this is a great automatic transmission one of the best out there is the zf 8-speed and you know they do a really fantastic job with it so you know even if you're on low throttle it still shifts fast if you get into higher throttle it shifts even faster so this is a fantastic transmission and you know there's good reasons why dodge only offers the automatic year with the hellcat red eye and you know as a kind of drag race style car that makes sense now the fifth and final point is the fact that manual transmissions are really easy to stall it's almost impossible to stall out an automatic transmission vehicle and in a manual transmission you know this is obviously nothing informative to someone who spent driving a manual transmission but all it takes is lifting your foot off the clutch while you're in gear while you're stopped and that engine's going to stall out and so as an example i was driving a ford focus rs for the first time and it was parked downhill and i needed to back up and i had never driven the vehicle before so i get in it you know and i start to release the clutch and it turns out it has a really short clutch throw in the ford focus rs so as a result you know i've driven plenty of cars i've driven tons of manual transmissions i rarely if ever stolen my own cars but you know the first time driving that ford focus rs i wasn't used to the clutch and i stalled it out the first time i tried to back up on that hill and you know that's not that big of a deal you get used to it but part of it is you know you may have friends that don't know how to drive manual transmission vehicle so if you go on a long road trip which i do all the time in my subaru crosstrek you know my wife knows how to drive it i know how to drive it but our other friends if we want to rotate and we're on a really long road trip and they don't know how to drive it you know driving on the highway in a subaru crosstrek is nothing all that thrilling so trading off is kind of a benefit so when you do have an automatic transmission vehicle anybody can get in it and that's kind of you know even more glorified with something like this vehicle right here because anyone can just go to the dealer and buy an 800 horsepower vehicle and then just go drive off in it and they can be a clueless driver i mean it doesn't take much to get your driver's license in the united states and and anybody can get in this thing and then go drive it and i think part of that is why we see some of it you know the anecdotal stories in the news but automatics are very easy very approachable and that's a true advantage to them having a manual transmission it requires you to spend a little time learning how it works understanding it and you know mastering the art of shifting and the art of accelerating and down shifting and that kind of thing in a manual transmission so it's more effort and if you're the type of person that just doesn't want any effort and some people don't like driving so that's fine automatics do make sense in that scenario as well so thank you all so much for watching and if you have any questions or comments of course
