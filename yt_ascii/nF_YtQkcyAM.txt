we've had a lot of fun over the years buying the most interesting exciting delightful pieces of tech on the internet but today's a day where we spend seven thousand dollars buying the absolute worst it has to offer the most unsettling cursed just plain wrong tech money can buy okay let's just look for some cursed gaming tech every image here is making me internally gag oh no shopping basket is a pc case first playstation 5 gs5 it's 12 pounds with two controllers and free shipping sadly that's exactly what we're looking for am i seeing this right the playstation 5 comes with snes controllers what a strange image first gaming controllers pizza hut you can get a nintendo switch gun that's not very nintendo what's that it's called the dragon quest slime controller well i found it for 155 tell me this is not a real controller how on earth are you gonna be able to hold that in one hand while typing with the other we've got patrick star that's not cursed that isn't elite sony actually made a chainsaw controller that is so cool we can import it that one's gonna be a fun one to explain to customs okay so this console is apparently meant to have the most cursed library of games in existence i remember seeing gameplay footage of a mario game played on this and trust me it was haunting speaking of cursed video games there is something here called babysitting mama and your mentor take the baby and i can't i can't so apparently if you want to reach the highest tier of gaming you also need to get yourself a game ball i mean it might be as revolutionary as they're saying it just looks ridiculous the game boy had a camera like when did the game boy come out 1989 that's almost 20 years before the first smartphone my photos even look like back then game boy camera resolution 128 by 128 yes because obviously someone's made a knuckle duster for the joy-cons nothing is sacred okay so controller storage right tell me that's not hanging the controller by its joysticks don't do that imagine trying to relax knowing that your controller is hanging like that first gaming tech bye that's literally our video why is our video been labeled as cursed is google trying to say here okay i think we should move on cursed kitchen deck this will cause an unfortunate amount of accidents you can get a microwave bacon wrap you never put bacon in the microwave a pencil sharpener the size of your hand so that you can grate carrots you can plug this into a fruit and then it turns that fruit into a spray that's actually really cool if it works is that a small maker why does it look so medicine [music] so there's a vertical egg cooker it looks great you're very uncomfortable spoiled the gaming room in the kitchen enough lifestyle gadgets instant under patterns just add water excuse me i'm so confused i will order a pair a coin eating savings bank something about the face on this bank is making me really uncomfortable it actually like chews and swallows the money when you put it inside digital skipping what is she doing these people are literally bouncing around with no rope finger extensions okay fine of course we ended up on wish.com a working watch the size of a ring how are you going to be able to read it it's also a watch that's apparently a lighter that seems safe okay so basically my single least favorite item out of everything that i own is this little thing called the octopus they have managed to find a way to make every one of the legs also the rock i'm gonna buy it and then i will immediately burn it when the video is done it's a pimple popper you squeeze it to simulate popping pimples i know there are some people who really enjoy that i'm not one of those people a cat brush designed to be used with your mouth to simulate being the cat's other milo you can get nose and ear soaps what are they going to smell like the new tool i only click this because of how wrong it looks just doesn't sit well with me but it's basically meant to be a soundproof bluetooth microphone that makes it impossible for people around you to hear what you're saying right what's this ostrich pillow you've got to know how this looks right i can't just look at it okay what about like a cursed charger what is this creepy phone charger it looks like it will strangle you in the notes we can assure you will never buy this six thousand dollar phone charger which resembles an umbilical cord and pulsates while plugged in oh my god but it's an actually working charger so it's handmade by some japanese artist and she'll apparently custom make it for whatever phone you decide this is so expensive it makes no sense at all to buy this product but i did promise to buy the most cursed tech on the internet add to basket we don't talk about this anymore okay everything's arrived i barely even looked at all the boxes and i already feel disgusted to my course so i'm gonna see if i can try and survive a normal day of my life but using the most cursed tank on the internet oh beautiful morning disgusting it's the first thing i do every single morning i get dressed which means instant underpants time soak your pants in water as any good morning starts when was the last time you got your pants out of a tin i can't believe this is underwear it looks like an oversized painkiller i did nothing am i supposed to let it brew because it's meant to be an instant reaction magic okay well while we wait for our not so instant underwear at least i can see how much time has passed with the ring watch i can't believe this is my watch and actually makes so much sense to be fair as well not as hard to read the time as i was expecting although it's so tight i think it's reducing the blood supply to my finger it actually hurts like it's actually chris do you have any pliers milo's come to see me i'll go with a screwdriver my day is officially rude and it's only 9 30 a.m oh it's not good i'm genuinely scared about the state i'm going to end up in by the end of this day there's one consolation with all this stuff it's that at least it was incredibly cheap it's going for this really fancy classy royal looking watch face but then the straps they look like they're made of like recycled bin bags okay so then you top it up with lighter fluid well this is not dangerous and that has now also covered my wrist just so we're very clear if i hit the light button on this right now my entire hand could just go on fire i need to make sure there's not a trace of lighter fluid still on my hands before i like that oh no it's the soap it's even worse in person if this was like bright green or bright red it would be far less haunting than it is but the fact is skin well they've managed to make it somehow devoid of any scent whatsoever which makes me even more uncomfortable than i already was texture is so weird oh that freaks me out isn't it also kind of look a bit like a pasta disgusting i'm gonna leave it in the middle of the sink we had a shriek later we know what it is okay it's nothing nothing is happening here [music] oh my god did you get that okay so this just exploded off camera it turns out the fuel when you put it in is actually leaking to the back of the watch which means that if i was wearing it on my wrist my hand would have probably caught fire so please don't buy one of these and still nothing from our supposedly instant underpants come back to it terrible morning really hope breakfast goes better than our week laptop by moving it up on the inside okay so that's heating up while it does that it's time for our orange juice it's one of the very few products that i'm actually not terrified to test you basically stab this into the fruit and then it uses its mechanism to break apart the internal cell walls so that you can apparently just spray the juice into your mouth when did you ever think you'd see that okay the green light is on let's crack two eggs inside oh i did not sound good the fact that these eggs are just cooking within this mechanism that i can't even see is mildly uncomfortable at least now it's time for the bacon this is such american packaging it could just be how the day is going so far but her eyes are looking deep into my soul when i was eight i invented the best way in the world to cook bacon let's see about that so this basically creates three racks for you to hang your bacon on and then a tray to capture the fat that comes out of it so it's meant to be healthier okay yep so it literally is just a hanger for your bacon i'd be lying if i said it wasn't kind of satisfying it was like trying to hang bacon on it is in itself destroying the bacon and then presumably when the fat in between the meat melts it's just gonna fall apart okay so the last thing is you place the tissue on top so it doesn't splatter inside your eyebrows then what is this going to look like when it comes out right what on earth is happening with my egg i have to say one thing that's made me feel slightly better this entire process is the fact that i can actually smell the fresh orange coming from this mmm it's gonna take a lot of sprays to fill a glass but wow that's so refreshing and i guess when you want more juice you just squeeze the bottle this one's definitely going to be actually not bad at all category so here's the question if you can't see your egg being cooked how do you know when it's done and to be fair as advertised a lot of the fat has just fallen into the tray below see what it tastes like it's a bit dry and it's very chewy but it is bacon i think it's time for human intervention with this egg as soon as he does it how do you like your eggs in the morning it looks like an alien egg never has the bacon looked more appetizing okay i mean it tastes like an egg and just no longer look like one hey it's a hearty breakfast we've got i mean what even are these so this isn't like electronic or anything like that it's literally just self-regulated no this is it i think i've ever seen is this like a practical joke one two three four five six they're spinning a different speeds how do you count the entire idea is a little ropey just out of curiosity i do want to compare it to a real skipping rope oh there so this has just reminded me of a couple of cons with a normal skipping rope a the fact that it keeps smacking the ceiling b the fact that it keeps getting stuck on things and see the fact that it keeps whacking my feet oh yeah just realized there's one more thing we need to do so last year we had the unfortunate pleasure of obtaining the octopus we've just now inherited its successor dear god so far that is the single most cursed thing i've seen all day i can't describe to you how much i hate this but since the rock is the gym guy you're gonna have to leave him to watch over this video really isn't [music] so i've had a full hour of a proper workout not these things and i was kind of thinking i fancy a nap i'm not normally a nap person but i've always loved the idea of it and this product the ostrich pillow is kind of the perfect opportunity it feels eerily soft as well wow it's like a bean bag but just with like really really fine beans here goes nothing oh god it's really dark in here [music] i can't be right what the hell is going on here okay so each one of these is for one of my ears and then this is from my mouth so i could lie down and have a conversation with someone it's kind of designed in a way that you'll be able to sleep anywhere and still feel comfortable to be fair it kind of achieves that actually the most pleasant part of my day so far ah time for a bit of gaming which would probably actually be quite a nice activity if we were doing it on a relatively normal setup like this i say relatively normal because if you've seen the video with me and big style and i built this it's got some issues but they're not it's time to hang up our traditional playstation 5 controller one sticky pad two sticky pads and then we hang it by the joysticks looks about as uncomfortable as i am let me show you what we are using there'll be no ps5 today just the gs5 i mean the size difference is actually kind of impressive my goodness the ports and the buttons look rough i actually do kind of rate that it comes with its own mini gs5 stand i think this might be the lightest most empty feeling controller i've ever held in my hands there's nothing inside of it they haven't even got around to labeling what the buttons are no button on either of these controllers is doing anything do you seem to press like super hard there's definitely something cursed going on with this video there's 300 games in this there's like a full second of delay even though it's wide controller it's far from the worst thing i'm going to use today but it's not great this one's even smaller and this time they've not just copied nintendo's games they've also copied their controllers not to mention the fact that this console and these controllers are about 30 years apart action game shoot game sport game fighting game racing game puzzle game wow just within shoot game there's 150 in one this is like when consoles only had the power to create 2d games but they tried to use optical illusions to make them seem like 3d but then again if you were really into games from this era then to be able to have like a thousand in a device this size and for the price it costed it's actually not that bad of an offer there's no call of duty i'll put it that way it's actually surprisingly low latency considering that this is a wireless controller and technically for the wrong console wait they've got the entire console backwards just like i guess the games you play on it my team's actually prepped these in the order that they think goes from least cursed all the way to most cursed so time to step it up so this is a philips cdi i've never played on in my entire life but i and just trust me when i say scarring i mean it all looks hunky-dory right now it got a nice game it's hotel mario everything's bright and cheery in the world the scary thing is going to be more what happens when you play it feels so weird to see like a phillips boot up screen and this thing right here is the controller for it if you've never seen anything like it so all of this stuff up here is for the game and then you've got your separate media controls down there so the entire reason this console exists is because nintendo at one point realized that cds are about to be the future of consoles and they contrasted out philips to design an add-on that allowed their nintendo console at the time to support cds but then one day even after philips had actually designed the thing nintendo just turned around and were like actually we don't need this so philips were just like screw it we've made the thing anyway let's just turn it into its own console which is why you have this bizarre scenario where a machine made by this company is playing mario oh it feels very strange seeing mario and luigi as full-size people all these characters oh they're horrible that's not mario it's like someone's drawn them in paint close enough to be recognizable but far enough that it makes me not want to sleep at night this is haunting stuff moving on to the nintendo switch the console i actually do like so these are the joy-con knuckle dusters does feel like a very strange concept considering how these are basically designed for kids kind of blingy not gonna lie hey that's actually not bad at all i genuinely think that adds a significant amount of comfort to controllers that otherwise would be too small for my hands like you can very clearly see the layers that the 3d printer has built as well as little like hairy kind of wires that are falling off it but really i mean these are knuckle busters only way to test them is to engage in a fight okay so this is joseph he actually helps to get a lot of this stuff ready and i'm just deciding what character to beat him with for the first time fighting talk considering i'm the one with knuckle dusters i don't like it i don't like it i have to say the knuckle dusters are slightly too wide oh that was massive i feel like it makes a difference like when you're holding oh i think compared to like a pro controller using these little joy-cons it's not designed for instant sensitivity no like this i don't like this oh he's polished me off and that's actually problematic because the next controller i'm about to use is a little more on the screen yeah and see if i can topple joseph with this unit of a controller the ergonomics of this controller are not nearly as cursed as i thought they would be i think i'm going to have to put this in actually not cursed it's getting a little heavy the normal switch joy-cons had to be portable so a lot of ergonomic compromises are made just in the nature of that which didn't have to be made here i'm using a piece of kit from the 1990s and you're losing come on come on get out of here get out of here yes you know what unexpected delight and when it's resting here like this being able to actually have a full-size keyboard is kind of crazy i'm a huge huge fan i don't think you are so this is a normal ps4 controller this is the slime controller so slimes are one of the monsters found in the dragon quest games oh absolutely that's crazy wait they're right there this is not designed for human hands i mean this genuinely has the worst ergonomics i think i've ever experienced you're actually meant to store it upside down so the joysticks fall in this random little stand none of it makes any sense i can just about deal with the ridiculous button layout and the fact that this thing doesn't have rumble and it also doesn't have a headphone jack then you just got this upside down face looking at you the entire time this is actually so grim the attention to detail is shockingly good it looks so much like blood that i actually really don't want to touch it oh my god and then you start it by no way that makes the controller and i can actually feel the rumble of it oh yeah and of course if you're holding the controller in a completely new way they've also had to completely reimagine where every single button goes look at this r2 is here l2 is like there it feels very wrong to be using this to play crash bandicoot do you know what the fact that they built this entire mechanism for the haptic feedback when you do this it means that when you are playing you can really feel the impact of every footstep on the ground it's really satisfying okay i mean this seems this seems nice i'm in a good mood so i think it's like a game that teaches you how to look after babies [music] i just realized what we need to do controller goes inside of the baby it's already moving towards traumatic territory milk time i don't know what it thinks i'm about to do using a bottle so you kind of put it like that oh and then every time you feed it too much it starts crying this is one of the most cursed experiences of my life i think we're gonna have to name you kirsty and why is this diaper detachable i don't know all right i think i'm i think i'm done with this right probably do something useful now it's work time and for that this is mutalk it's designed for people who take a lot of calls but they don't want to share with the world what they're talking about so you stick your mouth into this chamber while you're taking a call and on the very inside is apparently a really high quality microphone so it should isolate background noise really well i mean the reason it's on this video is more because of how it looks when it's on kind of like bane from batman can you hear what i'm saying guys yes [music] hey oh hello oh i can hear myself you can hear yourself that's not good well that's a sign i don't mind this is not working very well at all sound like you're 10 meters underwater fine that doesn't work in the slightest what a terrible product okay okay no it's fine it's fine because i can rescue this with the my webcam for today which is the game boy camera it's actually crazy how this works so the gameboy camera is mounted onto its own cartridge and goes into the console as its own video game which means that when you turn it on it's just kind of weird we've done a really good job of gamifying the camera experience i mean i've never ever seen a camera that looks like this okay so i'm gonna line it up with my face oh that is a very unfortunate image because the fact that the pixels are either black or they're white which makes it very very unflattering or does someone say cursed so navigate to our library so if we now click on view what the hell this is absolutely my hair fuel and now we click print this is disturbing imagery click print and then it transfers that to the printer which is actually kind of crazy because it doesn't use ink at all it basically applies pressure and heat to heat sensitive paper there's a reason most printers using you know what tops the whole thing off is that it just looks like a minion gone wrong so let's see if extending your fingers can actually make you more productive so you secure your finger in the thread and then slide it all the way in this is where you feel the consequence of having incredibly fat fingers this is how people turn evil do you see the power that's possible from the other side hey milo you want a little cuddle why is he not like the slightest bit freaked out in my fingers kind of three times the length and made of plastic did you actually just make yourself more comfortable that's where this cat's cursed [music] it normally sits this still for a cuddle extremely confused i'm even more curious how he's going to react to this says the cat lick brush it's designed to communicate with the cat in the same way that their mother used to i'm about to lick my cat it says bite [music] hell no it's not interesting the evil fingers are fine your mother's tongue you don't like no girl are you leaving right now time for the world's creepiest money box to deposit my earnings for the day there's something about it that's really really just chilling so i think you just take your coin and she just said take my money it's the way it moves like skin [music] so this is meant to reduce your stress levels apparently and i mean i can't think of a day that i've needed that more it's everything so it's in light today you have to heat up the pimple costs ah this is pimple juice right okay the pus is sufficiently warmed the idea is that it's like a reusable toy so you fill the holes yourself squeeze them out yourself then refill them did you just call it swords and we basically need to let that set for a minute i don't like baking except you don't get a cake at the end and that would make this like spots batter yeah boy three two one oh it's solidified into like one big plus worm why do people like this thing and i can't believe i'm saying this but if you think that's disgusting you actually have not seen anything yet no i was at 10 pm and this still isn't done it's the least instant gadget in this entire video watch how this isn't even a pair of underpants what can't wear that and if it wasn't bad enough that we've had to wait a day for instant underpants you can see through them i think we've been pranked here is where it gets many many tears worse so you remember the grow cable right well this lady has very kindly been keeping me updated with them the entire production process like just imagine for a second you're strolling around you're going about your day-to-day life and you get a message you open that message see fits this lady has spared me no detail i'm not gonna lie to you it's cursed or a product as it is it's actually come from a really interesting place this lady is an artist and she basically sees the world and sees people's reliance on smartphones and so she's handcrafted this umbilical cord charger to symbolize that in the same way that a baby relies on its mother and feeds via an umbilical cord there's absolutely no doubt in my mind that this is about to be the most scarring thing i've seen all day three two one oh it comes in packaging thank you for your purchase i hope you enjoy your fun charging time why is it presented on a bed of silk i really dislike having to open it this way because it means that by the time it's open it's already in my hands oh no no oh please stop no why why is it so big there's been far far too many skin like gadgets today this one's by far the worst should we plug it in okay at least it's usbc i wonder what the transfer rate is so that end goes into my laptop oh it's so squishy i swear i just felt something move here [music] get the hell out of me the idea is that if i now put my phone in i'm so sorry for such an unfortunate wallpaper choice it's like how do i even explain this i'm only just realizing the level of detail she's gone to on the skin of this you've got all the tiny little textures that normal humans would have tim got all the redness and the bumps and the veins i can't believe we spent four and a half thousand dollars on this i mean if you're enjoying this video then a sub to the channel would be groovy oh i nearly forgot the best thing good vibes only for this part it's the small maker i would actually do bad things for a dessert right now because it's biscuit marshmallow biscuit and for some reason it tells me to fill this with water oh i was wondering what these arms were for they actually managed to hold the biscuit in place that's i cannot wait for and you know what else is heating up right now awkward as browser there's
