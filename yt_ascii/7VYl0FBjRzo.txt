if you really enjoy a good sheet of smartphone specifications you're gonna be pretty happy with this lenovo has just announced maybe the most insane looking smartphone but something's a little bit off so last year lenovo announced their flagship smartphone the zed 5 and they created a whole load of fake hype to get people excited for it they made it seem like the phone is gonna have a 95% screen to body ratio 4 terabytes of storage at a 45 day battery life they talked about how it was gonna come with' new technologies and well this was what we ended up getting the way they'd gone about teasing the phone they've never explicitly lied but they were manipulating the truth for example the company's vice president stated that they'd be announcing a product with 4 terabytes of storage at the phone's launch event so obviously people are going to take that leap and assume that it is the phone that's gonna have that feature when actually it was a cloud storage drive that they just released alongside it fast forward another year and it kind of seems like the company is doing it again this time with their 2019 flagship the zed 6 pro but that doesn't change the fact that it might well be crazy value for money first things first it's got the snapdragon 855 paired with up to 12 gigs of ram and 512 gigs of storage and we've already seen it supposed and to to benchmark score of wait for it 400 3077 that would make it a world leader in performance with even a 10% gap over the xiaomi me9 it had been pairing that with pc quality liquid calling to sustain that performance and that's not a small feat and it's actually only the start of a really impressive spec sheet it supports 27 watt fast charging so more powerful than one pluses - charge and pretty close to their new warp charge 30 standard plus a weighty four thousand milliamp hour battery you're getting dolby atmos audio the latest android 9 and an in display fingerprint scanner that supposedly works even with wept fingers it's even got a six point four inch amoled display with support for high contrast hdr 10 content something i like is that it can reverse charge other phones using a physical cable connection which allows she be faster than the current trend of reverse wireless charging and here's the bit that you weren't expecting it starts at four hundred and thirty dollars so for that price you're getting the model with six kids of ram and 128 gigs of storage but still having all that other stuff seems like an absolute steal and would pose a massive threat to chemise offering but the whole thing just seems a little bit off to me one of the main things that was teased is the camera and turns out it's e quad camera setup with a few really interesting perks the main sensor is 48 megapixels it's got an ultra wide camera but this time with a 125 degree field of view which is even wider than the s tens 123 which in itself is wider than for always this means it cannot just capture even wider shots but can also get closer to subjects it doubles as the super macro camera the third lens is a telephoto and the fourth one it's something they call the super video camera and it is just there for video enhancements i've even got a time-of-flight sensor on top of all of that and if you flip it around to the front the 32 megapixels selfie camera it has got everything and so it all seems pretty good so far but a couple of months ago lenovo's vice-president did a presentation which is actually where he announced that this phone was coming and at the same time he talked about how they were working on three things 5g next generation hyper video and a 100 megapixel plus camera they didn't give any details on what this hyper video would involve but it sounds exciting and 100 megapixels is over eight times the detail of the galaxy s 10 is 12 so in exactly the same way as happened with the z5 last year and it's supposed four terabytes of storage people got really hyped for this phone the vp even sent out a message on weibo containing both the hashtag z6 pro and the hashtag 100 megapixels so like he's obviously trying to build hype at the same time without promising anything and then he sent a second message showing that the phone could juggle 4g and 5g using two separate sim cards anyways during the launch event it turns out we're only gonna be seeing 5g on the discovery edition of this phone to come out at some undisclosed point in the future they literally didn't even mention anything about 100 megapixel photos but the phone does come with this hyper video they've been going on about at least we now do know what that means it's actually not one thing in particular but it's the name that the company gives all of its collective camera modes so this super wide angle mode you've got this super macro mode as well as a super night this thing can record hdr video it can record portrait video in 4k apparently and this is all impressive stuff but at the same time it's a little misleading to say that one big thing is coming and then for it to actually just be a whole load of smaller things that already kind of exist one thing of note which they didn't mention is that the main suppose it 48 megapixel camera this phone has is based on the samsung g m1 sensor a weaker sensor that we've actually seen in even cheaper phones and it can't actually capture true 48 megapixel shots without using software to piece things together so let alone 100 megapixels even 48 is kind of a stretch here but it actually gets stranger lenovo showed his side by side of their new phone against the equal where p 30 pro taking video in low light and even though qua ways is the best smartphone out there for low-light video and costs twice as much that a novo it seemed to come out on top so either this phone is a complete game-changer for half the price of a flagship or this whole thing is an elaborate misleading setup and lenovo is about to get a lot of flack all i can say is there are a lot of questions i'm gonna try and get hold of one to answer them and i will let you know if you enjoyed this video it'll be massively appreciated if you could subscribe to the channel and in the meantime i'm off to find some dodgy chinese retailer so i can try and import this thing [music] you
