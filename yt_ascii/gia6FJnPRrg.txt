does money make you happy how much space is too much space and can a hundred thousand square feet of prime la real estate fill up the void in a broken man's heart today we're gonna be answering those questions thanks to a new side of youtube i recently discovered which i like to call ultra rich flex youtube and they're gonna be blessing us poor people today i mean i know i know i got the lambo in the back for these people a lamborghini is like a cardboard box okay it's nothing to them these people are ridiculous and today they're gonna be blessing us look with a feature-length documentary called the biggest and most expensive house in the world which they are humbly calling the one now if you're interested in this i encourage you to go watch the whole thing because i'm just going to be cherry picking the best little bits because normally i'm not interested in this kind of stuff i mean it's fine if you're into it but for me luxury for the sake of luxury isn't my style but the reason this video interests me and the reason i'm bringing it before you today is number one listen we've been talking about too many dark things pumping dumps scams whatever it's nice to take a little bit of a pause but secondly this video is so much more than it appears under the surface it is like the the iceberg of videos it appears to be a luxury video about a luxury house but in fact under the surface it's like a mini documentary on the hollowness of wealth the insanity of obsession a testament to just how out of touch you can get with regular human beings it's incredible okay it's it's a journey that's all i can say and before we embark on it let me just introduce you real quick to the main characters of our saga the first is this designer niall niamey he's the developer of the one he's a complete psychopath the second one though is our host producer michael who's one of the biggest ultra rich content creators now i'm not i don't want to bias you anymore so without further ado put these on real quick droning over miami let's go it is the most epic of epic videos we are at the largest house in the urban world when i say the largest it is a hundred and five thousand square feet it is called the one and what gets better than that we are with the one and only nile who is the visionary behind this he built this and he is just an incredible guy and he's going to show us around this house that no cameras have seen this house before in its entirety ever ever ever is that correct that's right so it starts out the tour starts off fine but pretty quickly it's clear that things start to go off the rails the type of person to build this house is not going to be stable this office is the only room in the house the house is surrounded by water so we have little moats and we have a total of seven water features and swimming pools combined but this office you'll see every single wall in this office touches water so it's like it's floating this is just incredible look at the height of this i'm six foot two one small question why i feel like you could fit a small crane in there and i'm not talking about the bird these are supposed to be drawers how do you get there with the cherry picker it's it's impossible to put anything in those shelves i think this is the best moment where you realize these people are on one talk to you guys about that because it's something close to me they're taking us to a glass statue and then off hand he says this this is a moat and the reason that we did a moat here let me stop you right there there is no reason to do a moat at first i love how he's like hey we're gonna go see this oh by the way there's the moat and then he tries to justify like there's any good reason forever for emote but besides to defend you know some castle structure from invading troops so below we have probably the world's most expensive running track because you can't run in bel air because there's no sidewalk so now you can run from here all the way to where the front door is does anybody ever stop in these projects and go but why the property is like a hundred thousand square feet i feel like running from one bedroom to another is enough of a workout are you choking me this is going to be a first i never walk on grass like usually you watch videos because it's like relatable i have to imagine nobody's watching this and thinking yeah that's me this is real grass and i'm gonna walk on it what congratulations michael welcome to the team i guess this artist was nice enough to make this for us and because they wanted to be involved in the one but it's turned into something so much more because my ex-wife i i'm just getting divorced unfortunately oh okay that's very sorry to hear that it was a whirlwind relationship i met her during coven and it it didn't work out matter married her and divorced her during covet okay weird thing to bring up when you're bragging about the one okay bad joke is that why she didn't go with you because she never felt like she was the one hey you know what i'll i'll see myself out for that one kidding guys i would never leave you in the middle of our show excuse me go ahead sorry sorry to interrupt you there bud but this is a charity that we have called wings of angels and this is going to help children in third world countries it's not through the arts because what what are you going to send him a picture you sent him a little postcard hey look how sick my house is this artist was nice enough to make this for us she she came from a very tough life in cordoba and she wants to be part of the solution of changing the world and one of the ways we're gonna do this here is through this charity i guess he's talking about like a real charity but you keep touching the sculpture and it makes me think that you think that the sculpture is gonna like save kids with the arts and by the way i don't think their problem is not enough arts i think their problem is food i'm not trying to hate on this guy's charity thing i just think it's funny that he thinks this sculpture is going to change the world this is a elevator a machine elevator i think there's six elevators he's like that's like the lamest one actually keep it moving we've got six of them dime a dozen year in the one here you know i'm i'm a big developer i have built a lot of houses no houses like this but i've learned over time that we really need to start sustaining and trying to do things where we don't just waste this man has built one of the most opulent wasteful properties in the entire world and then he unironically because you can feel it can't you that he believes this he unironically like is trying to say to this guy he's delivering the property to like hey man really learned how to not be wasteful the irony hurts so this is one thing that that we found all of my flowers are artificial but you can never tell right i hate this man i really do this is where it turns for me from like hey this guy's like it's funny how out of touch to like oh i hate you though oh my gosh you're saving the world through artificial flowers in the most wasteful property of all time it could be an apple headquarters the size of this building and it's for one person there couldn't be a more wasteful thing on earth and this guy's trying to tell you learned a lot about you know the green world it's like when you know somebody's flying a private jet and they're lecturing you about recycling they're like hey you gotta recycle those aluminum cans it's like you jackass okay we see what you're doing coffee tea anything you want but the cool thing about it is this is the setup here so it holds the milk and keeps it cold so you don't have to fill the milk up like in the melees and then it grinds it fresh so this does everything you don't have to descale you want to do anything you just this is the first part of the house where i'm kind of like i kind of want that can we start a gofundme for me guys touch on your phone cappuccino and other than having a cup come up it does it all guess where we saw one of these michael where in your other house oh yeah in your oh yeah this i forgot about this part tiny little' 000 foot house that was 65 million bucks which one was that which did you go to which' million dollar house are you talking about referring to with that super specific cappuccino machine i've got 12 of them and just wait because it gets so much worse how much of the house would you say this is nile percentage-wise that we're looking at 15 10. so look look at the running track oh you weren't kidding no that's a real running track yeah yeah you can watch the moment he realizes this oh wait rich people don't run why would you want to run on a track where you can look down and see your kind of hideous disgusting poor neighbors you don't want to see that right so they take us to the nightclub i would say that probably the part that the most people have been talking about about this house tour though is this weird moment i know and unfortunately in l.a i know a lot of the dudes are scumbags here and i'm going to change that i'm going to turn all the dudes into good people how are you going to do that one of the things i'm going to do is i'm going to set them on their feet so check out what i did in here plates right here that's for a monitor right and then if you come into the his side so he puts a monitor in the girls side can you believe these are the these are the urinals and i'm gonna have cameras here looking at the guys you're gonna have cameras me too hey me too this man right now i'm just not sure the logic tracks here this guy says hey i'm gonna save the dudes in la from being total dirtbag scumbags i'm tired of it how are you gonna do that i'm gonna spy on people's genitals without their consent that's hey oh man are you guys not entertained this is this is not your average luxury tour guys we are witnessing a special breed of human who has transcended social cues who has transcended self-awareness and becomes something entirely the type of man who knows how to set men right by peeking on their private parts i guess little dick camera is what it is camera's looking at the guys putting the image in the girls bathroom out of the box thinking that's adorable i have to say the approach of let's stop guys by being creepy by being even creepier it is out of the box i'm just not sure how that's going to work for you chief now with all these beautiful moments of these people being out of touch whatever i think it's finally time to in a tour prematurely you can go watch the full thing on their youtube channel and talk about the true insanity because if you thought they're just walking you through the house was crazy there's an even better video called the one its vision and future explained which is a video about the house and like what it's built for and this is what really blew my mind about realizing oh these people need professional help like it is beyond a youtube video to help these people yeah they're asking like what's your favorite part of this house the designer is going to answer answer now miami miami and you said something like what we can do with the house what did you mean tell everybody well i think that i have something very very exciting and i believe that i don't have this by chance the house is called the one bel-air and my show is called the one and between those two i think that we have the ability to really change the world in a very positive way when you say change the world in a positive way how does this house change the world this is the first great question by producer michael so far it's just been like clapping this guy in the back for building this completely ridiculous house nobody needs this and actually i heard that this guy is having a hard time selling it because of basically precisely that problem so then this guy goes oh it's going to change the world so how i i i will explain so because of covet all of the venues around the world have been either shut down or dramatically altered there is nowhere in the world really where you can go for a venue like you used to have like a big boxing match or the academy awards if you're asking yourself is he going where i think he's going with this because if he is he's the worst human on the planet the answer is yes to all of the grammys or anything else that required a large crowd to gather at staples center or mgm or caesars palace or any of these other places but we have it now because this house has the ability to hold 900 people in a safe coveted environment let's give it up guys we the the world was suffering because nobody could meet together and this guy spent like 100 million dollars 500 million dollars building something that could seat 900 people this guy's like hey the world has a problem no one can commute because of coven so i spent 10 years building this thing that can make 900 rich people's life slightly better because by you're not inviting poor people right look i love how this guy's like hey i'm doing charities for like like poor people and then you find out that actually the house is of course just for rich people to go from their mansion to the giga mansion and what is being created for this house is a show that is a show that everyone will want to watch and identify with because it stars me nobody identifies with this or you and i live in the house with people that i love we do crazy things and have crazy parties but we also help the world in so many different ways this is this is great i'm sure this is how the kardashians feel too they're like we're doing the world a service we're changing the world how will people get to watch us live a great life it's like that doesn't that doesn't change my life but what would change like you know third world country people's life is not you building a a mansion in the most wealthy part of the world it's you may be helping with that money and i'm not saying this to like you know shame this guy for spending the money his money the way he wants to spend it but you can't pretend you're helping the world while not helping the world that's all i'm saying don't say you're doing this for charity or the world when you're just building yourself a hundred thousand square foot mega giga mansion we are creating gigantic boxing matches right in the grass with the world championship boxers that you could ever imagine and concerts and anything that you could imagine that has a pay-per-view event leading up to the pay-per-view event will be my show so the the talent will come through the lands will be here because i have a lot of friends who are billionaires i have a lot of friends who have more money than they know what to do with and you understand if you have a billion dollars how much money you're making a year if it's at five percent what if you have two billion what if you have three billion you could never spend that money well i have a friend are you lecturing us as like a multi-millionaire that other people are being not being generous with their money and they're using it for selfish reasons are you really doing that it's three billion dollars and when i was in my house looking up at the sky saying i didn't have enough money to buy a cheeseburger he wouldn't help me [laughter] this okay this is about as relatable as kanye west being like i'm in debt nobody's sad for you kanye and nobody's sad for this guy it is not because people don't care about the poor it's because you're not poor this is a real person who was like five minutes ago telling us that he's got you know which multi-million dollar house are you talking about a tiny little' 000 foot house that was 65 million bucks which one was that which did you go to he's complaining about not having money to buy a cheeseburger i'm sorry it's not gonna work you have to feel bad for this guy at a certain level because it's like i don't know man i don't think this guy's happy with his life and fundamentally that's because money doesn't buy you happiness and like this video is just such a beautiful testament to there is no such thing as enough because as soon as he start finishes this this thing apparently he's gonna you know try to invest money into a plane right because you know his house wasn't enough i guess he needs to put a plane on it i am going to buy this plane that i call the god plane yeah and that's basically what you're dealing with i mean this guy is totally delusional i think producer michael might be one of the most sane ones to be honest i've watched a few of his videos since this video that we're watching here and he comes across more as a collector like an interested collector like he just wants to show you the cool stuff he has rather than somebody who's just doing it to flex on people so i would have to say producer michael even though he doesn't challenge him very much here he definitely is a lot more normal and it seems more well adjusted than anyone else we're talking about although i will say the grass comment was very extra this is going to be a first i never walk on grass and yeah at the end of the day like what do these people have to show for it like the guy complains multiple times in this interview about his ex-wife i just don't think these things make people happy and i think this show is like a great accidental documentary into this i hope you enjoyed this different kind of video and thanks for watching see you guys the next one
