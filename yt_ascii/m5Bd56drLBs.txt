honestly we all suck at passwords and yeah maybe you personally use unique impossible to guess 50 character randomized passwords for all your accounts but unfortunately you'd be the exception rather than the rule you special little person you according to a 2019 google study about a quarter of americans used some absurdly unsecured passwords like one two three four five six and according to a different study from the same year around three quarters of users in the us and canada reused passwords while around half only change one character when they're forced to update their passwords and to be fair a big part of the reason this happens is that the average person has so many online accounts now that they can't keep their password straight and many people aren't even aware that password management software even exists then you have the fact that passwords sometimes aren't even stored on the servers themselves in a secure manner all you need is to take one look at the headlines about password dumps to see that but do we even need passwords at all even though we're all still used to punching in passwords people in the computer industry have been discussing eliminating them for quite a while now back in 2004 bill gates himself pointed out that the whole idea of a password was flawed for situations where a high level of security was needed but if this is true what would we use instead microsoft seems to think they've got it all figured out if you have a microsoft account you can actually go into your settings right now and choose to convert your account to password lists instead of using a password you can use the microsoft authenticator app to secure your account each time you want to log in you'll either get a verification code from the app or through sms or email get prompted for a physical security key or use biometrics like windows hello face scan i'll tell you a little more after this message from our sponsor pulseway pulseway is an all-in-one platform management tool that can help protect your business for things like phishing and ransomware pulsar's got features like automated patching and central user and system management they also offer disaster recovery backup and stolen credential monitoring so protect your business today and try pulseway for free through the link below the password list isn't just something microsoft is doing though it has stolen the headlines considering it means you can go entirely passwordless on windows many mobile apps have allowed you to log in with a fingerprint after just a first-time setup and the signs also point to google moving to a passwordless model with those one-tap authentication prompts that show up on your phone possibly being the way of the future in fact google builds security keys directly into android phones themselves in order to verify that it's actually you trying to get into your own account of course even though none of this will sound super novel to anyone who's ever used two-factor authentication as all of you should be we probably still have a ways to go before passwords really become a thing of the past while large firms like google and microsoft will probably lead the way in implementing it it won't be trivial for smaller organizations to switch all of their infrastructure over to passwordless especially as users often have to log into multiple services that might not automatically play nice with each other it's for this reason that it departments might be looking more at a concept called the federated login which essentially means that one login will get the user into all the services they need but this takes work to implement and this isn't the only barrier to ditching our passwords if all this sounds like two-factor authentication with you know one less factor you'd be right although not having a password sounds super convenient it has the potential to make things a massive headache if a user loses their phone or their physical access token so cyber security workers face a challenge in figuring out a practical way to verify a person's identity if the worst happens personally i'm a fan of good old-fashioned secret handshakes so thanks for watching guys if you like this video hit like hit subscribe and hit us up in the comments section with your suggestions for topics that we should cover in the future
