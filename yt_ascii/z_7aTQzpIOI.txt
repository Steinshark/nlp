hello everyone and welcome in this video we are learning all about the engine used in the brand new toyota supra and toyota actually did a great job with this engine it has already won three awards auto top 10 engine awards it won in 2016 when it was used in the bmw 340i it won in 2017 in the bmw m240i and it won in 2019 with a bmw x5 so yes if you have not figured out yet bmw makes the engine for the new toyota supra and just about everything else now the engine is referred to as the b58 and there are of course many variations of this b58 so the latest information i have seen is pointing to the engine in the supra being the b58 b301 so what does all of this mean well the b means it was made by bmw actually made by bmw if this was a w it would mean that it was created by a third party the five means that it's a six cylinder engine if this number was a three it'd be a three cylinder if it was a four it'd be a four cylinder but because it's a five it's an inline six cylinder the eight means that it is gasoline powered turbocharged has valvetronic and direct injection the second b also means that it uses gasoline but that the engine is mounted longitudinally the 30 represents the leaders of the engine so it's an inline six cylinder 3.0 liters the o is its performance class so bmw has a performance class scale from k all the way to s there's six different classes and the o is the upper scale so you know not quite in the dead center but there's six classes and o is considered upper s being the top k being the bottom and then one is the revision number so it is the first revision of it i've also seen some reports saying that this instead of this 01 in the supra it is a c but regardless i believe this is the engine used in the z4 now in the z4 the engine's making 382 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque the supra of course being based on the z4 but with a different exterior and then the engine in the supra is 335 horsepower so it is down on power versus the z4 and a little bit on torque 365 pound-feet but it's also starting at 15 000 cheaper than the bmw z4 and the engine that won the ward's auto 10 best award for 2019 used in the x5 is making 335 horsepower so same as the supra but down on torque 330 pound feet at 1 500 rpm so this does give us a clue i do believe you know the super is going to have that turbo that full boost come on very early so i wouldn't be surprised if we were see a very similar rpm number for where this torque is available but used in the x5 this engine is getting that peak torque already at just 1500 rpm very cool now the b-58 engine is the successor to bmw's n55 engine and so we're gonna get into some of the changes here for this engine versus the n55 and one of the things one of the major changes to the block is they went from an open deck in the n55 to a closed deck on the b58 and so the main advantage of doing this is for rigidity so bmw does this with their diesel engines but now they're going to be doing it with their b58 engine and and it has that added strength added durability added rigidity of the block there of course you know the advantage of using this open deck design is that you have that coolant flow all around your cylinder bore so you have to change up a little bit your coolant strategy using the closed deck but overall it is going to be a stronger engine that can handle higher pressures within it so you can see just these smaller little coolant bores versus an open deck is going to have you know that entire area around that cylinder is going to be available for that coolant to flow around it and of course i've just drawn two cylinders here this is an inline six cylinder engine with the twin scroll turbo we'll get a little bit into that later on but overall a stronger engine block design versus the previous n55 the b58 engine is also using an upgraded cylinder liner so whereas previously they were using cast iron cylinder walls now they are using an electric arc wire spray and actually spraying on that cylinder liner and it's very thin so it means you can have a larger bore with the same size block it weighs less it's only just 0.3 millimeters in thickness versus you know the cast iron cylinder wells which will be much thicker has less wear better heat dissipation lower friction bmw says the unfortunate thing with these is that they cannot be machined again so they will last longer typically and they have less wear associated with them lower friction better lubrication properties but unlike a cast iron cylinder wall where you could simply machine that again if you were rebuilding the engine the b-58 is using both of bmw's valve technologies venos and valvetronics so vanos is valve timing and valvetronic is valve lift and so variable valve timing as well as variable valve lift and so here just kind of looking at some different scenarios which bmw has stated how they're using this at low rpm here you can see the lift profile of the exhaust camshaft and here's the lift profile of the intake camshaft of course you have intake compression power and exhaust and then so you have your exhaust valve opening there and then you're going to move on to your intake phase and so at low rpm you don't really have much overlap between the intake valve pulling in that fresh new air and the exhaust valve pushing out that old air bmw says this helps improve torque at low rpm once you get into higher rpm and you have more exhaust scavenging and you're improving the flow through here you'll increase the amount of overlap that you have between the two camshafts and that allows you to pull in a bit more air and make more power so both of these are done for optimizing power you'll make more power by having less overlap at low rpm and you'll make more power by having more overlap at higher rpm another thing that you can do with the valve timing is have internal egr so rather than having a separate circuit for the egr to travel through you can simply close that exhaust valve early trap in some of those exhaust gases depending on what you want to do for egr and that of course means reducing combustion temperatures and thus improving the nox emission properties and of course valvetronic i have a separate video explaining all about how valvetronic works but the major update to this b58 engine is that they have reduced the height of the system so they can decrease the overall height of the engine by making this more compact of course allowing for a low center of gravity in the toyota supra one of the things they're claiming about it is it's extremely low center of gravity even though this is an inline engine toyota is claiming that the toyota supra will actually have a lower center of gravity than the toyota 86 which is using that flat boxer engine another cool thing about this engine is its use of a twin scroll turbocharger and this makes a lot of sense when paired with an inline six cylinder engine and so what you're doing is you're separating the first three cylinders and the back three cylinders exhaust manifold as they travel to the turbocharger so the turbocharger has two separate scrolls and each scroll has its individual exhaust manifold now i've stretched this out in reality it's going to be much more compact but the reason why i've stretched it out is to help explain why it works and why this strategy makes sense so if you have this inline six cylinder engine right here cylinder one at the beginning cylinder six at the back you're firing order one five three six two four so here we're looking at the different exhaust pulses based on when these valves open so if our cylinder one is our first then we're gonna have that exhaust pulse up here next is five then it's over here next is three down here six up here and as you see two four it goes back and forth between these two exhaust manifolds and that's why it's beneficial you're separating those exhaust pulses and allowing time for the valve to close in between and so if you were to think about this system if you were to use a single turbocharger where you didn't have these split scrolls then all of those exhaust pulses are going forced down into the same exhaust manifold and so they're going to start to overlap with them because since you have a six cylinder and you're firing six times for every two rotations of that crankshaft that means every 120 degree rotation of the crankshaft you have a cylinder firing which means you're going to have valves open at the same time there's going to be two exhaust valves that are open simultaneously so looking at this example here with a single scroll if one were to fire first and then you have your exhaust stroke that exhaust pulse is coming out from one and then while it's traveling out cylinder five is going to open so this valve is open here at cylinder one and this valve is open here at cylinder five so now one is competing to force pressure against that exhaust pulse 5 that's coming out and also send pressure to the turbocharger so rather than having these kind of conflict with one another you separate out those exhaust pulses and as a result you're able to maximize the amount of energy you can put in that turbocharger maximize boost minimize turbo lag and you're doing this by ensuring that each exhaust manifold does not have two valves open at the same time with interfering exhaust pulses and finally this engine has a different charge air cooling system versus the n55 which used an air-to-air intercooler and now they've switched over the b-58 to an air-to-water intercooler so you'll notice the intercooler is right above the engine so you're gonna have a separate heat exchanger up in front of the car which is going to allow that coolant to circulate between it and the intercooler and of course then you will have your air travel from the turbo compressor into the intake manifold where you've got that integrated charge air intercooler and then pass into the cylinders and bmw says there's a good number of advantages for doing so they say that they have lowered the volume between the compressor and the intake valve so that's the most kind of the most critical component here is that you're reducing the volume of air from here after it passes out of the compressor to hear the intake valve so if you were to use an air-to-air intercooler that has to come up all the way to the front of the vehicle it has to travel through that air-to-air intercooler and then back and they're able to shorten the routing it's actually shorter than the way that i've drawn it here but they've significantly reduced the volume between that compressor and the intake valve which helps minimize turbo lag and improves the responsiveness of the turbo they've also stated that you get a more even temperature distribution across the valves by using this air-to-water intercooler so not much variation between what cylinder six is getting what cylinder one or three is getting as far as the air temperature going in so more even more normal combustion you don't have to worry about your air fuel ratios being different for each from differing temperatures it also has a higher intake pressure of course using that intercooler reducing temps and you know increasing the density of that air before it passes into the cylinders they say they've been able to use a smaller turbocharger which improves response and that they have been able to improve fuel economy by decreasing the temperature of the air going in that means combustion temperatures are low and they can use a bit more advanced timing create a bit more power and operate more efficiently so that is the new toyota supra it is essentially bmw hardware with a toyota body placed over top of it i'd love to hear what you guys think about the new toyota supra in the comments below thank you all so much for watching
