good evening and welcome to dr jordan b peterson's we who wrestle with god tour [applause] all these great bands and here you are tonight well thank you very much for coming let me tell you what's going to happen tonight i'm i'm going to share my thoughts with you for 70 minutes thereabouts then i have a special guest here constantine kizen who runs a podcast good well you should know about him definitely crazy russian from the uk a a real a real voice of reason for for our our our fellow westerners in the uk constantine is going to come out on stage and torture me about what i said i hope well what i'm hoping constantine is um very clear thinker very witty man he's got a very sharp mind he's critically oriented in the best possible way a good critical mind separates the wheat from the chaff right because to be property critical isn't to hurt or destroy with criticism it's to separate what's truly valuable from what isn't valuable so that you have solid ground to stand on and you know one of the things that i've strived to do in my whole academic career is to move closer and closer to believing in and stating and writing things that i can't i can't move and you do that yourself by subjecting your own presumptions to critical analysis you do that so that you think through what you're doing so that you don't act out your stupid ideas in the world and die and and that's the purpose of thinking right seriously the purpose of thinking is to have your stupid ideas die instead of you and that's part of the reason why your enemy can be your best friend because if someone can take out something you think because they can show you how it's erroneous and counterproductive and then you don't have to go through all the trouble of learning that stupidly in the world that's a fine gift and so i'm hoping that constantine can stand in for for the for the audience for the critical and skeptical audience were talking about very difficult issues it's highly likely that i could formulate what i'm stating more clearly and precisely and so constantine will come out and we'll discuss what was presented tonight and then we'll turn to the questions that you've kindly delivered and discuss those and and then we'll reintroduce the band and that should do for the evening and so that's the plan and so away we go i'm very much looking forward to [applause] this so the first thing we're going to talk about is we're going to talk about stories and and set the stage i think we're at a crucial inflection point in in the world culturally and philosophically i think we're on the dawn of a new set of realizations a new set of realizations that will return us to our fundamentals i think the reason that we have a culture war raging in the west why there's so much instability is because something new is struggling to be born or reborn and i want to explain the reason for that first and and the reason is that the enlightenment view of the world which has guided our technological and scientific endeavor our conceptual endeavor our philosophical endeavor for a few hundred years is there's something about it that's wrong like deeply wrong and that error is making itself manifest in the scientific community because i would say now that scientists themselves from a multitude of different disciplines understand that the idea that we see the world as a place of facts or that we see the world as rational creatures or that you can even see the world that way is wrong wrong and i believe that it's it's been demonstrated to be wrong it's this isn't a matter of mere philosophical opinion anymore although it's also that one example for example is that the newest artificial intelligence systems that we've designed the large language models that have burst onto the stage in the last year or thereabouts chat gpt the catastrophic gemini that google so foolishly launched elon musk's grock these systems are trained like human beings are trained they have an aim they have a purpose they were trained with reward and punishment so to speak they're approximations to a target they see the world through a structure of value that they have absorbed from human beings to make the world's smartest linguistic machines we had to inculcate in the a structure of value okay and so and and we produced machines now that can engage in discourse that can use language in a way that's virtually indistinguishable from the human and that's going to become radically indistinguishable from the human very very rapidly and they're not programmed like lists of rules they're not programmed like ordinary thinking machines they're programmed the same way that human beings learn they're programmed with aim they have an ethos and an ethic we can't orient ourselves in the world with the facts we can't follow the science because science isn't a leader science doesn't establish our aims our aims are established using mechanisms of perception and emotion and thought that aren't in themselves scientific we're aiming at something why can't we orient oursel in the world with the facts well the simplest explanation for that is that there are too many facts there's as many facts as there are phenomena more actually there's as many facts as there are possible combinations of phenomena you drown in the facts when you're confused in your own life and things are chaotic and you're anxious it's because a plethora of possibilities is making itself manifest in front of you and you don't know which way to turn you don't have a clear direction you don't have a clear aim there's no way of simplifying the world so that you can act in it we know for example that to perceive the world you have to obliterate from your consciousness almost everything that you could see because otherwise you you're overwhelmed we know even that the hallucinogens who are being studied in with increasing intensity in recent years interfere with your normal perception such that they bring to consciousness a plethora of things that under normal circumstances you ignore and the consequence of that is a influx of a sense of overwhelming significance and meaning but at the same time a kind of paralysis of action because when everything becomes infinitely meaningful there's no straightforward way of moving forward when you're in a restaurant with someone on a first date and you're focusing on the conversation and actions of your date in a sea of competing conversations you zero out everything that you could be attending to in every other table all the competing thoughts in your imagination all the things you could be bringing to mind to zero in with like laser pinpoint accuracy on what it is that your partner in conversation is doing and you do that in the world all the time you make one thing at a time of pinnacle importance and you arrange everything else in the world at every moment that you perceive around that thing that you've made of ical importance that's how you see the world and i don't mean think about the world this is under thought it's more profound it's what you do when you actually see if i decide to do something straightforward like walk from here to the stairs on the stage and i set my aim i don't perceive any of you you in consequence because the fact of your existence is irrelevant to my purpose and you're gone none of the facts of the stage that i could attend to are relevant and perceptible anymore except in so far as their pathways or facilitators or obstacles to my journey forward if i'm looking to the stairs i see the chairs but not as places to sit i see them as obstacles that i have to circumvent in order to attain my aim everything that you see in the world makes itself manifest in accordance with your aim and that's a radically revolutionarily different way of conceptualizing the world than the notion that you take the facts and you sort them despite their infinite number and calculate your way with the facts rationally forward that's not what you do all right here's a proposition to contemplate it's it's another proposition that has revolutionary significance it'll explain all sorts of things that you know to be true but don't know why they're true that description of the structure through which you see the world is a story that's what a story is okay so now this explains many things that are otherwise left as mysteries or or side effects i read a book by steven pinker once pinker's an enlightenment rationalist from harvard and a good guy and very smart and much of what he says is extraordinarily useful but he believes for example that our proclivity to enjoy and tell stories is like a side effect of something more fundamental cognitively it's it's the story as entertainment theory you go to a movie because it's it's fun you you read a book of fiction to your child because it's fun it's it's not core to the what would you say it's not a core element of the way that you exist in the world it's mere entertainment it misses the point that theory why is it entertaining why can you teach children with stories if this if you get the story right for a child you can capture the child's interest and you can integrate almost any form of learning into the story and the child will be captivated by that when children play pretend play which they do spontan ously they spontaneously dramatize the world they spontaneously make stories out of their roles and their and their destinies and that that that captures them that forms the basis of their friendships that's why children want to play so frenetically is that they're practicing modeling the world when you go see a movie it's not that you want to be entertained although it is entertained that's not why you're there it's not for fun either that's easy to understand and to and to see what's fun about a horror movie i'm dead serious it's like people will be so afraid in a horror movie that they'll cover their eyes they'll hide behind the chair in front of them they'll ask themselves afterwards why they even put themselves through it and yet they'll line up and pay to do it well why would you line up and pay to torture yourself well cu you want to know how to deal with what's horrifying and you want to practice that in a way if you can that isn't in itself fatal you want to expose yourself to the catastrophes of existence so that you're prepared when those catastrophes come along you want to expose yourself to the pred the predators that lurk everywhere you want to inure yourself against what's disgusting and contaminating because you're going to have to deal with it you want to expose yourself to what's frightening so that you can find the courage within you to deal with what's frightening and that's part of the instinct to develop and expand your competence and it's in that expansion of competence and skill that occurs as a consequence of that voluntary exposure that the entertainment is situated the reason that's entertaining is because it's part of the manner in which you expand yourself and you can do that in the direction of what's dark and terrible just as you can in the direction of say what's heroic what do you do when you go to a movie well you you you fasten onto a character and you understand that character the same way that you understand people that you're in conversation with now you might think that the way that you understand people is by you listen to what they say and you extract out the knowledge that they're delivering to you in terms of facts and you interpret the facts and you derive your understanding of the person like none of that's true that has absolutely nothing to do with how you establish a relationship with someone and well here's some proof is that what you do with a dog well obviously not but you can establish a relationship with a dog and so and the relationship you have with a dog it's not the same as the relationship with with a person but a dog's a pack animal a dog can become a member of the family you can you can understand a dog well enough so the dog likes you right and so whatever you're doing with the dog it isn't discourse about propositions cu most of the dogs you own don't talk so and it's the same with very young children and and it's the same with an infant you establish a relationship using mechanisms that aren't propositional they're not rules they're not descriptions they're not facts that's not how you do it how do you do it where do you look when you talk to someone you look at their eyes why to see where they're pointing them why so you can see what they're looking at why so you can infer what's important to them because we point our eyes that that's that which is important to us that's why our eyes look the way they look black in the middle colored on that ring around that against a white background that's an evolved mechanism i can see your eyes all of our ancestors who eyes whose eyes weren't visible either got killed or didn't reproduce the one thing you want to know about someone right away is where the hell their eyes are pointed and you can do that politely which you do by attending to someone without too predatory a stare you do that by attending politely to their face but not too intensely and not attending let's say inappropriately to other parts of their body and and they're going to be watching you to see what you do with your eyes because the one thing you want to know about someone above all else is what the hell are they up to right what's their aim and so when you go to a movie that's what you do when you watch a character in role you see him in a variety of different situations and you watch how he structures his attention what he pays attention to because attention is a costly business and so people pay attention to what they value you watch what they attend to and you watch how they prioritize their actions and from that you derive an understanding of what's important to them as soon as you understand what's important to them you've got their aim you've figured that character out this is what you do when you learn to know someone what's their aim as soon as you know their aim you can see the world through their eyes you can see the same objects they see and the objects take on the same emotional significance and when you say i come to understand someone what you really mean is oh i understand their aim and now i can aim a at the same thing at least in simulation at least fictionally and i can come to inhabit the same world of perception and emotion that they inhabit i can even guess at how they might act into what they might attend in situations i haven't seen because now i know their aim what's he up to that's what you're thinking in a murder mystery or in a thriller what's he up to what's he up to what's going to happen next and so the plot of the fiction is the aim of the character across time the aim as the character unfolds and that might involve the transformation of his aims as well right and that would be the transformation of a character in a movie he aims at one thing and he learns that that aim is off in some manner or he comes to a bitter and dismal partial end and has to switch course and you want to see people transform their aims that's character development we see the world through a story the world res the world's objects reveal themselves in relationship to our aim the landscape of emotion presents itself as markers on the pathway to our aim the world reveals itself in accordance with our aim that's how perception works that's a hell of a thing to learn because if the world for example appears to you only as thorn bearing obstacles right if you feel that everything's array against you and there's no pathway forward if you feel that you're surrounded by foes and obstacles instead of walking the golden pathway accompanied by allies with the world on your side you might ask yourself whether or not your aim is wrong and so the world lays itself out in accordance with our aim we go we produce fiction we generate fiction we live in a fictional landscape because we want to get our aim right we read stories we watch movies we go to plays we talk to each other because we want to get our aim right we want to find the place we should go and we want to learn how to get there efficiently and we're compelled by spirit and instinct to to establish the aim and follow the path and to transform ourselves so that our aim becomes ever more precise and efficient and delivers us a world that's ever more abundant and beautiful and that's all a function of aim big tech companies enrich themselves by taking

okay so we live in a story well then as soon as you know that this is what the postmodernists figured out by the way this is why the literary critics have become a dominant force in the culture war the postmodernists were literary critics you think well there's nothing more irrelevant than a literary critic like who the hell cares what an intellectual thinks about a story i mean of all the posterous things to be concerned about that might top the list not if the story is the thing through which you see the world if the story is the thing you see through which you see the world there's nothing more powerful than a literary critic except perhaps an author and we wouldn't have a culture war right now if the literary critic wasn't far more powerful than anybody had possibly imagined because the french intellectual literary critics known as the postmodernists have criticized the central story of the west to death and that's why we have a culture war and it's no joke this is foundational there's no more serious conflict than that and you all can feel that that's why you're here you know that the world is shaking and uncertain in a way that's new and the reason for that is the story itself is under assault all right so let's let's wander through that a little bit you see the world through a story the rationalists or empiricists even the biologists they might have an answer to that they say okay fof you see the world through a story but the story is biologically determined or socioculturally determined it's a story of sex that would be freud because for freud and for charles darwin for that matter for richard dawkins the famous atheist to an equal degree the story the the the aim is sex reproduction and the story is predicated on that aim freud darwin dawkins the degenerate element of that is a descent into a kind of hedonism because if sex is the story then why not worship sex and some dispute that and say no the central story isn't sex this would be the marxists the central story is power that's the story that the universities tell when they're not telling the story about sex it's all about power the essential human aim is domination oppression victimization exploitation the central theme of the family is a power dynamic the central theme of the relationship between men and women is a power dynamic marriage itself is a heteronormative patriarchal establishment of oppression that goes back to the dawn of time the nuclear families the same thing economic arrangements are nothing but power friendships are nothing but power the landscape of human interaction is a dynamic of power or sex or both or both fighting against one another look these are powerful ideas why well obvious it's obvious why i mean first of all without sex there's no reproduction and without reproduction there's no people and so the darwinian freudian richard daw's selfish gene claim is that well what could it possibly be other than sex and the marxists come running forward and say how about power and then the marxist say well obviously it's power because there's radical inequality in the world there's some who have and some who have not there's no reason to assume that property in the final analysis let's say isn't a form of theft and everyone who has established themselves in some manner has only done that by stealing from those who are powerless and who have less everything they have and acre it to themselves and that's a credible claim for a variety of reasons the first most fundamental reason is is that a minority of people have all the success on any possible dimension of comparison it's a very small number of people who are radically attractive it's a very small number of people who are radically gifted in the visual arts let's say it's a radically small percentage of people who are musicians a tiny percentage of the people have most of the money a tiny percentage of the people gather most of the attention it's a pito distribution and that's what mark pointed on to the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and there's real truth in that and there's truth in the claim that people structure their relationships with power and and that some people who obtain success do it as a consequence of exploitation and it's equally true that when any human relationship deteriorates it tends to deteriorate in the relationship of power if your marriage starts to become shaky then you begin to exploit each other you use force you try to get your way you try to dominate it's the same within any family that's deteriorating into a state of pathology it's the same in any organization we've seen huge states deteriorate into the tyrannical use of power if you had to identify a cardinal attribute of mankind powers a reasonable hypothesis but let's think about that for a minute so imagine that well imagine that it's sex that is and should be the complete story of mankind well what does what does that mean exactly what's a world organized on that basis what is a world organized on that basis look like well there's nothing more important than sex well how about immediate sexual gratification whenever you want it how about immediate sexual gratification as the archetype of hedonism how about immediate sexual gratification whenever you want it regardless of what anyone else has to stay say about it because if it's the story and it's the fundamental story then what stops me from gaining access to what i want right now regardless of the cost to anyone else espe if there's nothing beyond that if only the naive believe that there's anything noble about humanity beyond the immediate demand of reproduction then what have you got to say that's moral about sex and why the hell shouldn't everybody just do exactly what they want with whoever they want whenever they want all the time and with power you can make exactly the same argument and classical societies aristocratic societies militaristic and marshal societies are predicated on this idea if i can push you around all that indicates is that i should push you around because if you're so weak that i can push you around you have absolutely no ground whatsoever to stand on to oppose me because if you were moral by the traditions of power i wouldn't be able to push you around and so it's very difficult to argue out of that from a rational perspective why doesn't might make right and why isn't it only the weak who claim that that's wrong and why isn't it only that the weak claim that that's wrong not because they're moral but because they're weak that would certainly be a spin-off on the nian notion that will to power con constitutes the core of man and i would say up until the dawn of judeo-christian ethic let's say power ruled and then we could imagine what sort of world it's like when power rules well we know what that world's like it's like pay attention to the strongest or suffer the consequences well is there something beyond that that's not mere naivity what's if it isn't power that's the story and if it isn't sex that's the story what's the story for the west the the answer to that is the library of the bible that's the story it's the story upon which the west is founded it's the story that has a arisen over thousands of years tens of thousands of years for that matter attempting to address the core issue what's the fundamental story it's no mystery to make the claim that the claim of the biblical library of stories because it is a library is that it's the fundamental story all right so we live in a story we've identified the competitors power and sex what is it that's being expressed in the biblical story look if you go to a movie you read a complex book you go to a sophisticated movie a sophisticated play a shakespearean play or you read a sophisticated work of fiction you see a multi-dimensional characterization right a comic book has a hero with one motive a sophisticated work of fiction has a hero and perhaps an anti-hero with complex multi-dimensional motivations whatever characterizes those more realistic people isn't reducible to any single attribute and in a complicated work of fiction the author walks you through a multi-dimensional characterization you see the same person the hero aiming up ward the anti-hero or villain aiming downward you see that person portrayed in multiple different situations and as a and and and pursuing partial reflections of their ultimate aim and in consequence of that you learn to understand and embody that complex of aims when you see a movie and you watch the hero you're watching the hero to learn how to act like a hero when you're watching a movie and you watch the anti-hero or the villain you're watching the movie to learn how not to fail catastrophically and land in hell while taking everyone else along with you is it reducible to something as simple as power or sex not if it's not a comic book you need a multi-dimensional characteriz ation all right the biblical corpus provides a multi-dimensional characterization of the fundamental aim of man and cosmos that's the claim of the book so i'm going to walk you through some of the stories and show you what's being revealed what's being revealed is the proper object of worship okay so what does that mean the proper object of celebration the aim towards which all sacrifices and work are to be directed that which should be held in the highest regard that which should be imitated in ritual and admiration okay so that's the that's the idea admiration in the same way that a small child who hero worships the boy down the street who's the baseball star because that boy portrays a pattern of skill and attention that is the next appropriate developmental step for the hero worshipping child that's a recreation of the religious impulse the impulse to look up admire and imitate the question being what to what should we address our attention upward looking admire and imitate that highest possible object of apprehension and admiration is by definition god it's a definition it's the highest aim that lurks behind all proximal aims that's a good way of thinking about it it's the upward aim as such all right how do you bring that down to earth well let's start with genesis 1 there's a characterization of god and man in genesis 1 the the story opens at the dawn of time at the beginning of things that's not exactly the beginning of time that's usually how it's read but it's more complex than that it's not only the beginning of time in the linear sense but it's the beginning of all things that begin this is what happens every time something begins this is what happens every time something new makes its entry into the world it's the continual b beginning that continually unfolds that happened and is happening now and will always happen it's the pattern of the emergence of order out of chaos that makes itself manifest in the form of your life how is the stage set the spirit of god hovers over the water over the deep you hear that in the judeo-christian tradition god engenders the world ex nilo out of nothing that's not how the story sets itself up it sets itself up with the spirit of god hovering above the waters but it's not water that's not the word water is one of the symbolic images attempting to make what's being described clear using a sequence of complex metaphors the word for the water over which the spirit of god hovers is toou vaboh or tome and it means it means a lot of things it means it means the the dragon that lives at the bottom of the deepest well it means the unplumbed depth of the most abysmal ocean it means the water that brings forth life it means the it means the infinite well of possibility itself it means the confusion that rains when your world falls apart it means the un structured day that makes itself manifest with you wake up it means all of that it means the dragon that the archaic god sliced into pieces and made the world from it means it's the hydra that hercules defeats to form the world it's all of that so what does that mean it means that the spirit of being and becoming generates the world from possibility what does that mean that's what your consciousness does that's what you do see you think you're surrounded by a world of objects that you manipulate in a robotic fashion but you're not concerned with the objects that are static you're concerned with what you can dynamically transform when you wake up in the morning what presents itself to you is a field of indeterminate opportunity that's why you worried or perhaps excited because you have something to grapple with that hasn't yet come into being the possibilities of the day and you might think oh my god i have so many things to do i'm overwhelmed it's too much well that's the toou vaboh that's the chaos and confusion that's a plethora of possibility you're thinking oh my god how many ways are there for things to go wrong well that's the multi-headed serpent that the hero always confronts and what do you have to do with that it's like well are you going to establish the order that's good in the course of the day because that's what you're called upon to do and it's your recreation of what god himself does at the beginning of time that constitutes the action of your conscious on the possibility that's in front of you you have a microcosm of plenitude and possibility right in front of you at any moment that you can wrestle into order if your aim is right the process that god relies on to extract the cosmos the order that's good from the well of unform possibility is the word it's the logos what does that mean how much hell can you bring into being by saying the wrong words to your wife right now your wife is who she is but she's also who she could become as you've no doubt noticed many times and you can extract out something good or something terrible from the possibility she represents with the cautious and love in application of your words or with the careful and prideful and dismissive application of your words and the world you live in will be radically different depending on which of those two approaches you apply and that will be exactly the same with anyone else you talk to and how you treat yourself and how you interact with the world as such because there's a provision of possibility that you're offered as a participant in the process of creation that you formulate in accordance with your aim what's the insistence in genesis 1 aim up with love so if you want to establish the paradise of your household in relationship to your wife and your children you aim at what's best for the best in them you offer them the security that you can imagine that's the walls of the walled garden and you present to them the challenge that allows them to unfold and develop optimally and you do that appropriately if you're aiming at what's best what's highest and that's the spirit of god that mak makes itself manifest on the waters of possibility that's the embodiment the source the initial source and the spirit of upward aiming ultimate love you can understand this by understanding what sort of walled garden you produce in your house own household with your aim god wrestles with the possibility that's not yet manifest and creates the cosmic order as a consequence in sequence creating the fundamental divisions to begin with the separation of light and darkness that's the phenomenology of day and night the separation of the land from the waters the establishment of the dome of the sky over the disc of the earth populates the world with its created beings and on the sixth day produces man and says in his own image so now we have a characterization of god who's the dynamic process that gives rise to order from possibility itself in keeping with the highest possible aim and we have a characterization of the human being as a microcosm of that process the notion that each of us has a worth that's transcendental and not given by the state not given by yourself not given by other individuals is predicated on that image i mean that historically and i mean it conceptually the notion is that one of the notions is that the state itself has to grant to you the worth of someone created in the image of the creator himself in order even for the state to exist maintain itself and transform that the state itself cannot function unless it establishes a sacred boundary between its operations and the operation of the psyche the human psyche the human spirit that's a manifestation of the god who generates the order that's good from possibility as your business grows the workload can become overwhelming task that used to take

might ask well who believes that and i would say try talking to one person once without believing that and see how it goes we call to each other all the time especially in our intimate relationships to be treated as if we are the locus of value and if you treat people that way if you regard them that way if you perceive them that way if you encourage them in that pathway of development everything in your interactions with human beings will open itself up to you and fill your life with abundance everyone wants to be treated that way and the reason for that is it's in keeping with our essential nature and that that hospitable welcoming encouraging upward aiming loving treatment is the aim an attitude upon which the soul the the soul the community and the natural order itself depends for its integrity your country is predicated on that notion the idea that each of you is owed with inalienable rights and their requisite responsibilities is a d direct reflection of that conceptualization and one of the things you might frequently remind yourself of is the fact that your country wouldn't be what it is which is the closest approximation to a shining city on the hill that's been established so far in the travail of mankind without that fundamental conception [applause] right so then you might say well is it true and the answer is it's not hell i i mean that because lots of countries are hell and they're hell in a way that opens up into an abyss and has the possibility of a deeper abyss waiting latent within it which will open up with the possibility of a deeper abyss within that and that's what happens when that fundamental characterization is overthrown in a revolutionary manner or carelessly abandoned and we saw that for all of us who are non-believers and no longer conceptualize the metaphysical hell is real we saw the metaphysical hell realized in the 20th century many times in case anyone having abandoned their metaphysical presuppositions was so blind that only an object lesson would suffice right nazi germany the the soviet union under stalin the chinese communist party under mao if that isn't close enough to hell for you then i would say you should pray that you aren't introduced to something even worse for the purposes of convincing you about what's real in the second god announces two things once he three things four things once he creates man he says man is to tend the garden that's his purpose why a garden it's a wall garden actually because that's what paradise means wall garden why a walled garden well a garden is a place of nature obviously and walls are a place of culture and a walled garden is a place of nature encapsulated in a manageable manner by the walls of of culture that's what your backyard is it's a yard it's nature has walls the walls are culture the walls you could think of as physical as physical entities as objects but your your lawn has borders if you don't have a fence and your neighbors know where the borders are and where are the borders well they're in the imagination of your neighbors i i'm i'm dead serious about that the walls it's so funny cuz you'll see people in the border between canada and the united states say they'll get out and they'll step across the border it's like as if it's an object of it as if it's an entity that's there on the ground and people know that that's magic in some sense because the grass in canada is only slightly less healthy than the grass in the united states let's say it's easy to concretize that but the the idea of a walled off space in a communal society is a social agreement you have your domain your house your your garden your backyard that's enough cosmos for you to set right and perhaps if you're competent enough to do more you'll expand your garden so that you have more to tend but you start with a walled garden of some size and if you tend it properly then and the promise is that as your confidence grows so will your dominion man sent to tend the garden and to name everything that's in it this is adam what is it what is that mean well it's the logos again it's an re-representation of the creative spirit of god that makes itself manifest when time begins and when new things come into being our ability to name our ability to speak is that in in the microcosmic manner that's what we're capable of doing that's what the patriarchal spirit does is name and order the world and god brings everything to adam to see what he'll name them and that's a reflection of the idea that we have a created order but man has a place in it and the place is to organize it and to put everything in its proper place and to assign it its identity and that's no different than the prioritization of attention that's part of the story name things in relationship to their function put things in place in relationship to their significance in the hierarchy of being orient them orient all named things things upward sequence constrain organize and order the manifestation of the patriarchal spirit what does god decide that's not good enough man lacks a helper man needs a helper woman's created as a consequence because the order that men produce because of their lim li itations is insufficient and something has to be introduced to speak for that which is not included that's the role of woman that's the biblical role of the woman it's the biological role of the mother you know this in your own household women bring the concerns of the marginalized to the center you can think about that politically it's useful to think about it politically all established human orders exclude the exclusion causes pain the pain of exclusion requires a voice that's the voice of the eternal mother that's where genesis 1 ends genesis 2 begins contains the story of adam and eve it's another creation story it's commensurate with the first one it's a variation on a theme god creates adam out of matter earth and breath spirit why because that's what human beings are we're material creatures that are animated ana means spirit we what's the spirit the spirit is the living organizing principle of the material and human beings are an amalgam of the living organizing principle and the material and that's what's portrayed in the creation of adam the combination of matter and spirit the combination of material and conscious you could think about it that way if you're more secular-minded we're conscious matter what's up with that no one understands that no materialist understands that we understand nothing about consciousness it's as mysterious now as it's been throughout our the entire course of our existence it's never been reduced to a material phenomena phenomenon we have no idea what that would even mean and if we did reduce it to the material all that would mean was that we inadvertently elevated the material we treat each other like we're were're conscious we presume from first principles that we're conscious we can't even distinguish between being itself and being conscious and so that's a perfectly reasonable representation of man woman is taken from man from a rib from the side as an equal there's a critique of patriarchal judeo christian narrative from the resentful feminist side that makes the claim that the biblical narrative is for example radically patriarchal in its orientation dooming women to subjugation that's a preposterous claim by the way it's it's not only false it's false in a very particular way there are falsehoods that are approximations of the truth there are falsehoods so deep that they're the exact opposite of the truth truth and the truth of the matter is that right from the first words the biblical library is miraculous in its in its insistence that women like men are made in the image of god that emerges in the first chapter and that eve is the equal of adam in every manner although complimentary and not identical and our society is riven by conflict so deep that we now doubt both of those propositions there's no form of confusion more profound than that sexually reproducing creatures without nervous systems can tell the difference between male and female i i'm dead serious about [applause] that if you can get people to swallow the lie that there's no difference between men and women there is no lie they won't swallow right so god makes adam and eve each with their own role and he puts them in the garden to play forever under the watchful eye of their heavenly father and he tells them they have free rain in the garden with everything delightful that's being created that's been created except for one thing they're not to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil so what does that mean man that's a mystery i spent a long time trying to crack the micro narratives in the story of adam and eve and it wasn't until three or four years ago that i think i started to understand that particular fragment of the story friend of mine is here jonathan paso some of you might have been following him jonathan and his brother matthew really helped me crack this and so we're here i'm here with jonathan and a number of my other colleagues and friends right now with the daily wire recording another seminar we released an exodus seminar we're recording a seminar on the gospels right now we're about 60% of the way through that and so just so you know that's also forthcoming god tells human beings he makes one fundamental rule do not eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil okay that's moral knowledge that that should be self-evident knowledge of good and evil that's moral knowledge moral knowledge is predicated on the idea that there's an upward path and a downward path that there are desirable things and that there undesirable things and that at the pinnacle of what's desirable is what's heavenly or paradisal and in the abysmal depths of what's undesirable is the diabolical and the hellish and that's the moral landscape that's the landscape of good and evil that's the fictional landscape fictional in the sense of characterization and plot fictional in the sense of distilled truth not falsehood fictional in the sense that the fiction describes the structure through which you see the world fiction as the deepest form of truth what does it mean to eat of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil when nche announced the death of god in the late'00s he said something that he believed would constitute a pathway forward he said we have dispensed with god we are the greatest murderers who ever lived we've engaged in a murder so profound that will never wash away the blood how could we possibly how could we possibly conduct ourselves in the aftermath of that murder you read of n as a triumphant anti-christian he was a very complicated person and he knew perfectly well that the dissolution of the christian metaphysic would produce a cataclysmic consequence he predicted in the late'00s that europe would turn to a radically resentful egalitarian communitarianism that would kill tens of millions of people which is exactly what happened and he saw that coming just as clearly as his russian counterpart theodore dovi saw it he knew what would rise in the aftermath of the death of god he knew that resentment and communitarianism would be one temptation and he tried to formulate a alternative path he said we're going to have to create our own values we're going to have to take it upon ourselves to create the moral landscape i read that and i understood why he said that i could see its influence on clinical psychology for example the notion of the self-actualized person the notion that our soul should unfold in the direction that's commensurate with the deepest understanding of our subjective selves right the radical unveiling of subjectivity self-de i am what i say i am which is a radical claim in our society now a claim of omniscience not only am i who i say i am you better act like i am who i say i am that's the claim of the radical subjective well what's wrong with that claim well the psychoanalysts criticized n very effectively they said look how are you going to create your own values when you're not master in your own house have you tried telling yourself what to do how does that work for you i know you're just your own obedient servant right you're so morally pure you just tell yourself at new year's that you're going to go to the gym and you're going to diet and you're going to be some stellar physique lean mean fighting machine by march and you go once and then you tell yourself lies about why you don't have to go again and that's the end of that and if you were capable of creating your own values you wouldn't be the the banner the tattered banner that blows in the wind of its own whims the psychoanalyst figured this out very quickly you're a war of competing whims and a creature like that's going to have a very difficult time navigating the complex landscape of the ultimate moral pronouncement who are you to make a decision about what constitutes good and evil and that's what god tells men and women it's like you don't get to create the moral order you get to dwell within it you get to align yourself with the pre-existent moral order you do not take to yourself the right the presumption to define good and evil themselves you bow your head to good and you pray for deliverance from evil and if you violate that look the hell out and that's the pronouncement and so what happens the serpent offers eve the fruit why the serpent well the serpent is camouflaged the serpent is crafty subtle the serpent is marginalized the serpent is the voice of pride the serpent is lucifer that's the metaphysical surrounding of the story that de develops over centuries the notion that the serpent in the garden of paradise is lucifer himself the spirit of pride what does that mean it's prideful presumption it makes you assume that you can define the moral order what's the provide what's the prideful presumption of eve at the beginning of time and forever i can even clasp the serpent to my breast it's the careless welcoming in of the monstrous and prideful under the guise of the pretension of maternal compassion and if you can't see that happening in our society you're

powerful feminine virtue and it can be inverted and made prideful and trumpeted and presumptuous to infantilize the world and to advertise that compassion as a badge of worth and honor as a mode of attaining status what's adam's sin what do men care about impressing women men are ambitious fundamentally to impress women for better or for worse what's the prideful pathway and false pathway to establishing a relationship with the two demanding feminine i've got it anything you want dear right and that's adam's sin he eve hearkens to the voice of of the serpent and clutches it to her breast in despite the clear injunction from the divine never to do that and adam weakly does exactly what the worst part of his wife wants and so here we are folks so what's the consequence of that well the scales fall from the rock and they notice they're naked and they're deeply ashamed and they cover up they become self-conscious okay so when do people become self-conscious when they make prideful errors when you overreach and you reveal your inadequacy as a consequence of the mismatch between your pride and your ability you'll be ashamed you'll recognize your insufficiency you'll be aware of yourself as an isolated entity that's all to become self-conscious psychologists have learned over the last 40 years that there's no difference between being conscious of yourself and being miserable those are literally the same thing if you're living a life of other centered community oriented hospitable calling you're not attending to the miseries of your isolated self if you stay in your bwick and you don't put forward your hand presumptuously you can live in the absence of painful self-consciousness pride goes before a fall we have a month devoted to pride in our culture right pride goes before a fall you know this in your own life you can ask yourself and this is has been a christian conundrum since the beginning of time is your life miserable because misery is baked into the structure of the world or is your life miserable because you do stupid things and refuse to learn and bring endless misery on yourself in your presumption and you know you might say a little column a and a little a column b and fair enough but you certainly know that the most painful episodes of your life come when you claim falsely to be more than you are and the cor narrative in the christian judeo christian ethos is that the fall of man into the profane world is a consequence of pride and that is really something worth thinking about you know adam and eve are called upon to work in misery as a consequence of their pride well could you work joyfully if you didn't overreach yourself if you were aiming upward properly if you were telling the truth if you were acting communally if you're acting in relationship to what was highest would it be possible that your work would be joyful and bring abundance isn't there times in your life when that's happened is it is it the case that you move forward in misery in precise proportion to the pretention of your aim it's worth considering it's the suspicion that arises at the end of the story that begins history because it's with the prideful fall of adam and eve that him history begins adam and eve discover they're naked and they they hide and god comes along and says adam where are you and adam says i'm over here i'm i'm hiding and god says well why are you hiding it's a foolish thing to do right because adam is perfectly aware that god can see through bushes adam is hiding from god is it your pathetic self-consciousness that makes you hide from god that's a good question are you not everything you could be because you're ashamed of who you are that's what that story indicates and so god calls adam on he says who told you why are you hiding and adam says well i'm naked and god says well how do you find out that you were naked how did you find out that you were inadequate how did you find out that you are shameful and adam says you know that woman you made me it's her fault and that's the second sin of adam and that's another indication of the nonpatriarchal nature of the text you know eve is the first human being to take a bite of the apple but adam follows along and it isn't obvious to me that the follower of sin is in a worse better moral position than the initiator and then he compounds his sin like men do by blaming the woman why is your life so well if you had my wife man you'd know it's like those damn women it's like it's a handy excuse for men all the time to say that and it's not least because men can't tolerate being rejected by women and women reject them all the time and the reason women reject them is because they're not all they should be and so of course that makes men painfully self-conscious and makes them shake their fist at god and makes them hide and so what god says and so adam reveals himself in this pathetic manner it's like he can't even take responsibility for his own misstep he has to blame the thing that's been granted to him as the highest form of gift and not only her but god whose fault is it well it's not mine it's probably women's fault and if it's not women it's clearly god it can't be me so what happens while both adam and eve are condemned to suffer in their work and that's how history begins and that's the situation of fallen of the fallen world and that's the description of the landscape of profound fiction that we that we inhabit and that's only a tiny fraction of the characterization of god and man in the biblical corpus thank you very much [music]
