the story of wong labs begins and ends with the singular genius of its founder anwang an incredible engineer a brilliant businessman wang labs rose on the back of his ability to create the future an american story a man from china who came with nothing and became a billionaire before losing it all in this video we're going to look at the rise an incredibly sad fall of a computing pioneer wong laboratories but first let me talk about the asianometry patreon early access members get to see new videos and selected references for them before their release of the public it help supports the videos and i appreciate every pledge thanks and all with the show anwong was born in 1920 to an upper middle class family in shanghai his educated father was a teacher and a practitioner in traditional chinese medicine china during this period had fallen into an age of chaos torn between chiang kai-shek's kmt party and mao zedong's communist party of china wong's family would move repeatedly throughout the years staying ahead of the conflict wong started his schooling in the third grade since there was no first or second grade at the time so wong would always be two years younger than his classmates despite this he did brilliantly in math and science though not so much in the other subjects and not only was he brilliant he knew it too wong's unusual but quiet confidence in himself and his abilities would drive him for the rest of his life when he was just nine his parents wondered whether to send him on to junior high school or have him repeat the sixth grade wong made the decision himself taken the junior high exams and getting first place a few years later he tested into the shanghai provincial high school today shanghai high school and left his family behind at the age of 13 to attend it being two years younger than his classmates on wong in high school was quiet and kept to himself he shied away from team sports but liked ping pong he was also brilliant in the maths and sciences but struggled in other subjects like chinese and english never mastering the latter even in adulthood after testing in the top 10 of his class again wong won a scholarship to the chaotong university then considered china's mit he was just 16. the school later split after the chinese civil war it is now shanghai xiaotong university on the mainland and national young mean chau tong university in taiwan late 1936 was the time of japan's invasion of china the university along with wong's family fled to the french concession of shanghai an oasis amidst the fighting despite incredibly challenging personal circumstances his mother father and older sister would die in the fighting under unclear circumstances wong graduated in 1941st in his class after graduation wong joined the chinese central radio corporation to build radios for the chinese army he worked in the city of guelin within range of japanese bombers occasionally he and his teams had to hide into gwalene's deep limestone caverns to avoid the bombings people knew the mild-mannered anwong was destined for great things the company's president later told his wife look at wong he is very quiet but he is always thinking we have to support him all the way up he is very genius he will do something one day in 1944 the japanese overran guelin wang and his cohorts fled to the nearby chinese mega city of chongqing shortly thereafter the chinese government held a test to select a few towns to send to the united states for schooling wong naturally won a spot wong arrived at the united states in 1945 and entered harvard to study applied physics he found the work there pretty easy eventually receiving a phd in just 13 months he met a charming young woman from a prominent shanghai family lorraine chu they married after a short courtship and would have three kids fred courtney and juliet after receiving his phd wong joined the harvard computation lab working on the mark 1 then one of the world's most powerful computers under the strong-willed howard aiken there he pondered the problems of storing and reading large amounts of stored information without the use of clumsy mechanical steps back then data was stored on magnetic tapes reading out the stored information however demagnified the tape destroying the information how to get around this wong later recalls while i was walking through harvard yard i realized that it did not matter whether or not i destroyed the information while reading it i could simply rewrite the information immediately afterward without any real sacrifice or speed this concept was later incorporated into magnetic core memory or core memory the successor to the magnetic drum and the ancestor of ram in 1949 wong with his wife's encouragement apply for a patent of this concept today there are university policies for this but back then harvard only reserved patent rights relating to public health wong's patent application however angered his harvard lab colleagues who believed that such knowledge should be for the public howard aiken later said that wong quote ran away with harvard stuff and claimed it as a zone in 1950 harvard started moving away from fields with commercial applications which included computers dr wong has he would often be called disagreed with the decision he wanted to strike out on his own and start a company wong's friends tried to dissuade him it was a different time they only recently repealed chinese exclusion act had relegated the chinese to second-class citizens only for the laundries and restaurants but despite the racism his challenges with english and lack of money wong had unshakable confidence in what he could do even naming the company after himself and never entertaining the notion of changing it later on when a senior official bluntly suggested changing to something more quote-unquote american he angrily replied in a stuttering english if you don't like name of company you go work for company you like name better he quit harvard in april 1951 giving up a comfortable five thousand four hundred dollar annual salary just as his wife lorraine was giving birth to their first son founded in june 30th 1951 wong laboratories had just 600 of savings and dr wong but what an asset that was wong started by producing and selling core memories for about four dollars each has the only employee in a dusty office wong did all the selling himself he methodically called or wrote clients about what he had and in 1952 he reached out to ibm about licensing his pending patent on core memory the computer giant had started using the memory for their electronic calculating machines the talks dragged on for a year things were slow at the start and wong had to supplement his income by teaching a course at night but slowly he gained a reputation and custom consulting jobs came in he would tell one client first you show me all the ways you know how to do it after you have done that i will show you how to do it better and of course he followed through over time wong secured more custom design business in 1953 he struck a deal with ibm for some consulting revenue and a future option to buy his patent this gave the company the stability to hire employees wong was not only a brilliant engineer who saw all parts of the problem he was also a sharp very tough businessman unafraid to go head to head with ibm the doctor was also totally consumed by his work he obsessed over every little thing in his company even reviewing all the mail his company received when i say wong am i talking about the company or the person it doesn't matter the two are one and one that is how involved he was in the business and unfortunately wong was not a great boss a micromanager he demanded a lot from people and saw the company has something he fully controlled and critically envisioning eventually passing it over to his son in 1955 ibm paid wong some 400 000 to 500 000 roughly about 4.4 to 5.5 million dollars today for his patent good money but wong's patent only covered a small piece of the final core memory product ibm ended up paying jay wright forester 13 million dollars for a more practical and complete application of the concept wong kicked himself for being so close yet so far telling a friend why not i think of that ibm's money finally freed wong to move away from consulting towards products nevertheless he would harbor special ill will towards the american giant for a long time afterwards in the early 1960s wong partnered with a small boston-based company called compugraphic the compographic guys had an idea for a nifty machine that justified lines of text for publishing companies wong helped design and produce the machine which compute graphic sold as the linusek linusac named for a line per second was a hit in 1962 wong laboratories made 427 thousand dollars in revenue the next year they made 643 thousand dollars and then 1.4 million dollars a year after that a success but a quiet and shared one when competitors entered the market wong refused compugraphics request to lower the price compographic thus started producing the machine themselves cutting wong out of a million dollars of future additional revenue wong then told confugrefic that he patented the machine's original design and threatened an infringement lawsuit the lawsuit never happened but it shows wong's hard-headed style he learned then never to produce a product that he did not have full control over wong's first big fully controlled hit came in 1964. the calculator industry was transitioning from mechanical to solid-state transistor-based electronics wong wanted to take advantage of this trend wong wanted to produce a calculator far smaller than a mainframe computer but with the same capabilities he used natural logarithms to do this if you recall from calculus class you can easily multiply or divide two numbers if you have their logarithms but how to get the logarithms one might think to pre-calculate the values to get a table and store that table in memory but that would use too much memory so dr wong and a colleague developed a patented transistor logic capable of getting the natural logarithmic value of any number with just six natural logarithmic values 10 to 0.9 1.01 0.999 and 1.0001 these six values can be easily stored in rom thus we have the logarithmic calculating instrument or loci making its debut in january 1965 the loci looked like a typewriter fused to a box but it was small and powerful capable of finding advanced logarithms using less than 300 logic transistors the loci became wong's first big hit selling about 10 to 20 a month at six thousand five hundred dollars to science labs but it was also difficult to use with its intimidating keyboard requiring knowledge of logarithms so one geared down to produce the wong 300 calculator introduced in 1966 the 300 was an immediate hit easy to use and costing just 1 695 dollars it not only sold well to scientists and researchers but also to stock brokers and insurance companies on wall street the wong 300 became a legend for revealing a calculating error in a bond trading table that had been in use for three decades nobody cared that it had a chinese name people joked wong stood for wild ass number grinders wong set up a direct sales team to promote the product revenues nearly tripled from 2.5 million in 1965 to 6.9 million in 1967. and that year wong laboratories went public in a highly publicized ipo wong's personal stock holdings were then worth 50 million dollars calculators helped make wong rich but he wanted the next big thing in 1968 the advent of the computer language basic convinced wong that that would be a computer he acquired a data processing company called phil hankins inc for help they began working on two new computers the wong 700 and wong 3300 basic but then hewlett-packard announced their new hp 9100 calculator the 9100 was really a computer but they decided to call the calculator because only ibm made computers the 9100 had a crt display magnetic card storage and made calculating as easy as pushing a button realizing the serious challenge the 9100 presented to the 300 wong rushed out the 700 in mid-1969 as a response just like with the 9100 one called the 700 a calculator rather than a computer a year after production the 700 became wong's most important product pushing revenues to 25 million dollars but wong knew that the calculator market was getting difficult by 1971 the wong 300 was in declined costing just 600 each 1971 was also the year intel introduced their first microprocessor analysts now predicted a future in where you could put an entire calculator onto a single chip dr wong believed that such a thing would push calculated prices from 600 to just one hundred dollars it was wrong here prices would eventually go even lower than that aware of the coming storm in 1971 wong made the incredibly ballsy decision to pull out of the calculator market starting with the lower end markets it seemed crazy back then calculators made up 75 of the company's total revenue but wong had nothing but confidence in himself he knew that the computer was the future and he had a two-pronged strategy for getting there the strategy would have wong developed two computer products for different parts of the market first was your more traditional general purpose computer that was the aforementioned wong 3300 basic the wong 3300 reached the market in 1970 but the calculating computer as it was called wasn't successful it took 40 minutes to program and you loaded programs into it using paper the second product would be a word processor to replace ibm's magnetic tape selectric electric typewriter in the general corporate environment ibm had 80 percent of the word processing market but they didn't particularly give it a lot of attention the space made for a great first move the first iteration of the product was the wong 1200 word processor or just model 1200 announced in november 1971 before it was widely available the 1200 was really a modified wong 700 calculator connected to an ibm's electric electric typewriter the typewriter's job was to render the type of words but unfortunately his connection failed due to improper components causing reliability problems they eventually fixed it but sales nevertheless slumped to below expectations three products brought wong back from the brink of death and beyond in may 1973 wong came out with a successor to its 3300 basic calculator slash computer the 2200. the 2200 still use basic computer language for easy programmability but stored program information on intel's rom chips this gave the computer instant wake capability price between six thousand dollars to eight thousand dollars quite affordable at the time the 2200 became a capable small business computer and sold extremely well for a decade and a half the second product would be its biggest the 1200 fell short but it taught the company some important lessons in september 1975 dr wong called two of his veteran product guys harold koplao and david morris and asked them to try again coppola and morris thought hard about what such a product should look like they redesigned the system from the ground up to be powerful upgradable and radically easy to use they developed a network of powerful machines each machine had its own 8080 intel microprocessor it was powerful enough to work independently but can also share texts or send documents to a central storage unit and they ditched the ibm's electric relying on a competitor's product seemed like poor strategy instead they used a crt screen to display words on the screen the doctor himself ironed out the final kinks in the hardware connections and finally they simplified previous word process required secretaries to learn various codes to do editing or formatting tasks the new system showed built-in prompts and had a menu system for navigation introduced in 1976 the wong word processing system or wps was an immediate hit and brought the company back from the brink the accounting firm touch ross signed a 142 thousand dollar deal before the product was even finished at its introduction at a new york trade show huge lines formed to see the new device wong had to bring in new squadrons of salespeople to relieve tired ones the immediate hit that we all wish we'd come across in our careers and then in 1977 came wong's third big product the vs mini computer the mini computer is smaller and cheaper than ibm's big mainframe computers they do not require a big team of technicians but are still powerful enough to run commercial applications like spreadsheets competing against digital equipment corporations vax line of computers the vs held its own it was almost as powerful as a mainframe essentially being modeled after an ibm 360 but the doctor avoided calling it that three incredible products brought out in quick secession they would generate billions for one by the late 1970s wong was the world's largest supplier of crt-based word processing systems but despite that it was still largely unknown and those who knew them mostly knew them as a calculator maker so in 1978 the company famously launched a massive three-month tv ad blitz positioning them as a leading computer maker it culminated in a 30-second super bowl ad it cost one hundred and fifty thousand dollars or five thousand dollars a second despite only being the 32nd largest computer maker wong was the only such company advertising on tv other than ibm their attention grabbing david vs goliath spot in particular directly attacked ibm and caught a lot of people's attentions tens of millions of people saw it and it put wong on the map awareness went from three percent to 14 the campaign worked so beautifully that wong's executives were afraid to say how well it worked so to discourage copycats wong revenues doubled again two years later from 1978 to 1980 and then again once more two years after that sales reached 1 billion dollars in 1982 and then two billion dollars in 1984. 80 percent of the us's biggest firms bought wong equipment in 1983 nearly half of the company's revenues came from fortune 500 companies dr wong turned 60 in 1980 and he started to slow down in 1982 he started to spend less time around the office the year after that he formally retired he remained chairman with john a cunningham a 16-year wong sales employee taking the head spot the doctor and cunningham were very close lorraine called him their american son cunningham was well respected and built a powerful fast-growing sales force that any successor would have to fill big shoes dr wong was not only ceo but also chief of product development he was intimately involved day in and day out on crafting wong's most successful products spending an estimated 65 percent of his time there who is not only incredibly technical but also an extraordinary manager of the company sprawling r d operations imagine taking on such a job now imagine also being on wong's son in some ways fred wong took after his father he was a bit shy good at math and sciences but not so much the other stuff unlike his father however he grew up immersed in wealth and privilege both of his parents were strong-willed traditional asian style parents his mother wanted him to go to harvard and constantly harped on him to do so fred eventually got into brown a perfectly fine school which his mother could not accept she harped on him to get a harvard phd fred switched his major six to eight times after graduating he was not sure what to do he defaulted to work full time at the family business as a low-level programmer he did that for two years before switching to a marketing position then he was pulled out of that to shadow his dad around the company has a glorified gopher in 1978 anwong sat down with the then 28 year old fred he explained his plan to have sons fred and later courtney eventually take over wong labs in 1980 the doctor put a son in charge of the critical r d department but fred despite being a smart and decent guy was not his father elevating him into the delicate high-performing triumvirate alongside anwong and cunningham turned out to be a disaster as with many companies wong lab's turning point began with the products in october 1983 wong labs announced 14 new products with the hope of taking on ibm the most important of which was the wong professional image computer armed with image processing technology to manage images in real time other products included the wong office a software product that allowed different machines to communicate the market loved it and the stock soared reaching 36.50 immediately after the announcement the stock price peaked in 1984 at 42.50 the doctor's stake was then worth north of 1.6 billion dollars making him the richest man in new england and the fifth richest man in america but that would be the very top of wong's fortunes the problem was that all of the october 1983 products came very late and in some cases years late fred had wanted to show that he could develop products like his father and rushed out the announcements but the delays instead badly hurt his credibility in and outside the company and it was the wrong time for wong to be putting out vaporware competition was heating up two years earlier ibm released the ibm pc and it took the world by storm those pcs equipped with word processing and spreadsheet software immediately began eroding wong's two specialized word processors and 2200 computers wong revenues kept growing but it was all maintenance revenues for existing customers rather than new customers buying new things on wong resisted the pc he thought it would be another calculator a future dead end commodity fred eventually pushed the company to build their own anyway but without compatibility with the ibm pc's massive software ecosystem it was dead on arrival the company never really recovered from its botch 1983 announcement cunningham then president came to believe that fred could not manage the r d division fred tried his best but he lacked the doctor's touch and handling and moderating these powerful egos in october 1984 a year after the disastrous product announcement dr wong moved fred to run manufacturing replacing the excellent john cropper cunningham argued with this but wong overruled him the r d department continued to turn out duds dead piled up as the company recklessly expanded wong would turn down potential mergers with exxon's computer subsidiary and the itt conglomerate these mergers could have shored up the company's debt position but were rejected because it potentially would have taken control away from the wong family for a very long time dr wong had seen the future but now the doctor was past his prime and his loyalty to his family was taking the company down the wrong path in april 1985 wong labs announced a stunning 66 quarterly profit decline in july 1985 the respected cunningham resigned selling all of his stock a magical nine-year joyride came to a smashing halt it was the beginning of the end dr wong briefly took over for cunningham again but in 1987 he made fred the company president the company experienced unsteady profits over the next two years laying off a thousand people wong lab's board of directors asked to bring in a professional manager to work with fred they asked five times throughout 1987. but anwong refused every time famously telling them he is my son and he can do it losses grew throughout 1988 poisoning the company's relations with its banks finally in july 1989 wong posted a 424 million dollar annual loss suspending dividends and laying off more people the stock crashed from 43 dollars to just five dollars a share the board who became increasingly concerned about their own liability amidst all this shareholder value destruction also in 1989 dr wong who smoked nearly his entire adult life was diagnosed with esophageal cancer a very dangerous cancer it had an 80 to 90 percent mortality rate finally in august 1989 a few weeks after undergoing surgery for the cancer anwong had to fire his own son richard miller a turnaround expert with no computer industry experience was appointed president miller oversaw a massive 200 million dollar asset sale in an attempt to cut down the debt and he also laid off 2 000 more employees and yet the company still showed a 715.9 million dollar loss in 1990 a stunning loss considering the company had 2.5 billion dollars in revenues that year looking back on it pinning wong labs's troubles entirely on fred would be a huge mistake wong's failure traces back to anwong missing the pc revolution the power of office software and the company's failure to find the next hit product they were unlikely to survive this generational transition from the very beginning few companies did but the turmoil overhanging the company's secession certainly did not help in january 1990 the cancer came back with a vengeance despite the surgery and chemotherapy wong lost his ability to speak he finally gave up on running the company and allowed miller to do what had to be done never a present father in their youth wong spent the last months of his life with his children his daughter remembers him writing i love you in big underlying letters with exclamation points after them on a cold morning 5 41 am march 24 1990 anwong died alone in his room at the massachusetts general hospital he was 70. in their last conversation dr wong asked miller to try and save wang labs whatever you do he said try and preserve name i want it remembered has company founded by immigrant despite the asset sales and an alliance with ibm wong laboratories passed into bankruptcy two years after its founder's death in 1992. it would be acquired in 1999 by the dutch company gettronics and renamed to gettronics north america all right everyone that's it for tonight i'll see you guys next time
