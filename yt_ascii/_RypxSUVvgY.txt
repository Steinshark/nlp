over the last week i've been hearing some rumors floating around the startup and as ceo i got to squash all rumors squelch them prevent them staunch all right and this last rumor was quite salacious so of course i had to step into an all hands and i let everybody know during the all hands exactly what was going on as ceo of the startup no java php c-sharp is still relevant how is russ gonna compete okay you're right besides for tj being an idiot which we all agree how is russ going to compete with the likes of java with the likes of php with the likes of c sharp that's a great question okay i feel like that's something that we haven't really thought about you know what i mean it's something that maybe we haven't considered all these amazing language options that you have i mean let's just think about it php is a really well respected language i literally have never heard someone say something negative about php so let's just take that one off the list because that one feels like it's an obvious winning selection right there number two then you say java well i mean if it runs on three billion devices can java be bad i don't think so think about that sure the numbers been trending downward and not upward but you know what i think people are you know they're missing the point three billion devices is almost half the earth's population okay it's a very successful language and clearly russ can compete with java okay russ cannot compete with java on anything at all like think about it java can use more memory java is better at utilizing the cpu meaning it uses more cpu to do the same thing that you could do in rust with less memory and less cpu you know what i mean it's a pretty simple thing and lastly c sharp the obviously the better version of java right i mean let's let's be real here java is just bad c-sharp can we can we agree to that one it's a nightmare reality is that that that is true that's actually not a joke i do think that c sharp is actually probably better than java but it turns out you know what here's the deal nightmare c-sharp has the ability to run on i believe this is what it's called a windows server machine thingy and that's the superior server handling experience so when you think about rust and using rust in production you gotta ask yourself am i even able to run it on windows if you can't even run it as your windows server the language sucks okay so let's just go full circle here and just realize one very special thing rust will never compete with c-sharp it will never compete with java last time i checked it's not on three billion devices and it will never compete with a php the language in which all the developers drive literal lamborghinis so you know what you know what i say trust there you go so why i don't i only use rust because honestly it's i i'm not skilled enough to use c sharp okay i'm not i'm not hey one little quick thing thank you for subscribing to my youtube channel okay i appreciate that i really do we're almost at a hundred thousand which means i get a lick of plaque i'm so excited to lick a plaque i'm gonna lick that black so good i'm gonna we taking but it will be plaque and silver and
