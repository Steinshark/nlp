thirty seven thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars just take the zero buying used computers has been around since the day after the very first person ever upgraded their pc it's a chance to save some money compared to buying the whole system brand new or you can effectively subsidize the cost of your new system by selling the old one all without creating any e-waste but whatever your reason for buying or selling on the used market and regardless of wherever you choose to browse it's safe to bet that you're going to come across some ridiculous ads crazy prices bad part combos poorly written ads oh yeah it's all fair game for us to rest oh yeah let's go but not before i make this awful segue for you guys to roast to our sponsor waveform weak cell signal check out the selfie go x signal booster sold and supported by waveform the gox is the only booster with a hundred decibel gain giving you more coverage and blazing fast data rates learn more at the link below [music] okay so this one's being sold for 3 000 or best offer yeah okay that's important being sold on ebay too rgb gaming pc custom build ultimate desktop bundle i finished this build in february of 2022 and i'm very proud of it good for you dude this was my dream build where i spared no expense on parts no expensive shipping is included in the price man i would not recommend buying things off craigslist that end up having to be shipped if you're interested in seeing the rgb functions dm me for my ticktock link 36 cti 400 bucks so you got a 400 gpu you got like 200 bucks in ram oil it only comes with a 250 gig ssd spared no expensive yours is not worth this much money it's got more in rgb than it does graphics card gaming a desktop pc computer intel i7 gt710 one terabyte hd with dell monitor 16 gigabytes of ram oh it's a 4x3 display i love it it's adorable ps2 ps2 well you know what ps2 is not bad okay what's the specs i7 3770 it's not bad if you look at the location of the 12 volt connector for the cpu this is definitely an oem board yeah so this was an office pc that was thrown into a gaming pc chassis and called a gaming pc really i think the best value proposition here is this monitor yeah really kind of rounds it out we're gonna move over to kijiji for you american folks kijiji is a canadian equivalent sort of to craigslist just with like a little bit newer ui and just as crazy stupid on it this is an alienware x17 r1 with 165 watts so this guy must go to lan parties yeah 11th gen i9 so it's got a 4 terabyte ssd so this brand new newer version of of this setup it's got a 3080 ti a little bit better it's got a newer cpu that's going to have a bunch more cores i think it's 14 versus eight everything else the same is substantially less money i think this guy just missed the memo that used gaming laptops are worth practically well this is what i paid for it like two years ago actually would have been one year ago you should sell the case separately dude you'll get more money for it complete vr desktop for 450 excuse me 450 canadian 350 us oh it's an optiplex is this actually a good deal it's a 1050 eight gigs of ram i don't see a graphics card monitor has large scratch on the screen but it still works great no it doesn't have a graphics card so intel hd vr is this a joke what vr headset is that that's samsung odyssey vr wait does it have the controllers okay so this guy clearly just bought this to watch yeah like the where are the controllers i don't see controllers you don't need the controllers where we're going huh especially after you got that scratch on the screen you know really next oh man why are you giving me all these alienwares what are we looking at here so there's a there's a either a white with rgb here let me just let me just make this better there we go now i can see nice very yeah yeah hang on oh yeah wow you're set up for it too much of a computer for my needs well why did you buy it then dual 2080 supers msi 34 inch curved gaming monitor it's not attaching receipt so you can see the upgrades you bought every warranty 24 7 technical support for 300 accidental damage service for three years for 130 what accidental damage are you going to do to your alienware desktop dude guess what they're not even going to come to your house like they told you you paid as much in warranties as you did for your 2 terabyte ssd upgrade at least it comes with a monitor this is silly dude no issues though going to sell and get myself something a little less intense potentially a laptop with 128 gigs of ram did your mom just give you her credit card and said go ham honey offer up now i've never heard of offer up before what am i looking at okay so this is just ball another 128 gigs of ram why well okay hold on this is a threadripper system actually 2970 wx which is like kind of now with the 3090 so that's very lopsided this is this is more of an art piece it's not even filled properly oh look at this huge airflow right here painful put the flow meter in just to make sure you get really crappy flow we got a corsair cpu block we got a phantek gpu block we got a bits power distribution plate we got a whatever radiator corsair fitting down there like this is just all over okay man 15 grand you sir are out to freaking lunch what is this photo yes would you like to see the wall what room is this this is not very well painted linus would himself finance available yes baby thirty seven thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars you can make an offer maybe he missed zero warranty included so let's see what we got 32 gigs of ram ddr5 wait ddr5 on 11th gen what the this has got to be a price error comes with our red dragon keyboard and mouse yeah i mean red dragon's not bad it's not a 3080 ti tier yeah ryzen 7 32 gigs of ram one terabyte ssd okay so what else that's a gt-10 gt10 [music] all parts costed me 2300. run light to mid games it's got 5800x so here's what i think happened this was a gpu shortage build by the time gpus came down in price the guy was like no i want 12th gen this liquid cooler costs more than this gpu cpu definitely did maybe the ram did too so like 70 80 dollars that being said it is relatively new parts yeah but that's 300 us dollars just because you got the gpu shortage doesn't mean that you need to pass that along to people outside of the gpu shortage now these photos man come on couldn't have turned the lights on i guess maybe that would have drowned out the rgb facebook oh good old facebook pc game ready for use specked on the picture everything included 9700f that's it that's all the information we get that's that's the specs the spect windows 11 home wait dev version on the dev branch dude you gotta at least tell us what gpu we're getting for 3 000 us dollars he's got two mice too did we get everything in the photo oh everything included everything included okay so you also get the figurines yeah do i get the figurines and the po i want the drapes i want the wall oh from saskatoon baby ultimate gaming pc okay this actually looks kind of cool yeah actually that's what i love and everything multiple flow meters is that more than one is that a flow meter down there a flow meter there what's this thing is that another flow meter i don't know did people not understand that they like actually hurt the flow also that bend how about all of the bends it's so wonky it's got a core i9 oh 9900k a radeon rx 5700 xt and four wait 432 gig sticks of trident z royal we're again looking at 128 gig of ram system why do people do this you probably would have been better off paying somebody that knows how to water cool to build the loop for you it would have looked better and just spent a little bit less on random bull oh yeah here's mid build each loop gets a flow meter yeah yeah and you get a flow meter and you get a flow meter oh my god it's a mic oh a mining rig of course 26 thousand canadian which is about twenty thousand us dollars oh he's three months old it's right at the beginning of the crash he probably bought these for well above msrp from like a mining rig company oh yeah oh i'm so happy so many cards that could have gone to gamers went to this guy instead and then he got i like this side of anthony [laughter] full gaming setup chair with led lights look at how many times he says rgb it's like it's like when you go to ces the amount of times you see disruptive invidea 3060 ti gpu worth two to three grand brand new was there ever a point that a 30 60 ti was two grand this is canadian so even canadian i don't think my god everything was bought brand new pc was custom built paid around ten thousand dollars for it oh my god he's asking seven grand i didn't even see oh my god bull and or maybe not maybe the guy selling the fifteen thousand dollar one sold it to him all right ebay land of the good deals gaming pc desktop barely used monitors mouse and keyboard so it's a 5900x and a 3080 yeah that's the respectable oh god the glass that's got tow marks on it wait you didn't even take this off connect all cables before turning on oh my god it's a pre-built there's no universe where this thing is worth 4 500 i mean okay if you were like a twitch streamer and people wanted to buy your feet picks they might also be down to buy your your feet schmear on the glass so jake i had to ask you how many of these people do you think are just hoping for a whale to come along and like just buy it for the astronomical price you mean like the whales from whale land whale land yeah well then we did a behind the scenes on floatplane you can see all the cool activities we did you can see some sick pcs you can even see me walking around i think there's probably at least one clip of that i always wanted to watch jake walk around yeah oh my god a thousand euros for an i3 goodbye back to craigslist gaming and editing think pad it comes with a warranty workstation it's got the nipple it's called the nipple is that all you look for in a computer yes slightly used or lightly used ultra high spec gaming laptops editing laptops any used laptop depreciates way harder than a desktop there's so many other variables there's oh yeah the battery's gonna fail battery yeah there's way harder to clean it's way harder to service so many things make it way less of a value so many cheetos fall in between the questions so he bought a 48 month start december 2020. but it's only got a 10 750h and a 20 2080 super 30 series was out then though so he just got kind of screwed i would not pay 3 500 for this i mean you'd be better off buying a cheaper laptop and an ltt store backpack and then you can put the laptop in the backpack then you don't need the warranty the backpack's gonna gonna keep it protected you know price is firm due to the high value of the item we can high value police station lobby a laptop is i guess some one of those things that somebody would be like lol sucker and like it saying due to the high value of this item that just sounds like you're blowing smoke up somebody's ass that's a lot this is the leon lee fans right three packs 100 bucks okay so we have 330 dollars in fans at least it was easy to cable manage though yeah and it's got a 5950x in it too which is not 30 90. wait what is what is that that's mineral rainbow rainbow barf why do people buy trendy royal i don't has anyone looked at that in mid like that looks nice cpu never goes above 45 degrees max load oh yeah it's a 5950x it probably never goes below 45 degrees yeah it would idle at that make an offer if it's less than 6000 i won't respond your ask is six thousand what we'll trade for cameras as i'm a photographer yeah it really looks like it buddy okay so stock cooler in the garage covered in dust with an aoc monitor that looks like it's been through a war looks like it's got some scratches it's got the sneeze goop on there oh the back of the computer's got some sneeze goop on there oh god oh keyboard clean the keyboard man and the way he's holding those headphones looks like he's i don't even want to touch them oh of course he doesn't want to touch them yeah here's the thing with this one you didn't put any specks given that it's a single power plug i'm gonna go with this is not a great gpu yeah probably like a 60 series smaller amd cooler i think so probably like a ryzen 5 3 600 or something like that which is not a bad cpu but for fifteen hundred dollars yeah but then again you're getting those bonuses you get the aoc monitor that's the no name you get the the finger goop the finger goop what is that a poop stain right there oh yeah it's brown yeah this has been in that garage for too long dude 1200k rtx 3090 build this is not actually that bad of a price so it's brand new it looks pretty new it's clean it would have to be no toe fudge and the cable management looks pretty good is that his personal injury dude he just put his whole address here he doxed himself and the last four of his credit card number oh god damn dude so he paid 5 grand for all this 500 2800 doesn't actually seem that bad honestly yeah i don't think there's anything wrong with the actual listing other than the fact that he like straight up put his home address and the last four of his credit card okay so we got hey this guy's got this too whoa oh oh the other way oh i can't go the other way we've got another instance of runs any game on 240 hertz is a 990 a thing no no it's an i-990 32 gigabytes of ram eight fans wait one two three four five six seven eight oh my god he's counting the gpu fans you're not wrong it's just 1200k 500 bucks 2080 ti we probably already looked this up already i just don't remember looks like also about 500 bucks so you're talking thousand dollars and he wants 2500 but it's got eight fans jake it comes with two monitors maybe the desk blue mic stand a keyboard and three mice three mouses three mouses i i know that i use three mouses all the time for my third hand wait dude okay if you're gonna clean like you clearly you use this canned air to clean the pc like we get that what were you using clean shower for daily shower cleaning daily shower cleaner clean soap and mildew please people don't use this on your pc okay you just put no effort into this at all so we can see all of these drives holy crap the cable management is bad that's an understatement look at this they've got like a molex to sata adapter in the future it's like it's like the cables are all dragging on each other too people put no effort in at all like if that's the one thing i've seen oh man the 5820k that's like the the absolute cheapest x99 cpu you could have bought yep gtx 1080 hybrid corsair vengeance yeah 32 gigs as rock x 99 xtreme 4. it comes with all this other stuff it maybe it's not that bad i'm just i don't know with all connectors to start gaming immediately goodbye gaming computer with two acer curved monitors and they work just i do not know how or why they won't connect properly that sounds like they don't work or the computer's broken what the hell did he just steal this a bunch of extra stuff in a google pixel 3a it is fast phone this this must be like a storage locker maybe or stolen goods yeah don't ask me a bunch of questions i don't know a lot about computers so how do you know that it's two thousand dollars this is sketchy dude you see this yeah so that's like one of those one fan no there's there's more fans below but one rgb the rest are just normal i think that's just g [laughter] 400 bucks for a 2060 super it's an i5 that's all you get it's just the first two letters it's an i5 so okay what the first two characters what's that motherboard there's no way we're reading that dude this thing is a turd 60 bucks for this desk oh look at that sick monitor stand wait are those the razer speakers razer speaker he only has one side only one side how do you lose one side of your razor speakers what maybe what happened was he got so fed up with razer and the fit of rage in this realization that he destroyed the other speaker like he was asking 150 for the steam controller yeah that's like the most expensive thing
