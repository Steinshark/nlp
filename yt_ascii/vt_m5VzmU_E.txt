oh god it's leaking i had an accident origin sent over this beautiful millennium pc for a sponsored video of our choosing which is risky and unfortunately for them it happened to arrive at exactly the same time as this bin of the most random water cooling stuff that alex could find on ebay alex permitted me to open one in the intro i'm gonna go with the big heavy one wait is this our radiator it's handmade and passive without further ado then let's see who did it better this random collection of handmade and vintage water cooling crap from the internet's garage sale or origin pc i really hope origin pc wins because if they don't it's going to be pretty embarrassing [music] it's like scratched up oh brandon it's good so the scratches give you more surface area for this to enough let's get the b-roll oh my god all the clips holding it together are falling out all over the place i assume we've taken some baseline measurements of how the system performs with the stock water cooling oh yeah it's great like actual ray tracing on 4k still hits 130 fps it's fantastic why don't we go ahead and have a look at some of the other things we got this is an old alpha cool reservoir designed for an aquarium pump an advantage to this approach is that you don't have to have a lot of fluid in your system because a lot of your reservoir space is taken up by pump oh wait this is actually what it's supposed to be i thought this was like a random aquarium pump no this is definitely a thing using aquarium pumps for water cooling is what we did before there were purpose-built water cooling pumps so wait is this ac oh it is 12 volts yay right that makes sense this is an alpha cool product this is a pc water cooling reservoir and so they would have found an aquarium pump that runs you know easily off of bc power supply and designed it around it this has got to be a really old product though oh yeah oh my god this o-ring more like oh ring because we wanted to see what kind of water cooling stuff you can get on ebay and it wasn't enough for us to just see in the picture that this thing is grody we needed to hold it and lick it oh no no no [music] no no oh i don't want to use these fittings oh wow yeah those look terrible not good those look much better in the post what even is this how's that even a piece of a fitting you know when you can tell just from the color of the plastics that something is really old oh that's a hard line it was em technic no it's not hard line it is hardline well but the fitting you can just tell from the quality of the molding these are ancient oh like early 90s late 80s age like these are really old dude that's what the picture looked like this is just wrong did we just get scammed this is not even close expectations versus reality here i was going to say like i don't remember it being this i i thought it was all just going to work i i now understand why i thought it was going to work wait wait wait no there's something else in here fishing lures what wait why is this ship to address someone in latvia are you messing with me right now oh my god what is that well they aren't fishing lures but they sure as hell aren't the things in alex's picture either they at least appear to be g1 quarter these are by far the jankiest fittings i have ever seen apologies to inta if we got your random crappy fittings slash fishing lures if you reach out if this was actually your package let us know and we'll send you a really nice set of ek fittings free of charge the plastic fittings i'm hoping we can use because if we're going to do hardline with this tubing or something like it our only chance of bending it is going to be to use right angle fittings not to bend the tubing itself and these metal ones while they are right angle are threaded on damn it cannot afford to break one of these we have only eight fittings total threaded on one side so they're not going to help us mid-run we need these for that i think we got scammed pretty hard yeah oh my week just got so much more difficult but more fun yeah it's gonna be an upgrade this system isn't hardline water cooled please tell me this is not the cpu block this is so freaking heavy is that the reservoir this is freaking old school man this is a solid freaking kill the man chunk of machined aluminum that's then screwed onto like a face mounting plate and then you were intended i think these are for like like rack mount cases oh yeah like you would bolt them into the front so you could monitor coolant levels in the front of the case it says it's 59.95 on here we got an absolute deal on this you only pay 48 bucks for it oh good this was also addressed to inta do we have someone else's shipment so some of this is supposed to come from latvia and we're supposed to get this but this says to inta it is confusing also it's labeled hair clips that's one hell of a hair clip oh is that supposed to be our cpu blocks that would be really bad i really hope not that's a 13 900k or something isn't it yeah i think you goofed does this even have any fins in it we don't even have any way of opening it to see what kind of design is inside i suspect it's just a flat piece of copper what you see there's more in here no no it's a cpu and a vga cooler what the hell were you thinking in fairness i sent you the links to all of this i didn't look at that you approved it i can't be expected to read everything i approve this thing's gonna look like a piece of crap oh this is good news oh there's another block at least it's bigger okay that's what i was expecting for the cpu oh another reservoir this is kind of cute alpha cool yeah no stop fittings i'm confused though i don't think i ordered that you also didn't order this origin millennium that they sent over because if you had it wouldn't be this good everything in here is top of the line we've got an i9 3900k an rtx 49d 32 gigs of ddr5 running at 6 000 mega transfers per second and four terabytes of ssd storage because why not it's not just water cooled we took advantage of origin's custom laser etching for the side panel and uv printing for the other more different side panel that looks amazing i can't believe we're about to ruin this think about how great this is going to look with that massive passive radiator just strapped to it do you know what this is probably a vrm coolers from other boards yeah they used to do kits of these i was thinking these might be legitimately useful just for cooling like gpu memory because that's a problem that i've had in the past where we're making some sort of janky die cooler but we don't have good stuff for the memory yeah actually these could work we're gonna have to get really creative about which blocks are connected to which other blocks because not all of our fittings are the same diameter so like we might have to take one of these off and put one of these on depending on what size tubing is going oh yeah yeah fun you know from hearing that that if this guy ever invites you over for fun it's not going to be fun don't go my parties are excellent do you have a total bill here yeah i'm gonna open up this lap what it's a molex to why would it need all of this on it wait maybe it isn't this well we have that now you basically bought garbage yes brandon yes thank you that's very helpful and how much did i pay for the garbage 465 which is less than it costs to get the water cooling upgrade in this so we're saving money what's your favorite time and the fact that you need like a whole workshop to make this work most likely i've got a meeting okay all right let's see how good of a job origins done with their cable management in here oh it's fantastic brandon i hate this not only am i going to be ruining their wonderful cable management what's going to be extremely hard to get all of the stuff that i need out before we start draining i'm just going to hold the power button for a second make sure all the capacitors are nice and drained because things are about to get rather wet what i'm thinking might be the best course of action is to remove this fitting then we have the tube stick this little stopper in there as quick as we can hopefully it's all fine there we go yeah that was about it smells a lot like alcohol which is good you don't want stuff just growing inside of your loop if it's just water last time this gp was happy poor guy i've got almost everything out but i just want to shout out whoever cable managed this because it is actually the best cable management that i've ever seen like not just the stuff that you see is cable managed but everything underneath it was cable managed as well and what really got me was this right here this right here's the fan controller so six fans go into this one controller and they wired it so they would have had to take the whole controller off plug in everything and wrote the cables down behind it and up and around just to make it that little bit extra clean and now i need to undo all of it i have not seen a reference 40 90 pcb yet oh wow this is something there is no ram on the back it's all vrms and we don't even have full coverage with these vrm coolers well i guess my question is do we need to oh just use the stock back plate no but like this wasn't doing anything oh that doesn't necessarily mean that we don't need to cool them though it's probable that that wasn't doing anything because the front side was carrying all the heat away from the board which is copper right is it cheating if we is it cheating if we use thick thermal pads is it cheating if we just cover it in k5 pro oh my god we are not doing that never again especially when you don't know what size thermal pads you didn't clean it yeah because i didn't need to no let's just go back to the basics here so gpu die that's solved it's right here boom that's done what about the mosfets half and half half and half so you're gonna go like that and put a thick thermal pad on it yeah and this one probably can go right there and then finally for those memories are you kidding me that it's pretty terrible let's move on this with a bracket yep easy okay sold now things get more interesting we have three reservoirs so this goes in the bottom what about second reservoir up here yeah up there front and center okay third reservoir we go out from here into here we use all three of these as outlets to feed our gpu because we could go into the gpu do you guys have that guy you know like in your friend's circle or at work where you say something stupid half joking and they not only take what you said at face value but continue to run with it no but we could go through the gpu die with one so that's like in series yes then we split it using this into three yeah to cover this garbage yeah then we recombine it in that like you said yes you eat it into the cpu sure and the plan was to just strap this to the side panel yeah just zip tie it on the back it's probably fine as long as we go in the top and out the bottom oh i was gonna say the other way in the bottom out the top so we can bleed it that would be better for bleeding i just don't know if our pump can do it i think we're gonna have to try otherwise how on earth are we going to get the air out of this thing okay is that everything because at this point i just do it we have a lot to do jake i've been doing a lot of stuff but i've been mostly just turning garbage into bits of water cooling so like in order to attach these yeah i machined out some copper for the memory yeah oh aluminum for the mosfets those are just to space it up oh now i consulted multiple engineers three of them do you want to know what they decided for attaching these to this zip ties zip ties piece of steel continuing with the theme of just using garbage that i found around here i didn't want to you know this is garbage that i see and see machined kind of feels like cheating so for the cpu i tig welded some steel it looks very square did you try it yet oh yeah it works oh great wow since it's easier do you want to take over cpu mounting yeah it looks very easy man this must have been so nicely cable managed before oh yeah look at all those zip ties i had to take yeah another one and another one this is somebody's hard work i love how how not straight the holes are it was like pretty close but she got a little bit warpy in welding and the nice thing is you just have these giant holes so you know i got that much wiggle room in each yeah oh i dropped it again i gotta stop doing that wow that actually took a good joke yeah oh oh jesus why so much i don't really know how the contact's gonna be and also it sort of just splured it out i love that these which were probably made in like 2006 or something still have all the plastic on them meaning that nobody bought them can you believe nobody wanted this david wow have we leak tested this yet we have not maybe you can do that right now well it doesn't really help that i got the thing all wet first seems okay it's external anyway so like it can leak yeah oh look at that beauty oh yeah that's pretty yeah it's like just the tiniest bit still tacky ah that's fine i don't know how even this contact is going to be so there's kind of like a flat spot so i need to have it a bit offset wonderful mounting plate [music] copper and pink it's new the new style copper and pink is such a wonderful color scheme i don't i don't actually know how tight these screws should be we don't have springs like a usual cp block so i'm just getting them tight well that's actually like not that jank you got springs in there and everything yeah i added the springs and then forgot that i kind of built this to work as a spring yeah but it's a spring on a spring it's fine it's a lot of spring the spring's fully compressed so it's not a spring anymore the eagle-eyed among you might have noticed that not all of these have the brackets left on them that's because our reservoir needed a mounting bracket and i figured you know reuse recycle this is good for the environment i feel like i need to attach tubes to this first or i'm concerned we won't be able to attach to the gpu block probably a good call yeah once it's all zip tied in not going to be easy again i consulted three engineers to come up with the solution i suppose now we should find out if this pump actually works lttstore.com i'm going to use this piece of solder to jump the power supply it worked i want to see it shoot a bit more than that okay here all right hit it again yep what i was really hoping that that would just shoot water across but it's really not since our ebay pump wasn't working we went and grabbed the worst looking pump in inventory what's the what's the head pressure of this do you think jake i don't know is it not level with that it might be pushing the water the wrong way i don't think it really matters though yeah it has maybe half an inch of head pressure it's a legitimately the worst pump i've ever seen and i've seen dead pumps so we're using this one this other aliexpress one hey oh it actually does stuff this one rips heck yeah yeah point her straight up let's see what the head pressure is on this one i've had enough of getting sprayed in the face with stuff while working on projects with you frankly but linus wanted to do oh god let's go radiator cpu gpu die into this monstrosity of a reservoir break it into three why yeah that's a really good question we could just know it sounds like a lot of work i think we should just use this one these fittings that we randomly got are designed for 10 millimeter hard tubing now sadly 10 millimeter hard tubing just isn't really a thing for us to get it in time for this video it was going to be 230 dollars it is a very special thing so instead i bought this very cheap 3 8 tube and we're just gonna shove it in here and hopefully the shark bite of it's all fine i really dig this very much ilm prop this right here could be on the set of alien and it would be totally fine let's chuck her in you're such a nerd huh that works okay so we need to we need cooling on this anyway there's not a single problem with mounting a gpu like that oh dude that's beautiful yeah it'll even like hold the tubes in we're doing pretty good yeah got some things there's probably some other things on here that aren't really on the list but beautiful there's some what look to be screw holes i was kind of thinking if i just made a couple more threaded them and then just like actually drilled it into the back panel that would work yeah root it to the back panel what do you think the chances are if this thing just leaks terribly david parasite zero airtight all right perfect oh god it's leaking oh wow it is leaking just a little bit too tight of a bend yeah i think so it does appear we have no more leaks in our gpu oh god don't do any more notches than that that's that's the notches oh that's too many notches oh dear drill some holes in the side panel drilled some holes in this thing now i'm just tapping them so theoretically once this is done we just line this up with the side and run some screws and that holds it up oh wow look i even put spacers that i found in the drawer oh it's not a very like solid piece so it's touching in the middle but if you just pull it and that's why i'm pushing in the middle anymore honestly much better job than i was expecting that's mint look at that it's beautiful how do you think we should bring the tube back in we got one here and one down here i think this one should go through the pcie slot yeah that one can go through pcie easy i can just drill a big hole like right through that's exactly what i was going to say wait a second jake did you put this on the wrong way what why well so we want to fill it from the bottom to the top so that the air bubbles leave otherwise they probably won't which means we need to go from the pumping here out around to this one then out here actually we can just go down through the top to the cpu yeah i'm not it's not changing so yeah where am i drilling the hole don't yeah i don't think we need to drill a hole i want to drill a hole because look oh we just don't add the thing this right here goes on there and we just sneak it in there yeah we just snake her in so much less cool than drilling a hole you don't need to drill a fine you ready alex you should probably make sure it doesn't like leak or whatever heck yeah now i want to watch this there's a lot of water around the pump right now i had that accident it's working yeah it sounds awful but it's working honestly water's a lot cleaner than i expected yeah fair i'm amazed that this thing doesn't leak at all like what the hell yeah like this is the only part of the tube that we can see that came with it and like look at this it's so orange this is soft tubing it's hard now we should bring linus here and then turn it on okay here's the thing alex i couldn't help noticing that wow while the system does appear to be complete a few steps appear to have been missed ah that was just jake was the one i was supposed to be checking these off good supervising chick yeah you're welcome he wasn't supervising he was helping yeah okay all right clearly it works well no clearly together i shouldn't say it works wait what magnetic or like what even is this no it was you know there's water on the bottom of the camera and there's tape on oh there's tape but the water makes it so the tape doesn't work yeah we fixed that problem but really it's still wet do tell oh my god you didn't follow the plan alex there's no fans on the radiator well we're gonna see how it works see if it runs passively when it doesn't we can add fans i see that graphics card is so sketchy dude like that you really did it the way we talked about yeah i mean i thought the plan might get a little better oh my god you're so this is holding the card up yep thank goodness we're not trying to ship this to a customer do you like the pink yes that's a nice accent it's got like a melty aesthetic so it makes sense that it would match our melty pink monitor okay what are the odds this thing is just gonna immediately post she's totally good just everything's good shut up now she lives she's fine uh-huh thriving even it is what like 300 cheaper than what origen did and we're about to find out that it's way better too no we're not what happened to our three-way tubing splitter me and jake thought it was really dumb well yeah i know you can even see it on here decide if a three-way split is dumb and we said yes and cross it off that's fair i mean those idle temps are looking pretty cool what is it 34 degrees she's jumping a little bit hit 50 degrees just launching a program and so the before and center bench was 36 634. oh oh my goodness we're already at 83 degrees 91 degrees 93 degrees no how fast is it running ox degrees no thermal throttling yet 97 degrees hold on wait for it we might make it 98 degrees 35 988 haha that's margin of error for sure margin of error slower mind you but yes if we did a long blender render it is possible we would overwhelm that weak radiator but we hit 36 000 points cpu performance just as good it's not even warm moving on to fort sir things are about to get even more interesting while i'm pretty sure that the gpu itself will probably run at a reasonable temperature i have serious concerns about the memory we're looking for 128 average oh boy memory junction temperature managed to hit 78 already it's not great oh my god even in gamer cpu hit 93 degrees that's with only a couple cores active and it's loud it's really loud this is a much better gaming experience than the vast majority of systems on the market like this is like oh my god easy 98 you're not wrong but that's really not the point oh she seems fine you're actually honest that i see 66 67 that's fine anything bad under here i mean that's going to be hard to spot but it looks like the end of the scale is like 56. yeah doing great with that said the worst parts could be totally covered by blocks right because if we have poor contact between our block and the like mountain of thermal pad and then the heat generating components they could be just sitting insulated under there and we'd have no way of knowing our water is apparently 33 degrees right now not great oh wow yeah you can really see which ones are working which ones aren't so this is at like 42 degrees right now yeah it can still get hotter it's not going to get a chance our cpu is already at 100 degrees cert our gpu has already reached 75 degrees on air cooling that would be fine just fine on water that's a big boatload of suck yeah and i tested multiple runs last time 128 every single time i don't think i've seen it hit 120 oh that's lower i think the biggest surprise for me is that if it did have a proper radiator right like you can see these temps creeping up over time that's because the water's heating if it had a proper radiator might actually work i'm suspicious oh wait 124 again it's not getting worse i think that the blocks are a much larger issue on the cpu yes but it we would get away with it if the water was cooler we'd get away with it but the thing is that even with a high performance radiator you can expect your coolant temperature to rise and so the worst performing your block is the more of a problem that becomes should we stick a fan by it and see if it helps sure oh my god that's the fan what a good fan oh it's quiet too oh sort of a radiator had gotten up to 50 degrees it looks like it's lowering now which is good this is just about the best sales pitch i've ever seen for a commercial water cooling solution only we could make custom water cooling look this easy fast and affordable by comparison just one thing left ah yes and big thanks to origin pc for helping us do it if you enjoyed this video you must be a sucker for punishment so maybe check out the one where we put that radiator on top of the beautiful thing it's an awful video it's painful to watch people said it's like watching a submarine sink
