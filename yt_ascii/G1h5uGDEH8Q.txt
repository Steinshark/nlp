because the ibm pc was based around the intel chip and because it run microsoft's operating system there was no agreement with microsoft to actually supply ibm only so compact went to to microsoft and said can we buy your software yep that's fine no problem they went to intel and said can we buy your chip and intel said yep that's fine the only problem they had was the bios the bios is the chip that links the hardware to the low-level software so what compact had to do is create something that was a i'm not going to use that word it was extremely similar it was very very similar that did the same thing right basically what they did is they they kind of reverse engineered that chip so they had somebody that had never seen or used an ibm pc and they had somebody that person create a specification for exactly what that chip would do and somebody else that has also never seen those ibm machines would then write the code based on that specification lo and behold you end up with something that does exactly the same thing as the original ibm imagine it would get it so exactly similar if they haven't seen it hasn't it yes the law wasn't the same for software as it is now i don't think this story could be done today that created a product and a company that was the fastest growing company in american business history compact grew and grew and grew producing them desktop pcs in the same way as ibm were and really did make computing portable and compatible you know everybody that was using these could also share their data with other people that had ibm pcs and it blew the market open because then everybody could produce machines that were 100 compatible as well so although the original you know reverse engineer the chip might be a little bit questionable actually something amazing happened we ended up with something that was compatible everybody was using the same system and we could all share this data we owe it quite a lot holton catch fire is kind of based on the compact story isn't it yeah yeah reverse engineer an ibm pc with me i want to build a computer that nobody else has the balls to build are you out of your mind what was this machine called then just the portable it's the compact portable yeah i mean compact was an unknown name so you know the the term compact sort of quickly becomes synonymous with with portable computing and and this 100 ibm compatible sort of thing that was going on so yeah really important and later on compact would then merge with hp and the rest of it's all gone a little bit pear-shaped now but yeah great thing at the time being pc compatible just put the keyboard back on it's a clever design isn't it yeah it's really good because that's the that's the bottom of it yeah that's the bottom of it you would stand it up like that but at the side then you'd have these little trapdoors that would reveal the power supply on that side so you can put your cabling in there and then on this side you have all your i o cars standard pc cars that go inside there so you can expand it more memory printer hard disk interface whatever and i'm assuming there would be no battery in one of these there's no battery they would only run off the mains same as the the earlier osborne's as well battery technology was nowhere near capable of doing that sort of thing these are all full size components really in these things you know although they shrunk the screens they were using standard floppy drives they have fairly high current draw batteries we're not going to cut it no i was going to say that the screen is pretty impressive looking in that considering yeah these have got a decent sized screen so so yeah in that those terms was not bad at all certainly a step up from the osborne but then the osborne in a similar way although it had a very very small screen had a composite video output so you could also sit on top of it a decent size composite video monitor as well so once in your office you can have a bigger screen a little bit like people do with laptops today you just connect them to your main screen in the office and just use your laptop in the office as well so we have all the variations of the the compact so there was a compact portable which is this then there was a compact plus there's the compact portable two and the three obviously developing as the pc technology developed and then they would later on go on to create the desk pro and all the rest of those machines which are more desktop oriented so that's the plus we've got the the three and the two and the various other ones down there in the museum there's over a thousand different systems different machines in the collection that's not multiples of the same you know lots of bbc micros and things it's it's actually to begin with we need to calculate a private key right or a private variable i'm going to choose red for alice there we go probably could use more food coloring it's kind of pale red is that red
