finally it's amd ultimate tech upgrade time but for some reason they wouldn't tell me where we're going oh i still don't see why all this was necessary okay this is my garage did you guys get me a tech upgrade what you get enough upgrades it's my turn what linus doesn't know is that i'm donating all of amd's money there we go five thousand dollars thank you amd what i'm gonna do instead is use linus's money he never buys me stuff he always buys himself stuff so here's my chance this looks like a lot more than five thousand dollars well that's what i come in to help i'm going to help you to do the shopping part what i'm really good at you're kidding me dennis was involved well i don't know much at this point but i do know that this amd ultimate tech upgrade is going to be completely off the rails and i guess i'm here for it [music] we're back and thrilled to be working with amd for another episode of amd ultimate tech upgrade to celebrate the launch of their new radeon rx 7600 gpu they want to give a couple of them away to some lucky viewers head on over to our twitter to enter the giveaway for a chance to win one of the two amd radeon rx 7600 gpus that are up for grabs we're going to have that down below thanks again to amd for sponsoring this series first order of business is to get all this stuff inside okay trust me when i say it'll fit okay well i'm gonna take this load in first if i need some help you don't deserve help i deserve one sec okay is my wheel on it okay that's enough wheels well how many things have we broken already none i don't even remember half the stuff i got jake helped me pick a bunch of it oh good jake was involved so i'm sure it's on budget jake's budget you're gonna abandon the key caps that your children picked out for you i'm sorry made for you look it's wearing out and it's actually not just the keycaps the problem is that when i type on the keys they don't register anymore oh yeah i'm actually really sad to lose this too because i really like the wrist rest why the heck are there so many sets okay because there wasn't one set that had actually wait i don't know these look exactly the same they do they just have standard packaging no that says 10 and this is 15. but here's my keyboard pbt is i don't know if the 10 and 15 are oh okay keychron k10 why do you have two keyboards why why yeah why do i have two keyboards it's the nod version it must be for me knives yeah we need kitchen knives ours suck we've had them for what 20 years and they don't cut things anymore not properly my love we haven't even been together for 20 years look i finally got one of these that's isn't broken what is this a weird picture no no is it for disciplining children if they don't dance well enough okay let's try no hey ow hip not my butt butt so it works i know but you're making me feel like i don't normally buy you you don't normally charging tends to be replacing that look at it i don't think we've ever cleaned this no i don't think so and it's missing nugs this is my aunt's fault all our steak knives have the tips broken off because she uses them to jam stuff into the carburetor love you auntie but please don't do that with the new ones i'm surprised you ended up with henkels i don't know any better the accounting people are super into knives i'm sorry are slash knives they would be very disappointed in me but i we're basic like that yeah and i know you wanted self-sharpening but jake says those are a terrible idea so we got a sharpener one that doesn't change the shape of your blade that's not gonna fit that's that's good that's what she said ow yeah it hurts right actually this is really weird is it supposed to go this way or this way this way yeah no but now you can't even like i know but then that's still okay let's see this is what happens when you get jake's help he's well intentioned i got wireless chargers why is this one different that's a power bank oh a thing is just gonna sit here all the time yes how many phones are you planning to have charging while you're cooking no over there there's a couch reading reading whatever i have a charger how are you gonna read on your phone with a wireless charger oh you're not eventually we'll get console table maybe no one is going to use that i promise you what i would use it no one is going to use that okay fine then you have to wire wire that somehow your idea was just to have a cable how are you gonna have a cable no my idea was to charge your phone at night and then use it throughout the day yeah but my phone dies and that's why i got a power bank you got a new phone what oh it's my upgrade yeah okay that's true but i didn't have it yet when i bought how about we put it on this one okay that's fine okay i thought we were gonna do the phone first oh no let's do side tables first it tame the ultimate tech upgrade you don't like it do you oh you know what no no if you like it then i love it well now i don't know i know what we need ltt screwdriver twins yes lttstore.com you know there's a screwdriver right there i know but you're using your hands to get it started you're screwing it by hand how many times have i told you you can't use your hands for that it's better please stop please what this screwdriver paid for this house i will use it i will but it's easier to line it up with your hands we're still working on her screwing technique so my technique that's probably the problem remember folks if your marriage can survive assembling furniture together you're good to go i mean yeah like if she likes it then i'm i'm fine with that okay i think that was a success my phone yeah yeah okay [applause] [music] oh it's a galaxy s23 yeah so really you chose that i really think this is probably a mistake okay should i return it [laughter] at least you don't have expensive taste in person this looks very aliexpress really yeah yeah well it doesn't look expensive i think it was 200 dollars and that's how it comes packaged are you kidding me but now you can't make fun of me anymore okay i got a purse oh yeah i should show you her answer this is what she's been using as a purse all right okay but the real the real trick is does okay maybe i am keeping i'm not ultra version you're gonna be so unhappy with such a tiny phone it fits i'll stretch it out i was accidental wait did this just come apart oh yeah it did wow that didn't take long oh that is really disappointing the snap just came right off yeah how embarrassing return pile oh man should we start getting into the tech stuff that would probably be a good idea amd did sponsor this video sort of simple houseware desk monitor stand riser with adjustable but this looks like crap who picked this i did oh i assumed it was jake again let's see if you guys at least managed to pick a cool laptop you picked a chromebook yeah you know why it's actually not for me it's for the kids for the next grade she's going into she needs a chromebook so that's why i picked a chromebook wow this thing is way overkill for school ryzen 5 with vega graphics so you'll actually be able to isn't steam on chrome os now you'll actually be able to game on this thing eight gigs ram 128 gig storage that's lots though nothing will actually be loaded onto the machine itself and then a 56 watt hour battery which on an efficient processor like this is going to be more than all day plastic top but it does have a metal bottom meaning the stiffness of it is actually quite solid it's funny because in the past amd only used to get kind of the lower end designs from the big oems but that just doesn't seem to be the case anymore this is a really nice chassis can i see how heavy it is well that's not bad it's not light yeah but it's not bad it's got a big fat battery in it so like what do you want yeah it even has i o micro sd slot headphone jack usb a two usb cs both of which are charging compatible on an hdmi port awesome should we open my keyboard not the wavy one so this is going in the return file look i'm not the one putting things in the return pile now i'm surprised they didn't get you a 10 key list and then a separate numpad no i don't want a separate gnome pad why would i want that oh that's the new hotness oh i'm not the new hospital you're the old hotness hotness yeah yeah things are round so maybe the replacement keys that we got hopefully are not round i like it it's pretty all right yeah are you gonna at least still use the kids escape key yeah you know they love you right yes i do and you know i helped them make it and i love you right yeah i know i was part of that video i was there but we can also use it for one of their keyboards downstairs oh no you already did that okay i give up i needed new runners what are you running from so these are the my old lady orthotic runners and you got two pairs of the same shoe i yes okay says the person who got six pairs of the same shoe for badminton that's an athletic shoe i go running what are you talking about is that why you went running yesterday so that today you could say i've been running wow this is very fake looking dennis liked it oh well then no it doesn't go up there what no it doesn't go up there yet did you really get two of the exact same painting fun what i'm pretty sure that's a decor sin is it dennis was with me he approved how much for these how much do you think they were 130. no are you kidding me right now yeah i felt really bad about these ones she's actually tearing up this is how i can tell that this is trouble this is not what i normally would do okay just i think we're 299 each yeah i know it's brutal it's totally brutal i could just use this as a canvas oh my god oh bothering you need some floor time do we need to start talking about this order thing what is this and why are there so many pieces of it so you need to make space for me out in your workshop what you have a workshop no she converted our living room to a craft room craft room right yeah it's not a workshop i need space in the workshop whoa our entire living room from here to all of this david you got to come in here of this and is your craft space yeah that i have work people here every friday night to craft with so it's a work thing good yeah then it's a workshop s there are a few there's fumes it's a laser cutter so it sh and engraver okay and it apparently requires assembly i don't know i don't know anything about these this is an activity to learn this goes with the wall of flowers the lego flowers you know because you don't buy me real flowers or real birds so i get these are the ones that i get once again i'm pretty sure i'm the one who got you that one you did get me that one yeah yep but here's the birds that i'm not allowed you didn't even upgrade your monitor no i like my monitor why well it's only 75 hertz though so it's amazing how the meta kind of changes for a while these monitor stands were a thing and then now everyone's got the arms you know i don't even think these will go through the spacers oh balls okay i might have a solution to this oh who's the hoarder now don't mind me just back from my perfectly organized garage okay okay what do you think this monitor falls down but you said you have a bigger one downstairs i guess yeah i do oh my gosh you know usually these come come with instructions on which piece goes where but this one really does not where do you want the monitor that's really far away i wanted it to be like tucked back see this won't bend anymore so that's as far back as it goes yeah it's really not as flexible as i would like it to be i mean it's still an upgrade because you get all this space under it back all right we're gonna hello what whoa what are you doing what what well you have to take it off the back no no no no what you take it off a little piece at a time like oh yeah but you're you're bending it you got to take it off a bit more i i'm working on it just one sec it's you're bending it dbrand be watching this like i'm a strong independent woman i can do this myself all right and i helped wait what are these for of for above there it's decorative these should go up before the vinyls okay oh that was close yep i got this this is one of the few classic man duties that i'm actually pretty practiced at [laughter] higher than i had requested they all be what percentage of the shareholders and directors of the company is precariously perched on a table right now crap what what happened paul that doesn't seem to be a stud even though this thing claims there's studs all over the place here well there's an extra hole here that is a very happy shelf right now yeah it's coming out of the wall like this i'm gonna open this crappy desk monitor yeah because that's where i keep my keyboard and my mouse well no because i'm a big dumb idiot and i like my keyboard and mouse in there can't even charge the apple mouse like that do you think you could have picked more things that need to be assembled why what's wrong this thing is crap i really don't know if i even want to build it look at it it goes here does that appeal to you does that shine in sparkle no i hate it yeah let's leave it get out of here yeah this return pile is something else hey vaughn mm-hmm make sure this is gonna whoa is everything okay oh yeah did you check and make sure this is going to fit under the desk [music] just raise it like a centimeter yep now push there you go and you thought we were gonna make candles today well so ambitious not necessarily today hmm did you actually ask for all these things from you green or are they just trying to show off the breads of their type c dongle catalog no i i asked for some of it i don't remember asking for so many though but maybe i did i don't i don't remember this was a long time ago i think i see a green airfly pro connect two wireless headphones to any headphone jack oh yeah instead of buying all these things and whatever i was actually going to take you on a trip oh so that's why there's a bunch of travelers but then i thought about the filming schedule and all that stuff and i was like ah forget it so basically our whole life yeah pretty much they got you a headphone stand but they got you like the cheapest crappiest type okay no this one's my fault oh just like the desk thing jake advised against it but i was like this looks fine no it really doesn't it doesn't even stay together permanently you can you can add that to the pile more kitchen accessories oh yeah this is for that pot we bought from the liquidation place that burns our handle this time i love this okay so we've got the sick chromebook hey thanks amd we've got all the furniture the monitor arm but this oh this is what's exciting well let me show you we won't burn our heads this is amazing never again will this cheap kaiser half pot burn my wife's dainty hands yes success this is kind of coming together hey not bad how often do you use these headphones like if you're working in here and i'm working here and we're both like on a call i don't want to bother you okay all right maybe i'll just have to find a better place to mount this like maybe if i mounted it like under here or something like that yeah that would be nice because right now the cable gets in the whale okay and are you sure you want battery powered lamps they're not battery powered they're usb well okay the rechargeable battery powered but their usb one day i will get real birds for real you have cats how do you like the keyboard i'm used to so much more pressure to push on it it feels soft in some ways but i like how quiet it is because my one at work is really loud i like how i like how it looks it matches my my wall stickers my flowers and you have better speakers at your desk than me now so i like it oh man this is so nice it's like now i don't have to look at my side and just be sad when i look at your side mana my side looks kind of bland now yeah now it does well okay except that you have the wall of you two plaques i mean those are our youtube plex on your wall oh i know right i need to get more plaques you know what i haven't put up yet gold billy billy but should it go here right next to the other billy billy or is that not random enough should we go maybe here or it could start going that way it needs to be the first one to cross over we just we just start going that way okay more ability more more plaques let's go subscribe to lmg clips get another gold one for the craft space rug oh can you spill glass i'm really just okay sure stained glass is a temporary hobby a temporary right now hobby okay well we don't have to open it no let's go let's go i think we should see what it looks like so that we know if we have to return it or not wait wait before you do that i don't know if i like this rug okay i'm not going to be responsible for putting another thing in the return pile i think it's good enough okay all right all right let's do it yeah you're good you're good you're good and we're under she's trying really hard to put a splash of color in her life in this room and it's killing her inside i think well no it just doesn't go i mean oh hey look i just added a splash of color in there and it looks great you did a great job between the things we couldn't find and the things that ended up in the return pile this has been quite the day oh okay so you have a dress okay come on over let's see it okay wow that's really great do you like it yeah it's awesome it sounded super sarcastic okay it's pretty clear it's going in the return pile no i mean what from the back is pretty good it was supposed to be so we could go on a date together okay well we can go on a date and we can buy you a new dress how about that okay but we also planned three more dates oh because the whole idea was i just wanted to spend time with you no i don't know if i want to shout out dbrand thanks for sending over this thing for the wrong phone okay no it's for the right phone they sent us the right thing we bought the wrong phone and there it is grip case matching my car wait i don't even need to report the ordering ink for you still have ink it's agitating the ink yeah i know this is for when when it runs out it's already i didn't print very many photos and it's already at like a quarter and the float plane exclusive for this is going to be long long and gainey we'll see over there floatplane.com now we just need to figure out where the devil this is going to live yeah i propose you it does not fit up there i mean anything fits oh look at that that's terrible awesome okay just put it wherever you want it on it in the workshop yeah i'm putting my blindfold back on okay you realize i don't actually have that much desk space in this area right okay but you have enough for this it's filled with junk right now junk see if it can go right in that corner and we move these litter boxes and stuff it's perfect it goes right there and you get to use it too or you can build me a little shelf and i can put it in there and then when i want to use it i pull it out fine okay compromise teamwork that's a pretty sick vibe yeah i like it yeah this is great go amd usually we check out more desktoppy stuff like their ryzen 7000 series processors including the 7800 x 3d
