there's a certain part of the museum that most people don't get to see which is the archive and this is one of the archives which has some of the machines out there on display for those people that are that are interested and you're lucky enough to see it in the museum there's over a thousand different systems different machines in the collection that's not multiples of the same you know lots of bbc micros and things it's actually independent different systems could be different models but over a thousand machines there's quite a lot of it is in their original boxes and they're somewhere else so any machines that we have that are in their original packaging are stored in the other building but over here we have some of the machines that are a bit too big to go in boxes and actually are kind of interesting so we want to put them out on shelves so it's storage but it's storage that you can have a bit of a nose around so this is kind of like the the special stuff yeah this is for the connoisseur and if you ask nicely sometimes we can we can bring people over and show them we number every shelf and when you go on our website so if you want to see any of these machines they're all on our website somewhere and we can look at the back end of the system and say right that machine is on shelf 116 in the the the store that we're in now so we can find this stuff pretty quickly or at least that's the idea but it is random so there's there's no correlation between that machine there and that one it's you know these things are just on shelves so we can find them but there is a lot of interesting stuff here some very rare stuff some common garden stuff as well but but yeah just to go through a little bit of it i don't even know where you start with this but we have some machines up here acorn fans might recognize systems like this and specifically these ones so we've got an akon system three a system five but this is steve ferber's prototype it's kind of the prototype of the prototype really there was a machine called the proton which would later become the bbc micro well this is the kind of the prototype the proton was based on this machine and there's stifler's very first machine that he made at the top there it's entirely home designed including anodizing the aluminium in the kitchen sink and things like that so a bit of acorn stuff going on over here we have some nice apple imacs we've got all the different colors and some apple twos as well there's also some clone machines so that's a clone of the apple ii about when it was possible to do such a thing yeah i mean this was a licensed clone so apple did allow certain manufacturers to make their own versions of the machines that is also a clone of an apple ii with this drive built in i'm not sure how legit that one was the euro plus the apple 2e things like that but then there's other machines as well that are somewhat less common we have the icl systems up there interesting effect i don't know if you can see that this machine is not on but you can still see what it was doing so there's something called screen burn so if a machine was left on with the same display on the screen all the time it would actually burn that into the phosphor a bit of a shame but it's kind of an interesting thing so you can see the software that we're using probably a word process or something like that early that's a compact disc recorder a little bit big and there's a cd reader as well so yeah some really early stuff that's kind of quite a bit of a joke really to see something like that on a shelf whereas it's now just literally an internal cd wrong on most machines atari ste there that's a prototype of the acorn business machine so we have some really early interesting stuff there that's pretty much unique that's a later torch unix-based machine torch started off by making business computers but based on bbc micros so they'd have a bbc micro with a z80 co-processor and set it as a cpm machine that is kind of effectively the prototype of this machine here acorn business computer again yeah they're not necessarily sat next to each other maybe we will at some point but at the minutes really know about what stuff is here rather than precisely where it is it's quite nice in that respect because you kind of happen upon things you weren't expecting it's true yeah yeah you might find things you weren't looking for this one very uncommon that's the olympia people cpm based machine cpm is a language so cpm was out there kind of the early dos system so dos was so basically effectively i've got to choose my words carefully here dos was kind of a rip off of cpm so there was a language called kudos quick and dirty operating system which was kind of a bit of a a copy of of cpm and cpm was a language used by lots of machines z80 based machines and very much more business oriented so you had lots of spreadsheets and word processes that would run on cpm operating systems we've got very early pet down there with a chiclet keyboard the first incarnations had the cassette deck built in to it but had this very small little keyboard obviously you couldn't have a full size keyboard because of the cassette deck but that made it a little bit tricky to type on so the original pet 2001 series with those keyboards are fairly uncommon now most of them were replaced or people upgraded to the full-size keyboards which are over there somewhere i quite like silicon graphics they just look lovely don't they they look like machines you need to own very powerful machines incredibly expensive at the time most of these kind of things all the silicon stuff the silicone graphics stuff we get it's usually from universities or you know like say high-end broadcast systems and and render farms and stuff like that research machines produce computers for use in education if you're in the uk anyway a lot of people will remember those from school if you're 40 something like me and the 480z was kind of a network machine that a lot of people had in schools i remember from school the zenith beta system this thing's a beast computer there from zenith with a hard drive or winchester as they called it built in with its monitor there on top is an hp 85 hewlett packards machines very very popular use machine there for a lot of scientific and various other work of that nature next slab so this is steve jobs company next after he was ousted from apple produced this beautiful machine this is the slab normally sits down this way and they also produce the cube which we have out on display very powerful machines but in true steve jobs style very expensive the next step operating system will later become the mac os system it was based on the same sort of unix-based system that the next system used what else i have no idea what that is it's probably a powertrain system i have to look that one up so lots of single board computers back in the early 80s uk 101 nascom and i think it was eti producing instructions you could buy their magazine and build your own computer and powertran was the the name of that system there so i think that's what that is very big luggable toshiba laptop with a plasma screen there's one of those on display as well more rm machines an intermediate system so this was quite interesting this was a system designed to convert different disc formats three inch eight inch five and a quarter to other formats so you could read from one disk and translate it to another i've never seen another one of those machines so this is the outer 8800b this is the one with that style front panel so that's the one you saw was the one we have in the museum this is another one we've got another one because it's just a different front panel the 8800b there which is known as the turnkey version so this was basically the same thing except it didn't have all the switches because you were most likely going to connect it up to a terminal and access it from there and then very rare hard disk controller for the outer and set of floppy drives for it as well a little outset collection down there well this is kind of interesting this is just a pc a philips pc system but it links to a laserdisc player so this system was running educational software not educational training software was that what the doomsday was basically doomsday system is very very similar philips laser display except it has extra hardware underneath which is the interface of the bbc micro this was controlled purely from rs232 from that pc and this was used at ford for training software to show people how to do stuff i don't know that system there is purely a word processor that's the ibm display writer so this part the floppy drives and the keyboard and the printer there gives you a word processor nothing expensive typewriter it really is yeah but displaywriter later on become display right so all of this hardware became software afterwards that you could run on any pc deck i think that's a deck professional is that down there it needs a bit of a clean various different sj research networking things for the bbc micro and acorns networking stuff there canon's early machines there the as100 is that a tonto or is that an opd you never know right so this is an opd so this is icl's computer this was designed to be obviously on your desk and it had a built-in phone and it had a connection so you could get onto bbs's and view data type systems but ultimately inside that is a sinclair ql so it's basically a ql with some plug-in cartridges that gave it some inbuilt software and up here are two micro drive cartridges so that with its monitor there set on your desk and you had a ql but beefed up for business use ico were a big mainframe manufacturer weren't they so this was a departure for them right it was yeah this is starting to get into the the more personal side of things but it was basically just that system and it was re-branded then as so same system british telecom bt merlin tonto so bt got in on the act as well there was a little bit of a spate with companies producing kind of communications computers and slightly misreading where things were going well you know yes and no yes or no they were they were you know genuine very good uses for these things we've got a great system over there as well i'll show you but you know computing is mostly about communications these days you know so the whole connectivity with the internet and sharing information these were doing that kind of thing obviously much much more simplified and giving people instant access to stock data and shares and whatever else so you know something we don't have now because the computer is much more general purpose but could have been that way trs-80 there is that model two or one that's a two great big eight inch drives at the side there keyboard is sitting on top i think some apricot machines the zen and we've got a couple of development systems as well from apricot they weren't quite pc compatible they were close but not quite enough i remember seeing apricots back in the day and thinking black ones in fact they're thinking they looked amazing but were they just trying to rip off apple because of the names no there was a i don't think that was it at all there were lots of companies based around fruits i don't really know why maybe there's a whole conscious collective they really thought that would be a good name for for these things yeah i don't know but apricots were good equipment they were they were very good machines but they purposely decided to make them very very slightly non-standard so that they kept their customer base so you had to buy their version of the software for this machine which ultimately would turn out to be a bad idea you know everybody wanted compatibility floppy drives didn't quite run at the same speed as everybody else is so they were completely unreadable but then they did produce a machine i think they called it the chameleon agricult chameleon which was then much more pc compatible but by that time that kind of missed the button it's kind of ironic really because now it doesn't really matter as long as the files are the same it doesn't matter at all because everything connects the same way yeah absolutely yeah the physical media is is gone and you just spelled it over the internet but but no but back then that was obviously a big deal you needed to take your floppy disk put it in an envelope send it to somebody else so you could read your your word perfect files or whatever it might have been so so being not compatible was a bit of a problem in that way and ultimately leads to the end of apricot really i don't know how that got up there because that weighs a ton a microphone computer again i've never seen another one of those if anybody out there knows anything about them please let us know we've got an original brochure for it but this is this is metal and weighs at absolute time i would imagine probably pretty much it's just a cpm based machine but incredible and the monitor mounts directly to the to the unit there commodore yeah so not many people know that commodore did end up making pcs very basic ones 808 based i think or 86 i'm not sure diablo that's a xerox system there tandes that's again effectively sturdy pc more apricots over there olivetti that is just a data printer i think so that's basically a terminal printer terminal that's an old friend for me my first pc experience for 286 my mum got for word processing but we managed to get it to do all sorts oh of course you do it is for games well the pc games at that time weren't that great cga was funny another world was the most impressive thing on it yes absolutely i didn't really know how to work it yeah no pieces at that time were a little bit limited so for games and things they weren't that great prince of persia i think that we got that running was yeah the animation on prince of persia was was brilliant absolutely brilliant a samurai machine there that's a again eight inch based it's effectively cpm based system but there's a couple of systems we've got with different names but very very similar systems amstrad has got a few of the amstrad's here these are kind of business machines there's a digital there though is it would that have been deck is that a deck yeah that's a deck a digital much much later on in dex life just a pc nothing nothing to see there really but but yeah we've got deck alphas and things is that an alpha over there i think there's an alpha in the background there but yeah some amstrad machines are quite nice all right the later amstrad pcs the two eight sixes or two two eight sixes are known they were always beasts yeah yeah yeah and actually i mean that's quite a big monitor the other one we've got has got a very small monitor like this and then the word processor again these are other versions so we have the eight two five six on display but then we have the eight five one two as well so that we've got both oh we just mentioned this in the other video actually there is an xd sorcerer now i like these why do i like these because they're clearly low production run and what i like most about them is their cartridges so they have plug-in roms at the side but when you take it out that's what they look like do you recognize that at all is that an eight-track cassette that is an eight-track cassette if you look at the end there you see the way it's all been hacked out now i love the idea that these things are being manufactured at exedy's company somewhere and they've got a massive pile of diana ross tapes and they're unscrewing them all with tape everywhere hacking these edges and then putting their circuit boards in look at that well the thing is i mean it was a low production run so this is a very cheap molded case it's it's not it's not a quantity case there should be a one of these things over the end there yeah but you know this is a relatively low production run case i don't know how many of these machines they produced but they probably didn't produce that many so this was effectively five grands worth of machine in today's uk money but yeah to have a cartridge made like that would have cost you a lot for the injection molding would have been you know thousands and thousands of pounds so why not use eight-track tapes at this time were at the end of their days they were probably very very cheap to buy it's probably cheaper to pay somebody to take all the tape out of it and than than it is to get these things moulded so actually it's absolute genius i love it so so yeah that's the cartridges for them one of my favorites we've got the disk interface a monitor all built in onto that screen there and there's also a sort of expansion interface underneath it as well if that part of it was five grand i have no idea what the complete system there would cost plus software so yeah i love the xcd source we've got boxed on as well in the in the archive of the road as well we try and keep the original boxes and manuals and everything else where we can there are no manuals here we tend to separate those any software that come with and they're separated out and somewhere else and it's all sort of linked on the website so we know where everything is so that way we keep the best best condition we can deck 3000 there so that's sort of dex higher end still stuff as opposed to their pc stuff later this is a sony msx machine it's an msx2 but it has an interface that allows it to connect to that laser display as well a little bit doomsday system alike i'm seeing another old friend up here kind of the boring era for apple they were very much beige boxes there wasn't too much thought going into the design of what they looked like but they were perfectly capable machines from the internals point of view they were doing things nobody else was doing right yeah yeah the motorola stuff going on and they were yeah 68 000 machines they they were good well spec machines and like we were talking earlier these things were used for early multimedia so you know producing videos on these things you know was possible albeit limited so he was saying sort of quarter frame yeah we we used to do so my my introduction to video editing was on a power mac very similar to that and we couldn't do full frame video you could do a quarter of a frame and have a lot of black space around it yeah yeah but you know that's what people were impressed with you had cd-roms that had limited space anyway we weren't on dvds or anything like that so a multimedia cd-rom you had sort of 700 mega-ish to to play with so you couldn't have a great deal of video anyway so there were all these very small little clips that were part of another page so was the encyclopedia yeah compton's encyclopedia and in carter and stuff like that had these little not on every article just on the few and and i remember going through things like in carter back in the day and just looking for the ones with video you know i wasn't interested in an article if it didn't have video you know and you'd get this little i wasn't even 352 was it across it was smaller than that but they were tiny like something like 288 pixels or something ridiculous and compression standards were still evolving and not a lot of the machines could decompress much so yeah so it had to be very minimal decompression because the processors weren't capable of decompressing it live and yeah you were very limited but it was the beginning of you know what we have now you know i remember making websites with tiny i don't know how many there were less than 100 pixels across video of a laser show that i was filming and i thought that was amazing that people can go on the web and see this tiny little video it was it was huge but you know you look back now it's a bit of a joke but there you go things change that's what we're about so moving on what have we got i'll try and speed this up a bit swt pc early machine there victor machine we have hp 9825 so these are kind of again sort of scientific machines these were used for big glorified calculators in a way a couple there the a and the b version not sure what the difference is senior machines pcs there from seno our tasks again these are these are machines that were cpm based but rather than plugging in a monitor you would plug in a terminal so they had lots of serial connections so you could have eight users or something like that all using that one system at the same time and they had things like concurrent cpm that allowed people to use the operating system at the same time yeah so this is interesting i've got two stories on this one so this is for anybody that recognizes it part of the risk pc so we've got this pc around no so anyway oh yes right underneath it so that's your standard risk pc but you could have an extra slice they called them slices which would be one of these now the two stories are the that at this was definitely at the acorn world show and they had a risk pc that was built up with lots and lots of extra slices and somebody said that the pizza oven was just a bit of a joke to say you could add all these different things to it and you could even have do your pizza but actually other people have said well it was a little bit more aggressive than that that actually the pizza oven it was part of the risk pc they had on display it was trying to show that intel processors which used a lot of power and therefore displayed a lot of heat could cook a pizza so actually their their arm processors were way better much lower power but intel processors you could cook your pizza on now i don't know which of those stories is is the more accurate but they're both fun and yeah basically i mean it's a bit dodgy there's a mains connector there that went in and powered this light here to give it that kind of red glow i'm not sure that would be they would pass pat testing today i don't think we're plugging that in no but you know kind of fun and part of you know acorns acorn world exhibition and their display i've just realized actually this this is not just a risk pc that is in fact a prototype pc so yeah lots of stuff here that is pre-production and prototyping before the actual production runs and there's actually another interesting machine there so this this case doesn't look that interesting but inside it is a machine called the profit three so this portable computer if i can get it out that's going to be recognizable to quite a few people that know acorn atom and they'll realize that's a re-badged atom but an atom with a disc interface so you could take around your atom in this carry case there it is so you've got a carry handle there so you can carry it around and on top you can stick your monitor plug it into the mains there take the composite video output and away you go you've got your portable pc so yeah that's the profit i think again that was aimed at a specific market i think it has a spreadsheet not built in but on the disk so for accountants on the move 380z again people recognize from school but that is a very early what they call the blue box version not many of those around in that in that kind of box more amstrad archimedes all the different versions of archimedes 310 440 441 got the risk x machines over there so the r 140s and r 260s over there so acorn got into kind of a a different operating system called risk x these are more powerful machines and this was aimed more at the unix e high-end market but obviously didn't go that far cambridge workstation down there again they're quite rare there's another cambridge acorn machine that was again towards the end of days for for acorn sadly memory 7000 that's a huge lump of machine screen built in with its drives there that the computer itself set in front like that that's the memory 7000 so the enigma that's not the enigma that people would first think of that's just the name of it there were lots of companies making cpm based machines there was kind of no licensing issues it was a standard z80 based computer so lots of people made their variations on it and so you see a lot of these in fact the galaxy gemini one there and the enigma are very nearly identical in fact they probably are quite a few machines that are rebranding that way this is quite nice carefully take that off not the toshiba that's just a laptop this has seen better days but it's beautiful in a very ugly kind of way so that is a nescon one no sorry it's a netcom 2 i think it's a computer built into a great big wooden box lovely so you've got the expansion board there for memory you can add extra roms onto it the nascom board is underneath we get a lot of nascoms and uk 101s built into various flavors of wooden boxes no two look the same is there another one yeah there's another that's a uk 101 up there in fact again this is this is edging towards portable computing so if we i love the hinges yeah well the hinges uncover the keyboard so yeah the the uk 101 was a was a single ball computer you bought it you you put it together it was one board with the keyboard built in yeah people built them into cases that suited them so you've got the compartment at the back there which gives you access to 240 volts if you want to electrocute yourself at any point that's nice so you i don't know why you need to have a little compartment for that you know i've written some really bad code i must electrocute myself i'll just open this flap and kill myself i don't know i'm sure there was a reasonable reason to be on suicide probably kept overheating so they wanted to let air in that probably makes more sense i prefer my version like i like your room except that built-in you know brilliant i mean people went to these links to to accommodate their machines because actually you know the machines were a certain amount of money but maybe a molded case that went with it was half as much again you know so it's you know people had to find other ways of casing their machines if they'd made themselves we have compacts up there the early compact portable machines really important machine so this is the osborne one kind of one of the first computers that was popular as a portable computer i'll try and show you so they're not light they're not that portable you would put that on your desk you'd undo the catches which is difficult to do when you're behind it there you go so you have this tiny oh we've got some information on it as well tiny little screen full-size keyboard full-size floppy disks the thing they chose to shrink was the screen the bit the ring you want to keep as big as you can probably it was down to what was available so these are all off the shelf parts and they've all been squeezed into this case and probably that screen was maybe used on oscilloscopes or something you know there would have been some other use for that screen so they've bought what is available and made themselves a portable computer this thing was incredibly popular this started off really that trend for mobile computing portable computing and yeah sold very very well this is the early version with the with the blow molded case now i'll put that back in it in a minute let's put that one back up there but then very shortly after they started producing a slightly more professional version of it which has a slightly nicer case but essentially same machine this was one of the first machines that actually shipped with bundled software so when you bought this you got yourself a spreadsheet a database communication software it all came with it basic so the idea of having bundled software having literally your whole office in a briefcase suitcase was first done by osborne really quite important machine that would later be followed by the other machines that we saw up there so these what form parts of the holton catch fire story though yeah well yeah kind of these are the predecessors of that that machine there with its screen and its keyboard which is here that is the ibm pc actually that's the original the 5150 with two floppy drives so this is a machine that ibm produced it was quite unlike their machines that went before because they used to make all the parts that went in their machines this machine used in intel chip and it used a an operating system from a lesser-known company called microsoft and that was unusual for ibm that was the first time they've done that and this was kind of in answer to things like the apple twos that were starting to appear around companies emotionally in the states and ibm weren't too chuffed about that so they kind of rushed this product into existence and it was very good it was expensive but it was a hulking great machine metal case that sat on your desk personal computing no longer would you rely on the company's mainframe you could do what you wanted with this machine so this is great so that's the ibm pc what a company an unknown company at the time called compaq did they took the idea that i was born were doing this portable machine and they made a similar kind of product and they produced let me put the feet up can't reach there we go right they produced a machine called the compact portable now what's important about this machine is that it was 100 compatible with the ibm pc so whatever software you run on your ibm machine and remember ibm ruled the roost you know they they were so dominant in the computing industry it's untrue and with good reason but the software that was written for that would run on this machine even though it wasn't a standard ibm machine there's so many stories that go along with all these machines and actually the stories is what we can't find the most interesting the hardware is just the excuse to tell those stories so so yeah it's really nice when you can get one of these machines and then talk about the the things that it that it made happen and the the social impacts of some of these machines you get a lot of this stuff donated don't you do you get a lot of those stories from the people who donate them yeah we make sure we collect those stories people are quite surprised to hear that when they when they come in and say oh i've got this machine would you like it the first thing we would say you know is have you got it what did you use it for blah blah and you know people have got really interesting stories you know there's a lot of shared experiences with using them at university to write their thesis and all this kind of stuff but then some people are saying well i was doing you know computation for you know dna and all this kind of stuff we have sgi systems that we use to decode the human genome we've got other other machines that were used for all sorts of different things scientific research we've got machines from the scott polar research we've got machines that created the grating catalogue i don't know if anybody remembers that you know massive catalogue this thick that we had in the uk where you could put stuff on tick and pay off over the next 36 weeks oh the shop the shopping cart yeah yeah but there were huge yellow pages style big catalogs and and that that machine was used to do the data entry for that for instance just things that you just wouldn't really think of but they're interesting and what it's done for those people the way that it's changed their lives people that have had their their companies and they've computerized them you know which means installing a stock control system or whatever but everything that went along with that it's stuff that happens today that you don't think about you know it is obvious if you are going to have a business you're going to have a computer that's going to look after your accounts everything else but it wasn't always like that you know sometimes it was actually a lot more hard to work and these machines allowed you know the speed of business to just increase so much you know we used to send a letter to another company and they would reply you know a week later or whatever if you don't get reply to your email by the end of the day now he's you know why haven't they replied so it's it's changed everything in that way and it's because of these machines that's what's interesting that you know the hardware is great but the stories that go along with them you know equally so so yeah there's a there's a lot of memories for a lot of people and amongst all this sort of stuff so yeah yeah i can see some of these machines you know this one was controlling water processing plant we have another machine over there that was used for controlling water flow through a dam it's just incredible incredible lots of commodores down here another early commodore pep and then also the later pets these are the commodore sk series so so these were basically repackaged versions of the earlier commodore pets just in a nicer kind of space 1999 style cases really like those ones not really designed to fit on shelves like these but there you go but yes i mean it's just a small part of the collection like i said i don't know there's probably a couple of hundred machines up here maybe i'm not sure there's over a thousand in the collection some of them are just in boxes some of them in their original boxes there's over twelve thousand bits of software archived so far in the collection nine thousand magazines i don't know how many thousand manuals and yeah it's it's quite vast and it's you can look at all this stuff online just go on the website if the machine is up here and you've seen it it will be on the website for the connoisseurs next time right yeah absolutely there's some more stuff here we can show you we also go through some of these machines on our own youtube channel as well so we have if you search youtube for center for computing history and also retro tech archive we've got two channels if you want to follow those we'll put a link down there awesome yeah follow the link wherever it might be it's just got that sound of oh oh internet explorer is open again
