has your keyboard got too many keys maybe teach me daddy [music] so in a previous video i mentioned my 16 key layout and a lot of you really interested in that and what kind of things i'm doing to pull that off so obviously i'm gonna do a deep dive and look at that layout in detail and and hopefully it'll give you some ideas and you may not want to go that far and in fact i'm not quite sure if i'm going to stick with this and i'll mention this in the video but there's a couple of sort of things that i think another thumb key or two thumb keys might be really beneficial so i'm going to explore that in this video too whether this is the point that's too far or you know obviously i don't think there's any point in going any further i don't think i'm going to go any further i'm only going to go back now but it's amazing to have got this far and obviously the benefit you know reducing all that finger movement is fantastic i'd you know just really hardly moving my fingers now and that's amazing i'm actually really interested in this okay i actually am really interested in this this is this is kind of exciting you know what i mean like this is very very exciting i kind of want to understand this because there is something that's very appealing if you could somehow just have these power fingers and like nine keys like' keys right uh' keys and then like two thumbs on each side maybe three thumbs on each side i think it's kind of exciting i think there's something else that's what i've really wanted to try and get to with this keyboard journey so the first of my company i do like thinking about and that was really kind of intended for the gogoplex actually experimented with it on the moon lander and the plank and then put it onto the gogoplex and that was great fun you know the first time i sort of really created that layout where you're only moving one key from each of your home positions including with the thumbs so you've got one each side of your home thumb as well and that was fantastic so give me a real taste of the what it's like i've tried doing these kind of things where you like because okay so so real talk so like the pistol grip is what they kind of call right this is like your neutral position you're like everyone has like a neutral hand positioning where if you just like held it out without trying you'd be at some sort of angle and this is supposed to be like your your most like your most optimal way to do it because you're not doing this you're not doing this right it's supposed to be really good for you but man i don't i don't know about this it seems a little too it seems a little too erect okay i like to have a small layout people on the gogo flex and that led me to the ferris which i actually built myself so that's the first time i kind of gone down this road of soldering something a little bit and using controllers and all the rest of it but that was a 34 key layout so i adapted my layout and made that work and i'm going to link to all of the all of the files for these videos in the description as well so you can you can i kind of want to build this i've never really soldered anything i have a soldering kit over there i can see it i think this would kind of be fun see that journey as time's gone on as well dang it is this what's happening to me am i becoming am i be coming that guy am i becoming the guy that nobody likes well if you just build your if you just build your own keyboard you could you know don't you do anything right like i don't want to be that guy i don't want to be fine becoming the guys this incredible bit of software and kind build your own pcb for your truly custom layout just for you yeah and i've done a video on that and i'll be doing more more detail on that process as well because it's absolutely amazing i think it's what it enables you to do is fantastic you can really build a very beautiful and you know you don't worry about this guy has a really great i really i don't even know who this is ben valik okay ben affleck i appreciate this ben i'm gonna subscribe to ben you should too this is a very beautiful camera work i love his single take talking there's a lot of really great things he does in this filling up blanks and stuff if you want to go for a smaller layout you can just build a new pcb and it's so cheap and affordable and it's actually not that complicated to do so that's all very exciting not that complicated to do then shows this image [music] i think so as you start exploring smaller layouts you get to a stage where you're removing so many keys that you can't have every letter key on its own key and you know the first thing that you might think about doing which is what i did was combos for those missing keys so you would hit two you know two two keys at a time to get the equivalent of one of the other keys that's then missing and that's pretty awkward for flowy typing you know you can't really roll and some of those if you're rolling over a combo you might trigger the combo by mistake there's lots of sort of issues around that i think you fundamentally mean you couldn't ever type very fast using combos for some letters and i didn't really like the feel of it either i like the idea of rolling a whole word you know and hitting a combat kind of it's actually one of my biggest takeaways from dvorak one of the things i think is most bucked like just just bored about dvorak is the fact that s and l are so cool close to each other oh my goodness why am i up there we got s and l on pinky it's on pinky people people it's on pinky and by being on pinky like ah that sucks so slack yeah i hate that snl are on those keys like it really feels so terrible where it's like th that feels so good t-h-sh feels great right nh also feels great just doesn't make any sense in english right there's not a lot of nhs right but i just have always hated that i've always hated that about oh gosh flash bang i've always just hated it makes it stumbling obviously as you get to a certain stage you run out of good combos that work for letters so if you make a combo out of two common letters very fast over those then it will trigger as the combo and that that's a problem so you normally want to make combos out of letters that don't normally come i'm actually reconsidering i i kid you not i'm reconsidering going back to qwerty but obviously sticking with this bad boy just going back to clarity because that way i have i have my programmer dvorak layout with all the symbols so i have all my symbols correct but then i have but then i still have like qwerty and that way when i use somebody else's computer right i can still type like a normal human being okay you know how weird it feels to know you can you can type above 100 words per minute and not be able to type at all consecutively in normal typing but i never really found that i wasn't really enjoying combos do i just see [ __ ] on my pinky hell's happening in chat i wanted to go a bit smaller as well anyway so i ended up thinking of two layers for all of alpha keys so with two layers it becomes possible to get really quite small and in quite a short space of time i'd gone down to 16 keys i've stuck with a 16 for long enough now that i can make this video and i've got pretty fast on it you know i'm up to 80 words a minute which i think is unbelievable and i think it has potential to be even faster too you know not i don't think the layout's holding the 80 i think it's just you're not going to get faster with the muscle memory i think it can go faster i'll be super pleased if i can get this to 100 words a minute so in terms of the feel of the keyboard it's incredibly gratifying to type on a keyboard where you feel you're really barely moving your fingers there's just those occasional movements yeah and you know you once you start feeling the pattern of a whole word you get this sort of idea in your mind of what's yeah when you type fast you get kind of almost it feels like you're memorizing a word each time you know i'm confused why he keeps resetting things and that's how you end up typing really fast and you're not sort of thinking letter by letter you're thinking of the patterns for each word or at least the sort of chunks of letters that make up the words and when you do that with the board this small those patterns feel incredible there's there's hardly any effort to them and i think i'm really hoping that that is also going to enable me to type really fast on this as well qwerty has a lot of patterns that i feel like dvorak does not have that much i feel like dvorak does not have that much it doesn't feel as pattern driven it has like small chunks of patterns whereas i feel like clarity you had like whole word patterns often it just felt better maybe it's just because i was you know just such a young you know buck when i learned how to do clarity whereas dvorak was in my my you know my my silver fox hairs shut up the right thumb key is the key that switches to the second layer now i started off using a normal sticky layer key for this and that means that basically you can just tap it and then the next key you hit is on the second layer and then it goes back to the first layer now the problem with that in reality is i was as i started typing faster what i was finding i was doing was my thumb off that sticky layer key by the time i would go back to hitting say a key from the first layer after that so it actually trigger two keys from the second layer when i actually only wanted one and then back to the first layer because i hadn't quite got my thumb off so obviously when you start rolling quickly that's something that is going to happen so i asked on the discord group if anyone had any solutions to this so basically what i was needing to happen was as soon as my thumb is down on that layer switch key the next key that fires will force it back to layer one even if my thumb is still on it and someone had the fantastic idea of using a macro for this which is how that works you know so i'll put the sticky layer switch as a macro and that basically fires immediately and it doesn't it doesn't matter if i hold that key down it's not still going to work as a second layer switch so that that actually solved the problem it means i can roll through to the second layer and then back to the first layer as faster and sloppy as i like with my finger hanging onto that key and it doesn't cause any problems which is you know exactly what i want now i kind of want all of all of the letters to behave that way including full stop comma and apostrophe so that why i i'm curious why i didn't just have hold hold for layer you know what i mean to me it just seems like a hold for layer would be way way way way way way easier you know what i mean i don't know maybe i don't understand that's kind of my goal that i don't have to worry about timing for any normal letter key and that basic punctuation i can roll over those in any speed in any pattern and i won't get any issues because the timing or you know releasing because then you have that whole like double press problem so the right thumb is that macro layer switch key and the left thumb is just space but if you hold it down you get the meki which is fantastic for using the keyboard micro on a mac and gives you sort of so you hold that down and then you keep and switch to another application i use that as an application switches it's basically super fast to jump between applications on the mac with that meki on the thumb so obviously you're holding down the thumb keyboard this looks like a great program this this almost makes it look like mac is is is potentially able to be used again this is fantastic i like that because i i've all i just i hate this idea that you have to like think about what program you want you know what i mean i hate that idea it's one of the biggest reasons why i'll stay on i i just need a good window manager i never want to have to think about something i just want something to be here if i want to code i just want to be here i just want to be coding i just want to be right here and when i'm done coding if i want to go back to my browser i just want to go back to my browser i hate this idea of like thinking where people actually look you know where people actually have to like scroll through stuff oh good all time you just press alt tab you just press alt tab and then tap tap you just press all tap tap tap and then when you get into like a cycle and there's like three of them you just do the double tap i'll double tap i'll double tap i'll double that seems shitty i used another layout basically the sort of panic mode to get back to layer one if you're if you use one of the toggles and you're a permanently in one of the other layers so you can hold that down and it won't output any characters and you know when you release it you're always back in the layer one if you're already in layer one all you've done is just push the mac key which doesn't do anything by itself so yeah that's a really handy little setup for the left thumb i find so in the 16 kilo i've come up with this system layer and taken that a bit further than having any other layout and this is yes papa os's window manager is just like that that's why i can't do it it's why i don't use it at all really really fun really fast really great for working with the mac so with a three key combo i can switch into the system layer and it stays in that layer then so i can be mousing with one hand and i can have the right hand on the right half of the keyboard where most of the system magic happens so i can actually be mousing with my left hand which is good because i want to try and alternate i'm using the trackpad but i want to try and alternate the work between my hands a bit on the trackpad as well so i'm starting to use the trackpad with my left hand and actually clicking with a combo on the keyboard with the right and that really changes the feel of using a trackpad i think and that's a really good a good thing to do if you think that using the trackpad is causing kind of problems in your wrists and whatnot this is good we're mixing it up a little bit and changing the pan that your wrist is used to there so this is like the ultimate driving towards like preventing wrist pain that's actually i mean if you have to use the trackpad a bunch this is pretty cool i know that there's some things that you just have to any sort of you know some some you know i'm just saying there's some things you have to right like what i make in a box art i have to use the old i have to use the old mouse right you can't just be you can't just be using you know what i mean this is this is this is i mean i love this idea in the system there on the right hand they've then got arrow keys and a command key on your thumb so you can do arrows and thumb and you can also do alt with your left hand as well you can navigate the cursor in text very quickly in this layer now i've got some interesting things that happen when you hold down a finger on those arrow keys and the other keys in this layer so copy and paste for example tap is a copy and then hold it down is paste and that means you can you know sort of select text copy and paste and then you can also switch applications just with the right hand here as well so you've got the command key obviously with the thumbs to hold that down and then you can hold down the key above that with your index finger which is tab and that will then give you the application switcher where you can navigate that using the arrow keys and then release the switch into it i've actually just added a q key for quitting those through that as well so all that can be done with just the right hand which is brilliant because it means you can do things like use the trackpad to select a bit of text to switch applications copy and paste this if you're doing a sort of copy and pasting stuff from a document into a form or something it makes that kind of workflow really really really good so one of the key ways the 60s i i really like like i love this idea i i'm not going to lie to you i love this idea this is such a cool idea to be able to have like to be able to click a mode especially like due to me using dvorak one of the huge problems i had with dvorak is that like to copy is this right control c right c is over here so it's a two-handed operation control v v over here right so that's like a whole and then x is over here right so that's kind of like this whole it's like a two-hand requirement maybe i need to add something like way down here some sort of page end where i can pop okay i don't even i i guess i pressed it maybe that's next okay that is next i didn't realize that anyways you can pop that pop and it will this is disgusting anyways you can pop it and it will go into like one hand mode i like this idea i like this idea i may have to start exploring with that idea of just like one hand mode where i can just start like ctrl c you know control cvx all that kind of stuff right right in here and then pop it back out i like that idea it's like that's a really good idea i like i liked that video we were watching and now i've officially lost it so i guess it is time it is time to be done with this video i i i didn't mean to thank you i ben ben valik i appreciate that really technically deep video loved it the name it's the prime machine
