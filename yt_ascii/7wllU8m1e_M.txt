ladies and gentlemen how many of you have recently played a brilliant game of chess now for the 36 of you that answered that question truthfully please add me to your group today's video will feature a game that i played yesterday while live streaming and i got two brilliant moves and a 94 accuracy from chess.com i played so well that chest.com thought i was 3200 elo this video will be split into two parts first i'm going to show you the live footage of the game including a fantastic insane calculation that i did at the end and then we will actually analyze it move by move now there's a lot you can learn from this game so i hope this video entertains you and educates you and also i just want to show off let's go yes personally i think middle games master class is one of the best courses if not the best course ever made for intermediate players at least like for the middle game i i mean i really i like very firmly believe that and it's it's sibling courses coming out soon and games master class i think endgame's masterclass is also like magnum opus like it's so good and we're gonna sell a bundle for those two and it's gonna be lit i mean we oh and game course is coming out soon it's not out yet i think we have a lot of useful pressure here in fact i would go as far as to say that we are nearly winning in this position i think 50 middle games is like one of the best courses oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh that's a good move that's like one of the only ways to survive i think okay i gotta bring my rook this move does nothing by the way which is kind of a nice plus can i like i i'm desperately trying to sacrifice something here oh my opponent can't actually move wait that's really funny hold on they can't actually castle because i take [laughter] oh this is incredible look at this they just can't move because because of the pressure okay now do we just bludgeon them to death with like 95 yeah i think this is the right way to go and now d4 and you have to strike before the opponent is able to consolidate now we're gonna take and now that's hanging yeah i made two very useful moves rook c8 and castles and just get boring if you play it every day no yes but no because i'm so good my wife and i had a big philosophical debate about this because a lot of the times in interviews i get asked like what is it about chess you know like why like how you know how do you keep finding you know interest in chess and all this stuff by the way i think this move works because i think despite being a piece down i have so much pressure i'm threatening knight d3 i'm threatening rook d2 if queenie forum three i'm thinking this this this this this queen b2 oh my god the this this might be one of the greatest games i ever play like the i i'm king okay okay rook t2 king d2 bishop c3 pawn c3 queen c3 king e2 queen b2 king e3 rook c3 king there queen f2 king here queen f6 king here queen d8 king there or i can play i can play rook c5 okay my point is it's winning i didn't exactly see it but it's there for sure so the thing is when you get that deep into a position you probably have something if the king is on the other side of the board now i think my opponent's gonna spoil all of that and play like this but then i have this so it's still going to be really brutal and i'm still gonna hunt the king into the center of the board and the thing is when the king is like you know being used as a pinata okay so my opponent definitely missed this and there it is oh my god this is incredible look at this it's happening i found it i found the winning idea first of all i can just play rook c4 but i'm going for mate we have two king e5 queen f6 king there queen d8 the only move is to go back queen c7 i found it oh my god oh my god here here here here here here i can pre-move it oh my god oh my god oh my god oh oh oh oh oh oh my opponent plays the move e4 and i respond with c6 this is the only opening that i know and therefore i play it i'm joking but it's definitely the opening that i know best by far now my opponent plays the two knights variation so in every game of chess that you play you've got to understand how to analyze and what to analyze alright so pay attention give me about i think this analysis will be anywhere between five and seven minutes and i'm hoping to give you several nuggets of information to take away so the first thing you do in every opening is you set a checkpoint for where your knowledge of the opening concluded okay that will help you gauge how well you know your opening and also how well you know how to punish bad opponent moves and whether not just you whether you not just remembering the opening but understanding the ideas okay so my opponent plays knight f3 and a two nights carlcom that's checkpoint number one my opponent is playing this variation so now it's up to me to choose there's a lot of lines here there's capturing there's the immediate bishop g4 there's various g6s i play them all i mean there's knight f6 so here i played a6 now this is kind of like a sneaky little line i like to play it's a waiting move and it's a waiting move because you actually want white to play d4 you see the main line traditionally is this but white doesn't actually have to put the pawn in the center so a6 is just waiting like i'm just sitting there relaxing i am not rushing i am seeing what is going to happen so here my opponent plays the move d4 and now i play bishop g4 so so far so good i have had this position on the board probably about a hundred something times and sometimes they play h3 sometimes they play ed or e5 or bishop e2 so so far so good my opponent does in fact attack by bishop and my bishop went there to perish because actually if i try to be cheeky and cute i can actually get kicked out and this position is very good for white so i capture and i basically just set up a brick wall on the light squares i no longer have a light squared bishop so i have a light square brick wall sometimes i would like to put my bishop there but basically now i am looking at what my opponent wants and in this position probably the best thing for my opponent to do is just to do nothing like i have had opponents that just develop develop castle they leave the pawn here because neither option is very appealing for white if you capture on d5 you've lost your center control and i'm i'm happy i mean you've given me more space to develop not all trades are the same in chess right now my pawns are kind of in the way right so my opponent plays bishop e3 which is a great move i developed and now the best move is just simply to go bishop d3 and castle and the best move for me here is to take like at some point i have to take i i have to clarify the center i have to go here and essentially i just have a very slightly worse position i can play knight d5 but i mean i'm not gonna get like some crazy winning chances all right something like this can happen rookie one castle and like this is the position from the opening but my opponent plays e5 and e5 is wrong e5 is a fundamentally bad move and the reason for that is the fact that it completely deadlocks the center of the board okay so the center is now completely frozen and this pawn is attacking my knight on f6 but my knight goes back and these pawns are just sitting ducks with one pawn move my opponent has blocked the bishop's activity blocked the knight from having any pressure whatsoever and now i control the pawn brakes in the position with the move c5 and f6 f6 is a backup plan really this is the problem because that move will pressure this and allow knight c6 which that therefore pressures that my brick wall of light squared pawns is not going anywhere my opponent here sees that coming and for that reason plays knight to e2 it's a keen move this is a good move knight e2 and a lot of people don't play this move they just try to develop their pieces with like bishop d3 and then i play c5 and you know they get into some serious trouble so knight fd7 back knight to e2 and there we go but here's the thing all these pieces have departed from the queen side which means this area of the board is a little soft and after i develop my pieces i think i'm going to go exploit that side of the board i can actually start taking you see yes i can just play slowly and my opponent can just play slowly and then i can castle and then i can castle and like life is good but it's not you see the the more time i spend doing nothing the higher the evaluation grows it to my opponent's favor which is really not a good thing so after the move g3 i decided wait a minute i'm pretty sure i can go exploit this side of the board and open the floodgates open the door for my pieces and so i played queen a5 now i could have also played the move queen to b6 like this but i didn't like that move because i actually caught my opponent could castle and it looks like i'm right there but i'm not i'm not just simple king b1 and not a whole lot is happening so i played queen a5 which pins the pawn to the king and activates pawn takes d4 if my opponent just plays this i chop there is no way to defend the pawn in the center with the pawn and if bishop d4 i'm gonna win a pawn i'm just gonna be up a clean pawn okay so i played queen a5 my opponent dropped back and here i was like all right that's pretty smart the computer here doesn't like the approach that i took now the computer wants me to utilize the lack of defense from my opponent's center and go back to b6 a moment ago i just said queen b6 is bad because my opponent can cast muscle but after the move queen a5 bishop d2 that's no longer defended so queen a5 bishop d2 there is no queen side castling because when it's all said and done i win a pawn and probably i win a second one so i took i didn't play queen b6 and i did this and i thought this is very logical i am making progress in the position i'm applying some pressure and i'm i'm just being a menace and being being a menace is a is a good thing in chess it's a bad thing you know day-to-day life but overall it's really you know it's really not a bad thing and so in this position my opponent played the move queen e3 i brought my rook and i realized that i don't need to trade because if i trade pieces the exchanges in this position only benefit white now you might say well you might say well why can't castle and i might say yeah but so what see that's that's the thing in chess you can't just say oh well why can't castle you know as you get better you need concrete evidence something is bad you can't just say well you can't castle you know it must be no right now actually the pressure that i'm applying to white's position supersedes the lack of castling if the trades were to occur so that i realized that my opponent cannot castle because of the bishop and my opponent certainly cannot play the move bishop b4 because i go here and i'm threatening a fork and i'm threatening discovered check so they went knight c3 now at this point why does it move away from being fine why does a move away from being totally okay what does that mean well let's say i play something like pawn to f6 pawn takes rook takes castles that's it white is fine so seeing that i didn't get discouraged i thought i've got good eyes on the center got good eyes over here and the rook and a lot of the times when you have a lead in development in the opening and you're castled and your pieces coordinate well tactics are abound you always need to look for checks captures and attacks taking this is completely nuts because this move attacks my queen and then castling but taking this is bad news for white because of pawn to d4 and white doesn't get settled so pawn takes e5 d4 i've sacrificed the knight for a pawn however i'm going to get the knight back so for example queen e2 i'm just going to take on c3 and then i'm gonna take again and i'm just winning i'm gonna win all the pieces i thought okay i'm gonna win the game my opponent goes queen d3 now at this moment another idea dawned on me and this was probably completely unnecessary but sometimes if you do unnecessary things great things can happen especially in chess and i thought okay i can just take my knight back i can take my return on investment b takes and then i thought well knight e5 and and what i failed to realize is this is like death to the white position like white is dead because you would tag the queen you pick this up and at the end of the day you don't take with the queen this that you don't need to do this you can just play rook c3 and white's king is brutalized this whole game is essentially decided by the fact that my opponent was a step behind me in the development all right so knight takes e5 is what i played instead i could have just played it simple play pawn take c3 but i realized that i can get a little bit more fun and exotic by playing this move not the best move and sometimes it's absolutely fine to take back your return on investment right away all right knight takes e5 d4 take the knight brutalize down the but i did this and now queen d4 and i'm this isn't this is instructive all right right now black is down two points of material but essentially black is down a bishop for a pawn that is a fatal disadvantage like black is lost but in chess the two most important things are material and king safety and so in this position my opponent's king is stuck in the center how do i get to the king none of this works none of this works but i use the queen as a target to find an anchor on d3 and if my opponent plays here i utilize these pieces and i can play knight d3 but also i have knight c4 it's very important to look for maximum danger when you are down material and rook d8 i saw rook d8 and i thought well i'm winning because i'm gonna play knight d3 checking knight d3 check i can take this and take this and then here i played one of the greatest tactical sequences i think i've ever played in my life i played a rook sacrifice which got me a brilliant move and then i performed like a 10 move king hunt that ended with a walk of shame to the center of the board this was amazing the way i even thought of this move is you've always got a look at pieces you can capture that are protected by a king for example yes i see this and for the record this is still good for black it's just not as good but this is only guarded by the king and the king is gonna walk out into a defense that he simply cannot sustain so i calculated this this and bishop c3 now my opponent doesn't have to take the rug but well if they don't then i'm just gonna take everything else and they don't have to take my bishop but if they don't i'm just gonna take and get in with my queen so it's important that you don't just play hope chess like right now in this position the best move for my opponent is not to take it's to go here now luckily for me i am still completely winning and it's not even close but in chess you cannot play hope chess it's not checkers okay so after rook takes d2 king takes d2 which is not the best move i played bishop takes c3 and what i had calculated was if something like king e2 is played i'm gonna give some checks and i'm gonna win but the hardest thing to calculate here is take take take king e2 by far because mentally there is no move here that wins for black you can't give a check you can't give a check you can't give those checks because the queen takes in white is trade in queens and i realized queen b2 check forces the king forward so from a from a distance away i noticed the king cannot go back because i'll take the rook queen b2 the king goes back i take the rook okay now when the king goes forward i bring help the king now has only two ways to go if you walk into my queen i have mainten one which is very nice and here i realized my knight is hanging but i don't need to defend my knight i can use my queen and i can play queen takes f2 and i just figured if the king walks out here i have made that's just what i thought i thought if the king makes it out there i have checkmate and if i don't then i don't understand anything about chess and i thought you know what as a backup plan as a backup plan i'll win the queen okay queen f2 and originally my idea had been this this and check and rook c5 and maybe try to and i realized queen c7 cutting off the escape sending the king into the center of the board queen c5 mate this one felt nice and i wanted to share it with you and i think there's a lot of instructional stuff here positional stuff like how to replace light squared pawns when a light squared bishop is gone pawn play in the center and which trades come at what moment and how to take advantage of an opponent that has weakened a certain side of a board and understanding the role of time in a game of chess when to strike when to make preparatory and just sort of long-term beneficial moves and i think we put all of that together and i won a very nice game i hope you enjoyed now get out of here
