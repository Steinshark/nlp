all right people git roll ai that looks at github profiles instead of doing an interview okay okay okay this seems i can already immediately tell you this sounds awful this github tool is much more useful than giving a cv i can't even scroll okay i'm back we're back apparently apparently reddit just wanted to like i don't know what reddit was doing there this github tool is much more useful than giving a cv okay i'll just open that up this github tool is a game changer get roll helps you analyze github profiles saving you heaps of time as an interviewer instead of tedious task of scrolling through someone github's profiles git roll does the hard work for you providing an in-depth look at the candidat skills in no time flat a deep dive into code quality this features a dream come true for a tech geeks like myself get roll doesn't spot let's see get roll doesn't just spot potential bugs or vulnerabilities it also appre appreciates the beautiful the beauty of tasteful code i wonder if d daniel stenberg has any thoughts the guy you know remember the guy that created curl i wonder if he has any thoughts about how llms are really good at spotting security security floss remember remember that whole problem that security is happening right now where there's just a non-stop flow of really terrible really awful security reports being reported over and over and over again and then even when the person goes hey this isn't real what are you doing they go certainly and then they just start hallucinating code you know what i can't wait you know what like i'm the most excited about i think ever is that i would love to make sure that the next time i get hired somewhere i get an ai to deep dive my profile because that would be good ai is good at summarizing i feel i feel you're wrong i think sometimes ais are good at summarizing would you put your job on the line on an ai summarizing the tastefulness of your code would you want would you would you want an interview to be to be put on that yeah the answer should be no the answer should genuinely be no here it's like having a somalia for code for those that don't know like a somalia is a is is a is like a very fancy person that that has this special genetic gift that can actually taste the differences in wine like i can't taste differences in wine i can tell when wines are taste better and worse okay i'm not a like i am not a somalia you know what i mean i'm just not accessing a coder skill get roll evaluates a coder skills based on their repositories giving more weight to recent work this way you can easily gauge the candidate's skill which makes preparing for an interview a breeze insights into language pro proficiency and open source contributions okay so there is one thing i will say that an ai could be good at okay let me hey you know what i i'm willing to not have a full doomer doomer look at this stuff if this could only be used if i had five minutes before an interview and i wanted to find a couple things to talk about if i could have some ai be like okay here's the gto profile give me a few things to talk about i would do that evaluate mine oh we will evaluate mine okay we're going to evaluate mine hard okay the problem is is that this won't be used but that's what's bad about that hit me with why you can't say that that's already bad if you are given a candidate to interview that day and you just wanted the and you're there to just save time what's wrong with saying hey give me a give me a summation summarizing really quick of what what they've worked on recently so i can just talk to them about things so if you're an unprepared interview you're always an under you're always an unprepared interviewer a proper interviewer should know as little about their candidate as possible the more you know the more you already project i would not like to look at someone's code that i'm interviewing i'm going to most certainly judge the [ __ ] out of them i and the thing is is you could show me you could show me my own code from 6 months ago and i wouldn't like them okay okay just saying i don't know if it's really great interview in 10 minutes can you be there yeah my boss yes i've had i've had very i've had versions of this myself and that's fine that's why i would ask him about that hey okay i think your github profile has this this and this but you're unemployed i unemployed now thanks tj tech technically tj i'm not unemployed right now so suck on that insight into the language proficiency and open source contribution i think this is just crazy git roll gives you a peak into the coder's familiarity with different programming languages and their contributions to open source projects for example it noticed my contribution to facebook research pytorch 3d okay well let's find out about this dystopian tool all right here we go all right so how do i how how do how do i do this all right let me just turn this off for a quick second let me just see my let let's just see me let me just have all of my stuff taken all right read personal data email addresses and profile information only read only okay at least it doesn't have an excessive amount of stuff by the way this man this man literally has charlie the unicorn right here okay so how do i see mine my get roll dude i'm talks dude i'm top x per in my region top x per in my school let's go let's go apparently i've just let you know i just let you know some things i'm i'm obviously number one in security and maintainability and reliability really poor in influence if you go to global github follower rankings you will notice that i believe i'm 43 or 42 we just checked this like yesterday cuz so because someone asked me cuz i still am just waiting for somebody to tell me what the point of followers are there you go i'm 41 let's go killing and i'm on the ninth ring of him ceo of the startup so there you go so apparently my influence is just not that good i'm still not good enough to have any influence but damn influence is my worst one damn behind ben aad yeah i know anyways maintainability writes clean easily readable and maintainable code tj hey tj how does that feel my best quality is maintainable code and yet it doesn't even know that i rage program on live on on stream where i effectively ejaculate streams of thoughts into code think about that think about that this a dude influence issue this ai is so off this ai is off this ai is terrible i'm above 98% of people let's go let's go can you rate gatan i wonder what gatan has okay i you know you know i'm pretty much dude isn't reading the graph right what am i reading right what what am i not reading right the white is for average okay well then what's my scores oh my influence oh damn you're right yeah my influence holds authority oh yeah oh hell yeah dude i am awesome i got influence like nobody's business hell yeah dude look at that yeah you'll suck it yeah oh the dark gray line oh i can't even read that yeah i am reading the gra i'm reading the graph all wrong here oh gosh hell yeah okay you know what you know what i can tell i can tell right away that this is completely wrong you know how can can you tell why this is completely wrong can anyone here name one thing that's completely wrong about this graph the primagen can that's why no no not because of that sentence are you ready for it are are you ready for it yep i see the two i see people spotting it right now security apparently the average person committing to github writes some pretty secure code they also write really reliable code and they're mostly maintainable i hate to tell you this no no's the answer okay no is the the answer even more reason to make my lab repo private this is so wr this number should be inverted in slightly out the other direction okay like what how was that even possible okay i i definitely don't write secure code okay like i have i'm under no illusions that i am somehow super secure that everything i do is really well thought through like security is really hard it is a vertical onto itself and if you think you can just write secure code you're a dumb dumb right you are a dumb dumb okay okay but it also said hold on it also said that it can tell me uh it can it can tell me how tasteful my code is where's my tasteful ranking i want to see dude i'm s here by the way boys boys we're s here where's my tasteful ranking overview languages oh yeah the [ __ ] is read script a lot of javascript some typescript go rust cake lua zigg elixir what the hell is rescript text stacks front end ui development nextjs really that much nextjs well i didn't realize i did that much nextjs boys this is actually this is actually news to me that that i'm a rescript nextjs person i didn't even know that as someone who's used nextjs once because theo showed it to me ui testing okay more just yeah i mean okay react css styling this fair websockets i wrote web i have a websocket protocol okay restful just mocha chai bootstrap okay back in what do i got nextjs again i am shocked at how much nextjs i do websocket express app development restful just api development okay microservice designs okay scaling monitor and logging embedded systems iot cloud platforms what when when have i ever done iot cloud platforms what does this even mean microcontroller okay that's that's that's at least somewhat reasonable devops log analysis pino grunt this just shows how long i've been programming for okay this is really just a better indication that i've been doing too much stuff right machine learning unsupervised learning hell yeah supervised learning hell yeah reproducibility hell yeah mobile apps okay wow so i would just generally say that this is i would i would probably give this as 90% wrong all right what are my suppositories what do i got what's my top one c machine okay i mean people really like that one the these are all fem ones yeah these are all front and masters yeah yeah these are all front and masters ones okay cool i don't know what this is this must be something that's going on with front end masters i don't know what's going on there okay anyways this is largely inaccurate this is actually a horrible tool get roll is genuinely if if this what we just got done reading here versus what we just got done seeing i would say that this is an an absolute l not even like a sort of l not even a kind of l like we're talking like an l's l okay like for the last 2 to three years i have done nothing but pretty much make cli tools vim stuff any of that on my open source stuff and and a websocket protocol right and so for them like if this is the if this is the result this is crazy i think i might even have a partial implementation of http2 out in public out in public source this is just wild this is just wildly inaccurate this is wildly inaccurate and writing this is nothing charlie this is a shame 10 hours ago a shame yo yo this this ai stuff this ai stuff got to cool down man like i'm all for good ai tools okay i think a ai on the cli could be very well could be something pretty interesting i'm curious about it i'm actually pretty excited about that co-pilot on the cli could be really good i might just be able to use i might just be able to use ffm peg i might just be able to do it co-pilot itself again i'm still really skeptical of it i've had it off now for a little bit i'm happy i actually have it off i'm going to reenable it again i'm going to go back and forth i think chad gpt as a method for explaining new concepts and stuff could very well be a very powerful way to learn i do think this idea of ai assisted learning is actually a really cool concept but it has to be accurate but this idea of ai assisted assessments is nuts it's off it's way off because the problem comes i mean the problem with any of the ai stuff comes down to the white problem which is can you produce me an image that is pure white pure black pure yellow pure anything right and the thing is is that it can't it struggles a whole bunch because when you say produce me an image of a crab we think that ai is just effing magic or produce me a program that reads out a file and does a mat plot lib x and y it is absolutely right people are just like oh my goodness this is absolutely incredible but the reality is is that there's many many programs that fit that mold and the reason why it's not incredible is because it's not doing something specific it's just generalizing and it just happens to fit the problem space because when you ask it to produce a pure white image it's struggles because pier white is an exact answer there's one answer which is all all fs you can't have anything else and it struggles to do that because once you give it an exact thing to do it's really hard for it to do correctly and that's the big difference that really sums it up yeah and that's why i think people don't understand the difference uh between this which is give me an image of a crab there's infinite crabs give me an exact thing struggles a ton because an exact thing is always different like the absolutely no elephants example i have not seen the absolutely no elephants example but that's hilarious right i'm not saying that llms are going to be bad or good in the future i'm just saying that they're they're very hard to get right cu when you're looking for an exact answer that's hard that's really hard the name is this was genuinely the worst tool i have ever seen this is the worst thing i've ever seen we really really really as as like i rarely say as a whatever whatever you call this amalgamation of programmers hobbyist enthusiasts and traditional learning people whatever you call all that put together whatever that is we need to agree that using ai to filter is just going to be horribly bad it's it's not going to end well it's going to be an absolute 100% disaster and i also am an expert in next jen based on what the ai have said of course
