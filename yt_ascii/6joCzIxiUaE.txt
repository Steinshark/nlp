[music] sup guys mkbhd here welcome back to january so last year we did this thing where i did a q&a video every month one video every month that's 12 q&a is during the year and we kind of got into a rhythm and i feel like it was a good idea we introduced a couple different concepts and overall i enjoyed it so we're doing it again this year for 2018 i'm getting the year right this time so i already asked you guys on twitter what you guys wanted to know so without any further ado let's let's get into it we got a special guest tesla model 3 oh and austin evans here so we'll just go ahead and tag-team this one let the car answer the question let's get started what's a trend you do not want to see in tech and 2018 don't want to see the easy answer that i think a lot of people would give is headphone jacks going away stop oh yeah broccoli it's already over ya have phone jacks pretty much dead at this point that battle has been lost i think a lot of people don't like to hear that but we still need to see a wireless technology get better i talked about that in my last video oh yeah the airplane video that was great yeah so i don't know i i kind of just i like the way a lot of things are going right now now daniel wants to know same question but the opposite what's the trend that you do want to see in 2018 i feel like i want to see smartphones continue to get better and more importantly cheaper i think that we're getting to a point where $100 can get you a surprisingly decent phone especially we get to like two or three hundred bucks i mean the gap between a budget phone it's more like a flagship is shrinking every year and i like to see that that's a legit trend this year we have an abundance of less expensive phones oh my got another model three that's crazy look at one place on earth where model threes you never expect that i'd like to see a better usage of dual cameras maybe play with focal lengths a little more yeah i feel like right now most of the time a dual cameras like oh it's monochrome or it's like oh it's gonna give you like some death data but like you said the pixel kind of does a lot of that stuff better already just like what's the point of adding a second camera unless it's doing something meaningfully different i don't know who i'm quoting but i know at one point a youtuber has told me i don't think anyone knows what the hell they're doing with dual cameras that sounds like a quote i can believe that not normal tech related and this is true if you could replace any body part with a cybernetic replacement what would you choose and why so this guy's fishing for a very specific oh yeah yeah yeah do you know who we are what's your highest killcount pub gee i don't like bleep up geez like one yeah i think my answer is the same only the second time i played i'd survived down to like top 45 top 43 respect and i found someone that i want to go shoot and i had a gun that i knew nothing about and i just pointed and squeezed a bunch of times but it had this recoil thing going on oh yeah every time you shoot your aim just goes further and further up but i didn't let it go back down seems like i am squeezed and ended up firing a lot of bullets into the sky and i'm just like what's video doing pawel yeah i died pretty quick there that's a good story yeah what what health tracking apps are you using i'm not really using many apps for that what i try to do and i'm even wearing it but i try to close all the rings on my apple watch every single day which i lowered my goals to i don't even know it's like half of what it was supposed to be but i'd do it if you want to answer feel free to go through the tweets dig through and find any good ones i have another one with a weird rumor that came up what are your thoughts on the rumors about iphone 10 being discontinued i heard rumors and i don't i don't trust it i don't i'll believe it when i see it but there's a rumor that iphone 10 as a series has come and gone and it's not gonna be a thing anymore we'll go back to when they say that they mean like you know at the end of september or whatever when they bring out the iphone 11 or whatever the next one would be they were just completely discontinued the ten right well that makes sense to some degree because they pretty much always take the flagship phone and they bump it down in praise but they'd have to bump into ten down a lot in praise so i can see them just basically clearing them out putting the 11 and doing something like the lower-cost version because it's hard to imagine this foam being like 500 bucks i'll be honest i read the headlines and i didn't consider any logistical possibility of it happening so i'll read into them more but that's something new that's on my radar so we'll see all right one okay should i will bring back the 17-inch macbook pro if they do do you think they'd stick with amd graphics or nvidia something like a max q 1070 just the general question i would love to see another 17-inch macbook pro i do a lot of mobile video editing times like this when we're out here la times like ces times like mobile world congress in a month where i'm bringing a lot of heavy footage and it chokes my macbook pro every time do you think you would see a significant performance increase with a 17 because i'm thinking of like laptop processors and i mean the 15 already has about as good as it gets on the laptop side unless you look crazy like a desktop which is gonna like eat through the battery do you think you'll be legitimately faster he thinks more there's nothing like on the graphic snyder so i do think the gpu is what you'd get the most out of having that extra space with the battery could be a bit bigger but thermally you can just do more with the gpu with more space that's pretty clear so yeah and apple would never do this but i would love to see them unashamedly just make a thick just video editing look at a screen 3 delta pro it's never gonna happen but i'd love to see that ok this is one i don't think you're gonna be able to answer when i try it anyway what do you think of black mirror have you ever watched the netflix original series now black mirror i have never watched black mirror i have a netflix account and it has probably logged three total hours in its existence hello people don't believe me when i say that but i watch a lot of youtube yeah so i'm aware of the concept that i understand when people reference black mirror which is weird but i've never watched it i would actually say that you would play enjoy black man yeah i would i would venture guess that it's a very futuristic show it's about how technology is gonna ruin everyone's lives oh you're entertaining who do you think will be first samsung apple google etc to implement the on-screen fingerprint sensor okay so i guess the first of the big the big dawgs big mainstream phone makers i would okay so i would expect samsung samsung tends to be the first they were you know they they pushed the boundaries with things like the iris scanner you know they try new stuff so yeah samsung i think would be my thing like the note like nine or something no nine note ten i mean galaxy s nine is coming out and i think that's a little early to see it yeah i think that would be interesting what are the key iphone and mac apps that you rely on and how has that changed over the last 12 months oh for sure one that comes recently to mind twitter for mac trash okay oh i've used it but i use it for years i now use tweetbot on all my ios and and mac's but i couldn't like if you've ever tried to use tweetbot for mac for more than five minutes in your twitter format twitter from a cow it slows to a crash thank you for correcting me yeah let's agree on that section tweet vitals awesome but yeah i have a pretty study workflow across my it's a final cut editing suite it's it's spotify for music safari so yeah that's pretty much my exact setup i think photoshop is thrown in there sometimes but for the most part yeah it's pretty much final cut twitter safari chrome spotify like that's kind of yeah for that up the core suite yeah now let's change for me lately it's one you may or may i want answer okay do you have a tesla referral code why mark is i would love to buy a tesla would you ever have a referral code so i could do you can't get anything for that or now i do so funny story i do have a tesla furro code i've never really shared it i have a couple friends who have bought a car and so they wanted to have her referral code and when you use a referral code to buy a tesla you get free supercharging on your car for life so it is worth something i'll put it in the description i don't usually share it but well you do get out of that as a referrer is every new referral for me and the tier i'm in right now is 2% off my final payment on the roads oh so basically if enough people click the link in the description and sign up with your referral code gately a lot of money off your roadster it's not gonna happen but your 2% for roadster that's a lot of money if you do the math it's worth it yeah like 2% so yeah up to literally 100 percent off i think i think one tesla based youtuber i'll confirm with him but he has already earned a free roadster was regrettable yeah that's crazy okay you know what that's a good question someone says what are your thoughts on the new hasselblad i tweeted it earlier there's a new hasselblad h 6d i'm gonna get this wrong h 6d 400 c m/m/c it's a long name but essentially it's a hundred megapixel sensor that's using a multi shot so i think that's m s that's taking 400 megapixel stills at this point so normal stills are 100 mega pixels you can you take multiple shots to combine them it's combining them all with like a one pixel difference shifting in each direction it's an insane technology but if i'm printing billboards that's something i'm into but i'm not so i'll stick with stick with the camera i use now it's like a normal hasselblad yeah just you know x1d is cool no big deal i think you may be answer this one before if you didn't have youtube where do you think you would be right now yeah i never know i never know the answer i'll stop back at you because i like have been making videos for such a long part of my life yeah that i mean i assumed i would do something related to my major in college which was business but i think the same boat there because i think we started me like what 1516 sometime so i think for me i would probably be working at best buy that was my backup plan if youtube didn't work okay i can just go get a job at best buy and i'll have this awesome resume of some cool tech videos on youtube yeah but it's it's hard to imagine doing something else at this point it really is it's weird to think about what no this is i think you'll definitely have a good answer for this one what's your favorite music album cuz i guess you probably i know what your guess is already do your guesses ram by - yes and that is definitely a top three boy oh there's some albums i like to listen to in there completion okay that have a lot of replay value so i'll give the time i'll just i already know the incredible true story by logic i don't necessarily listen to individual songs on that album as much as i just listen to the whole thing about you favorite album okay yeah no that's that's an easy one i think ram is probably my top 5 but incredible true story i've listened to so many times like every year when i go to my spotify you're in a wine flight people like fadeaways like i was like number one you know it's weird though okay so and i didn't even remember this but when i go back in that spotify year and rewind for the past two at least maybe three years my number one artist is always kanye and i didn't realize how many years of kanye albums i've listened to from like college dropout to graduation that whole time it's not really that much new kanye but there's a lot so i'll throw i'll toss graduation in there for i can get behind that except there's a lot of kanye that i think would be on like my top ten yeah when was the last time a tech item blew your mind blew my mind i actually blew your mind my answer is in the frame right now yeah auto pilot not necessarily like the actual car but there is something weird about when you're driving being able to actually take your hands off the wheel and actually do something else i was messed with my parents in this picked them up from the airport during a holiday and my sister was in on it but she's like hey can't grab some from the backseat and i'm an auto pilot i just kind of casually reached back and the cars and they're in the backseat like what is he doing hilarious i'm definitely gonna do some more some more tesla videos and you'll see model three video coming very soon forgot to hold mention that whole thing but that's coming coming pretty quick so auto pilots on my list what do you got you know i can't think of a better answer than that i was probably gonna say something dumb but like honestly autopilot you're right it's like such a crazy sort of feature because you think how much time do you spend driving and it's just like you hit a button she's like oh yeah the cars you can do this for me it's great this car the fact that this car is built on autonomous ride-sharing should say something about the way car tech has gone in the future so i'll leave it at that thank you for participating in my q&a hopefully you guys enjoy the questions and the answers i thought they were pretty solid but stay tuned of course for the tesla video and for many more things to come the q&a is every month that's over on twitter if you're not already following follow this guy he makes youtube videos also and he makes he makes tweets sometimes very gonna read this thanks for watching talk to guys the next one peace
