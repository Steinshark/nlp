this is some mathematics by a guy who was missed by a lot of people and his name was hippocrates. but not the medic. lived at the same time, but this was hippocrates of chios, the island chios. the medic was hippocrates of kos. i think hippocrates the mathematician deserves an even bigger place in history and he was missed. and i'll explain one of the things he did. so this is called the mesolabe compass and what he did, he took two lines...at an angle. and you might say, but what angle ? it absolutely doesn't matter. but what you have to do is you have to be accurate in this, you're going to mark them off, like a ruler. and now you do the same here. it is now possible to multiply any two numbers, or divide, any two numbers just using lines. so say we want to multiply 34,692 by 3 - no, hang on, hang on. 3 times 4. what you do is you find 3 on this line and 1 on the bottom line. and you draw a line through it and it gives you a picture of one, three. now, this is well bc, long before christ, and they're talking about maths in pictures? wouldn't it be wonderful? so we've got one three but say we want four 3s. what you do is you find 1, 2, 3, 4, on the bottom line. and you need a set square. and what you do is you place the set square on that line, accurately. that it? yeah. and then you slide it along the ruler so it passes through the 4. and if i've done this right... (brady: so that's a parallel line?)
- that's a parallel line, they're both parallel. and this goes through the 12 and three 4s are 12. not only that, your parallel lines give you one 3, two 3s 6. three 3s is 9. four 3s 12. five 3s 15. isn't it beautiful? division! you reverse it! you want to divide 12 by 4? line through the 12 and the 4. parallel line through the 1 will give you the answer 3. it's as easy as that. and it works for any numbers! oh, you need big lines, but it's the principle, and the principle is so simple. no wonder the greeks didn't spend any time at all in numeracy. they were more interested in geometry, the shape of maths. this is the second idea from hippocrates of chios. and this is how to find the square root of any number. any number! wow! just using a few lines and a few curves. let's try. say you want to find the square root of 32 thou- umm.... no. 9 thank goodness. we know that one, don't we? okay, let's find it. okay, what you do is you produce a line and you mark it off, in centimetres - it's fine. that should be enough. we want the square root of 9. so starting from there you count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. now what you do now is you add 1. and you might say why? well 'cause that's what makes it work. so now you've got 10. so a line of 10 with 5 as centre, and 5 as radius you produce a semicircle. you can produce a complete circle if you like, it's entirely up to you. and now with a set square you raise the perpendicular from the 9. and where that line meets that point, that distance is the square root of 9, or in this case, 3 centimetres.
- (brady: so it's the length of that line?)
- the length of that line is three centimetres. exactly. but that would have worked for any number you like. and that would of course be in fractions, if it was not a square number. (brady: so if i had asked you to find the square root of a billion, you would have marked a billion and one as your - ) so it gets impractical because you've got a line with a billion unit, so it's impractical. but the theory works, and in practice it works, and i'll show you why. we can join that to that and you can see because the radius of the circle is 5 and we chose 9, that's got to be 4, and that's got to be 3 units. okay? and that's a 3, 4, 5 triangle, a famous pythagorean triangle. 5 squared, 25, equals 4 squared, 16, plus 3 squared, 9. but that wasn't the way this was discovered and that isn't what he used for the explanation. what i've got to do now is draw another one, very quickly. don't worry about the lines. now the inspiration of this is this. if we draw a line there, and if we draw a line across here, what you produce is two triangles. thales was the first known greek mathematician and he told you that in a semi-circle, any two lines from a here and b here. if they meet anywhere on that curve, then the angle they create will be a right angle. always. and that is so. when we look at these two triangles that angle there is equal to that angle there. that angle there equals that angle there, because the two of them add to a right angle. and that's a right angle, and those are right angles. so that means these two triangles are similar. they're a different size, but their size are always in the same proportion. so let's say for example that happened to be 6 units and that happened to be 3 units. if that was 3 units and that was 6, this would have to be 12. because 3 to 6 is as 6 is to 12. it's as simple as that. if this was 2, then it would be different. 2 to 6 is as 6 is to'? yeah, 2 into 6 is 3, three 6s are'. so if that was 2 and that was 6 that would have to be'. but if this was 1 unit, and that was 6 this would have to be six 6s, or 36. and the whole length, across there, would be 37. and that's why it works for any number. (brady: why does this link to square roots?)
- because you - going that way you're squaring so coming back you're square rooting. okay? and that's what you get. and that's where you get the square root and that works. now, these two ideas have been missed by many, many mathematicians in many, many history books. in many collections of mathematicians in history hippocrates of chios was missed! but he was seen by rene descartes. and descartes wrote a book called the geometry. and that is it in french and those are the two designs, okay? and that's in french and that's a translation in english from the world of mathematics - newman's world of mathematics - volume 1. and what descartes said, now do you see? understanding these as an introduction to geometry, he said if you understand a few angles, and a few lengths of lines, you can calculate absolutely anything! and he was wrong! because at his time we hadn't discovered calculus. and calculus was required to measure things that change, even as they change. but that was the kicker. and he and fermat started to look for ways of measuring things that even changed. and along came leibniz and isaac newton and he produced calculus. and from then you could measure anything using geometry. you know, when brilliant are good enough to sponsor one of our episodes i always love searching their site to see what they've got on the topic we just covered. and when it comes to square roots they have a lot of stuff, and i mean a lot of stuff. check it out people. this is all amazing, intriguing content because brilliant is a treasure trove of courses and quizzes and all sorts of stuff just like this. don't just sit there watching videos. the best way to learn, to get smarter, is to do stuff and brilliant's interactive website is, well, brilliant for just that. you can go check out brilliant without any commitment, but if you do want to sign on for a premium membership and unlock all the treasures they've got, go to brilliant.org/numberphile because that's going to get you 20% off. there's a link down in the description. check out brilliant and our thanks to them for supporting our numberphile videos.
