a few months ago i got an email from the sony repair shop saying that they were gonna scrap my fs7 mark ii for parts if i didn't pay five thousand dollars to replace nearly all the cameras internal electronics that i'd ruined with my own sweat [applause] [music] i'll get into that in just a minute the repair tech said even if i went ahead with the repairs they couldn't actually guarantee would ever work properly again and a quick check on facebook marketplace showed me that i likely wouldn't be able to sell the camera for much more than the cost of the repairs so i swallowed the lump in my throat and ignored the follow-up emails until one day they gave me a final warning pay the bill right now or will destroy the camera which i also ignored i can only assume the camera no longer exists other than as a pile of cannibalized parts in a warehouse somewhere but even though losing that money hurts big time overall i'm happy my camera got destroyed that fs7 saw me through the most important five years of my career as i went from shooting small news stories to high budget documentaries for clients like netflix national geographic and a bunch of others this camera literally paid my rent and put the food on the table for years and if i hadn't made the irresponsible decisions that eventually ruined it i'm not sure any of that would have happened but i'll explain what i mean by that in just a second in this video i'm going to talk about why i think abusing your gear might be the most important thing you do as a documentary filmmaker and why i can only hope that all my cameras in the future meet with the same kind of untimely end then i'll go into a few quick tips on what you can do to prevent that destruction from happening for as long as possible but in the end i hope your gear gets destroyed too and here's why hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsythe and on this channel i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer if you're into that kind of thing make sure to hit the subscribe button because i've got new videos coming out every week before i start let me give you the basic story of my fs7 how it helped me launch my career and how i eventually killed it with my own sweat it wasn't the first video camera i bought nor was it the last but it was the one that saw me through the most significant change in my professional life when i went from being a perpetually broke news videographer to a full-time documentary dp if you've been following this channel for a while you might know that before i got into documentary filmmaking i was a photojournalist based in phnom penh cambodia where i covered the asia-pacific region for newspapers like the new york times and worked for a bunch of international aid organizations like the united nations and the gates foundation eventually as the internet took over the media world i started to realize that video was going to be an important skill to learn if i wanted to stay competitive as a visual journalist so i got into the early days of hd slrs once i had a few short projects under my belt still mostly for news outlets and ngos i started to get more and more excited about the storytelling possibilities of video and i thought i might actually like to try and make some short films now dslrs had great image quality but their audio options and battery life sucked so eventually i invested in an fs7 mark 1 and started to advertise myself more and more as a video shooter instead of a photographer in the beginning i kept working in the world of journalism making shorts for people like the new york times or the washington post buzzfeed news vice but then one day out of nowhere i got a call to fill in as a b-cam shooter on a national geographic show about heroin production in mexico it was the first time i'd been part of a real film crew working with a real budget and i fell in love with it right away within a year i'd reworked my website and reoriented all my social media profiles to focus on video instead of still photos i built up my reel by shooting small independent projects around mexico using the fs5 and i beefed up my skill set by working as a b cam or a camera assistant on big international productions that came to mexico then i made trips to new york every six months or so and booked meetings with as many production managers and directors as would answer my emails and eventually more and more work came in after a year or so i started to get the first request to work as an acam shooter often as a unit dp who would go out and film scenes in mexico with the skeleton crew when it didn't make financial sense to fly in a whole team from another country when i didn't mess those up too badly i started getting hired as the director of photography and was brought onto projects from day one instead of just coming on as a part-time role player the only problem was that the fs5 great little camera that it was wasn't really beefy enough to be the acam on a multi-million dollar netflix shoot most of these shows wanted an fs7 or an f55 or a c300 something with a better codec and higher rates so every time i had a big job i had to rent one but eventually the volume of work got to the point where i was renting an fs7 for weeks or even months at a time and when i did the math i realized i'd be better off owning one myself and renting it out so i waited until a particularly big job came in a three-month feature dock about a sports team on the u.s mexico border and i bought a refurbished fs7 mark ii from b h by the end of that project i was able to pay off the camera completely from the rental fees and for the next three years or so i use that camera on pretty much every job i did around the world now the fs7 wasn't a particularly sexy camera it was a utilitarian tool it wasn't small and innovative like the black magic pocket cinema cameras it didn't have hollywood level image quality like the aries and it wasn't welcome on commercial sets like the red cameras it wasn't full frame it had a menu system and user interface that drove me insane and all the files were slightly green tinted and had to be tweaked in post it was no one's dream camera necessarily but it was an absolute workhorse and it just kept on going no matter what i threw at it and i threw a lot at it i used it in the rain and dust storms on boats on the beach inside caves on top of mountains hail snow deep in the jungle if it was crazy wet i dropped a backpack rain cover over top of it if it got especially dirty i'd clean it off at the end of the day with a paintbrush and a rocket blower but most of the time i just kept using it no matter what the conditions and for the most part it never complained but then in 2020 i went to kenya to film a bat documentary for vice because of the risk of disease and infections we all had to wear these full body suits whenever we went into the caves and those things were not at all breathable combine that with african heat and the humidity of a batcave and you can probably guess we were sweating a ton what i didn't realize was that i was sweating so much as i was shooting it was pooling in my sleeves and whenever i take the camera off my shoulder and carry it by the top handle the sweat was pouring out the cuffs and drenching the camera now obviously water and cameras are ancient enemies and now that i think about it it's actually pretty surprising that it made it as long as it did but after a full week of daily soakings the weather ceiling finally gave out and the camera shut off when i finally got back to canada i dried the camera out and took it to a local repair shop that said they cleaned up a bunch of internal corrosion and for a while the camera seemed like it worked then one day it lost power in the middle of an interview and no matter what i tried it just would not turn back on sent it back to the same repair shop and they replaced a couple more components and charged me a bunch of extra money for it but a month later it shut off again i realized that i couldn't really rely on it for professional work anymore so i sent it to sony for a full analysis and dug deep into my savings to buy a used fx9 which is the same a camera i currently have don't get me wrong the fx9 is a great camera and i'm glad i have it but i didn't really want to buy it and if the fs7 still worked i would have kept using that eventually i heard back from sony and as i said the quote for repairs was more or less the same as the camera was worth which brings us back full circle to where i started because i repeatedly ignored sony's emails i could only assume the camera is no more with any luck some of its components will go into another refurbished unit which some young filmmaker can buy at a discount to shoot their first documentary like i did years ago at first i was mad i planned to sell the fs7 for at least a few thousand dollars to offset the cost of the fx9 and learning that it was pretty much a write-off was not the news i wanted to hear but the more i thought about it the more i understood that if i hadn't destroyed that camera i wouldn't be where i am today if i hadn't ignored the camera safety in the name of using it to get the shots i needed i might not have delivered the kind of shots that kept clients coming back for their next projects if i hadn't used it in all those terrible conditions the footage i sent back might not have been up to client expectations there's a very real chance i wouldn't have gotten the second call without mounting it to cars or using it on dirt roads or hanging it off the sides of moving boats or any of the other stupid things i did with it i might never have convinced directors and producers that i was the kind of shooter they wanted on their dock crew i guess what i'm saying is that in the documentary world cameras are meant to be used it might be possible to keep things in pristine condition when you're working on a sound stage somewhere but if you want to make a living filming the real world you need to take your cameras into the real world and the real world isn't a particularly clean or sterile place in order to tell stories well you're going to have to put your camera or lenses or a drone or whatever into all sorts of compromising positions because i've never met a really good documentary dp who doesn't now even though i'm saying this i know that for most people myself included despite what it may seem like filmmaking gear is a huge investment and the thought of destroying it is terrifying in fact i know that for most people on the earth the thought of being able to afford one of these cameras at all is way beyond their financial realities and to even have this gear to risk in the first place is a very privileged position i'm not saying that you shouldn't take care of your gear or that you should just break and buy new things without carrying what i'm saying is that you should view your camera gear as tools to be used not trophies to keep on your shelf or safe inside a backpack to succeed in this business you need to get your gear out there and actually use it that's how you're going to get the best stories and the best shots not back in your office where everything is protected and part of the risk you take when you take cameras out into the world and all the crazy places in it is that it won't come back so i wish that my fs7 still worked because i'd be quite a bit richer if that was the case it sucks that it died and nothing will change that when i think of all the amazing shots and crazy stories i was able to get because of the fact that i didn't baby it i think i'd make the same decision again now with all that said there are a couple things i found that you can do to give your gear the best chance of survival the first is to get a rain cover while heavy rain might shut down a controlled set docks can't always sit around and wait for the rain to stop or sometimes the rain might even be an important part of your story and you have no choice but to get out in it for a long time i just used a backpack cover with elastic trim around it and draped it over the top and that sort of worked then finally i invested in a custom-built rain cover and if i could do it all over again i'd probably have done that much sooner mine is from a company called portabrace and it's made to be about the same shape as my camera with openings for the mic and monitor and top handle so you can keep using it when it's on it's got clear plastic where the buttons and controls are so you know what you're doing an elastic band thing that's cinches down around the lenses now it's definitely not perfect and taking it on and off is excruciatingly slow and it's absolutely much more annoying to use the camera with this thing on but if you get it set up right you can film some pretty intense rain while keeping the camera totally dry it's much more reliable and secure than my old backpack system and if i'd used one of these in that batcave my camera would probably still work now the next thing i'd say is to build up an ac pouch that has a multi-tool rocket blower a paintbrush and a toothbrush at minimum i made a whole other video about everything that's in my ac kit which i'll link to somewhere up here but these four things are key in my opinion dust and sand are kryptonite for cameras and can jam up your buttons or lens rings if you're not careful so the blower is for your first pass to get all the loose big chunks off there and to blast fine grains out of the cracks then the paintbrush is for the more stubborn dirt that the blower can't move finally the toothbrush is for the little nooks and crannies that the paintbrush can't get into if you can stay semi-disciplined and clean your camera every night or two after the shoot you'll decrease the chance that a random piece of sand stops your record button from pressing properly finally if you're using a lot of audio gear in bad conditions namely if you're worried that they're going to get wet try using a condom around your wireless lavs it might seem weird but condoms are strong flexible and waterproof they're also form-fitting so your wireless labs won't fall out if you think your characters might get wet put a condom around your audio gear before you stick it in their pocket some of those innuendos were pretty close to the edge but anyways let me know in the comments if you have any other hacks to keep your gear safe so take care of your gear value it and do what you can to keep it safe get insurance for the most expensive stuff so you don't get wiped out overnight get a rain cover and build up some basic maintenance tools and give your stuff the best chance of surviving to the next shoot but whatever you do make sure you're using this stuff for what it's made for which is telling amazing stories about the world and the people who live in it and if that means your gear might get hurt in the process that has to be worth the risk all right that's it for today's video hope you found it interesting or at least entertaining that it made you want to get your gear out of the office if you liked it maybe think about subscribing to the channel because i've got new videos coming out every wednesday or maybe think about checking out this other video i made about the toughest piece of gear i've ever bought my sackler flowtech tripod see ya [music] you
