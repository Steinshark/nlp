ladies and gentlemen deckley has responded brace yourselves he's gone full damage control panic mode including calling me racist for exposing his scam and he literally doxed me in a post which he has now deleted but we'll get into all of that for now let's back up and talk about his response video and explain what is this situation how did we get here well i uploaded a video right here accusing million token a coin tech lead created of being a ponzi coin that tech lead lied about and scammed his fans with for millions of dollars additionally he said he put in a million dollars of his own money i'm putting a million dollars of my own money into this to get us started but now admits that isn't true and you know to clarify okay when i started the project i bootstrapped with 50 000 usd coins paired to 50 000 million tokens but despite that lie tech lead seems to be doubling down because on sunday he responded with a video that frankly is unbelievable it's called i'm so sorry i'm going to jail as a millionaire let's take a watch together and see where it all went wrong ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla and don't forget to pump the stock that's not a stock zilla guys it's free you just like subscribe and the dividends they start rolling in now getting into this response video right up front let's put the cans on let's dodge the board let's do it guys right here here it is guys the big response video first of all tech lead looks a little sad oh that like dislike isn't doing so well okay let's throw him a like there i'm here for you tech looks like he could use it but let's get into this catastrophe together how's my hair looking sharp you know it's tough being successful it's lonely at the top as they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions or sorry what i meant to say was that i think we really have a chance of going to the moon so basically right away techlee doubles down and says that helium token is doing better than ever making a moon landing with million token the hottest cryptocurrency right now on social media in fact just recently million token has been trending on subreddit on coin gecko most visited most trending cryptocurrency now this is the beginning of the reality bubble of tech lead it's a manipulator tactic where you try to repeat a lie long enough to make it true he'll do that throughout this story but the reality of million token is this it's a crypto that's down about 80 percent but if you listen to tech lee tell it sounds like it's at all time highs and the reason the person you have to thank for that is apparently me it's because of so much press recently what do we have to thank for this coffeezilla oh the big bad bad wolf gonna blow your ponzi coin down get ready don't listen to me guys don't don't listen to me why he goes around basically calling project scams and maybe he generates some good press for himself he virtue signals and then people think that he's a hero for calling everything a scam life is a scam okay he's a hero this is really just victim mentality victim mentality guys you don't want victim mentality tech lead is very much against it sure life's unfair and you can complain about everything out there you can say that government's a scam but what are you really going to do about it wow this guy hates victim mentality which is weird because right after this video due to the likes and dislikes he went on a unhinged twitter rant where he tried to accuse me of being racist against him apparently that's the only explanation for why i called his coin a scam is coffeezilla racist his hatred for asian people like myself is really unjustified now that's an interesting strategy pulling the race card let's see if it pays off for him guys because the only problem is tech lead doesn't even agree with tech leads own use of the race card ability is that early on i just decided i don't really want to be playing the race card everywhere i go yeah guys he would never do such a thing play the race card why well because according to him doing so would be a victim mentality which tech lead would never have you just start blaming other people for your position and you just take on the victim mentality the victim mindset and you start saying it's because i was born in this way it's because you're being racist against me hmm that didn't turn out so well you look like a giant hypocrite right there you're saying don't listen to coffeezilla he's the guy with the victim mentality and also people who play the race card have a victim mentality and then because you can't ha you don't have any arguments oh you you play the race card i mean maybe this guy maybe you guys should listen to tech lead guys maybe you shouldn't listen to the guy playing the victim mentality but moving back to the video the biggest annoyance i had in this video you know before it went full delusional is just kind of the disappointment that tecly didn't actually address any of my points something that the commenters picked up on quote i don't want to brush off his accusations brushes off zilla's accusations a 10-minute response video where none of the major claims are addressed dude the first thing you did was attempt to play the race card how can you sit there and mention the victim mentality with a straight face you dodged every valid question and then tried to compare yourself to a pirate now hold on we might be getting ahead of ourselves with the pirate thing but these guys these commenters are right techlee doesn't address the substantial criticism so it's kind of annoying and in that sense i don't have too much to add there because if you're not gonna address the fact that like your coin is a ponzi scheme what am i supposed to say exactly but one thing i can add is that to my surprise i found out the tech lead a few months ago actually agreed with me that ponzi schemes are bad check it out recently some information has come to light that has made me skeptical about this whole cryptocurrency market thinking that the whole thing could be being pumped up by a ponzi scheme and i wanted to make this video quickly to warn any of you out there as well who may have substantial life savings of your own also in cryptocurrencies so a few months ago he's calling out ponzi schemes when i guess it was financially convenient and socially convenient to do so but then i guess he figured out if you can't beat him why not join him and this pattern of tech lead calling out scams and then doing the exact opposite doesn't even stop there he also called finance a scam a while back but what we need to talk about today is something extremely serious which are the exit scams and people getting rock pulled losing potentially their life savings this is exactly what happened with people over in binance so here he is calling out binance but hey what's this the video has been unlisted why maybe it's because tech lead is now trying to get million token listed on binance here he's tweeting binance listing at the ceo so tech lead calls out the scam until it's time for him to run a scam and then he pretends that what i do it's virtue signaling it's a victim mentality he goes around basically calling project scams and maybe he generates some good press for himself he virtue signals ah so tech lead calls out scams when it's convenient and when he's getting praised to do so but the second it's more convenient for him to run his own scam suddenly it's it's virtue signaling to do what i do it's so funny to me to watch tech lee completely contradict himself every few months whenever he finds a new grift or he needs to do it it's expedient for him to completely change his value system but there is one point techlee did address of mine and this was the part where i said he lied about saying that he put a million dollars of his own money into million token and guess what he admits i'm right and you know to clarify okay when i started the project i bootstrapped with 50 000 usd coins paired to 50 000 million tokens that's exactly what i said so he's admitting it he did not put in a million dollars of his own money he used your money i had already collected about 100 000 usd coins so i use those to continue deploying more tokens which would bring in more usd coins and now he tries to weasel out of this by saying oh it's still backed by a dollar whatever the bottom line is he lied about the exact like launch statement of his coin i'm putting a million dollars of my own money into this to get us started he lied he just admitted it i mean it's a scam folks but this is where the video really takes a turn for the delusional because besides avoiding all the major points tech lead it seems like decides to go mask off villain mode because he essentially said the fact he brought bad press to his own project was actually a good thing and so it's kind of like genghis khan napoleon or captain blackbeard these iconic historical figures and you know some of these people were even villains sure you could say that captain blackbeard was a scammer he even killed people and yet they are legends in history and there is a value with these people yo this man really just said yes blackbeard killed people yes he was a scam but isn't it cool that you know his name no and by the way you're not a legend you're on coffeezilla like that doesn't make you famous but this tells you so much about the psychology at play here it's all about fame that's all that matters to tech lead it's an illness that clout chasers have it's like followers are the only thing that matters and anything that gets you followers must be good and honestly it's cringy it really reminds me of this guy that was seen on dr phil i mean you'd look at this guy and think he's got a mental illness i mean i don't talk to my family what they're irrelevant they're irrelevant none of them have followers if they got followers or got rich i'd probably talk to them again hang on a minute did you just say i don't talk to my family because they don't have followers if they had followers they'd be here right now this is honestly the tech lead mentality it's like hey all that matters is followers good press bad press what does it matter guys it's all about being a a legend you got to be a legend and if you're wondering does tech lead really believe this just listen to what he has to say right after that clip i bet that if i were to get arrested and go to jail the price of million token would skyrocket because it would just be legendary you know like it took this millionaire down it ended this guy's career it destroyed his reputation this was the cryptocurrency that did it in for this guy look this is unhinged this is delusional like first it's factually wrong look at the price of something like i don't know bit connect you know after people were first like were arrested the price did not exactly skyrocket for coins that turn out to be scams but secondly getting put in jail doesn't make you a legend it makes you a criminal and criminals are a dime a dozen you're not cool if you're a criminal but here's the thing you can't talk sense to somebody like tech lead right it doesn't work and the reason is he thinks he's smarter than everybody what do you respect do people like coffeezilla and i'm sure that he works hard and he's got the best of intentions i'm just operating at a totally different level than him right so like if he's operating here i'm like up here i'm pretty up there it's literally the i'm the big brain meme it's like talking about how how high your iq is hey hey i belong to mensa like everybody else coffee's a lot down here me up here that's this is the level where you say i don't play the race card and then play the race card it's just you wouldn't understand guys it's a level you're not at you and me we're not there and look unfortunately you can't reason with people who think they're up here they believe they're superior to everyone else until it's time to play the victim card and then they're of course happy to play that too but that's basically the whole video tech lead acts like he's gonna address all my points never does goes on a rant about how getting arrested would be great for his coin and then when his back is against the wall because people are seeing through his manipulation tactics and down voting video he goes on twitter and tries to call me racist which he said he would never do early on i just decided i don't really want to be playing the race card everywhere i go you just start blaming other people for your position and you just take on the victim mentality the victim mindset oh and i almost forgot like yeah he also tried to dox me yeah i almost left that out of this piece using an old debunked piece of blackmail that we talked about in this video remember this is the thing swag academy tried to catch me out on but retracted immediately because it's literal blackmail and a dox now i'm blurring out most of it for obvious reasons but look at what he said he goes want some hard facts coffeezilla is a reported and then of course you have the obligatory this is why lions do not concern themselves with the opinions of sheep this is so insane defamatory fully debunked that when i saw it i laughed because i was like oh this guy must be completely out of options if this is the best he can come up with trying to smear me with anything and everything he can find and not even trying to fact check it and of course i immediately dm'd him told him it was defamatory and to his credit he deleted it and put up a statement correction on the last tweet to be fair the allegations on coffee were later debunked he's got haters apparently and i appreciate him correcting the record this is obviously the right thing to do but let's make no mistake here it's wrong to dock somebody period even if it didn't contain blackmail which in this case it did and don't forget the same thing happened to trin black after he criticized matt tran and tech lead but people for some reason gave tech lead a pass in this case i wonder if they're gonna give him a pass again to dox people and everyone just seems to be fine with it i don't know i'm sickened by this but honestly i think it's a distraction from the real point which is the actual arguments against million token going completely unaddressed he still profited millions from his followers he still ran ads about his scam and lied about his ownership in those ads he still created a ponzi coin after saying ponzi schemes are bad he still called critics racist after saying he'd never play the race card he docks his critics when they try to call him out and he's still trying to gaslight his way out of it with his fans whether it works is i guess up to you guys but either way we here at coffeezilla headquarters well we're gonna continue to try to keep unearthing these schemes and shining a light for everyone in this crypto space that's basically it thanks for watching smash like and subscribe to pump the zilla and i'll see you in the next one all the [music] a promises are you the same as choice
