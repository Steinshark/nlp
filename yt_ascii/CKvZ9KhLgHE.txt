this is russia we met three years ago she's my soulmate she's the most infectiously positive bundle of happiness i've ever come across she makes the good times so much better and in the bad times she's the first to come and the last to leave and i want to marry her but we have to do this properly i've been dreaming since the age of 10 about how i would one day propose and so now that it's actually happening i want to make sure i do that little guy proud so this is what we need to do i've got to figure out how i'm going to propose i want to ask for her parents permission we've got to find the perfect ring then i've got to actually ask her the question and she cannot find out about any of this until that happens let's do and so every time we've had an anniversary or a birthday i've always tried to turn it into some sort of increasingly challenging puzzle that she has to solve but no joke i spent hours even days on these puzzles only for her to just look at them and go not this time i realize the only right way to do this proposal was to create the first puzzle that would actually challenge her and probably the last puzzle i'll ever make i'm not dying she's just too good at puzzles okay i've decided we're gonna make a custom escape room from scratch we're gonna do the puzzles together but it's only when she gets to the final room and she realizes that the entire thing was made for her that i'm gonna get on one knee and ask her to spend the rest of her life with me now obviously i'm gonna need a little bit of so i furiously emailed company after company got rejection after rejection until there is a guy called jay he's basically just messaged back to say great to hear from you this sounds fun i couldn't believe it we're doing this i have to contain my excitement i'm still regularly meeting up with russia and i'll find out about to meet the guy who's gonna make this happen nice to meet you hello this is jay the only man big brain enough to make something that drisha might actually struggle with we could have some strange sounds like you're completely seamless transition into the game this meeting was really where it started to dawn on me just how next level this proposal could be even just like talking about it is giving me like butterflies yeah we decided to shape each room within the escape room based on her favorite dates that we've been on so for example our very first date we met at a cocktail club there's got to be a bar in this escape room one of our most memorable was dining in the dark together so that's going to become an immersive pitch black room she took me out once to a video game arcade which is when i first realized how competitive she was and how compatible we were and probably our joint favorite bit in both sneaking into a park at night and gazing at stars together had to make it into we ended up with four key puzzle rooms but each of those would also be filled with smaller references to the other things we've done together so we're trying to find a venue to be able to host the escape room in but this is london this never occurred to me before but actually trying to hire a large-scale venue in london for months at a time it's literally being quoted as 50 000 pounds but then we had a brain wave we found a piece of software that when you do a google search it retrieves all the phone numbers and the email addresses of the results so to get ourselves an actually affordable price we targeted all venues that might have some spare space that they weren't going to be using hubs churches local government buildings we ended up accumulating a list so large that we were able to push out 300 emails a day to them seeing who is interested we had many calls and many weeks of just narrowing this net down so we can use this location so that's milo showing everyone his location and then we found the perfect one a pub called the gunnersbury just managed to leave the house he thinks i'm seeing a friend i took a nice little secret journey to the other side of london we're here this is where it's happening this is the actual part of we're going to be downstairs these are the stairs that we're actually going to walk down it actually looks exactly what you would expect a pub basement to look like but that is actually kind of perfect because the hardest part of this whole thing is getting richer to the final room without her realizing what's about to happen in it and then this is where the game begins you actually need to oh so this is the first room where the tone is going to change she's going to come here thinking oh what a nice drinking establishment we're going to have some drinks we're gonna have some more drinks and then we're gonna stumble out the way we came but she's gonna have absolutely no idea that this is actually themed after our first date that it's about to become an entire escape room or that she's about to be proposed to and then this is the main room which we're gonna completely transform now that we have the floor plan locked in it's a little scary because we realize we have a lot of rooms to fit into not a lot of space but with about half a day of intricate fiddling we finally figured out how to fit everything we could have possibly wanted inside and a way to get from each room to the next one can potentially make the final room a long aisle so that she solves her final puzzle she walks in and she sees me at the end i actually so nervous just being here starting to feel surreal but it's just occurred to me we also need the perfect song to play while i'm proposing my sister is the best piano player that i know in hey i've got a slight favorite ass you know how we're doing this escape room do you think you can play her number one favorite song on piano yeah sure okay thank you so now that i've secured the music it's also time to secure the parents but because i wanted to see their reaction in person i couldn't tell them what this was actually about i'm about to text trisha's mom how do i do this okay so basically i'm planning a surprise that'll work because her birthday is around the same time so hopefully she'll assume that's what i'm talking about and i'm not lying technically i booked us a table would you mind coming with me to help sample some food please don't tell her and we wait with all of these things cooking in the background it was time to find the ring this is hatton garden it is apparently the ring capital of the country kind of weird that i'm actually shopping for a ring that doesn't feel real thankfully i did actually ask her really early on in our relationship what type of ring she likes been storing it up here she's going to want a thin band a fairly small stone and that stone i think should be a diamond as you can tell i know nothing about rings we're looking for like a really simple shape straight out of a disney movie the proportion has to be kind of quite dainty is there a name to something like that that was that was so easy and the search should be gone i went from store to store to store learning everything i could about the mysterious market of rings oh my god and look what they've got where have you seen this before this looks really nice that's crazy is it a thing to have a bezel all the way around okay yeah it seems ironic me putting the bezels back on it's actually phenomenal how fat my fingers are i look pretty though i was getting a really good idea of what kind of ring i wanted but for now there was an even more important job to be done all right so we're off to go meet the parents thankfully they don't know who josh is which is going to give us the perfect opportunity so we are at the location now we've got josh sitting over there he's gonna hold the phone and record and her parents are going to be right here and here i'm sure it's going to go well but i'm just like my heart is racing right now 10 minutes felt like forever but they did eventually arrive but yeah we got this surprise plant okay so it's you know her birthday is coming up it's not a birthday surprise oh thank you yeah the reason we're here is trisha is my best friend in the whole wide world and i want to marry her and i wanted to ask you guys permission oh my god oh my god oh thank you oh my god you're gonna have to do that in you seriously yeah that's my cameraman over there josh we're good that went about as well as it could have i'm going straight back to her house right after her parents we've left like a 30 minute time gap so it's not too suspicious i'm literally gonna be walking in saying hi to them in front of her not acknowledging the fact we've just spent the last two hours together the web of deceit grows so i spent a lot of time over the last three days trying to figure out what we're gonna call this escape room i really wanted to be some sort of amalgamation of our names aaron and brisha but it's just not clicking i realized there's something called an anagram generator which can scramble letters you give it but the best i could do with our two names was harsh durian which did not feel like the answer i think we might have cracked it it doesn't just need to be orange it can be arundrisha forever hey jay i think we figured out a name or covered henry's this is gonna work perfectly so she's going to notice that the bars called for harvard henry's very early on but what i'm hoping is that it's only in her final puzzle where she's going to be unscrambling these tiles that everything is suddenly going to fall in place and she's going to realize i'm actually so relieved trisha has come to visit me right now i asked her mom to measure her ring that she has at home and to send me what the size is and she is so smart because she's realized that i'm with drisha and so the text she sent is encrypted higher and just checked the wi-fi speed and it's 48 is that good 48. that's the number we're off to go buy a ring today's the day it's a lot of stairs that's the place i wanted to go that's not good at this point i was armed with all the knowledge of a diamond dealer and ready to buy then at the single moment i least expected it at the local nottingham christmas market i found [music] yeah no this wasn't it i basically went to every single jewelry shop in my entire city we're looking for a very specific thing but the more i looked the more it seemed like a fruitless effort i saw exactly what i wanted in london and they should have just got it and yes i should have within five minutes i was in a car and within three hours i'm back in london let's go buy a ring this is it i found the design and i also realized that this perfect ring i've been thinking about this whole time was actually just a demo unit that just had a two dollar quartz instead of a diamond inside of it so a slight knock to my confidence as diamond master but when i saw this one actual stone that we could use inside i could not believe the amount of color and sparkle that stone sold me on the spot thank you nice to meet you too see you next year i guess merry christmas okay it does i just bought my engagement ring i've just checked into my room for the night this is actually freaky so trisha just went out for dinner got a fortune cookie there's a good chance of a romantic encounter suit tell me that's not at least a little bit sauce i just thought this was funny so just in case it pops up as a message while she's around i've renamed the ring place to just harry on my phone now things were getting properly serious though it's about time we sent the most important text message of this entire project so i'd realized very early in this process that there was only one perfect day that this proposal had to happen on monday 6th of february the day we first met was a monday and february 6th would be exactly three years since the day i asked her to be my girlfriend time to ask her to book the day off her birthday is coming up very very soon what i'm going to tell her is i've managed to book something for her during the day but the thing that i wanted to do in the evening wasn't available what a shame we have to do on february 6th would you hypothetically be able to book off monday sixth set up oh my god she's seen the message she said you know exactly how to pique my curiosity i must i felt like i'm developing a sort of internal filter that stops me speaking before i've checked that what i'm saying doesn't contain the ring drisha her parents escape room and this is all also happening while i'm planning to surprise my mom with her dream car the two biggest secrets i've ever kept from the two people that i probably talked to the most i thought i'd do this to yourself literally every single day now all i can think about is just the moment where she looks at me and she knows what's about to happen i get done i'm on the i ask and spend the rest of her life with me is that like floating feeling in the pit of my stomach it does not want me to sleep right now and just to be sure that i kept it under wraps i decided to tell everyone who knew about the plan to only call it puzzle from now on and this ended up saving the entire plan a few times including when she was working right next to me and the puzzle chat was pinging with notifications it's ring pickup time right back we actually have a very frequently surreal since i'm literally off to go see her now i'm gonna wrap it in a sock and hide it in the front of my bag off we go he's staying there i'll comfy soon all right it's now january 25th we're literally two weeks away so finally time to see what this escape room looks like this is where we find out if all of the planning the diagrams sketches if all of that was worth it we're going in backwards first oh we have rooms this looks very very different when we saw this it was just one big space oh there's a dog whoa okay now three things became very clear to me in this moment a this was going to be the best escape room she's ever experienced this is cool this is very cool there was a lot of work to do in not a lot of time and see this was one very hungry dog he just ate the sandwich it's really nerve-wracking it's thinking about at what stage is she gonna figure out what's happening she's gonna figure out at some point this is very unfortunate that might be the sandwich from earlier this is why you get a cat but the main thing we came to do was to set up and install the highest end live streaming cameras we could possibly find oh my god those are enormous we thought okay this is game is incredibly low light we're gonna need the best possible set of cameras that all connect to one central hub so that we can monitor them and move them in real time this is the last time we're going to be here until the professional well so i thought so we've got a slight problem when you actually set the escape room to realistic light and conditions it's just a sheet of grain i actually can't believe this is happening right now these cameras we've rented are worth in total 36 000 british pounds and the phones are shooting far better footage interesting shot so i just had a bit of a brainwave we're making this escape room so we can just invent a reason for us to have to mount cameras onto ourselves obviously so we went away and we came up with a plan we're going to have 10 iphones two wearable on-body cameras and then six high-end security cameras because security cameras are built to see in pitch black using infrared we bought one just to make absolutely sure that it would work well in low light and it passed with flying colors so we are back armed with the heaviest gear bag i've ever had the pleasure of trying to carry the camera situation was finally under control and we even got jay to agree to find a way to integrate the body caps which since he's all about the immersion of the escape rooms he works on he obviously loved about us having these attached to us during the game yeah during the game um i'm actually so sorry joe anyway while i was in jay's control room i also got to see how he was going to be able to change his voice to sound like zeus to direct us during the game so you've created a profile for your voice so that when it goes through this it changes it exactly yeah but it was only now that it dawned on me we had just days to go and this final proposal room was not looking nearly as good as it needed to she's gonna remember this room for the rest of her life time to take matters into my own hands i legged it to the closest hardware store i bought up every white curtain and suitable led strip i could find and basically spent the next four hours frantically pulling down the decor that was there and replacing it with what i thought the room should look like i would have stayed through the night till it was finished but before i knew it it was 6 pm and i had to head to the other side of london for a samsung event terrified knowing that it was not done and that i would now have no more time until the proposal day itself [music] so practicing the song [music] incredible the song was literally the most beautiful thing i've ever heard but it actually took from morning to the middle of the night to put it all together smooth out the rough edges and finish this masterpiece and while i was there i also realized there was actually a correct need to go down on so i got some final practice in the only things left to do then were to buy the suit i was gonna wear stare at the ring for the hundredth time make myself look as presentable as possible which included a very painful eyebrow threading appointment and then practice speed changing when drish is in her final room unscrambling the name of the bar i'm gonna have a maximum of two and a half minutes to actually change my entire outfit so i had to make that sure i could do that it was it's the day itself this place needs so much work i'm both the most nervous and most excited i've ever been in my entire life putting my latexology to the side for a minute i have never blown up balloons with more pace than i did in those two hours i can't understate how many balloons we ended up getting that i just blew like my life depended on it i'm literally gonna have to pick pressure up in 20 minutes there's so much to do time was up i left the dog in charge hid all sandwiches and headed off to pick up my 2b fiance just after a quick bathroom trip on the way out so i've just realized i forgot my microphone which was going to be attached to me to record the entire audio track so i've told my team to basically wrap it all up and hide it in the bathroom which i will then visit when i take trisha to the pub don't make things easy there she was completely oblivious to what was about to happen i tell you keeping my cool in this moment was absolutely essential and also one of the hardest things i've ever had to do would you believe me if i said we're actually going to a pub no well we're going to the pub and i'm going to the bathroom to reclaim my lost microphone thankfully it's not engaged this time but i'm about to be well hopefully because this is the moment we walk down into the basement and begin the game time to see how my entire year of planning pays off hello there guys all right yeah this doesn't look like a standard sort of lockdown but i'll explain why it's obviously my name is henry maynard i'm from a company called for harvard henry's you've got a couple of hotels to give you guys tonight so as soon as it's february we think we'll go with themed love i assume you two are together you'd like to think so yeah we'd like to call the aphrodite the greek goddess of romantic beauty you're surprised like this is not what you expect it was in plain sight that you were like we're going to a pub yeah i told her i'm like we're going to a pub and she's like no there's no way you made me dress up to come to a pub so this bad boy it is a little bit of a mixture of everything sweet everything nice but not too much sauce so you're just having a conversation about how i don't think she can one for one me on drinks but she disagrees that's one of the best cocktails i've ever had well it was very interesting i must mentioned tolerance so absence one is very strong i've put in the wrong fridge because i'm quite tired i had this one last night and normally i feel like my alcohol tolerance is really high not me now i woke up and i was just clutching that book what what is the book full of like weird stories the guy's sitting here for one sec i'm just going around my dreams played me although my name is oasis this is insane i have entered your dreams to destroy true love you will never find a missing ingredient to your love challenge me at your peril and the game begins fun fact even though i helped to design them of course just to be absolutely certain that the experience felt real to me i also made sure that i knew none of the answers to these puzzles this is an immersive escape room oh my god that's so cool i don't know anything else oh this is so cool i am sorry there's books here wait there's something here it's like a laser tag thing yeah okay so we've got to do something i'll take my coat off okay so book december 31st i see the gods and they tell me to place three offerings on a bed of feathers the god aphrodite appears in the form of a beautiful woman with long flowing hair she's holding the scallop shell is that a scallop shell to see if there's anything else underlined them chris on that table that's a better feathers right there oh nice okay you have opened the gateway to your dreams oh my god we've done it barroom solved i could not believe this was actually working she genuinely thinks the escape room is the only surprise but now it was on to the pitch black room and the name does not lie oh oh put your hand in here oh it's gooey we quickly realized that there were pieces all around the room that needed to be used to fill the three circles at the end taking into account the three different types of texture that each one had i feel like i can see half a crescent oh there's another piece here oh wait there's another one here oh there's another piece here oh wait that's fell and it's got a diamond is that like a sticky surface perhaps we solved the first circle within a minute by just using the pieces we'd already found we just had two pieces left to put in so we need the bottom one of this and the top part of that getting them out must be something to do with these okay so there's five levels to this oh they're five slime tubes [music] oh maybe that's the code to this yeah it's a coded padlock right yeah and we can't actually see there's buttons yeah that's it that's it okay so which ones are out okay so left at the top then it's right then it's neither then it's left then it's both got it the final piece took a good 10 minutes of shuffling around in the dark and sticking our hands into some very unpleasant places can you feel anything that might be a key oh it's actually wet before finally yes yes [music] the darkness of eternal slumbers what do you think for harvard henry so far i love it so much we'd made it to the video game room and to kick it off a custom video game that we had designed from scratch just for her repeat against each other to win this is so like satisfying you know like the early consoles and stuff it's a two-player head-to-head version of pac-man made to work with a controller that i can only describe as twister for your fingers where instead of collecting food we're collecting hearts all right i've worked out how to go up and down wait drish it might be mapped to opposite sides maybe you get your four fingers on where right and left are right oh my god i'm so disoriented i want to at least get like one heart [music] fruit could link to this because look red yellow green blue and then reset yeah yeah [music] is that open [music] no dress yeah mine said loser i think we have to wear them based on the game that we just played i'm just gonna keep it in my bag i'm gonna keep it in my bath bomb okay so we've just got to figure out these oh oh the heart yeah put it over the ah somehow drisha had realized in seconds that putting this red heart over these numbered sheets around the room revealed a set of pixelated characters which when cross-referenced with the characters on this poster spelled out a code oh it's the sheets number three that's insane so the first number is number three so you can tap three [music] seven so two is seven yeah you need to look i think it's got one dot one floating dot i think it's one three seven one four try it oh so good my heartbeat was getting faster and faster knowing we're so close now i can't describe to you how surreal it felt to see brisha finally standing in these rooms with me and the first thing we notice in this park room is targets with labels on them oh soul search inside the salt love pot yeah it's like star signs yeah and then the last one is years maybe it's a sequence you have to this puzzle is referencing one of our biggest dates ever we went to a random feel in the middle of nowhere and played outdoor laser tag together and this was where we first said we loved each other so before the people start words and the fear shoot love and shoot yeah loves that oh yeah it's over here use that one okay oh yeah you can move it so satisfying but it wasn't the answer start with love [music] so love something you keep flashing me [laughter] that was one of my favorite dates ever yes do the words link together like soul search soul search light yeah light yeah now we just need to just shoot them okay let's try it love her can i get it oh we've got to do it quickly my heart is racing right now yeah that's not quite why my heart's racing open fire okay i'm surely the tree's gonna go so art done yep so now you do that one yep okay done the other one so now it's light yeah yes okay that should be all of them yes oh my god okay oh there's some stuff there okay oh god that felt so good take a seat and gaze upon the stars to see where your destiny lies make a wish on polaris to the north look over to where the sun sets and discover the herdsmen battling over ariadne's treasure with hercules take this treasure she wore on her wedding day to unlock your dreams oh dress wait keys so one of those is going to open that box yeah they all have a word wait trish have you seen this look at the ceiling oh look at the stars whoa when it happened that's that's my one yeah that's how i please that's the other one i'm gonna lie and look at stars at me i will remember this moment for the rest of my life i was struggling to keep myself together at this point not even because we were now lying on the exact spot the dog had defecated on i just knew that we were minutes away from the big moment can you see this shape anywhere on there is it that one yes is the thai yeah so it's that one foreign [music] oh wow keep me with you whoever's birth date is closest to capricorn how do you know that because i have a capricorn ah obviously must take their gift of velvet pouches with them the other must wait and enter into the waking world so i'll just chill heaven tell me about it later [music] but while drisha was piecing together what would become the most emotionally charged puzzle of her entire life i had a slightly different puzzle on my hands jacket i was scrambling around going from room to room looking for it trying to be as quiet as possible sorry but in my mind i was screaming i knew she was getting closer and closer henry's i got it but any second now it would all click into place for her and that final door so i started to just say screw it i ran upstairs because our families were waiting up there borrowed my brother's tire and prepared myself for the big moment meanwhile drisha figured it out drisha forever and then renew she knew what the final word was but this is her almost paralyzed in the moment not even able to put that final tile in place this is the moment she realized everything she realized that the escape room was not just for us but about us that i built the entire thing and more importantly what was had to happen next [music] you have solved no puzzle you have escaped your slumber to overcome me junior will be loved in the waging world and i will not travel you again now leave this place [music] does it all make sense now [music] thank you when i first met you when you first walked away from me on our very first date i've told you this i saw you disappear into the underground and i turned around and i swore that's partly because i never wanted that day to end and just throwing popcorn in my mouth but it's also partly because i knew in that moment that my life had changed forever and it's why now i want nothing more than spend the rest of my life with you pressure [music] always always yes [music] for real oh my god love you too foreign
