as electric vehicles gain popularity around the world people are starting to pay closer attention to the batteries going into those evs a recent report by the biden administration singles out large capacity ev batteries as one of the four critical industries worth further scrutiny asian-based companies are driving substantial technical progress here in a prior video i profiled catal group the world's largest ev battery company by shipments while they are indeed growing very quickly cato's leading position is almost entirely defined by its dominance in the china market outside of china the situation is very different in this video i want to look at another battery market leader one with considerable strength outside of china what had once been lg chem but is now called lg energy

in 1947 as la qui chemical industries pronounced lucky the company at first sold creams and other hygienics products when a large number of its creams were returned due to a faulty plastic lid the company started making plastics to help solve a problem of its own 1958 saw the establishment of the gold star company an electronics outfit gold star made radios and home appliances it would eventually grow into one of the country's largest electronics companies lucky and gold star eventually merged in 1983 to create lucky gold star or lg in the 1970s lucky entered the petrochemical business they were soon making carpet wallpaper pipes toothbrushes pharmaceuticals cosmetics and more pretty much everything this sort of product expansion is not all that unusual for chebo as you might expect lg chem found itself doing too much and its product lineup needed some reorganization thus over the years lg cam has spun off various sister companies to handle certain products its consumer brands went to lg household in healthcare in 2001 some of its pharmaceuticals division went to lg life sciences in 2002 its carpet and wallpaper products went to lg house in 2009 so up until very recently lg chem's product lineup was largely three categories petrochemicals like thermoplastic abs electronics chemicals like those used for lcd screens and the battery business then in late 2020 lg camp decided that it would spin off its battery division into a new wholly owned company called lg energy solution the goal was to single out the battery division as one of their core businesses and help it raise money on its own to fund its substantial capital investments lg chem began working on lithium-ion batteries all the way back in 1995 as a diversified chemicals company lg chem saw an opportunity to leverage their chemical expertise to gain share in the battery space after all batteries are basically chemistry the company started out making batteries for cell phones and laptops but for a decade they eyed the lucrative automobile market in the 2000s exclusively electric vehicles were not common you are more likely to find hybrids like the prius v released from 2011 to 2012 those cars were driven by nickel metal hydride batteries at the time lithium-ion batteries had significant cost abuse tolerance and calendar life concerns at high temperatures but in turn they offered the potential of higher energy densities lg chem wanted to develop a lithium-ion battery not only good enough for hybrids but also entirely electric vehicles for 20 years the company's battery business gained infamy for being an endlessly lost making enterprise but their long march eventually bore fruit in 2009 gm selected lg to supply lithium-ion batteries for their chevrolet volt electric vehicle a huge breakthrough since then lithium-ion battery costs have fallen very quickly this has in part fueled the increasing economic viability of electric vehicles around the world today while nickel metal hydride batteries are still sometimes used in hybrids most evs have lithium ion batteries lg has been a leading beneficiary of this trend in part due to its ties to the chemical industrial complex lg chem is very vertically integrated they spend a lot on research and development then leverage their supply chain to rapidly adopt and manufacture any promising new battery chemistries in 2001 they established their own technology center in troy michigan to study battery components alongside the american car manufacturers the company is very globalized lg has been willing to export its technologies abroad and build factories outside of south korea this has been very much necessary when it comes to the ev battery industry with laptop and cell phone components like batteries or semiconductors they are small enough that you can manufacture them at home in korea or china before shipping them abroad this encourages companies to centralize manufacturing which is how you get to a situation where something like half the world's chips are made in taiwan but such a thing is not logistically or economically feasible for electric vehicles because their batteries are so heavy with automobile supply chains being as complicated as they are manufacturers will often demand that battery factories be built near where the vehicle is assembled in 2010 lg chem spent 300 million dollars to build a 000 square foot battery factory in the american city of holland in west michigan this one serves general motors and the chevrolet bolt in the years since they have built two more factories in china and another in poland the latter completed in 2017 these are in addition to their core facilities in korea which serve hyundai motors fully integrated lithium-ion battery packs like the ones that go into your tesla or chevrolet bolt are made up of cells lithium battery cells are made up of four different components the first two are the cathode and anode the electrodes in an ev battery current flows from the two electrodes to an outside system there is a separator which is a porous membrane that keeps the cathode and anode from mixing with one another and finally there is an electrolyte that facilitates the flow of electrons back and forth between the cathode and the anode usually cells are first bundled into modules before being installed into the pack depending on their size and form there can be thousands of these cells and modules going into a single pack traditionally cells can come in three different forms cylindrical prismatic and pouch type for evs lg offers cylindrical batteries and pouches they do also make prismatic batteries but not for evs so let us start with cylindrical type battery cells you might be familiar with how these are shaped the kind of things you might stick into your bluetooth mouse the size and shape are more standardized and you can tell between them based on their name for instance the one eight six five zero the first four digits indicate their size' millimeters wide and 65 millimeters long the zero at the end tells you that it is a cylindrical battery many chinese ev companies as well as tesla use these cells for their battery packs the one tesla uses are 46 ads which are 46 millimeters wide and 80 millimeters long not sure why they dropped the zero at the end a company like tesla is likely putting thousands of these cylindrical cells into these packs and this can get immensely challenging thousands of cells means thousands of things to place and weld without making mistakes tesla learned how to do it but most car companies are not going to want to deal with that so that is where the second type of cell comes into play prismatic cells prismatic is a fancy word that means highly varied so the defining characteristic of these large format prismatic battery cells is that they are custom so as a result you do not have to put thousands of them into a battery pack rather just hundreds or even dozens many traditional car companies have preferred to go with prismatic battery cells it works since the vendor is basically customizing the product to best fit their manufacturing and product needs the drawback is the supply chain because it is custom it's hard to dual source for volume and dependency reasons the third type of battery is a pouch type a more minimalist type cell contained in a flexible foil literally a bag of chemicals because they are flat thin and light you can stuff them to the max into the battery pack this gives the packs a very high energy density and since they are in a bag when safety issues occur the pouch can swell rather than explode pouch-type battery cells are one of lg's core ev products two of their most prominent proprietary innovations are used for this pouch-type battery their stack and fold cell technology and a safety reinforced separator or srs stack and fold describes a patent way of manufacturing their polymer pouch battery cells this technique stacks the anode separator and cathode together and laminates them into what is called a bicell the buy cells are then folded into the battery stack and fold there we go the second major thing is the safety reinforced separator or srs a patented type of separator the separator if you recall separates the anode from the cathode damage to it can cause damage to the battery and might even spark a fire in lg's srs a ceramic coating is applied that acts to provide superior abuse tolerance and stability across a variety of thermal and nail penetration scenarios in other words the srs hopefully creates an overall safer battery due to its early mover and technical advantages lg energy has garnered an impressive range of customers and competitors general motors or gm is one of their best customers they have been working together ever since the aforementioned chevy bolt as gm moves closer towards a fully electric lineup lg is adding two more american battery factories in lordstown ohio and spring hill tennessee to help meet demand those factories both located near gm facilities are scheduled to be completed in 2022 and 2023 the lord's town plan is estimated to cost 2.3 billion usd interestingly enough they are both 50-50 joint ventures hinting at some sort of technology transfer out in europe the company supplies batteries to daimler audi and volkswagen volkswagen had been one of lg energy's larger customers but the company recently announced a switch away from pouch-type cells to prismatic cells the transition will probably take a long time but it is a big deal in china lg is one of tesla's ev battery suppliers alongside china's catal with plans to compete for a larger share of that business in the rest of the world they have also formed a joint venture with chinese automaker gili on battery tech this factory is in nanjing and open for business in 2020 on the competitor side lg faces some big players in its native korea the company faces competition from samsung sdi and sk innovation both are backed by massive chebul sk also makes pouch-type styles where samsung mostly makes prismatic cells lg and sk recently settled a fierce trade secret lawsuit over their battery technologies for 1.8 billion dollars it had threatened sk's ability to progress forward in the united states this had been a very big deal since sk will be supplying batteries for ford's f-150 lightning perhaps one of the most important upcoming evs the lightning is the electric version of the country's best-selling vehicle i am glad to see the lawsuit resolved because it looks to be a great truck outside of korea japan's panasonic is one of lg's biggest rivals their global market share x china as of this writing is second only to lg but most of that substantial volume is driven by two major customers toyota and tesla panasonic fyi is tesla's partner in the nevada gigafactory probably lg's fiercest competitor would be cadal they are expected to be the number one beneficiary of volkswagen switch away from pouch-type batteries to prismatic their recently developed cell to pack technology skips having to place battery cells into modules before loading them into the pack as a result the pack gets lighter denser and cheaper it's a big deal and puts cable's prismatic offerings on par with lg's pouch cells and cable is starting to build capacity internationally too lg will have to adjust their lineup and up their game despite the fierce competition lg energy solution as an energetic future ahead of it the unit turned losses for a decade but strong ev battery demand worldwide finally pushed it solidly into the green in 2020. since then the company has started to generate very real profit in q1 2021 the latest results i have as of this writing lg energy solution generated record revenue and profit revenues were up 88 percent year over year making it a 15 billion usd run rate business operating profit was 341 billion won or 310 million usd profit margin was eight percent lg energy solution is no cash-rich sas company but considering all the revenue growth as well as the challenges of manufacturing actual things it is now solidly profitable one can argue that they should be spending even more so to secure their market position but it seems like the focus on profit generation is for the upcoming ipo which as of this writing has yet to happen the company wants to raise some 10 trillion 1 or 9 billion usd valuing it at 100 trillion won or 90 billion usd institutional investors will want to know if this business can make money whether an auto supplier making just about a billion dollars annualize profit and wrestling with massive competitors some of whom are implicitly state-backed is worth 90 billion usd is up for debate i will leave that determination to you but it does demonstrate the company's value and outsized importance in an extremely dynamic and world-changing future industry alright thanks for watching if you want more content
