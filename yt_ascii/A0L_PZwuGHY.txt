some time ago i made a video about how there's 
no equation for a triangle depending on your   definitions the both equation and triangle because 
by the end of the video i had this triangle which   is plotted using that equation although the 
existence of the sine function which says if   a value is positive or negative upsets some people 
but if you allow that as a valid equation it plots   that triangle if you don't like that we also have 
this triangle which is made using that equation   and now we've got absolute values to try and fudge 
around using the sine function you get a bit you   get these spiky bits you get rays coming out of 
the middle and i rendered both of these using my   own ridiculous python code which meant that 
i could also turn on like a spectrum effect to   show you how close to the triangle different 
values are and that's yeah the kind of pink   floyd good fun and that was the video it 
took 20 minutes last time could have been a   lot quicker in hindsight however a lot of you got 
in touch with better equations for triangles it's   classic you folks and so i thought it 
might be kind of fun to do a sequel and   at last come up with a good equation 
for a triangle it's triangle two   triangle harder [music] this video made possible 
by james tree to more about the james street   triangle later a reminder that shapes can have 
equations so here we have a square and its   equation underneath which is using the absolute 
value function on there it is x nailed it   and y and it gives you this fantastic square up 
here and we can turn something like that into a   triangle by adding in just a a touch of extra 
x and that one absolute value of x extra kind   of kind of folds it all down and we end up with a 
triangle however it is only one specific triangle   so individual triangles can have equations but 
we want a generalized equation that gives us any   triangle we care to plot and you can start messing 
around with things like this a little bit you're   like well what if i swapped out y for y on b and 
now if i adjust b what it does is it stretches   or squashes that original triangle so if all you 
want is my isosceles triangle going up and down   no problem if you want to skew it side to side 
you've got to replace things with some trigonomic   functions and now you can start to alter a so 
all these a's here you change them in unison   and that will move the whole thing to the side or 
back over the other way and you're thinking well   that's not bad we're covering a decent number of 
different triangles but we want all the triangles   we don't just want ones that you can get to by 
stretching and skewing and these sorts of things   we want a generalized equation and it turns 
out such a thing is possible before the fully   generalized triangles however i thought i'd show 
you a few of my favorite close but no triangles   here is our first triangle sort of this was sent 
in by muhammad jafari and it's a really nice   triangle even better equation look at that look 
there's such a nice simple equation x to the power   of 2a plus x plus the absolute value of y and all 
of that there's to the power of 2a as well equals   one and it gives you it gives you this triangle 
and you know i'm gonna move it over here i'll   make it a little bigger so we can all oops too big 
too big back a bit there it is and what i can do   is i can turn on a dot here and i can label it 
so it's evaluating that equation at whatever point   this dot is it's displaying the value you get from 
that equation and this only displays if it equals   one and it currently doesn't there's very much not 
one it's a huge number and if i drag it around out   here it's just some massive number if i move it 
inside the triangle it's a tiny number that's now   10 to the negative 17 10 to the negative 56 tiny 
but if i put it right on the line that's where   it equals one there one and then likewise over 
here it equals one right on the line so it's only   colouring in the pixels there it is one where that 
equation gives you one it fills in that triangle   and you're like well what's what's wrong with that 
well hang on let's just i'm just going to zoom in   a little here where it crosses the axis and look 
at that what is that come on there's like a little   there's a dip you don't want to you want this to 
be straight not having a dip so it turns out it   looks like a triangle if you zoom all the way out 
not actually in fact the corners zoom in on that   corner isn't that lovely it's like it's a triangle 
but it was in a hurry it's like i got places to be   but we want a more crisp corner than that and 
you can kind of fix it by increasing that value   of a so oops let's try and fix that there we go 
so if i put the value of a up it becomes more   and more triangly and hard to tell this level of 
resolution turn off the dot and in the extreme   value like i guess as a approaches infinity this 
will approach a triangle if you go the other way   you can see just how not triangle it is so if 
i come right down here it starts to exaggerate   the dip exaggerates the corner and becomes a lot 
more kind of look at that it's it's like a heart   it's a triangle heart i don't know where am i 
there next almost triangle this one's actually   quite nice it's straight lines it's got corners 
everything you could dream of and the equation   is quite pretty let me just drag it out there 
you are it's using the sine function again a whole   bunch of things equals zero it's nice nice and 
tidy it's a slight variation on the things i was   doing before and the person who made this triangle 
wants to remain anonymous that's mysterious so i'm   going to refer to them as generic viewer thank 
you very much generic viewer for this triangle   you can mess around with all the values here 
so i can make move the sides up and down move bits   around all the various values in the equations 
can be adjusted and the reason why it's not an   actual triangle is because we just want the lines 
if you turn on the dot with a value for this one   you can see it is indeed zero everywhere outside 
but if i move it inside that little triangle it   becomes eight and the outside is zero and inside 
is eight so actually there's two regions the zero   region and the eight region and this line it 
doesn't actually exist mathematically it's just   it's highlighting where the regions change so 
strictly speaking this is not the outline of a   triangle that we want because a polygon is made 
of a strait of line segments basically it's   the filled in version of the triangle this is to a 
triangle what a disc is to a circle which is still   lovely nice equation looks great not technically 
a triangle but good work generic viewer you're   my favorite now for a quick round up of perfectly 
valid triangles but not generalizable starting   with this one here so this one look at me i'm 
in the triangle this was sent in by someone   called harrison and i thought i'd put it in 
as kind of a honorable mention because it's made   using 3d planes it's a 2d slice of 3d intersecting 
planes which is just ridiculous but amazing up   next this triangle which you think well okay okay 
it's perfectly good triangle it's not good not a   bad equation look at that it's got some it's got 
an octan and a tan there and back again great   but that slider for n equals three ones if we move 
that up to four it's a square it's a pentagon it's   a hexagon it makes a regular n-gons by adjusting 
n in that equation and there is actually more of   that equation so i'm gonna there's all of wait 
there's more there's more and more that's it   there so wow okay so all of that okay it's 
now real small but this which i appreciate is   now bigger than the shape you change n in that 
and it gives you all the different regular n-gons   that's so so pleasing that was sent in by 
someone with username idiotinium idiot idiom   generic viewer number two another one here 
this was sent in by jaden as well as a few   other people on on tech talk are they these 
tick tockers from tick tock look at the reach   we've got now people love triangles what can i 
say a good equation again arctan action bit of   a mod not quite as complicated as last time 
sure enough we can we can vary this around and we   get all the look at that it's so good so good 
all the different regular angons by varying end   in that equation which i love immensely finally 
thanks to tristan we get this amazing triangle   here which is very similar to the other ones i can 
vary and to get a different regular n-gons very   very cool they get bigger it's kind of fun there 
you go it's like it's like i'm zooming into it   and back there we go you know i've not messed 
with c what does c do oh it's just the size   excellent good to have that as an option there you 
are i could just made it bigger and smaller that   way now there's one downside and one upside 
to what tristan has done here the downside is   technically it includes the origin so this spot 
here right in the middle of that zero is that   is actually part of the shape according to this 
equation don't get me wrong lovely equation it's   got a big cow capital pi so the capital of pi 
that's like the product version of summation so   that means you from k equals zero up to n you 
are multiply you evaluate that each time and   then you multiply them all together and that 
gives you the shape which is kind of fun but it   does mean if i turn on the dot here it's undefined 
outside the shape you go inside the shape and it's   defined and then right on the crossover at zero 
so technically we're coloring in all the points   where it's zero but if you put that in the origin 
it goes zero again so you can see i'm i'm a little   bit off but technically right in the center there 
yeah it gets super small it's actually zero right   on the origin so downside you get cool shapes you 
can zoom them in and out but it does have that one   annoying dot technically right in the very middle 
of the plot right there the upside to what tristan   has done however is this a whole separate plug 
look at this look at this little person i'm   gonna name them generic viewer excellent this is 
what i think of you all as a stick figure however   now i have actually not played with this before 
um a friend of mine sam heartburn went through   and double checked all the things that everyone's 
saying there were so many and she came up with   a short list of all the good ones and she says 
you've got to see this other plot that tristan's   made and i've saved it to have a look at it 
now if i vary h here what is walking okay good that's the most ridiculous and i've seen a lot of 
plots in my life that is the most ridiculous plot   i've ever seen the rest of the video is just 
this enough ridiculous plots we now have to   find equations for generalized triangles and we're 
going to do that using the triangle right from the   start and we're going to start with our triangle 
from before because lots of people sent me that   equation when i said there's no equation for a 
triangle they're like that's a triangle that's its   equation and i think this may be the most simple 
equation for a triangle but like i said before   it's for one very specific triangle in this case 
well obviously you can scale it up and down very   similar classic triangle base coordinates are 0 
1 for the top one up there zero on the x-axis one   on the y vertical you've also got positive one 
negative one to give us that corner down there   and then you've got negative one negative one to 
give us that corner over there but what if we want   to move those three corners to three new arbitrary 
locations now we've just got this is like x1 x2 x3   can we move them to these new points now there's a 
very long reddit thread that i will link to below   about this okay and that triangle and people say 
well why don't you just use an f9 transformation   that's great because that's a transformation that 
preserves straight lines good for things staying   as a triangle but doesn't care about angles angles 
are not preserved which is great because we want a   different triangle so all we have to do is find a 
transformation to go from our starting triangle to   any arbitrary new location and to do that we're 
going to use a matrix oh here we go may have   literally right in front of me there you are check 
out these matrices right so there's our original   coordinates that we're starting with and we want 
to move them to these new arbitrary coordinates   and to do that we've got a matrix transformation 
t there it is we've got to solve for t and   that's that's doable so first of all ah 
right okay check these out okay so that   bottom one that's the determinant of the new 
arbitrary matrix over there and then this is   the rest of the equation so you take all of 
these and now we've switched this to be like   a big x big y's you take all of that you plug 
it in there and magically it will move your   starting triangle to any new look at that any new 
arbitrary locator so so pleasing i'm i'm the   side beside the triangle with excitement i base 
that explanation of the matrix transformation on   some working out email to me by anson mansfield so 
huge thanks to them for sending it in all mistakes   and miscommunications are my own and they were 
far from the only person who got in touch i also   received an email from graham goebel and he sent 
me a whole different way of working it out and it   starts once again with three linear equations 
my equations from before actually started with   this same idea where you have three generalized 
linear equations and then you have to combine   them somehow such that they only give a value of 
zero if you're on the middle bit of the triangle   not the sticky out bits that technically carry 
on infinitely far in every direction that they're   going and i did that with either using the sine or 
absolute value to tell which side of these lines   you're on what graham did is he thought hang on 
a second you've got several different definitions   of the center of a triangle one of which is if 
you pick a point right at the middle that then   has a circle around that point which goes through 
every single vertex and that technically gives us   two regions of space on our plot we've got the 
outside region everything out here that we don't   want and we've got just the triangle in the middle 
so if we have a way of basically getting rid of   the outside of the circle that would give us an 
equation for a triangle and what graham did was   work out a function based on the equation of that 
circle make it a bit more ridiculously complicated   but this will not return a value outside the 
circle it's under defined but it will return a   value inside the circles could you taken square 
roots and you've got negative things going on   and so this was graham's great insight to give a 
function which is only defined where the triangle   exists but it's not defined outside the triangle 
so then the rest of it is what we did before you   just rearrange linear equations multiply them 
all together so you only get a value of zero   if you're on one of the three lines inside the 
defined region and doesn't matter this gives you   one because you're going to be multiplying it 
by a zero over here and that works a treat so   well done graham i really like that the equation 
that graham's come up with here the only issue   is that the exact vertices are on that circle 
so technically technically the vertices are not   captured by this equation but all of the edges 
are and the edges go right up to the infinitely   small vertices so even though the vertices 
are technically points with no length and no   size they're not there i mean so you're missing 
something infinitely small which some would say   does that really count i think it does for the 
next generalized triangle we're going back to   decimals another desmos another triangle and this 
is a classic where you've got the three different   equations for your linear functions and you just 
kind of piece just the bits you need together to   get the triangle and you can actually edit those 
so that i can increase that instead of being a one   it's now i don't know a three oh too big i regret 
that immensely and i accidentally added another   row let's get rid of that look at that that's too 
too much triangle i think we can all agree in fact   i don't want to add anything there it is perfect 
love it tiny tiny little pocket sized triangle   there you are and you're thinking well how do you 
how do you combine these three equations to give   you a single triangle there's there's the function 
is right there i think i think that's all of it is   there is there oh no look at it all it just keeps 
cut look is there more there's more when does it   it oh it's ended oh my goodness it's too much it's 
too much so it's it's all of this so what do we   got here you add each of the functions to its 
absolute value and you multiply those together   and then you separately add on the functions while 
subtracting the absolute values of the functions   and oh my goodness it basically means it's against 
another way of defining which side of each line   you're on positive or negative depending on if 
something is equal to its absolute value or not   and so it narrows you down to give you those 
and so yeah it i think it might be arguably it's   exactly the same concept as what i did in my 
first video but arguably you know despite   being terrifyingly long i think you could argue 
that's a nicer way to go about that same concept   has any one last triangle to have a look at 
finally we have this tweet from indigo killers   who has made a moving triangle that matches 
my original ridiculous matam generated animated   triangle and they put the cool spectrum on with 
the magenta and the cyan and it moves around it's   so great and technically yeah it's an equation 
they just kind of show it like all the kind of   workings are spread out but it's doing exactly the 
same thing as before it's working out how far away   a point is from the closest side of the triangle 
and then doing the coloring and everything else   accordingly i think that's really nice it turns 
out it is not only goes first rodeo when it comes   to graphics like this because well let's just 
say we're going to ignore desmos for a while and   have a look at shader toy here it is all of 
inigo's original code on shader toy i have a link   to this below fantastic website and you can see 
it animating around again and not only is this a   great website where you can show cool animations 
like this but actually indigo was the person who   founded this website they founded shader toy such 
a great website and so not only have they got   triangles they've also got a bunch of other shapes 
as well here are all the 2d ones done in the same   style rounded boxes orientated box segments run 
by parallelogram look at all these look at these   crazy things amazing and that's just 2d here are 
the 3d all of these 3d shapes are rendered using   equations so it's how far things are away it's 
so good let's have a look at you know what i'm   an arbitrary capped cylinder exact that's that's 
look at it oh i've never seen a cylinder so capped   and you can see all the code that it takes to 
to make that it's so nice so i'll link to it below   do check out shader toy i'd like to quickly thank 
the sponsor of this video it's my good friends at   jane street which is why i'm in the jane street 
triangle which is made up of new york london and   hong kong and fun fact i was the first speaker 
to visit all three of those offices and talk   to the gene street staff and interns so there 
you go because jane street they solve complex   mathematical problems in the financial world which 
means they're my kind of people and if you're into   maths and computing and you've watched a video 
about equations of triangles then you are also the   gene street kind of person they're always looking 
for mathematicians and programmers they can hire   and they offer some fantastic paid internships 
and courses for young people who are considering   a job in that industry so do check out the website 
below if you want to go along to one of their   courses internships apply for a job there and you 
may even see me because you've got all these three   different places so many places around the world 
i was in the hong kong one recently i'm not gonna   lie most of the interns i saw there were from 
australia what are you gonna do and actually   they were in hong kong for their internship but 
they're about to go to the new york office for   a while it's a fantastic company that exists all 
around the world and fun fact i was the first   person to visit every single office twice i need 
to do three times then we'll have a jane street   tetration it's pretty exciting anyway huge thanks 
to james street for making these videos possible   and now i'm going to hand you back out to regular 
matt who will probably i don't know thank you for   watching the video or something honestly he 
hasn't even got a beard that's it thank you   so much for watching the video a huge thanks 
to everyone who sent in a triangle equation or   equation for some kind of plot there was so many 
just an overwhelming number of them sent in and   i appreciated each and every single one of them 
all of you you're all you're all generic viewer   to me thank you so much for making these videos 
possible and we're going to finish with the   walking stick figure partly because i just want 
to see them walk it's so good a bunch more but   also we look at the whole equation let's drag 
that out shall we so there's there's it's not   too bad there's the oh my goodness a lot of 
flaws wait i can't do any i've got a scroll   can i scroll i can't even how do i see 
the rest of the equation oh don't hold out   oh here we go i can push across 
to the side so that's gonna   how much can there be more than 20 seconds we're 
going to run out of end card on this video i mean don't forget to like and subscribe i guess place your bets on when this 
equation will end oh my goodness foreign
