i recently discovered that using clever 
mathematics you can algorithmically identify   the tail of a humpback whale in a photograph. 
and i'm not saying like just that's a tale it's   a whale we're talking the individual whatever 
that whale's name is you can identify which   specific whale that is because tourists like 
both going everywhere and photographing the   tales of whales you can use that data set 
of tourist photos to algorithmically follow   track and analyze the migration patterns of 
humpback whales absolutely amazing however   take a closer look at the maths behind this and 
maybe find a whale of my own i'd have to head   off to antarctica. yep we're off to antarctica 
where we're gonna have... a whale at a time this video about whales machine learning and 
spreadsheets, get ready, is part of the series   i filmed in antarctica and this specific 
video is sponsored by private internet   access they are the vpn that i use because 
they're 100% open source and they have a no   logs provably no logs policy at the moment if you 
use privateinternetaccess.com/standoutmaths it's   a mere two dollars and 11 cents a month once you 
factor in that you get three months for free and   they are the vpn i used while i was in antarctica 
filming this video and for the record the video is   not sponsored by hurtigruten i had to give them 
a lot of money to get myself to antarctica and   it's not sponsored by happy whale i approached 
them because i realized they were doing some   very interesting mathematics in their pursuit of 
identifying whales and spotting identifying animal   as well a trip to antarctica is all about and we 
saw a lot of penguins possibly too many penguins   although one day i saw a penguin fall off an 
iceberg best day of my life dolphins, other sea   creatures the works but there is no bigger animal 
spotting prize than a whale we saw a few different   types of whales sometimes they do an announcement 
on the ship saying where whales have been spotted   sometimes you'd just be looking at the ocean and 
a spout of water would suddenly go up and you know   there's a whale there and like this time there'd 
be a commotion and you realize someone else has   seen a whale and i was filming a different bit 
for a different one of my antarctica videos i   heard the commotion i ran over and there were some 
humpback whales close-ish there was one time when   a tower went up in the air but was a bit too far 
away and then another time i managed to zoom in on   my camera oh i think it was just close enough 
there might just be enough resolution in this   image to be able to automatically identify that 
whale so i logged into my account on happy whale   yes we we had wi-fi and antarctica is ridiculous 
i know i was able to upload the image not that   fast but still you know antarctica wi-fi and then 
into the details about what ship i was on where i   saw the whale the latitude and longitude as well 
as which bay we're on the antarctic peninsula   on the west side and that was it then i just had 
to wait while happy wales algorithms crunched away   to see if they could recognize what whale owned 
the tail i had seen the important thing is though   what is the math we're using to identify these 
whales the people at happywell had to find a way   they could automatically identify whales from 
images of their tails and so they turned to the   website kaggle this is owned by google it's an 
online community for analyzing data and machine   learning and so what they did was they started a 
competition and there's all sorts of competitions   on this one of my favorites is the titanic one 
this is a data set of most of the people on the   thai titanic whether or not they survived the 
sinking or not you train some kind of machine   learning algorithm on that and then they give you 
a test set of data where you get the details about   the people but no information about if they lived 
or not and you've got to try and predict it and   people compete to get the best algorithms and 
there's all sorts of options on here in their   words we gave the competitors five well-curated 
catalogs of humpback whale fluke images to develop   train and test algorithms to achieve the desired 
automated matching of humpback whale individuals   they actually provided 25 361 training images that 
had the identity of the whale as part of the data   set and then there was a test set of 7960 images 
with no identification assigned and so people had   to try and work out which whales those 7960 were 
they then submitted what they thought the matches   were didn't have to provide their algorithm yet 
and people were ranked by how accurate they were   they then contacted the top five ranked entrants 
to see what their algorithm was and if it could be   implemented and it worked here's the grand result 
advanced image recognition a fully automated high   accuracy photo identification matching system for 
humpback whales and of those top five responses   i mean they ended up using the third ranked one 
which was able to correctly identify 97.1 of the   unlabeled images amazing but of all top five four 
of them all used densely connected convolutional   networks so we'll go into that in more detail 
the one that didn't use a convolutional network   used other methods that actually needed at 
least an order of magnitude more processing   power to achieve the same results so this is 
clearly the way to go but what is a densely   connected convolutional network we're densely 
connected just means lots of connections so   we're going to ignore that the network part is 
a neural network and that has been explained   far better than i can i'm not going to use this 
video to explain what a neural network is because   3blue1brown has already done that perfectly and 
they uses their example image processing here is   an image of a handwritten nine in this case and 
then they show how you can take that handwritten   image each pixel becomes a single node and then 
it goes into this a neural network so every single   node at the beginning here is one pixel from 
the image and then you've got these links and   each one's weighted and what the value is in each 
of these determines what the combined value is in   these based on the weighted links which control 
these which control these 10 end ones and there's   10 of them because one corresponds to each digit 
from zero to nine and whichever one lights up with   the biggest value is the digit the neural network 
thinks the original hand-drawn symbol was and it   works neural networks are absolutely amazing and 
through blue one brown i mean grant just knocked   out of the park with these videos so i highly 
recommend you go and check them out however what   i thought i would give an extra explanation on is 
this word convolutional and grant briefly mentions   this as a type of network in their videos but this 
is a particular type of neural network that's very   good at working on images and the issue is images 
have too many pixels for example if we take my   picture of a whale tail open it in photoshop crop 
it down to one just small low resolution version   that's still 93 pixels by 60 pixels and if we 
grayscale that we've now got 5 580 different   values which are going into our neural network 
and this is a tiny image big images are going   to have way more pixels going in that's too many 
nodes in our neural network we need to simplify   that down somehow against my bit of judgment i'm 
going to try and make a convolutional layer for   machine learning you know analyzing an image in 
excel which i am already regretting so what i've   done so far is i've pasted in all our values 
so every single cell is one of those pixels   and they're all different values between zero 
and one and actually i've inverted them so that   white cells are zero and black cells are one 
i'm not going to select the entire image and i'm   going to use conditional formatting so if i 
go into additional formatting here i'm going   to use a classic spectrum with the lowest value 
so the background is going to be white and then   the maximum value of the foreground are going 
to be black and in theory this should give us a   oh it's oh it's loading a bit okay excel very much 
not designed for there it is okay not designed for   this has taken a while but you can see there's 
the whale tail appearing and actually i'm going   to zoom out a little so we can see it all look 
at that so that is my original image of the whale   tail this just values in a spreadsheet but as 
we established too many values imagine an even   bigger picture we couldn't put all of these into 
a neural network too many nodes so we're going to   get a filter often called a kernel which is much 
much smaller i'm going to do a little four by   four one up here in the corner okay so i filled 
this in it's eight negative ones eight positive   ones you take this four by four grid and you 
apply it to every possible 4x4 grid in here so   you apply it to this 4x4 you apply it to this 
four by four you apply it to this four by four   when i say apply it i mean you multiply all the 
matching squares by the matching values and then   you add them all up so actually let's try and 
do that over here so we'll zoom out and we'll   apply that to every single pixel in the image 
so we're going to basically copy it over here   but multiplied by this so that first cell is that 
one times that one plus that one times that one thanks to the magic of editing here it is 
now so i've set all the ones over here to   be absolute references so that stays still on 
my kernel the filter and then these ones here   are relative so they'll move around and i've used 
an if then statement to do basically a rectified   linear unit so if it's below zero zero if it's 
above zero it equals itself just it's it's the   way you'll scale things in machine learning and 
then that one there is a zero i can now stretch   this out to i worked it out it's gl that would 
be the same size image again and there we are   there's our duplicate image huh well once again 
we want to use some additional formatting so we   can see what's going on there so there's a same 
thing and again background is going to be why   interesting features are going to be black it's 
not zero to one this time but this will scale and   we'll see what it looks like and oh look at that 
oh my goodness so now you can see we've gone from   the original image with all sorts of stuff going 
on to now this and it's picked out features it's   picked out there's a line here there's a line 
there this is like a line finding algorithm but   because i've coded it up like i can mess around 
with it a bit so what if instead of it being up   and down what if i switched you know what let's 
make the middle zero see if that changes anything well that's probably a better line finding 
algorithm i could take out oh look at that one   oh that's just nothing that doesn't work 
okay let's put the ones at the bottom again   yeah look at that that's not a bad filter so 
now we've lost a lot of the noise and we're just   pulling out certain features so actually i'm going 
to switch this half to be all zeros and then this   side i'm going to put in some more negative ones 
and so what i'm doing now this oh look at that   that's given us a type of feature what 
if these were ones oh look at that   i got a lot more noise coming oh that's too 
much that's too close to the original that's   all the noise back so i'm this is this is machine 
learning by hand i'm tweaking tweaking these knobs   to see oh no that's just a blurry version of 
the original tweaking the knobs manually in   this case to see what filter i can use to pull 
out the features i'm after and so there now you   can see i'm favoring vertical features and so oh 
ignore the strap on oh i went too far this stripe   on the side is where we've wrapped off the edge 
of the image let's just clear that because   we've now got smaller because it's for each four 
by four grid fits and so here we go so that that   i've just messed around i put some values in you 
can see this is now pulling out these vertical and   sloped features and so this convolutional layer 
means that we can take our original images instead   of taking in every single pixel we run this kernel 
over it and we filter it down to just interesting   features and then only these get passed into the 
neural network and of course we can do this with   multiple different filters and it worked from 
the final report they say when compared against   the workflow of manually matching the automated 
workflow including manual match confirmation   station reduce the time required for matching 
by at least 98 isn't that incredible and they're   going to add that it reduced error rates from 
approximately six to nine percent down to one   to three percent depending on the image quality 
thresholds that's including the low quality images   basically they even say that the error rates go 
to near zero for high quality images absolutely   incredible it's made a huge impact i will link 
to the paper below if you want to go check it out   they've also said that access to the algorithm 
and the supporting information architecture is   available for use at no cost via their website 
happywale.com so go check that out as well but   it does now raise the question if they've managed 
to cut this down over 98 of the manual matching   version what on earth was the manual matching 
version how do you do this manually thankfully the   ship i was on in antarctica the ms rolled amundsen 
was as well as being a floating luxury tree hotel   don't get me wrong with also a science ship so 
they had a full-on science lab all sorts of great   science excursions and data collection i had so 
much fun if you go to standupmath.com antarctica   it will take you to the herty gruten website that 
i booked i mean i paid for this trip myself my   patreon supporters will be very pleased to know 
but if you want to go on the same trip i cannot   ever recommend it please do check that out an 
event on board they had a science coordinator this   is zoe walker and when she was doing science she 
had to identify humpback whales the old school way   so i asked her how on earth they did it and zoe 
you used to have to look the whales up in a book   to say how how on earth do you look up a 
whale in a book well it's a very very big book   it's just a very large catalog so the whale 
tails the humpback whales their tail pattern can   be sort of broken down into general categories 
so you start based on the amount of whiteness   on the tail so they range you know abcd from 
mostly black to mostly white and then you can   see different patterns so maybe the white 
is at the stock or the bottom or the top   and and so you start there and that narrows 
it down a bit and then you just spend a lot of   time narrowing it down a lot more because i was 
wondering how on earth we would you can't put   wales in alphabetical order not so well no but you 
can do it by like percentage of white there's   a penguin that's just floated by as well i don't 
know if that's yeah that's a penguin what kind   that i want to say magellanic correct ding ding 
ding here we have another creature please identify   this from my continued cooperation that looks 
like it's going to be a a black brown albatross   someone has been look at that science program whoo 
ah i feel like i'm bordering on being a biologist   yeah okay so so if you want to identify a whale 
yes you look at the percentage of white yeah you   flick through the whale of a book find that and 
then and then there's just like pictures of tails   pretty much and you've got to locate the yeah more 
or less so they kind of come in distinct patterns   so if you look at enough whales you start to 
see it's not just the percentage of them but also   you know more along the bottom or more along 
the top edge or from the middle going out or   asymmetrical of course is everybody's favorite 
default category and then you just spend hours   until you find the well you're after you just 
flicked yeah you start to become familiar   with them and if they've been seen in that 
area regularly then you kind of know where   to look but it's actually very interesting over 
time because the whale tales evolve as they get   new scars and new barnacle marks and maybe boat 
damage which is unfortunate but we do see it so   you might get one that you're like this is a 90 
match but actually it's something a bit new now   the the the the the whale has aged yeah and 
the patina of ocean life right now okay but joe   you'd be pretty happy if you could automate the 
bulk of that to just take a photo of the tail   and it tells you the whale i think it's one of 
the best uses of technology we have there you go an email's just arrived let's have a look an 
individual you encountered in antarctica was   determined to be new to science to the best of 
our knowledge and has been assigned an official   well number we hope you're pretty excited i'm 
pretty excited the problem probably oh sorry do   you want to take it from okay the problem is a few 
days later i got another email it turns out they   weren't able to match it to a different whale 
in the database giving it the new catchy name hwmn1300439 however it was still a whale i managed 
to cite it was recognized in happy whale and it   did not yet have a name and that was something i 
could fix back to you voice over matt here is my   whale you can see since i saw it down here in the 
antarctica peninsula actually if i zoom out you   can see the rest of antarctica which is huh a lot 
skinnier and more repetitive than i remember it   being projection joke okay anyway let's spot it up 
here in chile it's pretty exciting you can see   the people who saw it down there and the pictures 
they took and actually where's my pictures it's in   this group here no that's not my picture that's 
me oh that's mine there it is oh and these people   saw it too hilda and v who are these people hilda 
and v i guess they were on the hurtigrutin ship   same with me ha i mean it was a fun ship there 
was a lot of people on there but i didn't realize   anyone else cleaned up it's my picture let's have 
a look is it just my photo or do they get a photo   too no just me oh they just said they saw it oh 
come on those free loaders but more importantly   hasn't been named yet right so it's swimming 
around it's still called unnamed or hw mn1300-439   however if you have a look up here you can 
name your whale right if you donate money   to a whale or ocean charity you can then name 
the whale and so i'm gonna name it krill bill   krill bell if you think you've got a better and 
or funnier whale name find your own whale get to   antarctica and work it out for yourself wow i 
really am in the middle of nowhere here and as   that fog rolls in i could be anywhere much like 
this video sponsor private internet access.com   stand-up maths means that your computer or 
phone or any device could be anywhere and   private internet access is really useful when 
traveling i can open the app on my phone i can   go through the list of where all the servers are 
i can connect to them look at all these countries   i would then pick one in the uk so here we go 
let's go to london and then it just connects   and now all the traffic from my phone is going 
via london i can carry on doing business as if   i was at home and i'm only paying two dollars 
and 11 cents a month to connect to any country   i want and as a bonus hypothetically bypass 
any content restrictions on a wi-fi network and   in a emergency so you know the video about how 
there's no equation to plot a triangle i was   actually finishing that while i was in antarctica 
and i had matam my plotting software running on   my machine at home and i don't want to go to the 
details but because we do have onboard wi-fi in   antarctica it's ridiculous i was able to finish 
the video remotely because the onboard wi-fi here   had no idea what i was doing online what websites 
i was visiting what may or may not be blocked i   was able to finish my video and it went out on 
youtube so huge thanks to this video sponsor   privateinternaccess.com stand up maths hold up 
rewind did you spot that in the background that   was a whale i didn't even realize there's one 
behind me when i was filming that antarctica is   amazing if you can get that you must go there's 
just incredible wildlife everywhere and i had   a lot of fun i mean i'm not a biologist but 
i really enjoyed spotting it in fact as you   saw i think i got so good at spotting wildlife i 
may have actually earned a legit biology degree wow the posters here oh i did get a legit biology   degree check that out and 
it wasn't even on purpose
