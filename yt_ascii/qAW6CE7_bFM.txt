before you read the donation. - mr. beast.
- this donation, oh. - are you a kid, yes, sir, i am. thanks for the $10. - wow, he was very quick. all right, guess he's a kid. but i don't think he's as
kid-kid as the last kid. - i don't know. - because you are not as kid-kid as the last kid, you get normal kid money not kid-kid money. - oh, there it is. oh, wait, no way. - does it read it? - because you're not a
kid-kid as the last kid, you get normal kid money not a kid money. what does that even mean? oh my god, bro. you're crazy. a whole grand? - a whole, not a half. - jesus. - i underestimated your kidness, here you go, kid. - dude, you're way too kind, bro. - i know. i'm kidding, kidding. - jesus. oh, i underestimated your
kidness, here you go, kid. another. oh my god, dude. $2,010. - i should donate eight, so it's 2018. - it's more money than i've ever made

this staple of a little kid. have you ever seen a guy over
the age of 13 with a beard? no. so there's a good chance he's a kid, but i need to make sure. are you a kid? - first off. let's see how he responds. - mrbeast6000. - to this crucial question.
- thanks for the time. and are you a kid? no, i turned lately 29. so i think that passes
the stage of being a kid. - 29 does not sound like a kid. - you could also type it in the chat and i could let you know. didn't have to donate 10
bucks for that question. - so much shade was thrown. - thanks a lot, much appreciated. - oh no, i'm more mind blown. i didn't realize there was a chat there, i don't have to donate to
people to talk to them? - but he wishes he was a kid. - but he's not a kid. all right, next one. wow, this guy actually looks really young. i think we got a good
chance of him being a kid. are you a kid? - yo, mrbeast6000. - [electronic voice] are you a kid? - i am somebody's kid, i am. - i need a yes or no, it's for science. - do you mean a kid by less than'? i don't think i'm. i don't think so. - no, i was literally about
to donate a hundred dollars. guess we can't give him money then? - ah. he should have just stopped talking. - he did it to himself. - what are you doing, man? - are you a kid? i'm pretty sure you are, but not certain. [music] oh, i, oh lord [music] - am i a kid? i mean, i can be a little boy if you want. - what did we just do? - no, i'm old dude. i'm old and wrinkly. - sorry for even bringing this up. - is that a joke? - mr. beast 5000? - one off, there. - i feel like that's a troll though. thank you. - should i type in chat so
that she knows i'm real? - yeah. - it's real. thank you. i don't know what else to say. now i'm emotional piece of. - you told me you had a green. - she's definitely not a kid. kids don't curse. - holy. - are you a kid? it's time for the test. will he pass?
- what? yo, what? yo, what? hold up, hold up, hold up. with a hundred dollars? mr. beast just tipped. yo, hold up. a hundred dollars donation. - well, he passed the test boys. - are you a kid? i'm not a kid, no, i'm 21. - no. are you sure about that? - that's insane. wait, hold up, what just happened? - we'll give him a shot at redemption. - yo dude, what are you talking about? what is happening? yo, what is happening? you, this guy's just donated again, bro. - i just wanna know, are you a kid? - that's od. that's actually crazy. - what does od mean? - what does od mean? - [electronic voice] what does od mean? - so od just means like, like that's od. it's like, overdose. like that's crazy, that's wild. - oh, okay, that makes sense. that just proves he's not a kid, a kid wouldn't be teaching us things. we would be teaching the kid. all right, well, guess we gotta move on. are you a kid, answer carefully. we're struggling to find kids, so we're going to minecraft. he just got banned. dude, he got banned as i donated. - [electronic voice] answer carefully. - am i a kid? no. - ah.
- i'm not a kid. thank you for the a
hundred dollars, mr. beast. are you the mr. beast? - are you not a kid? i feel so bad, they're
all gonna watch this video and feel terrible but rules are rules. i don't make the rules. pewdiepie clearly tells me what
to do, i'm just his puppet. kids are typically bald, this is undoubtedly a kid. have you ever seen a grown up bald? are you a kid? - are you a kid, please say yes. no, i'm not. interesting question but no. - i have a reason for it, okay. - someone's plays minecraft that has to be a kid. - ah, no. now he's making me feel bad, no. no, it was a bad joke, soz. - so now goes, is it
like the same mr. beast as the one that's on youtube? who does those crazy videos
and donations and stuff or? - yeah, he's clearly seen the donation. - anyway, i appreciate your generosity. - yeah, i don't know what just
happened, but let's move on. is you a kid? - your first donation. mr. is you a kid? oh my god, dude, mr. beast. - that's actually funny, we're his first ever donation. - i've been sub since one
mil dude, absolute legend. mr. beast. answer the question, well
dude, i'm a kid, man. is you a kid.
- he's a kid. - 100% a kid. - oh, he is a kid.
- 100. - 100%, all right. well there's no doubt in this
kid's mind that he's a kid, there's no doubt in my
mind he deserves $2,000. - woo, that's kid money. that's real kid money.
- here is kid money, kid. - thanks for that donation,
i'm using that to buy. two thou. oh my god. oh my, dude, that's a lot of money. dude, mr. beast, dude,
you're an absolute legend. - no, stand down, he's a kid. - oh.
- we're good. - if you guys are not following mr. beast. - i agree, if you're not
following my instagram, mr. beast, you're a loser. - is this a sponsored video, bro? - no, it's not sponsored. all this money's coming
outta my bank account 'cause i hate money. for those of you that don't know, twitch just released a feature where you can actually gift a
hundred subscribers on twitch. which, a subscriber costs $5, so basically i can give a hundred people in her chat a free
subscription to her channel. all right, then we'll just do 44 'cause that's how many viewers she has. or 50. should i.
- all right, here he goes. - all right.
- oh these buttons. - oh, look at her chat. - [electronic voice] thank you. - what? - look at her chat.
- holy crap. - oh, what, what the, what, what? - now, the subs are non-refundable, so. - what just happened? - the reactions are a lot better 'cause they actually know it's real, whereas sometimes when i donate, they don't know if it's real. - what just happened? oh. holy mole, yeah, okay, mr. beast, thank you so much for fif. i don't understand why, but thank you. and mr. beast, thank you very much. holy, yeah, i don't know what to say. - we're gonna keep our
defenses up and switch. he's clearly a kid, we don't have to ask. what we need to determine is,
is he a kid-kid or just a kid. - he is playing roblox. - that's true, he's a kid-kid. you are obviously a kid. keep fighting for pewdiepie. the only thing standing between t-series and being number one, is
the kids of the world. we must support them. i just realized he's playing
freaking call of, dude. oh, there it is. - it's actually. oh my. oh my god. - look how delayed that reaction was. - no. no, there's no way, that can't be the. no, that can't be the real,
that can't be the real. - he's just got $2,500 and he's gotta go tell his mom. he just ran outta the room, so i assume that's what he's doing. - i hope he tells his mom, he's got. - god only knows what
they're gonna do with taxes. - irs is gonna be like, open up. - fbi, open up. - why didn't your son pay taxes? i dunno. is this pewdiepie? it's a fact, only pewdiepie plays amnesia. - [electronic voice] is this pewdiepie? - this is not pewdiepie though, i'm sorry to disappoint. - all right, new person. is this pewdiepie? he needs volunteers to help stop t-series. i got you, pewdiepie. - mrbeast6000 says, is this pewdiepie? no. - chris, keep your defense up. he's clearly not pewdiepie.
- holy crap. can we please get a lot
of love in the chat guys? - what an impersonator. - what a legend. - i hate when people
impersonate pewdiepie. - that's ironic. - 'cause that's what we're doing. is this pewdiepie? - mini minute hortatas. - what the. mr. beast, what the. - i need an answer. do i lower my guard or do i attack? - i actually killed pewdiepie
yesterday in a solo game. - really, all right, i don't care anymore. that deserves lots of money. really, she killed pewdiepie. gg, you are new pewds. just, she killed pewdiepie, that clearly means she's better than him. - i don't think it's gonna go through. i don't know if that card's
gonna have 1,500 on it. - my $1,500 donation
never went through, so. or euro1,500, that's like $2,000. we're gonna take a little break and try to figure out what paypal's doing. we donated that girl euro1,500 yesterday and it never popped up, so i don't know what paypal was doing, but the money went through,
but she never got notified. i don't know, it's confusing. hopefully it's working now. my dollar is upside down because it is going to australia. i really have no idea what
i'm about to send them. - [electronic voice] my
dollar is upside down because it is going to australia. - what the. - well, 'cause australia's on
the other side of the world. so it's upside down, obvious. - surely that's fake.
- surely that's fake. - surely that's not real. - i know i had a hard time believing kangaroos use money too, but i'm pretty sure it's real. what game is you. i feel bad for whoever hosted him, 'cause i was gonna give
him a bunch of money but now this guy gets a bunch of money. - dude, is it actually legit? wait, what's happening. jesus christ. - [electronic voice] i was
about to donate to a guy but he hosted you, lol. - that's the guy right there. - it's not real mr. beast if
he doesn't tip his fedora. you are correct, mate. let's find someone that's
not a kangaroo next. are you a kangaroo? i'm pretty confident she's not a kangaroo because it's pretty hard for
a kangaroo to hold a weapon. - the thing is, i don't know. is that real? that's not real. nah, it's not real. it's from a company. is that a youtuber? it's from a company. no, please, don't. - i just need an answer. is she part of the kangaroo army, or not. - can i yell out the company? i don't know if this is real or not. - it'd be real, m-a. - why would you do that? - i had a question that
i really needed answered. are all twitch streamers kangaroos? - i don't know what to do now. i feel like i should be crying, but i'm just very confused. - me too. i don't know if you're
a human or kangaroo. do we have to put our defenses back up? will this prove i'm real? - oh, there it is. - oh, hey, i bought a bunch of subs. there, does she believe me now? - oh my god. - oh, that's gonna be on
the screen for a minute. - [electronic voice] mrbeast6000. - see, that's the reaction we wanted but they don't ever know i'm real. all right, let's move on. i wuv you. oh, we're hitting it with the big 2k. - is the question. also. that's gonna be a chargeback, right? nah, if not, then i just
got euro1,700 donation. holy, my dudes. i'm gonna be careful
with that, but what the? that is a lot, man. thank you very much for
that, dude, if this is real. i gotta be honest, that's. - he's a cool guy, let's gift him. - i'm gonna be a bit careful
of that, that's $2,000. - i donated him a bunch of subscribers. - all right. yo, what the, mr. beast? oh my god. and then also gifts over 50 subs as well. and a community gift, thank
you very much for that, dude, once again. what the hell are you, actual legend mate. 50 sub gifts coming over from mr. beast, thank you very much for that, dude. that is very kind of you, man. holy, dude. - let's do a hundred. - look at the chat, going nuts. - i think that's my favorite part is just watching the chat. - what is that? i can't scroll to the top, what the is happening? is that the real guy, holy. - i'm not wearing a fedora,
so i'm clearly fake. - thank you for the 100 subs. - wait, did we do a hundred? - yeah you said.
- oh, whoops. i meant to do 50. well, since i accidentally
gave her too many subs, the only logical thing to
do is to buy more subs. i meant to do 50 and i
accidentally did a hundred so now i gotta do 50 again 'cause that's what i'm meant to do. that's logic, right?
- that's basic math. - wait a minute, i think i meant to do a hundred subscribers. frick, so then i gotta do a hundred again 'cause i meant to do a hundred. - is that how that works? - it is. i think this time i'm gonna get it right. all right, so this time
i think i did it right. i gave her another hundred subscribers. shed tears, woman. - holy shit. - tears, woman. - no, i'm not crying, you. theme changes every month and you get to be drawn in
as whatever you want to be. - ah, that's pretty cool. yeah, i just wanna be a kangaroo. i want to be a kangaroo. - he can be a kangaroo god. - hey, let's make a time lapse of this. i just shouted out this guy's stream. if you want a free subscription for when i do things like this, go follow my instagram, it'll
be linked to description. i'll put a little swipe up on my story and you can check out streamers. so if you follow on my instagram next time i do one of these
things, you can watch it live. i mean, who doesn't wanna see me donate tens of thousands of dollars live. go follow my instagram. - sub me daddy, where's
the sub mr. beast, hello? - we're gonna give him a hundred. - holy, what is going on? oh my god. what? what is going on? you gonna break my obs dude. bro, i just sit, i'm sitting here, enjoying my miso soup, watching my boy pop off,
and this is happening. - i think we do another hundred. more subscribers. - send the reinforcements. - go, go, go, go.
- you guys have. legit. all right, mr. beast,
how many subs is that? i can't even keep count. - he has over a thousand followers now. this guy was the smallest of
the smallest of streamers. more of you need to follow me on instagram so when we shout out people,
they get more viewers. go, go, go. i think more people get subs. - holy. this is mental. [music] are you ready [music] - never heard of this one. - old meme, but never dead, okay? where we at, where's this fan? - it's probably dead,
i've never heard of it. - yeah, yeah, yeah.
