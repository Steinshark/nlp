ladies and gentlemen you are probably watching this video because you are a fan of chess maybe you play chess maybe you spectate top tournaments maybe you enjoy going down to your local pub and playing once a week with some friends or maybe in contrast to what i just said this is the first ever chess video that you've ever clicked on welcome to the chess world now there is a clear disconnect in chess between the type of chess you play and the type of chess top level players play top level players almost always play not to lose there is a meta strategy involved to minimize risk whereas 900 elo chess is complete chaos i mean there are pieces flying all over the place pieces blundered left and right checkmates for both players but sometimes the top players play like you and sometimes like me and that is what i'm going to be showing you in today's video this was an absolutely breathtaking creative crazy exhilarating chess game sometimes in chess two people just want to get in a fight they just want to fight that's what they want to do they want to punch each other in the face repeatedly and that is basically what happened in this game this game was played a couple of days ago at a major major elite tournament and it was boris savchenko who believe is a maybe in his mid-30s maybe he he he's 40 years of age versus java h thought of so savchenko has been a grand master for many many years so don't be deceived by his rating at 2479 he's been very very strong and sarov is the number two player in usbekistan and he's just underneath the rating of noir abdulov javak sarov is an olympic champion he was a gold medalist with the usc team very very good player let's watch this game so boris opened with the english all right c4 and generally when you open with c4 you are trying to not play the queen's pawn because there are certain things white can do you're also kind of hoping that black will play e5 which is the reverse sicilian and then you know you get into a very very dynamic game but synov played g6 and i mean look this is just leading to a typical bishop on g7 position and likely a king's indian defense like if black wants to play a king's indian defense in chess you can't really stop it it's a choice all right which is why on the second move boris decided well look sarov is playing like this so i'm going to play d4 sarov plays knight to f6 so again he could have played bishop g7 but he plays knight f6 to prevent e4 if he had played bishop g7 there is a good chance that you know savchenko would have just taken the entirety of the center and we do teach beginners that you need to put as many pawns in the center as you can really if your opponent gives up the center i would you know capture as much of the center as possible but the game takes a turn in an unexpected direction right away because after starting out with a traditional opening this is a very very very very well-known opening sachenko here plays f3 this is a very weird move the idea of this move is designed to prevent black from playing an opening known as the grunfeld and the point of that is that if black play if white plays knight to c3 black could just play a king's indian like this this setup but black can play d5 and this is one of the most studied one of the most dynamic complex openings in chess it's known as the grunfeld and so what white does sometimes is play this move f3 which kind of stops this move because now there's no knight to trade so white never offered up a knight exchange so instead white gets a big boy center all right f3 now here black can still play d5 but black can also play c5 bishop g7 d6 no none of that happens the game now leaves known territory of tens of thousands of games into a position that has literally never happened before ever so sarov now does not develop the bishop to g7 he plays d6 which is fine white plays knight c3 and now black can simply go here and we enter a king's indian defense for whatever reason sarv decides he does not want to do that sarov decides after setting up three of the four moves i guess you know three fifths of the moves required to play the kings indian he now strikes the center this move has literally never happened at top level ever in a serious tournament so this way of playing from a known position on move four we leave all that so both guys completely have to play the game on their own now savchenko closes the center he had an option to play this move and then he you know trade the queens but i think basically the argument here is that white is kind of in their own way so white can't develop the bishop or the knight and actually black already has a microscopic advantage which is why after d5 you know the position is kind of resembling more of a king's indian and again after bishop g7 there would be e4 and we would be in a kings indian it's a king's indian defense but sarov was so inclined to mix things up he wanted to get enough fight so bad he played knight to h5 and already is threatening a fatal blow to the white position queen to h4 check is good night so if you play something like e4 after queen h4 check you cannot go here cuz i'm going to take and then you probably have to move your king and maybe you will survive but this is miserable and that's only if you play e4 right like this is winning for black if you don't defend correctly knight to h5 we have officially left alln theory on the fifth move of the game that's how you know know a top level chess game is going to be a good scrap so queen to h4 is threatened by sarov which is why savchenko plays g3 but sarov plays f5 so he is very quickly marching into the white position despite not having sufficient development cuz white also doesn't really have sufficient development this is not a very nice position to be playing so but savchenko responds in a you know in a very normal way plays e4 tries to take the center and if if you give white the possibility he will develop pieces very very quickly and maybe he will even castle the other way so you will do all of this attacking stuff but then white will just go the other way and you have no attack sarov plays f4 right so he's targeting this pawn and if you take again queen h4 is absolutely brutal you have to move your king if you push queen h4 is absolutely brutal and now you're going to lose your rook because i go here and if takes then then takes so what do you do against f4 like if you defend it that's one thing but then i will probably continue going over so you know what sachenko does this is how you know a game is going to be good you leave known theory on move five and a king is walking on the eighth move of the game the king has to defend the integrity of the castle this is a bad sign but apparently it's the best move because in reality the king is completely safe exactly where he is so sarov now thinks and he doesn't even hesitate he continues the assault i mean this this literally looks like 2700s are playing playing g5 so the queen is now blocked but the pawn is arriving if pawn takes black will take with the pawn and the queen will come back to the h4 square so g5 very very tough position now funny funny funny little thing here okay savenko thinks for a little bit and he plays the best move but if i ask you what the best move is here for white you might have no idea the best move is positional let's do a little bit of trivia are you any good at math how many many black pawns are on dark squares let's count them 1 2 3 4 5 6 six out of eight pawns that's 75% for those of you that are fractionally inclined now 75% means that black's dark squares are really really really good but what it also means is that black's light squared bishop is actually very important because it means the light squares are very weak which is why savchenko goes here because savchenko has a bunch of light squired pawns so it's this interesting dichotomy between light and dark colors and bishop to h3 is purely designed to trade the bishop away the knight goes back to f6 to bring more attack and savchenko doesn't hesitate trades the light squared bishop because without it he is completely confident black does not have an attack and guess what he is right it is now plus point4 and he in the face of all of this plays the move h4 you talk about a gangster move this man is doing the equivalent of a poker calling of the bluff he is saying javah here i might be 2479 but that is a fake rating all right you might be 2701 but i have the advantage from this opening h4 is a crazy move h4 leaves this pawn to hang and only be defended by the king and the idea is to just destroy this pawn structure and walk the king to safety black takes the craziest thing about this position is that safo could actually take on g3 now king h4 he's not going to play the king the king is bald but he's not that bold okay but he can take with the rook instead what he does is he uses the pawn as an umbrella pawn okay this is a pawn that you hide behind you use the opponent's pawn as a shield from the reain of the pieces right g takes h4 rook takes h4 and suddenly where is the black attack where is it okay you play rook g8 that's great you defend the pawn but now savchenko is just going to play around your extra pawn this is your extra pawn and if savchenko can trade the queens if he could trade the rooks he's just going to be better he's just going to have an advantage he's going to push these pawns life is going to be good so he plays knight e2 queen d7 and like i just said he is about to play the entire game around that pawn so i would play queen b3 bishop b3 maybe slowly you kind of threaten that you're going to take this pawn but give it a a little while no he takes it right away that's a very bold decision he did not have to do that right he could have just let the pawn sit and again i'm i'm trying to explain this kind of to you let's say knight a6 just like a very you know simple and straightforward castles if white gets to a position where he controls this knight takes back the pawn he's just going to be comfortably better so that is what black wants he wants to get his pieces in like that knight takes g3 savchenko takes and this kind of unclogs the pores of the black position now sar of is attacking the white king again but knight e2 and i mean how do you break through this black has absolutely nothing but that is we are just getting started all right this was the appetizer the appetizer of the opening was the white king being on g2 this king is about to get some serious cardio bishop e7 rook is kind of hanging not exactly but you have you know you can sacrifice this and open it up yeah queen h1 he says you know what you want to do something against this rook go ahead queen h1 my idea is queen h3 get in there move my king move the knight to f5 pressure the h pawn white is just doing very very well sarov brings the other knight to the party zenko moves up i talked about this already right he has eyes on this diagonal he's got pressure on the h file how is black going to do anything sindara made all of these really aggressive pawn moves and now he can't do anything in the position queen f7 now it's time to move the king king went there there to help now the king's going back we unpin ourselves and we're ready with knight f5 knight f5 is a problematic move it is a serious problem after long castle knight f5 i'm really not sure what black deck's move is black has literally one idea in this position and it's maybe to double the rooks maybe do something like this and guess what like very simply i can just start whoop i jumped ahead of mo i can just start trading pieces and you're going to get anywhere not to mention i have forks so it's really bad but sarov is not going to get trampled he got to 2701 for a reason and he plays the move h5 h5 doesn't even look at the what is it even doing if anything h5 just loses a pawn but that's the point he wants the pawn to be taken cind prefers the h file is open for both of his rooks to come in he is giving up the pawn on purpose but there's another idea behind the move you see saf chenko doesn't take he puts the knight on f5 he has a dominant positional advantage he's going to go knight h6 next sarov shows he is 2700 for a reason and the defense of the white position is an illusion and here he plays knight to g4 and as far as i'm concerned this can get a brilliant move knight to g4 check the pawn anchors the knight can't the knight just be taken absolutely it absolutely can be taken but you know what happens after you take this knight i take the rook and you do the math knight and bishop for a rook that's a good deal but in comes the rook and then the entire position falls apart suddenly i can't defend everything if i try knight f6 knight c3 to protect it's an illusion that it's protected and like i said suddenly the entire white position falls apart knight g4 is a crazy move and now we are about to have a barn burner king e1 from sevchenko so the king went f2 g2 f2 back home we completely run out from the f and the g file the king is worried there's going to be an avalanche coming and by the way the rook can be taken and it does get taken and queen h4 but this knight is not being touched sachenko doesn't want it it's a trojan horse because if you take the knight in comes the rook and then the entire position falls apart but for now this knight will just hang this knight's just going to hang i have mate threatened if you move the queen i'm also disallowing long castle with my queen on this square the black king can't go to safety the rook can't get active and you can't move the queen so sarov plays knight c5 he now has help arriving to give this knight a helping hand to allow the rook to infiltrate the white position this is crazy the game is hanging in the balance like both sides can't move fully you still can't take the knight because after rook g4 you lose i get all my pieces in the game and most importantly i'm going to be able to castle so knight c5 and in this position savchenko plays b4 he says sn if you want the knight into the position come on i mean literally this is a fighter waving on the opponent like this is like when a fighter punches the other guy and then he goes like this like come and get some you want some more let's go knight d3 this is this r you rarely get games like this nowadays where where both guys are are in a silent agreement to be as violent as possible on the chessboard the king goes again f2 g2 f2 e1 d2 i'm telling you king is getting cardio now knight is hanging now an important thing here is you will never take this bishop you will never trade a knight that has moved that many times for a bishop that has not moved because you are killing the utility of your position of course if you take the bishop and it's made on the next move it's a different story but that knight moved around so much you can't just get rid of it for a piece that hasn't moved yet right which is why knight f2 so now the knight can't be captured the knights create a bond in this position putting pressure on everything the rook is now infiltrating and the best move in this position is for white to move the king again we go to c3 we go to c3 to protect b4 and to activate the bishop now we're already with bishop e3 to get rid of the knight king e1 king g2 king f2 king e1 king d2 king c3 just walking just walking right just taking a troll just check checking in on all the pieces you guys good everybody good i'm not a lazy king a lot of kings is just you know they sit back on their home square like this they don't move around much yeah that king takes care of his pieces now it looks like the attack is over for like the third time what is sarov going to do he can't castle he can't move either night because he's going to lose the knights he finds the only move the only move to continue the attack here is to activate the flank pawn meeting the king where he's going now if you push it's the only move and you at least get me an escape if you take it would be a horrible decision there is no need to bring the rook into the party so a5 b5 and now officially the attack is done there is no more attack here you got no more flank pawns you play a4 i play bishop e3 you resign but sarov knew all of this was coming and he finds again the only move to continue the attack how is it even possible white white looks completely dominant looks like black has no moves anywhere black moves he's going to lose material sarv knows that which is why in this position he plays knight takes e4 check what what does that even do it just loses a knight i mean you just straight up lost the knight yes but this is like the structural integrity of a bridge by getting rid of the knight and planting the knight back on c5 this is a huge problem and rook g4 is now re-enabled as a threat and as i've been telling you the entire game if e4 falls the whole bridge collapses so now savchenko has to find knight e g3 but then in this position there is rook takes g3 you cannot take with the queen because of a fork so you have to allow in the queen and then probably this game ends in a draw somehow maybe maybe black even has some attack to continue things so instead of that savchenko plays queen h1 the pawn is now protected he has abandoned that plan but here comes rook g4 so the threat is again knight takes e4 winning the game but there's just one problem because the queen left the h4 square it is now no longer under attack which means in this position savchenko has knight to h6 forking the queen and the rook what is happening the material count of this game is black has a rook and a pawn for a bishop and a knight it is equal materially it is equal here the game is literally hanging on a knife edge if they hang on the knife edge for the eternal eternity of the game it's 0000 the game is probably a draw if one of them makes a mistake they fall into lava like the game is over immediately knight to h6 the queen is hanging the rook is hanging but if you take here the king is hanging and he's protected by the rook knight takes e4 check the king continues his cardio with king to b2 f2 g2 f2 e1 d2 c3 b2 dude is just bouncing around now how do you deal with this you don't knight to f2 this game looks like a fever it looks like none of these moves should even be possible the the queen is now just under attack in the corner but white maintains a fork right so now the queen goes to h2 why h2 well if let's say you had gone to f1 you would lose your queen because i would give you a check and then my queen would take your queen so in reality it's the only move now if you take the queen i take your queen and the knight is hanging and when you move the knight i go here so you lose this knight crazy so queen h2 here comes queen f3 queen f3 is ridiculous queen f3 threatens the knight it threatens all sorts of threats near the king and if you take the rook which was the entire idea you lose you you lose by checkmate there's king here here here imagine getting made it like this what the what even is that how is that even possible how did this happen happen so queen f3 allows queen takes h5 check and the black king is now being hunted the king is now being hunted this king was lazy and he was abandoned by his troops early in the game those pawns went up the board now we have king d7 now the rook is hanging again but you cannot take it in fact you are not going to believe what is the best move in this position for white i can give you one minute i can give you 5 minutes i can give you 10 minutes white to play the only move in this position that maintains the balance of the game you got all sorts of ideas but none of them really work if you take this there's this well why don't we just move the knight out of the way yeah wouldn't it be that simple knight d1 check if you take rook g2 and discover an attack on the queen and you lose the only move in this position for white that maintains the balance is the absolutely gang rook b1 longtime fans of this channel know we have a song about that move rook b1 rook b1 yeah that's what it is and do you know what the idea of rook to b1 is it is to create a bunker for the king on the a1 square that is the ultimate journey of the king walk around the board f2 g2 f2 e1 d2 c3 b2 and hi rook f8 though so so synov doesn't take with che and instead plays rook here now it's important to note sarov played most of this game under like 5 minutes he was low on time from the opening he was thinking a lot but now sevchenko can take the rook this hangs that hangs what do we take and now where does the king go a1 and the king relaxes he made it to the rond vu point like in the movie like james bond this man went here here here here it's a real game by the way it's not a fake game it's like a it's like a mik tal game from the 1970s i mean really and now queen takes g4 and we take a moment black is a pawn up like if you trade what that would be if you trade black will win black's just going to win he's just up a clean pawn so queen h7 check synov plays king c8 but suddenly the attack is not over b6 how is that possible i mean it looks like it was it was look at white's pieces three of the four of them are here and yet pawn to b6 is literally a threat of checkmate and if you take the pawn i play queen e7 and i forg this and i'm still assaulting your position you can play queen d4 check i play bishop b2 i mean it doesn't make any sense how is white doing this from the opposite side of the board it looks like the white position was asleep the white bishop hasn't even moved it has been 37 moves the bishop on c1 has not moved at all queen takes c4 and inaccuracy it would have been better for him to play queen d7 and try to trade and simplify not an easy move to play he plays queen c4 he's now up two pawns and again you you go to this end game you're just going to lose so queen c4 queen e7 and now a big moment where do you move your rook d8 g8 or h8 you go up you get mated give a check i play bishop b2 plays rook d8 it's the best move queen e6 check and now in this position i think sarov thought king b king b8 was too risky and maybe they would go for a repetition of moves and make a draw queen e8 rook d8 or he would get some time and then he would make a decision because in chess they gain 30 seconds every single move so a very big moment here queen e6 rook d7 and in this position boris savchenko plays bishop to b2 and after all all of this time after being up two pawns all maybe three suddenly something becomes very painfully clear black has no attack it looks good but there is no threat the knight is not a kangaroo it can't go to c2 the rook is pinned on the worst possible situation rook c1 rook c7 is game over rook c1 wins the game so all of a sudden the threats are really really strong if you stop rook c1 i show you my other idea which is this how do you stop rook f8 snov is now up three pawns his pieces are moments away from beating the white king and yet he is the one losing you cannot stop rook c8 mate or losing the queen there is no back rank checkmate because the bishop protects by the slightest of margins by one move it is the black king who is tramped amongst all his pieces the only move is b5 and you lose your queen and this position is not regarded as completely lost the computer thinks it's only like plus two and and you can defend it a little bit better but i think synov entered panic mode and unfortunately he's just going to get swarmed here by the pieces bishop e3 bishop c5 and this position is completely lost there is simply nothing you can do king c3 king c4 between my queen and my pass pawn it's just simply game over and boris savchenko wins the early candidate for game of the year 2024 i mean what even was that that was an opening that left known territory on move five white's king proceeded to go on a spiritual journey white thwarted the attack masterfully and it looked like the attack was completely extinguished sharov jumped in with his knight white sacrificed the rook the knights were dancing in the position the white king was going for a a threemile run all right preparing for a 5k then synar sacrificed the knight roared in with his pieces and the white king found himself not just in a safety bunker on a1 but opening the file for the rook like everything in this game was just perfectly timed a perfectly choreographed battle not to say it was pre- choreographed i'm just saying like it was and then queen e7 with just unstoppable threats just when it looked like the the fire had burned out completely and there was nothing left bishop to b2 and synov needed to get his king to safety that's what he had to do and then he needed to defend like this and i guess he didn't want to lose a piece but this is actually probably a draw because white just doesn't have enough material here to continue the attack crazy what a game what a game that's all i have for you today hope you enjoyed and you know the drill get out of here
