hello everyone and welcome in this video we're gonna be talking about the many things one can do with this tiny little device it's the obd link mx plus now this video is sponsored by obd solutions which is the company that makes this device so of course i'm going to say great things about it right well here's the thing i've been using their products for years in fact i've recommended them in dozens of my video descriptions i've bought them with my own money and if you've ever seen a data overlay in any of my videos it was using an obd solutions device in order to do it so when they reached out and said hey jason we want to sponsor a video on your channel to me it was a no-brainer because i use these things all the time so in this video i'm going to be showing you how useful these devices really are and what capabilities this obd link mx plus has we'll start off very simple looking at scamming trouble codes but then we'll get into some of the other really impressive features you can use with this like monitoring engine parameters using it for digital gauges measuring fuel economy creating data overlays for video trip logging with maps and speed overlays and finally some performance tools starting off diagnostics that's the bread and butter of these devices and there's a lot of devices out there that can do this but we'll get into some of the unique advantages of this particular device throughout the video to start off we plug the tool into the obd2 port will connect to the device via bluetooth open the app and connect to the device through the app so starting off with diagnostics in the top right corner we can go to the report and see that no trouble codes were detected but this is a 2016 crosstrek that's still under warranty so that's not really all that surprising to see now aside from reading trouble codes which gives you insight into potential problems there's quite a bit more you can do here in diagnostics if you hit monitor tests you'll get a list of various tests the tool is capable of performing on your specific vehicle and from there whether or not your car passes those tests this is particularly useful if you're about to bring your car in for an emissions check you can see here whether or not it will have any issues that would cause it to fail for example with this vehicle it's able to see if the engine is misfiring if the fuels system is working correctly as well as your o2 sensors if a test is not available you'll see a red x so you won't be able to run that test this often comes down to the specific car the car may not have the hardware required or the test may not actually be applicable to your vehicle now within the diagnostics section if you hit pid values at the bottom this gives you a list of several of the key engine metrics which are quite useful to know for example at the top we have engine coolant temperature believe it or not the crosstrek doesn't provide coolant temperature to the driver just a little logo that lets you know if the engine is cold or too hot we also have engine oil temperature which many vehicles do not display so in situations like when you're towing track driving or off-roading these are super useful data points to know to make sure everything is running at operating temperature you can see other metrics as well like timing advance for cylinder number one this can be useful especially for modified vehicles to see if your ignition timing is backing off to prevent knock or looking at mass airflow rate to see if certain engine modifications are actually allowing for more airflow so if you hit report at the bottom you'll see pid snapshot and you can see there are 44 of these values which are available to view on my crosstrek so access to quite a bit of information which leads us to digital gauges now while you're driving if you have dashboards selected this will pull up a series of digital gauges which you can use to monitor your vehicle in real time and this actually highlights one of the major advantages of this device as it has a very high sampling rate and is able to display a lot of information very quickly so while some of the other lower-cost obd readers might be able to read five or six pieces of information in a second this can take 100 samples in a second the result is that you get very fluid displays with instant accurate information and you can display numerous gauges without worrying about the scan tool not being able to keep up with the amount of data being transmitted now the standard display here is showing vehicle speed and engine rpm engine temperature mass air flow reading fuel rate and battery voltage how these dashboards are completely customizable and you can create various pages of different displays so for example if you wanted to add a parameter you can select menu add display choose between a radial or a digital gauge then pick the style of the gauge and then select the parameter you would like to monitor in this case we'll add engine coolant temperature beside our engine oil temperature gauge so ultimately this is one of my favorite things about the device because it's so easy to get digital gauges for so many different parameters as cool as it is to have physical gauges installed on your car they tend to be fairly expensive and it of course requires the time and work to install them this is super fast to set up costs 80 bucks and you can display all kinds of different information and change it whenever you like it also means you don't have to do any cutting or irreversible changes to your cars - and it can be a wonderful tool to use for monitoring a modified vehicle it's also useful for measuring fuel economy many modern cars come with fuel economy displays but for older cars this isn't always the case so for example here with my s2000 i can get the fuel flow rate an instant fuel economy readout and an overall average of my fuel economy this is excellent for road trips or for monitoring your driving habits to see how to improve your fuel efficiency as it turns out flooring in a supercharged s2000 doesn't result i was as shocked and as disappointed as you likely are now one of the things i really like doing with - mm videos is to include a data overlay on the screen and so i'm going to show you how exactly i do this using the obd link mx plus i'm using a garmin virb ultra camera plugging in the scan tool and then connecting it via bluetooth to the garmin camera once it's connected it's already programmed to record all of the information so you simply place the camera where you'd like and then hit record then using verb edit which is free software to download you import the cameras footage once you have the footage into the editor you can select which parameters you would like to have displayed on-screen as well as the style of how the gauges are displayed using my s2000 as an example you can see digital displays for vehicle speed and engine rpm as well as throttle position intake air temperature engine load and engine coolant temperature and you can rearrange these gauges however you'd like as well as change the color scheme you may have seen something similar done with chevy's performance data recorder an option that costs about eighteen hundred dollars to record video with speed and data overlays with an onboard camera on corvettes and camaros with a $400 garmin camera and an $80 scan tool you can essentially do the same thing with nearly any vehicle and with 4k video resolution rather than 720p like on the corvette the obd link app can also link up with maps for trip logging so if you're driving with the scan tool you can record your drives and maps with a speed overlay if you were driving on a track you could use this map functionality to monitor your speeds at various locations with these recorded trips you can also see how much fuel was used and what your average mpg was and while you're recording a trip you can have a graph display various parameters over time so here you can see as i'm driving i have a graph displayed of my engine rpm throttle position and ghin coolant temperature with respect to time this illustrates another advantage of the device as displaying this much information continuously requires a large amount of data exchanged between the device and my phone to occur very quickly so for my automotive tech geeks out there the amount of power and data that this device can provide a driver is pretty incredible which is why i've been so impressed by it being able to monitor things like coolant and oil temperature which i previously didn't have access to is great for peace of mind while traveling and ensuring everything is running as it should now here's where i say something cliche like but wait hold on right there there's still more so you also have performance tools so you can record things like zero to 60 times or quarter-mile times and i know everyone would probably prefer to see this done with - mm but instead i've decided to show you just how impressive subarus crosstrek with manual transmission can be so the test is set up from a dead stop here we go 10 20 30 miles per hour and a few days later the crosstrek has yes hit 60 miles per hour quite impressive so how do you know if this device will work with your specific car well the company lists all of the vehicles it's compatible with on their website and one thing you may find interesting is that subarus and honda's only have generic parameters available to view meaning everything you've seen in this video has been done on a vehicle with limited access and i still find the device quite useful on cars like ford nissan mazda toyota and a healthy list of other brands there's even more parameters and information which the device will have access to i'll include a link for compatibility in the video description if you'd like to check for your own car and whether or not you'd have enhanced vehicle coverage the device works all over the world depending on the year and make of your vehicle and it also works on both android and apple devices so that was a ton of information and really it's just a quick overview of what's possible with these kind of devices it's very powerful you know i get friends calling me all the time they're like you know jason something's going on with my car i can't figure it out and so i'll just drive over to their place i'll plug one of these things in and we'll figure out what's going on what needs to be fixed super-powerful very useful tools so i will include a link to it in the video description a big thanks to obd solutions for sponsoring the video and thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below
