so hello everybody i'm sitting here with jp maxo you probably have seen him on my channel jp is the editor of the symbolic world blog and also a contributor to that blog he's written several really interesting articles he's becoming i would say a kind of bright star in the world of symbolic interpretation he also is able to provide other aspects or ways of talking about symbolism that i don't have and so more philosophical talking more about science and so i really enjoyed talking with him he recently wrote an article about miracles which is something that i've been hinting at once in a while talking about miracles trying not to talk too much about miracles because i know it's a stumbling stone for a lot of kind of secular types or atheist types but i knew that we had to kind of slowly get there and so here we are with that article i think we it's very important to start talking about miracles how they relate to notions of emergence and eminence how they participate in reality how they are in a way the let's say the the summit of reality and so jp wrote this article about cs lewis and verveiki investigating miracles with verveicky and c.s lewis i think i'm getting the the the title wrong but the pattern is right the pattern is right with the title to draw and so yeah all right so i'm looking really for looking forward to this conversation [music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [music] so i think to begin with maybe jp you can give us the basic gist of your article what your argument is and then we can dive into it yeah so the article itself is trying to summarize the key insights of lewis in his book miracles using the metaphysics of john raviki the the source of metaphysics that he's been defending in these discussions in our corner of the internet because the main key is that the way lewis used to talk about miracles back in his time was sort of set against the naturalism of his time which was a fairly simplistic kind of materialism where nature is sort of one big interlocked mechanical system and lewis's strategy to introduce miracles in that worldview was to take something closer to us so take our rationality and show that our rationality is not something that can be fit in that or interlocking old system and is a his argument is something that actually john made in his series and he also made it in the last discussion you had with him and where okay well if all that is real ultimately is the mechanical level of reality then this will not make our rationality real like our intellectual concepts and so on will have to be somehow reduced to something mechanical but this this makes not the ideas themselves not our theories themselves really makes only the mechanical level real so it means that our theory which points to materialism doesn't fit in the system so it's not rational so we don't have to to believe it so it's it's self-defeating and there's a blind spot i think this is a blind spot we've been all been pointing to for a while which is that a lot of materialists take for granted they're the invisible part of their world they take for granted these theories as if they don't even exist and then they they use them to talk about the material world and we've been trying to say no look up look at you have patterns that you use to interpret but you can't pretend as if those patterns are physical because they're not and then you also can't pretend that they don't exist because you're using them to interpret reality yeah yeah yeah it's it's fascinating i rewatched your conference discussion with with jordan and also with bet weinstein and i was i was surprised to see how strong positivism is still going like how how strong the old-school modernist positivism is still going in the sciences it's like we because in philosophy itself this has been sort of debunked and it it it died i don't know maybe 100 years ago like it it it's it's really in dire straits and people are going towards like non-reductive kinds of physicalism that i'm gonna explain just a bit later in this discussion but yeah definitely the the blind spot is is real and there are interesting reasons why it it isn't clear yet why it doesn't trickle down to the the whole of academia but it's definitely making its way i would say because in cognitive science like with you the sort of metaphysics that you see john put forward is is totally aware of the the problems of modernistic positivism and he he ends up with something that is much more traditional yeah and what is much more traditional is is non-reductive kind of physicalism we talked about it in more details last time we had a discussion i think i i'd like to introduce it with a sort of a series of examples that become more and more complex and make up their way progressively to miracles so that we jump into the subject sooner rather than than later if you you look at let's say what happens at the lowest level of physics it's gonna look super weird you're gonna and you you often see physicists and reductive physicalists say this sort of thing and maybe blind blindly and not recognizing the the issue there but they'll say for instance that from the fundamental fields of probability at the bottom of physics you can see that particles just appear there and if you leave it there it's a very poor explanation of what is going on it's super strange things don't just pop out of of fields of potential that's a strange thing to say but the reason why you accept it the reason why we accept this strange emergence is because we also know the top-down pattern that informs this potential we know that there are certain laws of physics that tell us that the probability that certain particles will manifest themselves out of potential there and so this meeting of the the potential at the bottom layer of physics and the emanation of the the laws on the potential explains to us why the the particle appears and because we have this this pattern to explain the emergence we were okay with it so you already have two layers of of reality there and it just keeps getting more and more complex as you go up the different layers of reality to explain the emergence of something you always need to know the top-down pattern that informs it one layer that i find really cool and useful is the one that happens in our brains if you were to look at what happens in my brain as i'm saying these words it would look completely insane like it's so unprobable there are billions and billions of neurons which coordinate just the perfect ways so that i i send the right signals to my muscles and my lungs and so on my mouth so that i just say these words and this kind of coordination is is insane if that's all you look at like this is there's too much possibility there for this to clear correctly like it makes it's insane but once you know the emanation of the top-down pattern there which is my my fairly simple desire to say these words then this whole coherence makes sense you can explain the the bottom-up emergence by simultaneously knowing the top-down emanation of my my thought so you have two layers of reality there so and the way that for instance non-reductive physicalist like john will explain it is that you cannot reduce my brain as a whole to let's it's individual constituents if you try to do that you get the problem of like all of these possibilities that don't cohere you need to explain that there are constraints that come from let's see my brain considered as a whole and it it gets even more interesting than that because modern cognitive sciences will include also the environment like the fact that it's not just my brain it's my brain in my body my environment and who knows how far this goes like it's this old structure this pattern this abstract this abstract spirit you can see that informs that shapes the potential that is emerging from from my neurons okay so that this is going from say the the cellular level to the the level of of mind of an individual person yeah and so i mean to maybe synthesize what you're saying you're saying that when you look at something top bottom up right you when you look at something bottom up without understanding the pattern which informs it then it you can't make sense of it the sense actually comes from the manner in which they they join together and they connect with a top-down pattern right and so if i look at a painting and i look at all the all the individual specks of paint on the painting it's just a bunch of jumbled specks of paint until i understand that it's a painting of an apple and then when i when i know that it's a painting of an apple then all of a sudden the jumbled specks of paint make sense yeah yeah find a reason to be there yeah yeah and that's it's it's one of the things i'm hoping to bring out of this conversation is i tend to speak let's see from from the outside as like the old school philosophers like aristotle or aquinas would do of no seeing that there are layers of patterns in the world and the way that you tend to speak on your channel is more as a as a phenomenologist looking from how we perceive things as you know if i can we can take a simple object like you took you took the painting there you can we can look at it from the first person perspective where there there is a combinatorial explosion of of facts in the painting and i have to take this this all of these facts like this layer of infinity of facts and i have to abstract the pattern from it so that i can then understand the this combinatorial explosion so this happens in my consciousness so that i can actually see the the painting so that i can see anything really i have to make out the pattern behind this emergence and what i want to put forward here is that this well this does really happen phenomenologically in my consciousness it also happens in the independently of me in the painting itself like in the painting too like the the whole structure of the canvas is informing all of the fundamental particles or whatever in the in the painting and they're always changing like there's all kinds of chemical interactions and like photons are being going in and out of the painting and so on so the form of the painting which exists even if i'm even if no human is looking at it the form of the painting still exists and it is informing really the the multitude of atoms and particles and so on that are in the painting so the the meeting of emergence elimination within my mind that allows me to create the painting is also occurring within the painting in the meeting of the emergence from all the particles and downwards from the form of the opening okay so we talked about a few levels and if we keep going higher we'll get closer and closer to to to miracles the sort of top-down causality the way that ultimately what i want to get at and it's what lewis was getting at as well we want to say that the way that i can smoothly have causal influences on my neurons for instance the way that rationality can smoothly intermesh with with the brain is the same kind of smooth interaction that god who is behind emergency animation altogether can have on creation but it's useful to go through a few layers i think to to get that this so one example i like and i use in the article is the example of the placebo effect because there what you have is a situation where you need the narrative frame to make sense of what's going on because the other patient who goes to see his doctor and because he has serious migraines for instance and the the doctor ends him just a flower pill and tells him that it's a cure for his his migraines and surprisingly and this happens all the time within like a day or two the patient is completely ill there's no more migraines you've had this this weird coherence of different chemical reactions within the patient that really did like lower his intracranial pressure and really did lower stress enzymes and so on so something physical really happened but it doesn't make sense if you try to explain in terms of what the flower pill did in his system because flour doesn't have those causal powers like flour doesn't do this but once you know the the story once you know the pattern once you know the placebo effect then this the this this all emergence makes makes sense once you know the top-down elimination of the placebo effect then you can make sense of the the emergence of all the chemical reactions within the patient that really did cure yeah i always i always use that example too to talk about how the placebo effect is the last remainder in a kind of materialistic world one that they can't totally get rid of of how more traditional societies thought of causality in terms of top-down causality and can help you understand ritual your placebo can help you understand ritual help you understand magical acts can help you understand how you know exorcism all these things you can understand through understanding how let's say or at least realizing that placebo is a real effect in the world yeah yeah so you just have to keep going higher yeah to get closer and closer to miracles for instance i don't talk about this in miracles but you can sorry i don't talk about this in the the article but let's see what happens in a in a church in a prayer group where lots of people will prey on on someone to heal something more drastic than just a migraine you know sometimes this sort of thing works and it makes sense once you know the narrative of you know there's there's all groups praying let's say to a certain saint and this whole story is very powerful and it can smoothly influence the emergence of a real healing in the same way that i can smoothly influence the coherence of my neurons when i think a certain thought okay that makes sense all right so now let's get to miracles here go forward yeah one okay so following what we just said lewis will give us a useful criterion to think about even just what the miracle is and how to recognize them the idea is okay now we're looking for events that require not let's say the the level of explanation that you find in in certain physical laws or in even in a story that to explain miracles you'll need the highest level possible you'll need god himself with beyond emergence and a nation altogether you'll need something that seems to okay so for one thing you need something that looks kind of alien that doesn't fit neatly into the normal way that emerges in the nation meet but at the same time it's gonna have to make sense it's gonna have to be coherent in that once you know the pattern it really does have to make sense of everything below it in the same way that once i know the pattern of let's say the laws of fundamental physics i really need to to be explaining things for it to be a legitimate explanation it really needs to explain what you observe in fundamental physics or once i know the the level of cognitive science thinking once once let's say i can detect your intention and not just your neurons i really need to be able to explain how you behave i really need to be able to explain like how your your person and your cells will interact with i really need to be able to explain it same thing will go on for for god and miracles and that makes things obviously more complex because now the claim is is is huge we're claiming that once we we take that frame to explain a miracle it should make all of reality more intelligible it should make all of our emergence in the nation more intelligible once we know that a certain event was a real miracle it was and it was called biker yeah and i think that that's really the point we need to drive towards which is that when we talk about emanation when we talk about the notion of these different lev talk about emergencies different levels emergent emerging the question is what are they emerging towards and inevitably they're emerging toward towards the different levels of unity at the at the levels of which they're jumping out of and so you know you have multiplicity it jumps into a one and then these ones join together they jump into they jump into another one but a way to understand that in a more kind of phenomenological way is to understand that they're emerging towards identity they're emerging towards name they're emerging towards pattern and they can also be emerging towards narrative they or at least how they fit inside stories and how they fit inside facts you know coming together in terms of narrative and that's also why you can understand how miracles ultimately end up like you said if you look at the miracles they're not just random things that happen without explanation which is somehow how people want to characterize them but they're rather they're rather moments where meaning shines like no other and so christ walking on water is not just a thing weird thing that happened that you can't explain it's a it's an event which happens and which manifests the manner in which like you said in which heaven and earth you know come together it manifests the manner in which pattern can be above the chaos of manifestation and how it ends up ordering it when christ you know tells for example the the storm to stop it's like how logos how meaning will stabilize phenomena and so all the miracles of christ and all the miracles in scripture are not just like freak things that happen but are rather super events that that help us make sense of this whole process of of emergence and emanation yeah and louis as a way of putting it i think cause it's okay i had been trying to write something about miracles for a while but i could never sort of pinpoint them to something that was let's say manageable because like it explains too much and it's hard to pin it down to something that you can digest into just one article and luisa's strategy is is very good at this point what he does is he focuses on a few key aspects of nature nature which is in our modern language the meeting of emergency nation we can recognize the miracles of christ because they they will be manifest they will be shedding they will shed light on all of those key aspects of nature so the key aspect that luis thinks about is first there is something we already mentioned the the the fact that nature can actually this is this gets a bit tricky and i only talk about it obliquely lewis the way lewis was talking about nature is a bit different from the way that we talk about it today because the naturalist now agrees that there are different layers of nature whereas the previous naturalist only saw it as sort of one big mechanical layer yeah but luis says that okay we see in the world that there's an intermission of something that doesn't fit into that system into that one layer mechanical world view with namely the mind the mind doesn't fit into that one layer of mechanical causality of the world so there has to be an intermission of mechanical reality with something higher and we can see this in the incarnation as well there will be actually the all of creation will be intermeshed with god with outside operation altogether and okay so this is one one aspect and then you will talk about three things you'll talk about selectiveness the fact that and it's funny the way luis says it says that the the if you look at the way that nature selects and also that god selects it can somewhat hurt our democratic sensibilities because because in in all of the world for all we know there's there only seems to be like one planet that has life on it and in that life there's lots and lots of uh species and organisms that just dead end that don't reproduce it's very undemocratic and the same thing goes on in in the incarnation because out of let's see all the planets of course god selects the earth to to internet it wouldn't make sense to go on the moon for instance and then you select just one people namely israel and then you'll select just one girl namely mary to fashion a body for himself and then it will be sort of all on the shoulders of christ until he found the church and so on but this this selection well it can seem sort of evil from the outside because i mean nature is falling in certain respects there there really are bad aspects to selectiveness the way that it exists right now but in using this the incarnation shows us that selectiveness doesn't have to be evil like at its roots it it can be good provided that for instance israel is selected but is selected to save the whole planet it's it's elected to save ultimately all of reality and it will do so through very difficult trials like in many ways it's much harder to be an israelite than to be a someone from some other tribe and then similarly for for mary of christ who were selected but they were selected to save the entire world so yeah and i think that's the mystery let's say the difference between christianity because every every type of empire every type of government will have that process where you have a chief you have people above and people below and so the selectiveness is inevitable those who think that it that it can be you know communists who think that you can avoid it end up creating you know an insane parody of of that very selective process yeah and so it's inevitable and the the mystery that christianity offers is that the selectives never the true selectiveness happens through how the thing that is selected then sacrifices itself for that which is it is selected out of which is the huge difference between christianity and other another aspect that anyways continue with the musical part yeah but that's true that's where i was heading because the lewis then focuses on vicariousness the idea that when the these selected devote themselves to the unselected you see something that's good and that actually redeems several aspects of nature again prince because no living thing survives on its own like it doesn't happen in nature everything eats something else there are even parasites and all kinds of very bad interactions by which something survives only by being a parasite on something else but this vicariousness can also be great it's also the instance of let's say the child depending on his mother or the fact that we depend on christ it can actually be beautiful for to see some people sacrifice themselves and for us to accept this in gratitude it redeems an aspect that is fundamental to nature this always happens everything that exists exists because of something else except god but this gets complicated let's see everything in nature exists because of something else and then the the third point is the pattern of death and rebirth which is also like universal throughout nature everything let's say everything that we see around us will will die and then lewis has a a very beautiful way of putting it that i had never seen before he says that by letting satan introduce death into the world god was doing a master move in sorry master strategist move because by letting satan introduce death into the world it allowed christ to die precisely to reading the world so it introduced something in nature which is that everything we see dies but also it allows us to use that and turn it into glory to turn death into glory because right now and we can see it even within nature that there are aspects of this pattern that it's not just all tragic all the time the fact that certain trees die for instance is also what allows the entire forest to to remain alive like this pattern can be beautiful and of course its highest expression is in christ itself and the way he sacrifices himself for the the entire world and is reborn so these these are the the few patterns that's that lewis selects and i think it makes convincing that in the incarnation which is the process where god selects to incarnate himself to then re-emerge in in in the church that will remain the entire world this is so coherent with the way that we see nature work at its most fundamental level that it makes miracles very plausible and this is at the highest level of the incarnation so this is the the the biggest pattern and the individual miracles of christ will make sense within that overarching pattern so he notices that you can break up the miracles of christ into two categories there's miracles of the old creation and miracles of the new creation so miracles of the the old creation are the miracles that focus sort of in one precise moment patterns that already occur on the grand scale patterns that god already does at the great scale so for instance the the the virgin birth is an example of a cosmic pattern just focused at one particular point where in in the virgin birth god creates non-violently anybody for himself such an atom nothing there's there's a spermatozoon missing and yet he creates a body for himself in there and this seems crazy for us once we see it this way at our human level but the same thing happens at the cosmic scale like all the time the fact that the world is created out of nothing i know for instance it's crazy too it's just like people people believe in people think the virgin birth is insane but they believe in the big bang it's like okay so everything comes out of nothing but you don't like the idea that that that let's say that that miracle would show you how the reality works but you believe that's how reality works interesting and it's the same for a bunch of other miracles that christ does that just replicate old patterns a cool one is the miracle at the wedding of cana where it turns water into mine and this is in the normal pattern for wine that's put into certain jars by the work of human ends to turn into wine it happens all the time and it's crazy just when you think about it that this works it's it's insane that something as bland as water by the fruit of human hands can become it's a euphoric liquid it's it's weird but we only notice this when it's contracted into one moment where a god himself tells people to go fetch some water from a well put it in some jars and then pour it so after after working water into some earthen vessel or some rock vessel it will become wine it again focuses something that always happens in creation into one point you could also talk about let's see the multiplication of the loaves and fishes this happens all the time of course as well where fishes multiply all the time and when we plant seeds it grows again yeah yeah so so it always happens and it's it's also one pattern that is strange when you think about it it sort of opens your eyes to just how beautiful and kind of crazy it is that food can multiply this way but so so what christ does is he and one way to see it maybe is as a as a microcosm because christ then christ is becoming the end of creation christian was in rebellion and then god comes down to become the end of creation once again to bring creation into into himself into write prayer right worship you can say and by doing this he takes something that is a pattern that is on the broader scale the way that christ creates the world in general he brings it into a microcosm so that it can be the head of creation so the seed that then will bring our creation back into himself and it was super important that he did those old creation miracles because it allows us today to recognize him as as god as the creator of this world but it also allowed people to do the same at the time and it was a part it was an important part of the story like it's what allowed people to recognize him as god back then and some people followed him and lots of people just wanted to kill him because of it and that was an important part of the story it was important that he the miracles that he did were uncontrovertible like people couldn't just dismiss him if he hadn't done miracles like not that many people would have wanted to kill him but he he was really despised because people couldn't dismiss him they didn't like what he was saying but they couldn't like dismiss his his powers they couldn't dismiss the fact that he was clearly doing something miraculous and that was a way that luis puts it that is really beautiful i think is he it's not as if god was coming and just sort of wrecking random miracles like you see in some pagan myths sometimes there's weird stuff that happens just doesn't miracles don't seem to make sense but what you see rather in christ miracles it's more like a king coming into his own kingdom a king doing some things that will sort of seamlessly fit into creation in the same way that my my mind seamlessly informs my brain for instance okay yeah that makes sense yeah it makes sense one of the things that i like is to is to really use that very pattern of let's say emergence and emanation to look at the miracles of christ because like i said i think that every single miracle of christ bring together or show us the secret of this process they show us how in in old testament terms how heaven and earth meet together and so the idea that christ heals the sick is exactly that the notion of a sick person is someone whose parts don't fit together that's what a sick person is they have different aspects of themselves and they're not properly fit they're not properly working together and so the word the seed the light comes from above and and and brings it together re-manifest like re-imprints the normal pattern on on that broken vessel and so that's one of the types of miracles christ does like i said walking on water healing stopping the storm all of these are the same they're all the same thing they're all you know something from above coming down and and calming bringing order making sense of that which is which is below yeah and i think that every really every single miracle that christ does the same with a you know something as crazy as this notion of the the the healing of the woman that bleeds right and so here is a woman who's leaking stuff like it does not clear exactly what's going on but she's leaking and so it's like she's not contained and so christ comes and just by touching christ then she becomes contained like her identity and her body kind of come together and she stops to to to lose herself in the on the world she starts to spread herself out on the ground you could say and so every single miracle that christ does is just manifesting in a super manner in like a in a super condensed manner the very process of how reality shows itself to us yeah yeah and one thing that lewis brings out and we touched on a few of those for instance in the walking on water and other miracles like there would be the the transfiguration and also the raising of of the dead and the the resurrection of christ himself lewis calls those new creation miracles in that they're not just the old patterns of of creation not just the old ways in which heaven and earth meet like multiplying loaves and fishes and turning water into one and so on those are all patterns those are the old ways in which heaven and earth meet but in the incarnation christ doesn't just sort of come down to show us the patterns of the old creation the purpose is also to bring all of creation back into himself and in doing that this will include sort of setting all of the the the powers and principalities right this will involve you can say rewriting the the regularities rewriting the patterns that told in nature in modern language you can see rewriting the laws of nature and you can see that christ was smoothly moving from the old christian miracles to the new creation miracles in his ministry so it's towards the end that he raises lazarus from the dead that he is transfigured and also that he is ultimately himself resurrected those are all cases where it's not only that in the old creation heaven and earth meat that patterns and matter can need to form loaves fishes and so on in the new creation miracles which points to the new creation where heaven and earth will meet even more directly like the the relationship will be more intense mind will be able to inform matter more so that's an instance of walking on water where it's not just that our minds can inform our bodies like our our minds will be able to inform even like water even other aspects of creation that are chaotic and unruly at the moment the transfiguration is another instance where christ's body was shining and like close to moses and elijah this idea that you can sort of be in tune with older patterns and bring them back into a new and richer and transformed body and then same thing with christ's body after the resurrection it's not just that his head was able to govern his body and that he didn't die like lazarus or the other one or two people erase from the dead i'm not sure so it's not just that it reverses the normal course of nature the let's say the second law of thermodynamics by re-uh by recreating order that was lost his body was also able to do a bunch of stuff that he couldn't do before he can sort of go through walls he can kind of appear and disappear all kinds of words things happen that showed that the the purpose of the incarnation was to ultimately change the walls of nature so to set creation all right after i after you can see that the patterns of nature had fallen and that the the the patterns that i laid out before were wrong christ lays them out right again so in showing us that in using the patterns of selectiveness vicariousness death and rebirth christ shows us that at their deepest nature they were meant for good and yeah actually sets them for good in the in the incarnation like he he really does use selectedness vicariousness and death and rebirth to set those patterns set nature right again and it's been unfolding for 2000 years obviously and it's not perfect but it's it's already better than it was 2 000 years ago well that's that's at least what we that's what we think but and so i think that i think that we've probably gone for for quite a while but i think that at least what i kind of take out of this is really understanding miracles it's almost like reversing the way that our kind of new atheist type of person sees miracles which is that instead of seeing miracles as the freak thing you use to disprove religion it's almost as if the it's the contrary the miracle becomes the very key to showing you how reality works it actually becomes shining moments that are so bright and there's something about that where the pattern appears so strongly in the miracle that it becomes difficult for us to see the secondary causes it's like i can't if you ask me like okay how is it that jesus walked on water it's like i don't i don't know first of all i wasn't there i can't tell you but well like what i can tell you is when i see that story and i hear the story of christ walking on water i recognize that it's showing me how reality works it's it's manifesting to me that some very deep secrets of how the world exists and also how we are called to exist in christ that is we are also called to through our own like our attachment to god and our logos to inform and to stabilize the reality around us whether it's our relationships our families and also the physical world in terms of in terms of you know in terms of building things and creating cities and creating civilization and so and so then at that point the secondary causes it's like you don't care what they are and i know a lot of people will get angry that i say that but i don't know what the secondary causes are and i don't it doesn't really bother me it doesn't i don't ask that question just just like you said in the way that i also don't understand the secondary causes of how my own thought works i don't understand how all the neurons align and how all the the the you know all the the cells you know whatever all this these things that's going on at lower levels i don't understand it and i don't attend to that because if i try to attend to that too much then i start to lose what exactly this is about and i've seen this in in in kind of modern approaches to miracles where they tried to kind of explain the secondary causalities i heard crazy you crazy things even christians saying crazy things about how you know like when the israelites cross the red sea that you know at the red sea at that point is really thin it's really not it's really shallow at a certain time of year and if there was a really strong wind maybe it could like split open the sea and then they could walk through and i was like dude you're losing the plot here like i don't know what you're i don't care what you're talking about you're losing you don't you stop to understand what this miracle is about and how it manifests the very pattern of creation by pulling dry earth out of water through the spirit coming down from above it's like if you can't if once you start attending too much of the secondary causes you'll stop to see how it's showing you the pattern of reality yeah yeah and yeah i was hoping we would get to this because there's something i want to stress at this point and it's not just the pragmatic move of focusing on the pattern focusing on the iron level pattern rather than focusing on the the multiplicity it's like i've seen this in in reading papers in philosophy of mind like it would be technically wrong for instance for me to try to explain why you're what you're talking to me and zoom right now if i was to look at the the precise neuronal events that occurred within your brain like it would be technically wrong and we can do this using counterfactuals so let's see if i say okay so if rather than the neuronal configuration a you you add that something else if this new configuration didn't happen would you still have come to talk to me and zoom and of course the answer is is yes like you wouldn't have done it in the precise way let's say that you moved this morning at whatever time but the overarching pattern of you coming to zoom and talking to me this is still true the real explanation is at the level of your your intention at the level of your your your consciousness and not at the level of your individual neurons yeah and i think that's really important to understand because the because of the multiplicity and because the possibility of difference at the lower level if you start to notice the differences at the lower level then then you then you don't realize that multiplicity different multiplicities can can manifest the same pattern like a pattern can manifest it so for example like if you take two cups and you focus on how they're different and you start looking at all the different chips and the different things in the paint and everything and that's what you're talking about it's like okay dude both of those are cups stop focusing on the yeah on the details because you're going to forget what they're what's going on and he's got his christmas cup too look at that it's not even halloween yet because yeah we had really christmas weather here in quebec yeah it's going away now but anyways it's gonna come back yeah even this cup like at every instant it's different like it's exchanging neurons and whatever there's all kinds of vibrations that are happening there and it's still the same that all the multiplicity at the lower level doesn't remain the unicity at the level of the cup so i think the same thing happens in in the miracles of christ for instance i think a great illustration of this is the fact that we have four accounts of his resurrection and they're somewhat different and i think this is telling us that it doesn't matter like which precise physical manifestation happened of the pattern what matters is the pattern of the resurrection was there like this is what matters it could have been like either of the accounts it could have been something different as long as the same pattern holds the manifest the precise manifestation isn't what matters any more than when i'm speaking to you now what matters is the thoughts behind what i'm saying not the precise neural configuration there could be a million different neural configurations that would give the same manifestation of my thought yeah and there's there was you know even in the early church there was a temptation to synchronize the gospel there was a desire some people had the desire to take the four gospels and then kind of you know streamline them and then make one gospel that everybody would follow and the church fathers refused that they refused that process and i think that there is a hint in there there's a suggestion of what we said which is that if we that multiplicity comes together in unity and even sometimes things that look contradictory or look like they're that they're not the same that that it's the pattern which brings them together and so the thing that brings the four gospel accounts together is christ christ is beyond the gospels christ you know when when some people call god call the bible the word of god got to be very careful the word of god is not the gospels it's what's above it it's christ which is which is holding together these different sometimes even different accounts of his life yeah yeah and i can't i i want to use that occasion to come back let's see on especially the very old miracles in the bibles because it happens sometimes that i i've seen it i've seen it in q and a's where people ask you about let's say the exodus and so on and i think with what we've said we have the key to answer even like some some of the more reluctant people when let's see it says that moses split the water and you alluded to this miracle earlier i don't know what the like the precise physical manifestation of the pattern was and it doesn't matter what matters is the pattern there was a physical manifestation of the pattern like it it's necessary i think that's important too it's not people because they don't they stop to realize that symbolism is the pattern of reality they always want to tend to go towards oh it's an imaginary thing well what do you mean what do you it's like it's just a story people told no it's like that's the pattern of reality they're talking about how the world manifests itself it's just maybe not in the way you would want it to be described but you know yeah i think it's when let's say you often talk about this on your channel the way you you often talk phenomenologically and it's sort of implicit that when you describe the way that we humans perceive patterns this is how we we contract stories in the past making them more and more mythological the fact that we do this in our phenomenology reflects something that is real in the outside world outside of our phenomenology so whatever happened during the exodus like i don't know if it was i don't know what the physical manifestation was but whatever happened it was crazy like it's as crazy as what you imagine when you imagine moses splitting the waters and it's the the pattern that matters the precise physical manifestation isn't isn't a big deal it's important that it happened but the precise one doesn't and whichever manifestation happen it's going to blow our minds anyways yeah and it was important enough to in the eyes of the israelites to seal for them what was happening and to understand that they were going through a recreation that they were moving out of the flood that they were finding new land again that all the patterns that they had learned as children in terms of the story of the the flood of noah what what is what was happening to them and it was happening in a dramatic manner that was about to launch into i mean they didn't know at the time but was going to launch into basically the most influential story in the in all of humanity like these stories that have basically molded all of all of civilization all of western civilization and is also not just western civilization but is also molding other civilizations through through the kind of the spread of western ideas yeah yeah and even let's see if you try to look at the story of judaism without like by naturalizing miracles it's not going to be less weird it's so strange like the kind of laws they have and circumcision and all those rituals and like what do they have against idolatry like the only ones who care about this stuff they're such a weird people like no matter what genesis you come to use to understand them it's always going to be strange and it it's always going to express the same pattern as the israelites themselves described in the oldest old testament yeah all right jp i think i think we've gone around miracles and we've created a few headaches to some people watching this i imagine the process and so all right guys the the comment section is open i know it's gonna be crazy and there's going to be a lot of stuff going on so so go nuts and we'll have fun reading the comments and and maybe engaging on some further time on this as well and i want to tell everybody to go to the symbolicworld.com check out the blog the articles that are being put out are all very good and jp's article especially so so check that out and stay tuned for more discussion on symbolism with other writers on the blog as well i hope you enjoyed our discussion on miracles as you know everything we do here on the symbolic world is thanks to your support so you can check out the website the symbolicworld.com support to find out how you can help us out there are also ways to purchase the products that i've designed which are based on traditional imagery i've just put out some recent patterns based on a celtic slash anglo-saxon vision of the four beasts of ezekiel which are interpreted as evangelists and also i put out a dragon all-over pattern for a more subtle look so once again thank you for giving me the possibility of doing this and i will talk to everybody very soon
