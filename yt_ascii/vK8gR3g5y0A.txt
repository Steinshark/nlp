imagine if this was just a picture of me michael lynn do i know this person i do like the x neph i do like that that's always funny to see the x's all my exes live in texas baby this is looking really all right anyways nine minute read are you ready for this he went rogue all right golden handcuffs all right golden handcuffs when you stay at a job that you'd rather quit only for the money yeah yeah that's reasonable i think a lot of people i mean i mean at some level i think a lot of people feel this way i thought i was going to stay at netflix forever top of market pay freedom of responsibility we call it f r internally unlimited p t o what more could you ask for yeah good question so like so when i quit netflix in 2001 everyone thought i was crazy my parents objected first coming from the cultural revolution china where they barely had enough food to eat they thought i was throwing away all the hard work they went through to come to america that that had to be tough i mean this alone right here that has to be tough i you know i don't have parents that my mom has like never she's always been like a huge cheerleader in my life so i don't know what this is like you know what i mean i've never experienced that not to be hard just keep your head down and do the work they said don't be ungrateful for what you have they said none of my friends could believe it either but the free food fang just rest invest bro there's actually i mean you don't we don't technically vest at netflix you get all your stock immediately you know what i mean it's kind of it's cool the only argument i heard against quitting that made me slightly pause was from my mentor at netflix he said i shouldn't quit without another job lined up because i'd give up the leverage i had with my high salary at netflix this is a good point you should i mean just in general you should just if you can don't quit a job and then you'll find a job you should always have a job it's it just makes people think you're more hireable when someone's taking you from netflix you just appear to have more credibility than the person that you used to be at netflix it's just different it will always be that way netflix this isn't netflix campus i think i don't know what campus this is but this isn't netflix minimum this could be facebook's this has heavy facebook feel to it because facebook kind of has like this little like world is this true free food and drinks yeah there's free food and drinks but drinks aren't alcoholic of course well sometimes they are but yeah there's free food every day you get like they they have six restaurants from around san jose come in and cater food in and then we have a seventh restaurant that caters every single day and that one's joby's joby's is not that great it's never been great it's always actually been pretty horrible but we finally made the jump now we have six six photo or six different restaurants coming in oh man it's so good bonchon oh i ate so much bonchon so much bonchon so much fun chance all right that made me pause for all of three days but i quit anyways now eight months later i am 100 certain this was the right decision ooh interesting interesting interesting let's see what he has to say here all right in this article i discussed the three factors that helped me understand the real cost of golden handcuffs and why even a half million dollar salary a year couldn't get me to stay at a job i no longer enjoyed i do want you to know he is at amazon so you know from one golden handcuffs to another golden handcuffs really a failed role transition with offices shutting down in march 2020 all the best parts of work socializing the co-workers the perks disappeared yeah yeah that's true that's why that's why i literally left as soon as possible i i genuinely i genuinely drove out of san jose the day lockdowns were announced by gavin newsom just got the hell out of there went straight to south dakota and never came back let's see and all you were left with let's see all you were left with was work itself so if you didn't like the work and all that all that you had covid magnified this fact 10x more yeah that's a good point i think covet really made you realize how much you like your work and how much friends you actually were with your co-worker you know what i mean you think you're friends with your co-worker but when all of a sudden covet hits you don't ever talk to them again probably weren't that much friends you know i wasn't enjoying the work but it wasn't always this way i worked at netflix for almost four years as a senior software engineer in growth i know growth i used to work in growth in fact i was on team gas growth acquisition and social and at the beginning i felt like i was getting paid handsomely to learn and up around a year and a half mark i loved it netflix culture was so different than than the more secretive culture i experienced before at amazon the memos for every product decisions were available yep for all employees to read yep this is actually really nice it was like getting paid to do an nba it's actually really cool you do get to read every single memo why we make decisions how we make decisions all that kind of stuff it's actually really cool i actually really like it and you get to comment so a lot of times if you get in early and you're really active about it you can actually start asserting yourself in conversations and making points and all that it's pretty cool netflix is transparency around all of its product decisions was one of the best perks of working there it contrasts with the more secretive cultures of apple and amazon yep towards the latter half of my time the engineering work started to feel like copy and paste yep it's why i don't like doing ui you need to spin up a new microservice copy and paste the old one change the business logic you're done new a b test copy the old one change a few test variations you're done this is like a reason why i didn't i just don't like you i work in general is i always feel like it's just all copy pasta it's just like 100 percent copy pasta netflix is a very into a b testing stuff oh yeah and there's four variations on the call to action they tested for the home page let's go let's see i feel like there's no doubt that engineering could execute for netflix but i felt the better question was whether a particular project was a good use of engineering resources at all so i wanted to transition into a product management where i could lead the efforts i spent two years going in a circle around the company networking non-stop talking to every organization and applying for every role i could find so something that he's not telling you in this in this whole thing right here is what is product management at netflix so product management at netflix is significantly different than any organization you're ever going to be at product management is the track to effectively ceo so every product manager is the one who gets qualitative research done right they go they go to the ci the insights team customer insights they go there and they they do research and then they try to they ideate and come up with the next product that will be built for netflix the next big test so there is no such thing as like you know this isn't coming from c-suite it's coming from product managers product managers make the new ideas and then they get design and coding to help them build the new idea and so product managers we often say internally are like mini ceos they are ceo of the website they decide how and what the website's going to look like and then there's like cross organization product managers such as jennifer nieva used to be one where she used to be a product manager of originals and so we'd build originals together her and i worked on the pig episode you know the one i talked about yesterday and so it's like you come up with these ideas did someone do that and come up with netflix games effectively but netflix games was probably a little bit higher up in the sense that it was you know are we gonna do this as a company right yeah galacticus i spent two years going around a circle yeah so it's not surprising at all getting into product management is extremely hard at netflix there's like eight of them for all of ui and that's including product management leadership so to get into this this is like virtually impossible you have to have years doing stuff a lot of them were high ranking people at a previous company you know c-suite people slash you know vice presidents and other places it's not that's straightforward i submitted a proposal on what my priorities would be as a pm and i applied to every org customer service developer productivity studios partnerships and notifications i suggested creating a role on my own team to help manage the growing infrastructure so that is different than a product manager at that point that'd be more like a project manager it's different right i also suggest that other pms could delegate more of their work to me so they can free up their time and grow their org all these proposals ultimately didn't pan out yep i get that i spent two years going in a circle trying to get a pm job at netflix but ultimately ran out of options hmm so it sounds like he just wanted to do a lateral change he wanted to do something completely different and we just didn't have the availability for that slash he didn't have the experience to do it looking back i realized my mistake i thought if i just try harder i'd eventually get the job but now i realize that some things are sometimes something sometimes things are out of your control because of structural issues netflix doesn't have a process in place to support horizontal role changes like this it's not it's not horizontal it's very vertical to me this is this is a very vertical change i have never seen an engineer successfully trend transition to product manager here yep i don't i have never seen it either i have been here longer than that guy has they offered me more opportunities to partner with project managers to develop product skills which i was grateful for but partnering is not the same as having a role itself yeah ultimately you can't just read a book about swimming and expect to learn how to swim you have to jump in the water yeah absolutely warning let's see waning motivation and waning performance towards the end of my failed pm job search i felt the high salary was increasingly a bad deal before i was earning and learning now i was only earning yeah this can be tricky so i'm just going to make an observation right here right now he wanted to do a big change in his career and there wasn't appetite or availability or potentially even a skill gap issue that wasn't there and then to follow up on top of it he wasn't exercising and growing his own role all of his extra effort and energy was going into this role he wished he could have and so when he looked and went to his role it was never growing it was never expanding in technical difficulty he was never growing into the position he wanted to be in and so it became very very difficult i think is what he's seeing right here his expectations i know everyone's right now saying well the privilege you know if you're earning 450 just deal with it you know there's this weird thing that happens to people and expectations you could be earning anything and if you start having a misalignment with your expectations you can feel a lot of things i've seen it happen to a lot of people i've seen people at the tippity top of their career making over a million dollars a year i knew specifically of a person and it just wasn't working they were misaligned and all of a sudden they expected x to happen and it wouldn't happen and it just became this grinding thing where it became worse and worse it's almost like the manifestation of your own work is actually the thing that you feel most attacked by i don't know it's just really really weird in some sense i've felt this before because i had this mis expectation it really made me miserable and whoopsies i did not want to do that dude stop doing that please it was really really hard and i know i know it's easy if you aren't making that money to say well the money is very great you should just be happy with it but it's so weird the tricks the mind can play no matter what you know right now look at this look i mean real talk right now look at this we have 1500 people watching the stream right now that is out of this world if i go to twitchtracker.com the primagen and i look at the numbers right now right now point one two percent of all people that speak english on twitch are watching my channel that's out of this world and that's not even the current number right that's huge look at this graph that is huge but guess what if all of a sudden i start getting less and a little bit less like let's say just 800 you know how weird and odd that can start to feel and all of a sudden even though it's 800 and that's crazy and that's amazing and that's the top point oh whatever percent of twitch of all time i can still feel like crap and so that's the problem numbers are so damn deceiving and so awful and so just everything it's so easy to look at it from the outside and think one thing but there's always you know there's always this other thing involved this relative weirdness and i understand where he's going this guy just wound himself up he's probably depressed he's feeling really shitty things aren't going his way he's constantly looking at something else comparison is the thief of joy absolutely he's looking and just assuming like he just cannot help but to keep comparing why am i not here why am i not doing this what is this happening and boom dude it just kills your heart because comparison that is the point of cons comparison it steals and robs you of all things that are good and so even though an amazing job with an amazing using ability to grow and the amazing ability to have everything you could possibly want in a job and all that feels horrible and on the other side is this an amazing green grass like just awesome experience that you're not having and therefore it's awful and i i get that one time when i was in 2016 i wanted to get into management okay i was sick of programming i was doing what everybody else does that talk about burnout i was moving away from programming and i thought less programming would make me happy and i started focusing really hard on management and guess what i had the worst year of my life in programming of all time the worst year i've never been more unhappy in my entire lifetime than that year i still think about that as one of the hardest times ever i felt so awful this was at netflix i have never ever ever been so unhappy and i felt so burnt out and i hated everything i did like constantly and it was so hard i don't think people realized how shitty things can feel and it was just the worst it was just so bad and then i had my third kid i took four months off netflix and i programmed every day for like eight hours and i just tried to build my own thing i tried to build a crypto trading bot it was really a lot of fun and and it like re-sparked something inside of me all of a sudden i couldn't wait to program all of a sudden i couldn't wait to dive in and then i realized what the problem was this is 2017. come on crypto was hot okay crypto was hot this was before crypto zombies this was hot hot as [ __ ] okay and that like blew it up inside of me for how amazing and exciting right programming can be and i realized my problem wasn't that i was my problem wasn't that i wasn't becoming a manager the problem was is that i was letting myself have burnout because every because i was just like just stuck in this comparison problem oh my goodness and then all of a sudden the moment it changed boom you're right cam you're absolutely right it was just yeah yeah it's true paychecks don't release dopamine in your brain like being recognized it's very very true and all of a sudden it just like blew up inside of me like how much i was wrong about so many things i realized that diving in and becoming awesome at programming and enjoying programming for the sake of programming was just awesome and all of a sudden i loved it you know like i couldn't even help it then i was just i was all in at that point i was all in and that's pretty much why you see this stream this stream is purely because i became so damn motivated from programming from that that i just like it started building up inside of me and all of a sudden i quit doing ui i jumped clean out of the ui went back started chasing into the things i'm more excited about and just kept pushing kept pushing and guess what it's very easy to horizontally move at netflix horizontally moving from one engineering to another engineering sure it took me like six months to get it done but i got it done we got it done we locked it down and guess what high-fived it come bam built a bunch of fun stuff at netflix i made it so that we could tell that every single image at netflix if somebody has uploaded or not uploaded the proper language based on production failures because at that point we were exploding with a huge amount of images and originals and we had zero infrastructure to know if we were actually serving it we actually had no idea if we knew we were serving it at all and that is this magical point where i was just like boom i'm gonna do all this foul course 2015 2016 which led me into the kind of the depression era which led me into the wanting to try to do management which led me into the worst time of my life life of all time and then now things are just way way cooler you know what i mean and so yeah and i mean i solved and made some really kick-ass problems but i was i i just you know i just felt passionate about something again and so then i made awesome tech and i just came up with ideas and that made me get the next horizontal position which got me out of front end and i just kept coming up with tool ideas and things that would make engineering easier and some of the tools were awesome and some of the tools were horrifying and they were bad ideas and then i got recognized and got onto the next team now i'm on the platform team for tvui which is primarily what like builds the actual product for television and now it's going amazing it's going fantastic i love what i built it's awesome how do i come up with good ideas you look at what people are doing and try to imagine a world that could exist in which could solve problems whether they're having or problems they don't realize they have today and you just try to be good at it like my current problem was just or the current tool i'm working on was purely me going this is what p this is what's happening this is what i think will solve what's happening because what how we're going about it is completely inverted and i made something and now that's the de facto standard and then you know then the next thing happened and then the next thing happened and now i'm going to be able to potentially even get an intern or a low or a e4 engineer to come work with me on the tool i'm making to help me build a front end for it maybe i don't know we're still kind of working out the details but that's like a real thing i'm wondering if you're the oldest at netflix my team the average tenure at my team is has more tenure than me you know what i mean that's crazy if you think about okay let's keep on going here it started to feel like i was making a previous career mistake again oh hold on my team's goals and my interest also started to diverge my team was moving more towards a more engineering focused direction involving a platform migration but my interests were revering more towards entrepreneurship and product management the engineering work i was assigned would never feel applicable to any of the future work i did yeah so here we go we just have a real miss right at this point this is a full-on roll miss i started to feel i was making a previous career mistake again staying in a job that wasn't a great fit longer than i should have this mistake is more costly than people think if you stay an extra two years at a job that you wanted to leave and you did that over five jobs of your lifetime you just wasted 10 years of your life working at jobs you didn't want to i feel like i was wasting my time i feel like this is a kind of a shitty pessimistic view on things this also i mean real talk to me this reeks more privilege than any other statement in this entire in this entire paragraph you know if you have a family and you're the sole provider of your family sometimes you have to you have to grunt that crap out and you have to find a better opportunity you can't just like oh i don't want to work because i don't like this no like a lot of people's life doesn't revolve around this type of decision making you know you you have requirements and things you can't change externally and you just have to do it because you have to do it i feel like there's definitely some missing comfort zone problems you know practically speaking i cannot just quit netflix if i quit netflix it would be really hard on my family we'd have to sell we'd have to make some serious changes within my familiar structure to make things work out i like my job at netflix i love it but i you know in some sense i am tied to it right i'd have to sell the well my f and well is still we've had people here for the last two weeks trying to fix it with a new technique and this is already like six thousand seven thousand dollars spent and we still don't have water i still have this big ass jug of water in my garage just sitting there it's my big ass jug of vs code tears and it sucks my motivation waned and my performance waned with it i blame i became less engaged in meetings minimized doing any work that was directly affected or directly relevant to developing product management skills and dragging my feed on communication the only motivation at the end is just trying not to get fired it was just kind of sad to feel like i had reached a point where i was aiming for such a low bar and struggled even to cross that you know again i feel like this person jason lynn whoever you are you you didn't you never really liked programming you just got into it as like you know it was fun in the beginning because it was all new but the moment that either you had to take the mantle and make yourself much better or really you're just interested in something else and programming just was an avenue it really was this it doesn't sound like you're really into the whole programming thing to begin with you know unfortunately my manager started to notice he in a heated performance review that lasted over two hours he told me that i needed one to be more engaged in the migration and to be more communicative in his words i had to improve in these areas if you wish to remain on this team yeah that's how working works reassessing life priorities during covid-19 the pandemic was a wake-up call watching millions of people die from covet made me realize that tomorrow is not guaranteed you could die from covet before any of your dreams are ever realized and the longer you put off a dream the greater the risk of it never had it never happens i mean in some sense this is a this is a good thing to remember that if you wish to try to if you're going to take a risk in life waiting for the perfect opportunity may never exist this is super dramatic absolutely but let's people if there's one thing you could tell me eat the fish or if there's one thing i could tell you eat the fish spit the bones eat the fish spit the bones this is this is an eat a fish spit the bones moment this is very dramatic but the reality is that if you wish to try to make a risky change sometimes you just gotta jump off the cliff and do it you know don't wait for the perfect moment for me it was doing netflix netflix was my big risk my wife was eight months pregnant or eight and a half months pregnant we drove to california with our two dogs and everything completely packed in our subaru outback and when we arrived she was no longer allowed to travel based on like doctor's orders we arrived in a place with no idea who was going to help us with birth we had no doctor we had no friends we had no housing we had two black labs and we did it because we wanted to make sure we could take an adventure and go for something you know sometimes you got to prioritize risk and it's okay to prioritize risk long as everyone involved is okay with it and so i think there's something in here that's you know you can you can eat the fish out of this statement no more next time now is the time inspirational quote i realize what the real cost of golden handcuffs was the cost is your youth your time in your life okay that is like way too dramatic i think the cost of being misaligned at your job and wishing you could do something else but not able to do it at your current job but staying at your job because it pays well is not that's a cost of your time this is a little this is a little too intense people don't accurately judge these costs because the salary is a hard number whereas your value of your youth is more intangible you know your 30s are actually your best years 30s i'm in my 30s right now right now i feel like my 30s are my best years my 20s i was stupid i was a dumbass during my 20s honestly my 20s was the worst should have stopped talking should have stopped talking but really my 20s were my my dumbest ears it's actually my 30s that really i've kind of got into the saddle and understood things much much better i've actually i'm calmed down enough to make better decisions i am more like slow in my decision making to make better things wouldn't the 40s be epic then i'm excited for the 40s i think the 40s have a huge opportunity to be awesome you know youth is overrated youth is wasted on the young as they say wait till you're 40. i'm i'm excited being 47 i can report that the 40s are better than the 30s i love hearing this this is great first off second off this is one of the best parts about twitch programming or programming culture in general we're just older and everybody thinks it's awesome right there's no fascination with youth i remember seeing at my job somebody that was like 50 and i'm thinking man this guy is probably the best programmer i've ever met in my lifetime right it's like the inverse of like gaming culture and internet culture it's so fantastic it's probably the best part of programming is there is ageism but it's the reverse it's like dude those old people they're probably super they're probably super ass smart dude it is the best it is the best part about being uh what's it called in programming love it love it all right hold on let's do that age 20 to 30. here i'll just like this you get it 20s 30s 40s 50s uh 60 plus yeah oh let's go like this let's go tenant tens right so if any' year old 1980 or 15 year olds whatever 20 30 40 50 plus let's go like that that seems more fair tens mean tens right 10 through 19. 10 through 19. all right let's see it 10-19 come on you guys are a bunch of programmers you should know this by now all right so we got a lot of 20s in here but we got a lot of 30s in here let's go look at that feels bad man feels bad man the only thing that hurts it is that your kids thought we were the same age okay tj aren't you like 27 or something nonsense damn there's a lot of you there's a lot of you youngins in here 300 in the 20s 160 in the 30s tj you're not your brain has barely fully formed you don't know nothing you don't know nothing'50 plus let's go dude i guarantee you these' they're just wise as [ __ ] they're awesome programmers or even more badass they're making a late light late life switch dude like think about how cool that would be imagine being 50 and making a switch into programming dude i would have mad respect for you i would yeah so sweet yeah it's not surprising that 20s won but i think the bigger thing is that 30s are like a huge portion and 40s that's a lot right that's incredible also what's incredible is how many people between the ages of 10 to 19 damn well welcome 10 to 19 year olds i hope you hope you do whatever you do i don't know what i don't even know what you guys do anymore watch tick tock what the hell do you guys do what the hell do 19 year olds do these days you guys like smoke with cigarettes drink near beer what do you do play beer pong what what is it tick tocks you know when you get older you're all about that dick top oh yeah vape okay vaping yeah okay yeah i'll tell you this much a 19 oh gosh tj i can't even read it tj 19 year olds watch the guy react to dumb articles on the internet oh okay yeah all the best programmers are in the the third decades of life it is true worked in capital markets for 25 years at the age of 45 decided to jump and start my own probably the best oh nice dude that is that is sweet all right let's keep on going all right hold on but just because something is hard to measure doesn't make it any less valuable than something countable like money yeah okay it's hard to measure the value of a brand mental health or love oh love but we know it matters one really beautiful part about netflix is that you can really get your job done in 40 hours honestly you can really get your job done in 40 hours and if you wanted to really lean into personal life the reason why i can stream the reason why i can do any of these things is because of like being able to accomplish my job in a reasonable amount of time and honestly it's awesome it's i've i go to work every day at 5am i get done with work every day at 4 pm and from 4 p.m till 7 45 i spend it with the family from 7 to 7 45 i read i read awesome books to my kid right now we're on wheel of time book two it's been great i don't know it's awesome it's awesome i love it it's it's a great great lifestyle then from right now because i'm doing this course from 7 45 till 9 9 15. i do i do work on the course that i you know and then after that from nine to like 10 o'clock i spend it with the wife wheel of time is epic yeah have you read lord of the rings yeah we read through lord of the rings and the hobbit i've read the hobbit twice in lord of the rings once to the kids it's great overworked much no i feel good because when i disconnect so the one thing about working hard and doing and doing a good job and working really really hard is that when you leave your job you can just blank mind it right i don't need to think about it i'm gone i'm not thinking about [ __ ] okay i'll have my production my production alerts they're gonna go to my phone but everything else i'm not thinking about at all right and so then i can actually disconnect foley from my job because i know i've done a very good job i've done a very very good job doing the right things and making the right decisions and that is just something that i can do and it feels great feels really really good seeing all these people die from cove it made me scared that one day my tombstone would read here lies michael he spent his life work doing or his life doing work he never wanted to do then he got covered and died rest in peace i really think that whoever made his tombstone is kind of a dick can we all just like can we all just be like yo michael you need to get better people in your life if that's what they're gonna put on your tombstone this is pretty serious drama i feel like he's really overestimating especially if he's a youth a ute all right let's you know you know anyways oh gosh we're about to enter the final days what is this jesus jesus coming back here i the longer i stayed in a job i didn't enjoy the greater the chance that this would be my tombstone oh [ __ ] i i knew i had to take action now i could not keep kicking the hard career questions down the road i had to quit this is intense i saw a bad performance review and threat of getting fired as a way out but i wanted to get that to get a severance package first without getting fired i feel like this is getting really close and that's and that's why we went to amazon [applause] and that's why he went down well i i would say that right now this strongly reads like have you ever read a r slash am i the [ __ ] this feels like that moment here i proposed it to my manager you know one-on-one and a few weeks later we discussed a preemptive severance package he i said something along the lines of my performance is declining because my motivation is declining and i don't see my motivation improving the team's goals are diverging further from my career goals what if we discussed a preemptive severance package out of netflix rather than letting this rag on that way netflix says money and i can find a better i don't know i don't know how i feel about this whole thing honestly like if i were a manager honestly if i were like real talk if i were a manager i would i would like talk to legal and be like this is like extortion he's saying that i'm gonna just become worse and worse and worse and you're gonna have to fire me and pay me severance so why don't you just cut it and just pay me the severance now so you won't waste my time and won't waste your time honestly it feels like extortion like i'm gonna not do a good job and you're gonna have to fire me so why don't you just give it to me now and we don't get fired huh it feels like i mean this just feels weird this is a ballsy move this is a ballsy ass move and it's more of a ballsy move to put this on the internet damn i mean give them props it's a win it's a win-win i know it's a win-win i i get paid money to not work and you don't have to pay me as long to not work i mean this is giga chad move i would fully agree this is full but yes it does sound illegal it fully sounds illegal and i how i actually definitely honestly like writing this this sounds really like you know it's a woof woof after you discussed with hr what the what wrong scene that damn it karen carrot i went to the wrong place karen let's see after discussing it with him at hr the final agreed to preemptively terminate me and i got my final severance package out golden handcuffs be gone light let's see i thought my life would be over after leaving corporate but it has been the exact opposite he did join amazon which is like definitionally corporate i was worried i'd have no social life but i actually met even more people after quitting other creators entrepreneurs and builders i saw my mental health improved as my anxiety i developed from worrying if i miss another email or slack message disappeared oh man i feel i i really feel bad for him because this like feels like a totally unhealthy situation but it doesn't feel like a totally unhealthy situation because of netflix it feels like it because of like his perspective and i feel like i genuinely feel bad about this now i feel deep calmness inside of me an unshakable belief that everything will be okay even if any future success is not guaranteed right now what if you get into the same situation again it seems pretty shakeable honestly real talk this seems like you could easily you're you're making this other life into something that it's not that somehow it's gonna fulfill you and when you get it you're not going to be fulfilled if you're not happy now you're probably not happy later just real talk no matter i you know i remember being on a ui team or i remember being on a ui team wishing i could work an open source i worked in open source i was miserable i remember thinking okay the problem is is that i'm not being creative enough i worked on a ui team i was miserable why why why because i constantly thought there was something that was going to make me happy at my job and i wasn't being happy i wasn't happy at all i wasn't happy at all i did ui yeah there's no better incentive than knowing that i could capture all of the value of my own work me one year ago creating efficiency so i can work less than five hours a day me now creating efficiency so i can work greater than 10 hours a day what changed working for someone versus working to build things i'm passionate about yeah yeah i mean this is a great statement this is this is a great great observation into human behavior when you feel like you have ownership this happens like this is this is like this is the definition of ownership major linkedin vibes though strong but it's on twitter this is this is strong twitter linkedin vibes you know yeah i see that read right dude anyways and by working only on things that energized me i let's see it might sound ironically unlocked potential or it might ironically unlock potential earnings even greater than i was making before it's been eight months since i quits in may 2021 i took a bit of a break for the rest of 2021 you know the old half year break seven month break i lived in nyc for a few months took a road trip through utah to arizona and generally just enjoyed life zoom or take zoom or take i i literally could never do that i literally could never do that i have four kids there's no world that exists where i'm not working i know i do this i mean the joys of being young and single right i actually i actually much much more i just side note i'm much much much much would trade out any single day of the week my current life for any of that life honestly if i could spend one week on a beach that'd be great awesome super sweet love it if i spent two weeks on a beach i think i'd be miserable like this lifestyle for me is miserable being able to i don't know having a bit more purpose in my life providing for the kids providing for my wife making opportunity for her to be like the happiest she can be there's something about that that is way more fulfilling than ease for me ease does not bring fulfillment ease just brings emptiness it's great in the moment it's great as a spice and a life so you've had sex four times yeah art user but anyways it's just real talk i feel like it's great as a spice of life it's not great as a main course i would be really sad if it was a main course personally although i'm just starting and i let's see say i've decided to fully or to commit fully to working for myself although i'm just starting i don't have any real dependable streams of income i'm going to trust the process if i'm working on things that energize me good things will happen i truly believe now that playing it safe is the riskiest choice of all i think there's some truth to this there's some truth to it you get you got to learn how you got to know how to risk risk you know risk tolerance is a good thing like honestly again i should have said no to netflix by all available data me working at netflix was just the riskiest choice ever it was stupid but it was a good i did i i dude at at 65 i'm energized af let's go that's great when you play it safe you are just exposed to all the dangers except you have no chance of that upside as helen keller once said avoid danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure the fearful are caught as often as the bold that's a beautiful quote it's a beautiful quote there was a time here on twitch when i kept getting followed by people with the name helen keller's dj helen keller something helen keller's this that and the other helen keller's ear pods if i'm not mistaken like they're just crazy all right well good job michael michael lynn i hope that i hope that you found the joy that you're looking for i think i think what i read from this article is what i see in a lot of young people especially in a lot of 20s and the person i saw in myself ultimately in the 20s the reason why i used to smoke meth the reason why i used to do all this crap i exact exact same things i was just looking for meaning honestly i was looking hard for meaning and it just sounds like a search for meaning and just hoping he found the right one that's going to give him enough meaning to be happy and you know i'm not trying i'm not trying to dunk on him or anything i'm not trying to be mean to the guy it just sounds hard it just sounds really hard because for me it was a feeling i i dumped all my what would give me meaning into a feeling and so of course sex and drugs was how i was trying to like get some sort of meaning and man i did a lot of drugs it was i did a lot of them and man i've never been more empty in my entire lifetime than those times and i always look back at that the fix was non-intuitive you know what i mean it was not intuitive i was kind of stuck in this dumb cul-de-sac right i just kept thinking well if that didn't work maybe more would and then you know but without drugs you would not be who you are today exactly these experiences make you who you are today for sure you are an amalgamation of your past whether you like it or not and your past can be really shitty i was physically abused one time sexually abused one time dad died when i was young blah blah blah blah oh i could name all the things why you know my life sucked and all these kind of things but you know what very happy for the life i've gotten i'm very very happy that i got to grow up the way i got to grow up because without that i wouldn't be the person whom i am today don't say sorry it's not a sorry you know it's it's something that happened to little me not adult me and whether i repressed it moved on from it did whatever it doesn't matter because it is you know i i wouldn't you know this wouldn't exist without that so i appreciate it you know i can appreciate it in a in a way you know what i mean i i sorry i suck at these type of things because i can feel myself getting a little emotional about it the clip i found my way let's see when i found out my girlfriend was pregnant i quit my meaningless job [ __ ] around for 10 months for 14 hours a day studying web dev and have been a full stack developer for five months now and of course a father let's go you know again kids give a lot of kids really give you a lot of reasons to do things that you wouldn't do otherwise you know how much i was just kind of like honestly i was just kind of a [ __ ] for a lot of my life and when i had kids it really changed who i was i'm young and single and even i can't think of doing that i'm scared it would bulldoze my career and i love what i do yeah let's see just do a transition to karen room and save you from the emotions i know i know i said i said the b word i'm sorry all right anyways
