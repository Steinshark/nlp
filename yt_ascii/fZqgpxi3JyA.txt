what is a double colon in python where can we use this and why would we use this and the answer is quite simple but first let's go ahead and create an array so we can demonstrate how we use it a bit better and this is just going to be a list of a range of numbers all the way to 21 so from 0 to 21 and that means we're going to have 0 all the way until 20 in a list and we can even demonstrate that by printing these numbers so let's go ahead and print this function and when we run it we'll get all of the numbers up until 20. now so far that didn't really explain anything but to continue with this we're going to go ahead and talk about slicing in python how we can slice arrays and usually if you want to slice an array you'll go ahead and say numbers and and inside here you can choose whether you want to slice from the beginning or slice from the end and what this means is we can slice everything before 10 and when we print this we'll get an array that prints out 10 to 20. otherwise by adding a colon in front of the 10 we're slicing everything after the array up until 10. so it's going to print 0 2 9 and the reason this only prints until nine is because if you ever want to add these again python made sure that we would be able to do that by adding both of these as you can see we now have a perfect array just by having a colon in front and a colon after now this is fine and all but where does the double colon come in in well when you slice an array you have three different sections that you can specify so here we were slicing everything before 10 but here we can say that we only want to print the numbers from 10 to 16 and if we print this we'll get the numbers from 10 to 16. and these are two of the spots that we can specify in a slice but there's also a third one which is the step so if you want to go up by two we can choose to just print the even numbers as you can see here we have 10 12 14 because it goes from 10 to 16 up to at a time now we can choose also not to specify any of these and to do that we will end up with a double colon and what the double colon says is ignore the first specification and the second specification and just go up by two steps for each item in the array so when we print this we will get back an array of even numbers and what's so cool about this is that you can still specify a starting number so you can start at 10 and get all of the even numbers back from the array and this works with any kind of array so it doesn't have to be numbers it also works with arrays of strings tuples and so on so you can really use this slicing syntax anywhere and this is the most common place you'll find the double colon and if you want to ignore the double colon you can also say you want every two numbers until 10 and this is the way to do it so to sum up this video we use the double colon for slicing syntax it just allows us to easily go up by two or by four and by any number we want in an array as you can see here we use 10 double colon 2 to start from 10 and go up 2 for each element we can also do it every three and remove the 10 and we'll get 0 3 6 9 12 15 and' return to us but anyways guys let me know what you think about this feature in the comment section down below also let me know if you enjoyed this video and if you did i'll try to make some more similar to this one but as always guys with that being said thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next lesson
