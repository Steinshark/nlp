the internet because now attention is everything it's in some ways a sped up version of what the ancient world had because what will survive is only that which gains attention and which is able to keep attention even if it's for a short time and so inevitably the world will fall back into tropes of of attention and memory so if i say that trump is brutish but it's complicated and he has this quality but mostly negative things i won't get anybody of attention but if i say satan then all of a sudden everybody is listening and so we end up falling back into ancient tropes of of mythological patterns but way faster i mean now it's [music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] thank you hello everyone i am here with mary harrington and i know many of you have been looking forward to this conversation we've been kind of skirting around each other i've been i've been watching it from the sidelines seeing very many interesting discussions and her wonderful articles but it is a article called fairy the fairy tale allure of conspiracies which really kind of caught me and i thought would be an interesting starting point for a conversation with her and so mary thanks for coming on thank you for having me and so maybe you can tell us a bit about what the basic thesis of that article is and we can start the conversation because i think it comes close to many of the things that we talk about in the symbolic world as well yeah it's a simple thesis which is that i mean it's it's what people say about alex jones right that he may be factually wrong but he's often directionally right yeah or you know to put it in slightly slightly more kind of highfaluting terms and without the the extremely problematic commentator what i'm saying is that when i talk about conspiracy theories or or the the stories that float around which tend to get dismissed as comparative conspiracy theories is that they made the the factual details of them can sometimes be way off and very baroque but at a metaphorical level where as a as a poetic level they're often they're often pretty much pretty on the nose yeah i think that's an interesting i think there's definitely the point to look at and we can actually use tools of storytelling analysis you know you can use the same kind of tools you use to interpret myths or interpret fairy tales or religious stories to look at some of the tropes that appear in these conspiracy theories you know the the lizard people one i i like to look at the extreme ones because i think they're the best cases you know the lizard people one is is so simple you know it's the idea that there are snake people and that those snake people are not like us but in some ways they've ended up becoming our own leaders and so we have i mean it just basically manifests a deep distrust in leadership and the idea that the people that are running us the people that have control over us do not want our interests they have other interests that are strange you know they have strange interests and not our own i remember thinking much the same whether there was a whole there was a rumor i mean it's still flying around there's a whole series of rumors that flight that slot around the internet about her job joe biden is not in fact real some people say he's an ai or that he's his computer generated simulation or you know and another variant of this either slightly more banal variant of this is the one that just says he's senile i don't know what i don't i mean i can't i can't attest to the truth or otherwise of any of these but what they seem to me to be conveying is a sense that the the president of the united states is not in fact the leader of the united states and the in some sense you know and the details vary he's he he's a sort of cardboard cutout behind which something is calling the shots and that's that's the that that's the story that's actually being told and the rest of it is kind of is just kind of coloration yeah yeah and it's story trolls really and it's kind of falling into ancient story tropes which are almost they're necessary to call to the importance of the of the moment moment you could say you know i when you look at the way people tell me like say tell stories in movies is a good way to understand that you know in real life the two the good guy and the bad guy actually don't fight they don't duke it out they have armies and they have you know they have all these bureaucracies between them and then they have these massive complicated things that are really boring to look at and to to think about but if you want to get the image of it you have to the two guys the two protagonists even if they're the president and some other character they actually have to physically duke it out or if you want to show a bomb in a movie you have to have a red blinking light like no terrorist would ever put a red blinking light on a bomb but you have to have that in order to signal to people what is going on and i think that in a lot of these kind of crazy wild imagistic stories you have this similar type of approach some of the type of tropes that are being used in in the way we remember them right and one of the examples i gave of these which actually is it yeah a provocative example i suppose concerns the theory which also sloshes around its kind of q and on adjacent i guess that there exists a conspiracy a sort of baby eating satanist conspiracy i mean theories of that kind have been sloshing around for some time but there's definitely a cue adjacent version of that story that there there exists a cabal of people who's who are for esoteric possibly devil worshiping reasons kidnapping and murdering babies and i'm thinking well actually this is probably not true however there is there is that there is an organization that calls itself the satanic temple and they have created a telehealth clinic in new mexico where you can you can obtain abortion pills in order to circumvent the changes in legislation since it stops and they have also launched a court case under religious freedom legislation in the united states to protect the right to what they call it an abortion ritual in order to release complicated feelings around terminating a pregnancy and i'm thinking this i i mean it's it's not it's not quite the thing but you can sort of see how you get from a to b right yeah yeah and it's also i think the idea of people who eat your children is a very important image and it's a very dark image of course we know how that it's been used in very dark ways in the past but it is it is an image which shows the notion that something is taking your fruit like something is taking that which is important to you someone is stealing it away from he's kind of pulling it away from you and and one of the like one of the one of the important shifts that in the kind of conspiracy language or this kind of imagistic language which is important to notice is that in the ancient world we used to use these types of trope for for the people that we didn't know who they were right it's like the cannibals and the monsters and the lizard people and the you know the the dog-headed men they're on the edge of the world right there are these weird things that we don't know about these kind of strangers that we don't know about there's an interesting shift that happened which is that now these types of images are used against our own elites which is not something to to just kind of shy to just brush away it seems like there is a shift it means that if the normal traditional society little tribal society anywhere in the world tends to be suspicious of the stranger now we're suspicious of our own power the people that are are powerful over us that's a very that's a different thing yeah it's a significant shift i mean it tracks with returning to a more banal level of interpretation it it tracks where the pervasive loss of trust institutions but you know the the the explanation for it or rather the the emotional you you can you can see you can see where emotionally you're re-situating the lizard guys in in our own elites rather than outside on the edge of the world makes sense if there's been a pervasive loss of trust in institutions and loss of trust in the in the alignment of of elites with the masses and that that's measurably the case i mean i interviewed peter turchin last week who writes about elite overproduction and yeah the way the way in which elites need to be kept in check or at least roughly aligned with with the masses because otherwise they will have a tendency to turn power into goodies for themselves at which at which point that sets off a whole cycle of anita overproduction which usually accommodates in crisis and some kind of an uprising at which point the whole cycle starts again and in his view i mean i think that is his phrase was america is now in a revolutionary situation and i think i can't i can't speak for for where you are that britain doesn't feel a million miles off but in in the divergence between the interests of those with the with with any access to the levels of power and and those those from whom they're siphoning wealth and resources and opportunities to lead a decent life so so given this you know the fact that the fact that that's emanating you know at the sort of mythical mythic level as as lizard people who walk amongst us or you know baby eating cabals gathering on epstein island or whatever whatever variant of the story we're we're looking at it doesn't it doesn't feel so strange really what i find fascinating just kind of zooming out for a bit is just how radically and how quickly it's become normal again to speak in mythic terms since since we transitioned from from print to a digital culture i mean this is a this is a kind of long long term preoccupation of mine the that transition from print to digital culture i i read english literature at university and i was lucky in in being probably one of the last to get frog march through a prop food through a fairly a fairly comprehensive kind of canonical english undergrad in the sense that my others i mean it was pretty sketchy but it was it was pretty much the entire english literary canon from beowulf onwards and i ended up with in in in order so you got this that you've got the sense of historicity and the sense of the sense of the evolution of ideas and and tropes and of of literary forms over time and one of the things i found incredibly interesting and just has been preoccupying me ever since is the transition from pre-modern from from the pre-modern to the modern moment and particularly particularly around how how stereotypes tropes stereotypes and tropes disappear or become low status at the point of modernity in a sense yeah the the idea so what well i can take one word to illustrate what i mean we when we say commonplace we mean it in a dismissive sense right but a commonplace in medieval terms was was something that you took quite seriously like the i forget the greek term for it but it's a rhetorical term that refers to to areas of shared meaning which are widely understood and which you can reference if you want to make rhetorical points in the in in using using the art of public speaking so the common places might refer to love or to the relations between men and women or to the duties the the obligations of a prince or the whole series of them and if you study rhetoric in in the ancient up to the medieval world you'd be expected to have a decent working knowledge of the common places top boy in fact they're a conceptual place but they're understood as in a sense a very real place that that people that have that that's shared and everybody can visit in a sense it's the public square yeah but but on the sort of thematic level and all of that disappears over the course of modernity to the point where we had to speak of something being commonplace is to speak of it being banal and ordinary and low status and probably belonging to the peasants it's boring it has nothing nothing to recommend it because what we're interested in now is the signal and not the noise and and and and common places are under are just dismissed as noise rather than being read a signal yeah and what i find fascinating about the the having left the the modern era which for for the digital rather having left the print era for the digital era is that all of those top wire back it's just that we call them memes now yeah i think it has to do with the reality of attention that's the way that i think about it is that the the ancient world was one in which attention was extremely valuable because we had to remember things you know although we did have writing that writing was was there were a few books and a few people had access to them and so attention and memory are extremely important and there are certain patterns of attention and memory which are pervasive and those you know the the older they are the more let's say mythical they are the easier they are to to to perjure you know and so it's like if i want you to remember something i have to be careful not to make it too idiosyncratic i have to make it you have to have to contract it in a way that is as universal as possible and connects as closely to you as possible that you can remember it and you can not only remember it but then pass it down to the next generation now what written culture was able to do was in some ways to stilt that to some degree so you end up with you know victor you go in like massive historically accurate novels that are that are that are very idiosyncratic and try to describing all these very little things but that in some ways is a it's also in the myth of this kind of authoritarian publisher and you know this kind of centralized streamline of information that peaked with tv like television was the peak of that you know where you have this like streamlined of of a high supposedly high-minded information that is that is programming given to us but the internet because now attention is everything it's in some ways a sped up version of what the ancient world had and it's a sped up virgin because what will what will survive is that only that which gains attention and which is able to keep attention even if it's for a short time and so inevitably the world will fall back into tropes of of attention and memory so if i say that trump is is a is is brutish but it's complicated and he has you know and he has this quality but mostly negative things i won't get anybody of attention but if i say satan then all of a sudden everybody is listening you know and so and so we we end it we end falling we end up falling back into ancient tropes of a mythological patterns but way faster i mean now it's it's set up and it's also being it's being filled in with a lot of the let's say the the strange part of that because we don't have a common place so much we just have attention so we're just like cycling attention yeah yeah yeah yeah yes and no i think there are thorough magic landscapes emerging but they but are very much at the grassroots and among subcultures and in in a way yeah it's moving very fast i mean just going back to the trump is citing one of my informal metrics for whether or not a political figure gets cut through in the internet age is it could this can could an utterance by this person ever be sampled over a base beat and cause the crowd to go wild and if the answer is no then they're then they're gonna they're gonna sleep without trace yeah that if someone can't meme it into the into people's mind i mean you can i listen and you know i don't i have no i have no particular fondness for the orange man right but pretty much everything he says it could be sampled over a base pitch that's right and i don't i don't like that this is the way the internet that the the way the way internet attention works but it but it is and whether whether we wanted it to or not i mean the last british politician that got sampled for for a rave that was boris johnson which which figures really whatever else you may think of boris johnson he was box office now that we i mean until somebody else shows up who's box office in the same way we're basically in the in the sink but but thinking about i mean you're saying i just wanted to add one thing to your your theory of attention which i think is bang on it's about it's about what sticks and what can be remembered because the the flow of information on the digital conditions is so fast that unless you unless something something sticks in a very catchy way it will just disappear without trace and i mean most of the stuff that i write in that sense is eminently forgettable which i remind myself of every possible opportunity most of my this is why i like to meme as well as as well as theorizing at length because you often find that that a coinage a two or three word meme coinage can unpack into four or five thousand words or sometimes fifty just depending on depending on how hard you're trying to explain it to normal people who aren't far too online for their own good but i wanted to add a materialist layer to that as well being a crypto marxist that i am which is about and the relationship between meaning making and money which which is distinct in the print era those of the the economics of copyright printing and relative information scarcity meant that for a while for maybe i don't know 250 years it was actually possible to make your living directly as a writer and that wasn't really the case in the medieval era where you might be employed as by the court as a poet or you might be an itinerant minstrel or apart from that you probably have to go join a monastery and copy bibles and and find and make your livelihood that way you know if you're if you want to enjoy the life of the mind your opportunities as a sort of independent opinion have a are pretty limited and that and that's true again now it's very it's i mean digital multiple digital reproduction makes it more or less impossible to make a living directly as a writer now yeah there are people who do it but their numbers are their numbers are pretty low and the money just isn't that great except for a handful here and there i mean i think about alexander pope who was one of the first to nail this is says translations of homer in the early'th century were insanely successful there was this incredible incredibly avid reading public who were desperate who who maybe hadn't learned latin and greek at university and were desperate to get their hands on the on the cultural goodies and then they flew off the shelves and you know they they made him so much money his translations of homer that he was able to buy this massive house in richmond and you know and create this incredibly elaborate garden there it's i mean these these days these i don't know people are writing listicles for buzzfeed and even they're getting laid off in favor of church it's a different world right it's a more oral world too it's a it's a strange it's not exactly oral in the same way the ancient world was but it ends up being it's post-literate yeah the people that are making money with ideas now are speaking and not writing so much yeah it's true it's true yeah it's a it's very very post-literate the point at which i realized just how just how far into that we are already was when i gave a talk at a very a well-known very respectable very expensive english boys school one of the more conservative of the of the boys schools in private expensive yada yada yada and one of the boys came up to me after my talk and said you should be on tick tock mary because you you realize people my generation just don't read and i'm like you know this is this is the creme de la creme that i'm talking to here this is a scholarship boy one of the most academically rigorous demanding and conservative english public schools that there is and he's telling me that his job that his peers don't read you know this is where we we're not in kansas anymore yeah yeah and the difficulty of the oral culture now is that i i want to be careful not to make too many comparisons with ancient oral culture because it it is ancient or a culture was a culture of memory in the true scent right it was a cult it was a culture of internalizing stories internalizing you know places whereas now it's really it's like it hit dopamine you know it's still it's like quick dopamine hit and forget you know like tick tock i mean there's no that can't be tick tock in my house it's just impossible you know my kids have deleted all that stuff from their phones it's insane it's a it's a very dangerous but it it but in terms of let's say paying attention to culture and noticing patterns it's still helpful it still works because it does it does fall into orality and it does help us see you know what's going on much it's as if a lot of the religious things that we're seeing kind of popping back in have to do with that as well because certain you know like ancient worlds would i don't know what you're going to think about this but like ancient worlds talked about you know let's say transpersonal intelligence this idea of angels and demons and gods and all the intelligences would act on people in like long spans of history and so and so you know they had this this intuition that had that they had developed over millennia about this and they put they engage with this you know in the modern world we were able to dispense with that completely but now because of sped up internet attention culture we see back in the discourse again and we see the agencies act because it's sped up it says if you can see you can see like waves of of control kind of come in and then vanish right they just come in and move away and it's yeah yeah everything's so fast amongst people who are paying attention it's back in the discourse again i mean people talk about agriculturals which is just a you know that's a that's just a modern kind of west coast west coast america where i was saying david's right or angels you know extra extra payment intelligences yeah exactly and so yeah or it's close enough for jazz anyway yeah exactly and then yeah and then ai is also making us forcing us to think about this you know you know i wonder what what as a writer you know ai is with how you see it looming on us like how do you see it affecting your own your own not maybe your personal career but let's say writing in general i remember wrestling about this and it's a while ago i might be wrong but i think it's gonna i i think it it will have a sorting effect in the sense that work workmen-like like jobbing writers will suffer and they they will remember there will continue to be a class of writer whose work is valued and who stand out and they'll they'll and they'll do so by for on two fronts first a capacity for pattern recognition and sense making or rather i mean i mean at the end of the okay we have to think about what an ai is at the end of the day it's a glorified auto correct right it's a very very clever autocorrect that guesses the guess is a guess is based on based on pre-existing patterns but it doesn't originate anything it doesn't actually think and it doesn't it doesn't know it doesn't have any way of sense checking what its output and the difference between that and a human sense maker is tiny and also infinitely infinitely large because at the end because the a human sense maker a human sense maker is distinctive on one on one hand by by virtue of not having access to all of that information and all and and also by the being the being an active awareness which is choosing which which information to notice so much information not to notice in in so so the by the just by virtue of bit of the that idiosyncrasy there's something distinctive about human sense making so that's and and though there are there are just some sense makers who are who are valued because because their work speaks to people and that's not something i think can be that can be reproduced by a machine so that's that's one thing but the number of people the number of people for whom that's the case is is always is going to be pretty limited so once once again we're back to court poets basically yeah and it's also it's also very difficult to make your yeah under under conditions where you can just get a machine to output text jobbing jobbing writing work is you know a lot of it's just doomed right so at the end of the day if you do want to make a living as i said i mean at the end i think writers will become sense makers and if you want if you want to earn a crust as a sense maker chances are you're not going to be you're not going to be doing it directly it's much more likely i think under for a host of other reasons as well that you're going to be effectively a poet again we're back in we've already exited the democratic age and we're back in the era of lords and princes even if we don't call them that yeah yeah and it's increasingly clear to me that survival level as a sense maker for in for for the most part means some kind of court patronage that's just that's just how things work again once again you know as james pulos says digital retrieves the medieval you know so but i think you know in as much as you did a couple more things on the the relation between gpt and human sense makers i also think it's possible at least i'm sort of hopeful that it's possible that we'll see we'll see human sense making thrive to the extent that it's that it can work that like i'll start that from start from another another point of view i think how the way the human sense makers will be able to distinguish themselves from the machine by their grasp of the tacit but what is not said it seems might seem paradoxical to say that we have writers writers will be able to distinguish themselves by what they don't say yeah but but i think but i mean gpt sucks at puns right it sucks at implication it sucks at puns it sucks at illusion because because there's no thinking there it's a pattern recognition machine it's just it's just an autocorrect and so of course it can't do implication of course it can't do illusion of course it can't do dog whispering so there's an entire entire poetics of dog whistling of jokes of puns of references of illusions of hints and implications and we're all of all of which is really to say a literature of the unstated and and particularly you know if politics continues on its current trajectory towards you know ever more sensoriousness and restriction i think those those politics those writers who are political dissidents or political radicals will also just be forced to embrace the poetics of what's of the unspoken anyway yeah so so i mean those there's some not particularly well organized reflections on how how ais ai changes writing or sense making as a craft but i mean those that that's where i've got to up until now i think a lot of writers are doomed i might be one of them i might not i'm working i'm working on plan b just in case yeah but it seems i think that you're but i think your intuition is right and it has to do again with i won't use the word attention in this case but i'd use the word care you know the i the i ai doesn't care doesn't have relevance it doesn't it doesn't have direction right we provide it we provided direction we ask the questions we tell it what to talk about and not only that but we also provide the intelligence for it that is that it's the tr the ais are trained by humans we have told them what's good and what's not and that's how they align their pattern recognition onto our own right you can't ask a machine to say show me a create me an image which is not disgusting and be absolutely certain that it'll succeed in doing so yeah yeah and so the so but i think that lines up with your which was a little surprising to me but still i think you're right that kind of new feudalism you know in some ways that what will be necessary for people as we move now unless very quickly is to have let's say to have little city-states you know intellectual city-states of people that are that are a lot that let's say move in certain direction but also like you said have patronage in some ways that that have we we also need how can i say this you know and i say this because this is you know as you maybe know like i'm involved in this arc thing this this and and i i hesitated a very long time to be involved in that because i'm not a political person not you know i'm fine with politics i'm just not it's not my main thing let's say but i realized something like what you said that in some ways we need to be able to recognize even those that have money that are that say moving in the right directions and to be able to to signify to each other that we're in the same team let's say and that's a weird it's a weird thing to have to do because it does signify a kind of fragmentation of society but in some ways there's no there's there there aren't i don't see any other solution at this point i mean what the what the implications are of what was going through my mind as you were speaking is that some an unknown at this point is how how that maps onto existing exists pre-existing political structures and pre-existing modes of government i guess there's only one way to find out which is yeah get suckered away get up and find out is to do it and see but i mean what yeah some i wrote something else not long ago about how although as much as it grieves to me to think this i think the nation state is toast i think it's over for the very straightforward reason that there's no elite consensus for it it's broadly it's broadly not in the interests of the of the elite to a predominantly knowledge workers and very internationalized both in their culture and also in their economic interests to to to support band read banded nation states where where there are clear delineations between the people here and the people there it's just it's there's no elite consensus in favor of that being the way of doing things and as far and i and i don't see i don't see the masses at present that's having enough leverage to to push things back the other way unless something changes significantly none of them none of this makes me very happy because i'm i'm a i'm a you know i was raised in the age of democracy and i'm a democracy respecter a democracy enjoyer but yeah that's that's what i see happening and and i think it's part it's part and parcel of the same phenomenons you're describing about if you like sense making and meaning making tribes which are coalescing sometimes around singular or or affiliated sources of of finance of patronage really you know in a sense as the as the sort of second order layer of cultural production that relates to whatever this emerging mode of governance is yeah yeah and there is but there's also in this moment there's also possibilities for you know the crowdfunding possibility has also made that very interesting you know because crowdfunding can be a form of resilient patronage if you if you manage it properly you know the the difficulty of the ancient form of patronage is that it was usually single you know like you said you find a prince you find some rich powerful person and then and we need them obviously definitely we need those people as well but there is also the there is also the possibility of of of crowdfunding which which makes that a little more resilient in my at least that's what i've noticed it comes with its own pitfalls i mean audience capture is a thing yeah if you want to talk about agriculturals there's one you're right no the guru problem is a real problem like it's a it's it's a real problem and i think everyone is trying to figure out a way to avoid the pitfalls of that of that issue as we see people kind of fall into it head on and then also become one of the problems with that and you see that on youtubers fall into that all the time is that in some ways they also they also become a slave to their own body right they become a slave to their own aggregor because then they they just want to make sure they feed the body what it wants and if that that can also be low level you know just constant barrage of of you know how can i say this like commenting on tick tock videos which i'm seeing a lot of conservative people doing now it's like that's a bad tip of going on a bad direction where the where the supposed light social commentators make their money commenting on tick tock videos we're like that is definitely an a version of audience capture and this weird this weird yeah desire to please your own your own support group let's say i hadn't thought of that until you mention it but as soon as you you said it i just saw the image in my mind and i thought yeah that's absolutely that's absolutely true i wanna i wanna come back to the to some of the this basic the fairy tale conspiracy stuff i don't know if you thought about this one of the things that i've been thinking about is you know there's also a weird there's also this weird thing that that in the mainstream media which is the use of the conspiracy theory tag as a political attack which is as soon as you point to opposition as soon as you point to organize opposition if you if you notice patterns of of of capture and of opposition in the system then then they just call you a conspiracy theorist and people back off right away you know and so if you talk about the for example like the the lgbtq thing which is obviously organized which is obviously moving which is obviously a politically weaponized towards certain goals then they'll say well you're a conspiracy theorist and it's like and the and in some ways the the silly aspect of the conspiracy theories is is almost advantageous to to that wet to that type of attack because you can always move into q anon into the fringe point to the the insane looking conspiracy and then say well are you like those people like are you like the people who believe in the lizard people as soon as you point to opposition and so it disarms a lot of these i've noticed it disarmed a lot of conservatives especially during covid you could just see it people were so disarmed because you know in quebec where i am especially i mean the conspiracy theorists that the outset said covet is going to be a tool to bring about digital id and and control people through digital id and then we recall conspiracy theorists and when it happened there was no way out of it it didn't matter it didn't matter that it actually happened and that you know we people were standing in front of churches with cell phones you know forcing people to scan their passport to go into the church there was no way out of that that that trap of being called a conspiracy theorist and i not sure how to get out of that trap sometimes paul kingston seems to be doing pretty good at pretty well at it but it's it's very difficult to to be able to talk about opposition and capture without immediately being afraid of that tag one of the things paul does really well which which may contribute to this is he's a good storyteller and when i when i say storyteller i don't mean i mean it's very easy to say oh you know there are there are mysterious forces which are doing any of the other he's you know he talks about the machine and he talks about he talks about the things he do i mean you're familiar with his work and he he manages to do so without imputing it to shadow to a shadowy other and yet making it a very compelling story which obviously speaks to a lot of people and i think that's that's one of the that's one that's one effective tool he also uses self-disclosure in his work which i find which i think is is significant and it's also unusual for a man it's much rarer in my observation to find to find men male writers male thinkers who who are as generous with self-disclosure as paul is i don't i don't know why that is that's that's not something i've given much thought to but but i mean it's that this is just my observation it tends to be a women thing but it's i mean i self self-disclosure can it can often i don't know if disarming is exactly the right word but i think a humanizing effect which makes it it makes it much more much more difficult for people who disagree with you to to dismiss you to unperson you if you've already if you've already drawn people in with your personal story it's it's much more difficult to do to dehumanize you out of hand it just is and this is i just a few these are these are scattered i'm sort of thinking on the hoof here because this is a really interesting question another another instance of somebody who who uses stories very intelligently in some quite political some quite controversial activism it's katie fast who who campaigns for children's rights in the united states and who i mean she deliberately avoids standing on any of the really controversial the rainbow colored landlines where it comes to children's rights she's just not touching that stuff but what her focus absolutely laser-like focus on we need to you know these are what this is what children need and this is how and and this is and these are the things that we need to do in order to meet their needs and just you know to turn the whole argument around and to say you know this this should never be about adult desires they should be about what children need and to that purpose she she has collected and is as an ongoing project she collects stories from people who grew up in situations where for for reasons for whatever you know for a sort of different whether it's divorce or you know being the child of surrogacy or something like that they they they had to make a sacrifice for the sake because of because they're the adults who in in who cared for them needed something other than what they needed and and she collects stories and it's a it's an extraordinary powerful set of stories to read through and yeah and i think you know and she she uses she uses and offers them as a resource to anybody who wants who wants something which isn't just statistics like nobody nobody pays any attention to statistics right you know maybe maybe some policy wonks here and there and you sort of have to you sort of have to show you have some you like you need some data but nobody really listens to data because there's always other data yeah but and and then but again in the the sort of you know neo neo-medieval meme plex of the internet people do listen to stories particularly if they're arresting stories this is this is just they're powerful currency on the internet so yeah i think that that's my sort of scatter shot thought personal disclosure is is a powerful tool storytelling generally if you can if you can draw a narrative together which isn't what which doesn't just fall back on the familiar tropes of you know lizard yeah the sort of lizard man thing and and if you're if and if you can tell a compelling or or you have compelling stories from people yeah you you can do something you can do something quite different than you could if you were just sort of watching to those guys over there so i think i i agree and i think especially with paul i know his work better and i and i see it i i see that one of the ways he's been able to do it is to show the mechanisms of the machine and to show how they just are that say they're just coral areas of of enlightenment modernism that this is just something that plays out you know like a like a story right it's like which you put these things into place and you start the the ball starts to turn then at some point it reaches this point like this is where we are but one of the things that makes it very difficult at this time is that there are some people who do identify their enemy right very clearly and will say like western culture is our enemy basically or however they phrase it you know like the this or that the the group our enemy like the conservatives the right wingers like to be for example to be called a right winger is like everybody shakes like all the conservatives start to shake when they're just being called the right winger and so there's this weird like imbalance where on the one hand the the one side is not only allowed to call on their enemy but does it similar constantly like just non-stop with all the weapons possible and then yeah and then and then and then i need this is my pre like my maybe this is my perception and then it's like i realize that i'm always trying to do the kung fu move like i'm always trying to do the jiu jitsu thing i'm both trying to to to do this thing where i'm not i'm not doing that and i'm wondering you know is it cowardice like is it is it is it being a good christian like i'm not sure sometimes the reasons why i realize that this is necessary to kind of to try to do this type of jiu jitsu i don't know i'm i'm also really thinking at the edge of my thought here when i say these things no i understand it's a fun enough i've been writing about exactly this today it's still still a work in progress so i'm sort of hesitant hesitant to try and set out the whole thesis but my my sort of my working my working hypothesis is that we end up doing so much jiu jitsu not least because we've conceded a great deal more of the frame to to the opponents than to our opponents than we imagine yeah because even conservative have for the most part accepted in principle that normal is the enemy yeah that the the the normativity is bad or the normativity is at the very best at best suspect i mean actually this in in a funny way this this articulates with the the pre-modern modern modern and post-modern story of of how how of the role played by pattern recognition i mean in in a sense if we're if we're talking about if we're talking about means and and meme culture and the meme plex one of the reasons the left can't mean is because they hate normativity they suck at memes because they're always in though although they they never want they're never interested in paying attention to the noise they never want to pay attention to the signal and because that's that's the essence of what progress is that's the essence of what the machine that's that's what the machine runs on the signal rather than noise and mean means a noise you know they are they're they're aggregate they're they're aggregate top wire that emerge out of out of the sort of collective semi-conscious or subconscious yeah the the mean plex the general sloshing the here and there of signification and sort of shared shared recognition of what the world is and they're funny because people recognize them they're funny because and they they travel to the indirect proportion to how how instantly intelligible they are so you know having having said all of that where was i going with this the the oh yes the war on normal and the war on normativity and the politicized war on normativity essentially we have we have to be able to defend the meme we have to be able to speak from the place to the meme does that make sense yeah yeah so by that time and we have to we have to see the entirety of the discourse which even even a great many of us have largely accepted as a as a as a normal phobia as a bigoted hatred of what's of what is in fact normal and observable and and in holy you know self-evidently intelligible to the vast majority of people and and i think i'm coming to think that it's it's time to go on the offensive against nomophobia yeah and and to see it to see it as as a kind of bigoted irrational fear of and and attempt to destroy something which is a a fundamentally fundamentally culturally and socially important and be just impossible to destroy anyway it's futile it's futile and socially destructive to to try and to try and abolish all norms in favor of personal freedom it's just profoundly wrong thing to do whether it's the you it's the revolutionary trope which is which has been there now for a very long time right it's been there since the enlightenment at least you know this vision of revolution as being as being the justification for narrative and and so you know like every movie that i grew up with had that trope every single one always had the underdog story and the underdog story it's not wrong in itself it's fine the underdog story is fine but usually the way it is presented as the ragtag weirdos who basically take power from the established thing and that structure is just basic our basic narrative structure and so it's difficult because conservatives also have that same basic structure and and so that what are they conserving i don't even know like i use the word conserve myself but i use word conservative but i really don't see myself as a conservative because i don't know what the hell they can serve anymore right it's like in some ways this is this is why i prefer reactionary yeah there's a wonderful quote from nicolas gomez davila he says the true reaction is not a seeker after abolished pasts but a hunter of sacred shades on the eternal hills and i'm like yeah sign me up but it's an interesting sacred shades on the eternal hills it's good it's an interesting time to be to be so i don't know you probably probably don't know about this but you know i decided very similar to what you're saying that in some ways there was this strange moment right now and in storytelling where all of a sudden the normal can become bright and precious and and desired and so we're publishing these series of fairy tales right i'm doing a version of snow white and it's snow white i don't know what to tell you it's snow white there's no there's no deconstruction there's no cynicism there's no like weird it's no way it's it's i i hope it's a very insightful version of so white i hope it's a it's a version of snow white that that will actually bring people into understanding the reason and the purpose for these ancient stories but it's snow white and you know what we we started crowdfunding it a week ago and we're like 200 000 in and it's we still have like three weeks ago and people are just like raving and and just and people throwing massive amounts of money at this because i think i think in some ways that's that's where we are you know disney is going to put out a version of snow white next year and i don't know how they can even do it i don't know how they can do it how they can't even have snow white get being woken up by the prince it's not even they're obliged to mess around with it just what are they going to do with that yeah you just know they're going to ruin it because they because they they're contract they're obliged by virtually obliged to destroy it that they have to destroy snow white they have to they have to rape snow white that's all your disney is is obliged to to rape snow white so it can't it can't go any other way because that that's just where they sit up typically in the story but here's the thing i mean you know if i say you know we we've we've left we've left modernity which is to say the print here and we've arrived somewhere new you know post-modernity or digital culture or the cyborgater or whatever you want to call it which has retrieved the memphis from just being commonplace in the disparaging sense and returned it to the common places in in the much more powerful and historic hysteric sense possibly at full you know if if along with that we're getting neo feudalism and we're getting a return of artistic patronage it's it's just possible that we might we might also get a return of normal as something which is no longer disparaged and no longer abject and low status i mean that's been the direction of travel for a great many decades if not centuries you know to to disparaging the normal as something something that at best taken for granted if not actively actively the enemy of all that's good and progressive i i think i think the tide can and will turn i mean maybe i'm over optimistic and i'm usually wildly out on the timelines for all i know this won't happen in my lifetime but but i think i i think i think that i just i think the tide will turn because there just aren't any left but anything else yeah i'm a long-term optimist short-term pessimist that's for sure and long-term optimists because in any case you know just because we've lost a normative language we're talking about human nature doesn't mean our nature has gone away exactly you know it's yeah well that's just what will happen is that that nature will appear suffering for some time you know because you can't we can suffer perversion and distortion of our nature we can suffer it and we will and so that suffering is a call it's always a call and at some point that call i think i think what sits at the root what's it to the at the behind that call and what really or gives it power which i already see giving it power is the fact that the ultimate the the ones the the group that ultimately pays the price of the war on normal is children yeah because the children's children's maturation on organismic needs have not changed just because the desires are lots have changed that's just obviously true you know a baby still needs what a baby needs and a child still needs what a child needs you know of course human cultures are infinitely malleable but there's a baseline right that just hasn't changed and isn't likely to change anytime soon and i mean if you were to genetically engineer a baby not to not to need or not to need its mother's love it just wouldn't be a person i don't know what it would be but it wouldn't be a human being when we get to the point where we're where we're waging war on normal to the extent of asking oh you know commercial surrogacy for example this isn't this is one i come back to again because it's so fundamentally at war with with what and it's such is such a transparent instance of putting placing on a baby's shoulders you know the the sacrifices required to meet adult desire it's it's so clearly what's going on there you're asking a child to sacrifice mother the bond the bond with his with his or her mother you know gestational mother you know in order to in in order to meet the needs of an adult which is which is radically inverts the way the way it ought to be in the caregiving obligations that adults owe to children and but but i think that that essential principle stands actually for most of the wars on normal you know the where where the war on normal it hits hits the buffers hits a immutable limit in human nature yeah the the group that pays the price is always children yeah and i think enough people see that there are great many france you know i'm not going to point at them because i imagine you can you it doesn't take very much reflection to see to see fronts where people are saying no enough you know leave leave the kids alone yeah that's that's happening on a great many fronts at the moment and i probably don't need to point to them i i think that's yeah people see it and people say no enough you know enough we've asked too much of children and it's we need to we need to turn we need to turn things around a bit yeah well i i hope so i hope so the machine is strong right now let's just say and it's getting stronger next year is going to be it's going to be a great year for the for the machine the world seems to work the feet of the world seem to be something like the american election cycle like that seems to be how the how things happen and so we have to be we have to be attentive to next year and see you know how to say how things play out in terms of all these questions they're going to accelerate quite a bit and with ai with these with ais battling each other it's going to be a wild year that's for sure yeah it is right yeah america sneezes and the rest of the world catches a cold you know it remains it remains the global hegemon it's all it's the run of our day you know where where it is in the sort of rome historic cycle is i think more more knowledgeable classicists than me need to argue that one i don't think that that one's that was actually not that hard to notice it's interesting i don't know i think some people think but it's it's still in the republican stage i'm not so sure yeah yeah i think yeah well yeah whatever if it the let's say the emperor is not it's not it's not visible yet you know at least it is in star wars using star wars terms it's the you know palpatine is still in the in the in the corner like he's still kind of hiding out you know we'll see if palpatitude i think one one not not at all impossible hypothesis is that we end up mapping radical egalitarianism onto the need for an american caesar and the only possible solution is to put ai in charge yeah because they're the only the only way to to not set any other any any one person over another is to is to hand off hand off responsibility and accountability to a machine yeah and the willingness of people to do something like that is just so surprising to me and i've noticed it my daughter yesterday got from her from the the quebec government she was asked as a student to to participate in a poll and the and the poor this is from the government itself and the poll was asking students what they thought of having ai counselors for a student with emotional problems yeah because you know no prejudice come on if it's an ai it has no none of the none of the it has no prejudice it has none of the hang-ups not all the all the the hate that humans have you know the the implicit biases it's crazy i mean the the fact that the government that my government is willing to ask a 15 year old that you know send her an email and promise her fifty dollars if she answered me that you could win fifty dollars if she answers that poll is completely insane like it just shows where we are yeah there's a i'm i'm gonna have to go in a minute so we might have to it's up another timer but there's a there's another piece in here that the puzzle the the kind of big the big narrative from pre-modernity to modernity to post-modernity which is about about and and and how that relates to storytelling and fairy tales and and that that's how we conceive ourselves yeah which is which is something which which in tandem with the you know i mean with the the rise of literacy changes and becomes something something much more into i'm sure you've read walter walter on i mean when we're talking about orality and literacy yeah and the the transition from morality to literacy you know comes comes with transition in how people think of what and understand their interiority in a much more general sense and this is you know more and more erudite and intelligent people than me have have drawn links between that and the emergence of the individual as such you know as a feature of the modern era and then the political systems to to meet and to meet and engage with those individuals it stands to reason that that that's changing again in fact i see it changing already and where this relates to the idea of having an ai counselor is because i i sometimes want i wonder what you think of this it's occurred to me on occasions that that the the postmodern understanding of selfhood or if you like the digital age understanding of what a self is is much emptier than the print era one it's much more it's it's a little more it's less like a it's less it's less like a deep pool or a place than it is like a dream catcher it's something through which things flow under which things can be hung it's not it's not a it's not a place in which things are collected so much and and i wonder if from that perspective there might not be a great many 15 year olds who've just internalized from a young age that understanding of selfhood and just don't really have a problem with being being catechized by a robot because they don't think of their inner lives as being that different to a glorified autocorrect yeah what do you think that's a good no i think that's a good insight that's a good insight and i think that all of the all of the like for example like the even the fact that you know we're moving to more and more towards medication as solution to all kind of mental health problems you know like this is the the basic key shows us that the idea of the self as something that you nurture is something that you that you you have to align with virtue all of these types of things it would used to be a normal thing to think about the self are are are are slipping you know and we see as a we see the human as a kind of as a complicated machine that you have to press the right buttons and so it's like if i if the eye can press the right buttons it's like of course then the eye can just press those buttons and then you'll be fixed if we can give you some pills and you give you pills and you're fixed and so there isn't i would say you're right that the i mean the self the idea of the soul obviously in this was the ancient idea of the soul is very yeah it's not as strong now and the the the idea fluid identity is very popular like the notion the only place the only place where we see the soul alive and well of course is in gender identity yeah but it's it's it there's a there's a move towards fragmentation and fluidity is the best way to talk about that like it's so so there's this weird mo rel relationship between pride and fluidity which is a which is almost like a it's almost like a contradiction you could say because usually you're proud in something right i don't know i think there was there was there was one one very famous figure from myth and legend who was both proud and resistant to all boundaries who who springs to mind who is it he's he's kind of he's kind of the bad guy the bad guy in most stories okay yeah that's fine i get it yeah no that's right that's right well that's all yeah that seems to be victoriously notoriously associated with those of those things all right okay we cannot if we we end without saying his name that's probably a good place to end our conversation yeah yeah don't don't don't do that practice attention for mary thinks that it's great first conversation i i really appreciate it it's been such a pleasure i'm sorry it's been i'm sorry it's so short but i have to go i have to go pick up my daughter no worries and so hopefully at some point we can do this in person you know all right great thank you
