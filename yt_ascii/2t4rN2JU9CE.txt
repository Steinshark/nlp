i actually went back to school to a coding boot 
camp and through this course i got to see what   they were building what they were working on learn 
a lot of things along the way as well you heard   that right i went back to school but the reality 
is only for a day but why did i actually do this   i did this because a lot of you always ask me what 
coding boot camp to recommend what learning path   you should take when you are starting out in your 
coding journey and rather than just suggesting   ideas to your schools to you i wanted to ensure 
that i actually had the experience that i was   suggesting and that is why i went back to school 
at coding dojo oh the first one being courses what   kind of courses do they have to offer and also to 
do they have flexible courses as we get older and   life continues to go faster and faster between 
kids marriage what else do we have in life   just more responsibilities bills can we talk about 
bills we can't necessarily drop everything quit   our job in order to study or go to a coding boot 
camp so i wanted to ensure that whatever coding   boot camp i personally would go to or had the 
opportunity to check out had flexible options and   that's one of the things i discovered with coding 
dojo i'll pull up on screen here you can see they   have a wide range of courses from online full-time 
part-time accelerated and part-time flex all   which are really great options depending on your 
situation and this is under software development   they also have data science which is part-time 
it's a full new stack so they're always keeping   up to date with what technologies are trending in 
demand based on what companies are hiring for and   the other one which if i was probably to go 
back and do it all over again after i did a   a software development bootcamp what i would 
do is a cyber security course i think it's so   fascinating the stats around it how quickly it is 
growing in demand and how many roles need to be   filled for it is just mind-boggling and they offer 
the cyber security course so it's online part-time   but for this let's focus in on i'm going to go 
into the online full-time course the full-time   online course is 16 weeks or around 16 weeks 
and so what does that look like it means monday   to friday you are basically going into you can 
treat it as a job meaning you are going signing in   online it's done from the comfort of your home or 
wherever you want to study and you are taking this   course so it's your full-time responsibility and 
during the time with this course you start with   the basics so this is something that whether you 
have been tinkering or building around or maybe   you have very little experience or feeling kind 
of like do i need to already be a developer to   take this course or can i like what what level 
of experience you can go in with very little   experience i think that's less important what is 
most important is the willingness to learn you   want to learn you want to grow and you're ready 
for the challenge because there will be a lot   of challenges that come your way and they start 
with html css javascript and also to vs code and   these are things that even with vs code when i was 
attending some of the courses and reviewing some   of their past courses you literally get walked 
through how to even install these tools now if   you are someone who has experience with coding 
and you're like i already know that that's fine   it's literally two weeks of your time and then 
from there you continue to build on but i think   regardless of whatever level you are coming in 
with starting from that foundation a proper way   understanding really what you are doing from the 
very foundation is so key then they go into web   fundamentals get into the first stack they teach 
three different stacks which i think is something   that when i started collaborating with coding dojo 
many years ago it really stood out to me because   i've never seen another school that puts that much 
effort into working with more than one stack and   these three stacks you will learn the first one 
is python it's so in demand right now not only   for software development but for data science data 
analyst like like it's continuing to grow so this   is really exciting to me and it's something that 
i wish i learned at my coding boot camp is python   then of course the classic javascript full stack 
this is something that i feel like is continuously   in demand it's on a lot of job posting still and 
it's a great place to start then i really like how   for their third option they have two different 
options you can choose from so you can actually   choose from if you want to learn full stack java 
or if you want to learn full stack c sharp and dot   net so it's kind of cool because you can choose 
your own path and actually if you scroll down on   their website you can see what projects you will 
build so in this case what you will build in java   mini event planning app custom projects music 
playlist app and that's another thing too i feel   like when i went to my coding bootcamp it was like 
let's build a to-do list here's a basic you know   to-do list which is classic you have to build that 
at some point in your your journey but i love how   they also get really creative with the project so 
when you are interviewing with employers it's not   what everyone else has seen you're standing out 
because you're building projects that are pretty   unique next up on the list is pricing we need 
to cover pricing it's one of those things when   you are going to a coding boot camp you are not 
only investing a lot of your time but with that   comes money and as we continue to take on more 
responsibilities as we get older it includes bills   and it brings back to the question one of the 
biggest i think hurdles or things that we need to   overcome when thinking about a coding boot camp is 
isn't worth the price tag that comes with it and   one of the things that for me when i was looking 
into okay if i was to go to a coding boot camp   again invest all my time invest a lot of money how 
would i want it structured and for me one of the   main things when it came to pricing i wanted to 
see in a coding bootcamp was options i didn't want   to see a coding bootcamp that is like pay all up 
front or nothing that just doesn't sit well with   me i want a coding boot camp that is flexible 
has different payment options pricing plans and   also too if i want to speak to a human about these 
things i can it's not necessarily just a chatbot   or a robot i can speak to a human okay so let's go 
on screen and see what coding dojo has to offer go   into admissions and let's go to financing 101 and 
one of the things honestly that stood out for me   right away with them with their financing options 
is they're upfront they don't have a oh send us an   email to know any of our options or or just this 
like one little box you have to put your email to   get information it's like no here is what we have 
we have three popular funding methods installment   plans ascent ascent financing i should know 
that word climb credit different options and then   also too you can discuss your funding options you 
can schedule a one-on-one call with a human maybe   it's the millennial in me because i'm getting old 
and start kane i feel like my editor is tired of   me saying that because in every video i'm like 
insert cane or insert gray hair but it's true   talking to a human nowadays is very difficult 
especially when you are looking to go into a   school or any kind of thing online so the fact 
that you can schedule in a one-on-one call with   an admissions person is really awesome to me and 
then two not only that but if you scroll down they   really do a nice guide as to when you should start 
thinking about your funding so speak to admissions   apply to the program secure your funding and then 
start your coding boot camp so i really like how   they take it very seriously and also to walk 
you through the process that it's not just this   one box fits all no they they work with you and 
figure out what is the best option for you let's   talk about something that is probably the most 
terrifying part of of going to a coding boot camp   what is it you ask what do you think it would 
be leave in the comments or i'm wondering what   you think it would be no it's not learning how to 
code it's not going into this new environment for   me anyways what it was in the job hunting process 
finding your first job after investing financially   in this investing your time your emotions into 
this it is nerve-wracking i'm not going to lie   and it's one of those things that it very much 
is true when people say finding your first job   is always the hardest when getting into the tech 
industry after that recruiters are really truly   hitting you up all the time and it becomes a 
different issue of you know getting people out   of your inbox as much but that first job is really 
key and it's very difficult at sometimes to land   if you're doing it by yourself not difficult 
per se in the sense of you don't have the right   qualifications or you're not skilled enough but 
difficult emotionally the emotional toll it can   take on you or i'm just saying from my experience 
anyways when you are job hunting if you're doing   it alone and that's what i did it's it sucks and 
that's one thing i said to myself from day one   i was to do this all over again the number one 
thing i would look for is a school that offers   support after you graduate that doesn't just say 
okay here's your piece of paper certificate you   graduated goodbye but rather this is one part we 
just finished now we're on to the second chapter   together and we're going to do this together and 
that's one thing with coding dojo they actually   have lifetime access to their career services 
so not just for your first job you can use   it for your second job and this is something 
that really stood out to me as well if we go   onto their website here you can see there's no 
expiration date starting from day one you have   unlimited support and you also have one-on-one 
career service manager coaching career service   manager coaching and you can really get to know 
this manager connect with them and work with your   coach on what jobs are best for you you have to 
keep in mind that they want you to find a job not   just a job but the best job for you the highest 
paying salary job for you as much as you want to   find that maybe even more because this is their 
reputation you went to their school they want to   ensure that they can can be like hey look where 
our graduates are working look what kind of jobs   we can lend and that's one thing that they really 
invest in with their resources is ensuring you   land those proper jobs let's talk about something 
though here as we wrap up which is should you even   bother to learn how to code anymore and i wanted 
to include this in this coding bootcamp video   because let's be honest we've heard so much 
about chat gbt coming out and what does this   mean for programmers but i always bring it back 
to what does this mean for anyone chachi pt we   always think about it a lot more than i would say 
the average person because we are in tech we are   inherent to knowing what is coming out and what 
does this mean for our field but this is an area   or that this is a tool i should say that it will 
affect all areas and what i like to sum it up as   yes chat gpt might be able to build the basics of 
programming meaning when you're first starting out   and you're learning cms html javascript these 
basic fundamentals that their basic their core   basic level yes chatgpt can probably do it too 
to some degree but does that mean you shouldn't   learn anymore absolutely not the reality is you 
need to still start with that base getting that   strong foundation in order to continue to grow 
understand system design understand how the code   works you need to start with the basics and then 
from there you will overcome the knowledge that   chad gpt has and rather use it as a tool that 
can help you build and learn faster so don't   let all this news of ai or chat gpt coming out 
scare you into thinking well maybe i shouldn't   even bother becoming a programmer anymore maybe 
it's not worth it i would say it's the flip side   there is going to be so much more opportunities 
in the tech field with ai continuing to emerge   people who are experts in this field people who 
are passionate about technology and that can be   you all right i feel like that covers all of 
my checklists and even a bit more honestly if   you are someone who is looking to go to a coding 
boot camp i kind of am jealous of you i had the   best time going to a coding boot camp i i really 
built an amazing community through going to one   i still keep in touch with some people i went to 
school with today there's so much opportunities   when you're starting out it's like the world is 
your oyster it's like you're starting out with   the basics and then from there you can specialize 
there are so many areas you can focus in on and   having that right support and community that 
coding dojo offers is i mean in my opinion   priceless it's something that i'm not trying to 
be dramatic and i know this sounds so dramatic   and i've said this before but for me going to 
a coding boot camp a good quality coding boot   camp i should add not just any coding boot camp 
like coding dojo it changed my life it changed my   income it changed my freedom my flexibility what 
i was able to do on a day to day what is able to   build i could start thinking and building my own 
business working for different companies i don't   know it's just it really when i look back going 
from modeling and fashion and if it wasn't for   coding boot camps i'd probably be working in say 
fashion or marketing which is a great industry but   because of a coding boot camp and i took that risk 
it really opened up the doors for me to explore so   many other avenues in a relatively quick amount 
of time mine was i think around three months and   i know coding dojo's full time is 16. 16 weeks 
which is yeah four months which i wish mine was   a little bit longer like that so i link coding 
dojo down below go check them out if you are a   coding dojo grad leave in the comments where you 
are working now your experience i know i have some   grads that follow me as well and yeah i'm just 
super excited about this i'm always very cautious   about what i share with you and that's why i've 
continued for years to share about coding dojo is   because i truly believe in them i love how they 
let me come to their classes which is crazy it's   so fun to do and okay you get the point i love 
you all and i'll see you all soon thank you bye [music]   foreign
