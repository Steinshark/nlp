hello everyone and welcome i am here with the straight pipes and we're going to be answering the question can you recharge a tesla by towing it so jacob where are we and what are we doing we are at toronto motorsports park i have brought my highest mileage ford raptor so i'm excited to see what happens and if my raptor breaks down or if we can actually tow this thing right on and then the second question we're going to answer because i'm curious about this is if it's more efficient to drive a raptor from point a to point b or use that raptor to charge a tesla and then take the tesla to wherever you're going which one will be more efficient so what do you think is going to happen there i think that's going to be efficient at all i'm excited to find out yeah i think there is like a slight possibility that it could work even though it sounds like there's like a loss of energy that's going to occur i've done a little math beforehand and we'll see what's going to happen all right so we are going to be targeting about 30 kilometers per hour so let's see if we can get the slack out first just kind of slowly inch up okay we're good and we can go okay so we are towing this along and it is showing the regen working so we've got the recovery strap hooked up between his truck and my toe eye by the way that toei is a pretty cheap little piece of plastic that just kind of pops and breaks off when you open it up regardless this does seem to be working and what's really cool here i'm showing we're traveling at about 30 kilometers per hour and i'm showing negative watt hours per kilometer so we are regenerating quite a bit of energy actually we just started this at 62 percent and we're going to try and keep this around 30 kilometers per hour now i know many of you will say hey you should have some form of damper on that recovery strap in case it were to break but we like to you know live dangerously and just see what will happen so if it does break no big deal the thing is i know that the rating for this recovery strap is well beyond what we're actually doing here so i'm not worried about it so continuing along here we've got negative one kilowatt hour and we have negative 1 000 watt hours per kilometer so we're able to regenerate one kilowatt hour traveling just one kilometer this is super cool okay going around some sharper bends here just making sure everything works as is we're now at 63 battery so we've got one percent so far going around on this track i can't believe it's staying at one kilowatt per kilometer that's pretty good amount of energy that we're putting back into this okay so we're now going to come to a stop right where we started so we're just going to have one laps worth of energy okay i am coming to a stop okay so we've traveled 1.4 kilometers we've gotten 2 percent battery and now we're gonna see this gauge right here and wait until it gets down to zero meaning we've completely evened out the amount of energy we've put into it versus how much we're going to use so we're gonna go around this track as many times as we can on the energy that we just generated how far do you guys think we're gonna get half a lap i have a lap i think we might get our lap back okay so we're not driving the most effective okay so by the way i don't even want to tell you what my edge i got in the raptor there so we have gotten across the first straight and we still have energy remaining that's good news this is positive and you are flying all right so i still have energy left so you beat yuri's estimate ooh a little understeer there oh this might be the whole lap back wow that's wild i think we're gonna do it oh yes we are heck yes passing the truck yes raptor go raptor oh there we go and there we are we're in the positives again so it was able to do a full lap based on the energy from being towed around with one lap and at a decent pace which is quite cool does that make sense scientifically i think it does make sense because what's happening is this thing when you're pulling it it's basically breaking really hard so you're pulling something that's taking the kinetic energy of what speed it's at constantly which is this weird little thing because visibly it looks like nothing's really happening but really i'm drinking your milkshake i'm i'm taking your fuel and i'm sticking it in my battery it's quite cool so the strap is your lifeline yes yes exactly okay so what we're doing now now that we understand that you can tow it is we're going to get a baseline efficiency for both vehicles and so we're going to go around this track four times to see what our efficiency is and so we're going to get the efficiency of both cars so four times around we're gonna switch who's leading so that we kind of account for aerodynamic differences and we're going to be going around together so that we make sure that we're around the same speed as we do this and so then once we have those baseline efficiencies for each vehicle we're going to find the efficiency of the raptor while it's towing the tesla and then we're going to do a comparison to see if you use one gallon of fuel or 3.8 liters of fuel how far can each one of these scenarios go the raptor alone the tesla alone and then the raptor towing the tesla and then using what energy went into the tesla to then drive but this is to kind of simulate real world driving we're not trying to get you know a fast lap time around here we're just trying to see what's the actual efficiency of these two vehicles in the exact same scenario driving in the 40 to 100 kilometer per hour range but with of course a bunch of turns okay so we're going to come to a dead stop on the starting line i'm going to go wide copy okay so my efficiency was 193 watt hours per kilometer what was yours 22 liters per 100 kilometers right on okay so now we have the efficiency of both vehicles we have the efficiency of the raptor independently and we have the efficiency of the tesla it just so happens going around this track around the same speeds this tesla is about 10 times as efficient as that raptor so now the efficiency number we need to figure out is how much fuel does that thing use while it's towing this tesla and then from that amount of fuel how much of it do i actually stick into my battery so that's what we are figuring out right now so we're just going to go around this track at about 30 kilometers per hour and see how much i actually regenerate and then what his fuel economy is okay so stop with like the front of yours like just past those cones i think okay so we've done two laps around the track and my charging efficiency here was negative 1026 watt hours per kilometer so over one kilowatt per kilometer traveled we traveled 2.8 kilometers so now we're gonna figure out what efficiency jacob got okay what was your fuel economy are you ready for this i don't know if you're ready i am ready 69 liters for 100 kilometers 69 that's a pretty high number i mean i'm not sure what the exact conversion is but somewhere between like three and four miles per gallon so just a little bit worse than if i wasn't towing you that's hilarious awesome okay so we're going to get our final results here and so what we have here and i'm going to put the metric conversions all on the screen so you don't have to think too hard taking one gallon of fuel we're trying to figure out is it more efficient to just take your raptor or to tow a tesla and then take the tesla so we're starting with one gallon of fuel and based on our testing today this tesla on that one gallon equivalency of energy this is a pretty good eight right there can go 108.5 wow look at that writing 108.5 miles on just one gallon of fuel versus the raptor which was 10.7 so literally 10 times as far using the tesla okay so here's the big moment of truth how far towing the tesla and then taking that tesla and driving with it so the math works out multiply that divide by that what do we end up getting'.1 miles off one gallon put into the raptor converted to energy into the tesla and then driving so it's more efficient to tow the raptor with the tesla than it is to drive the raptor by itself yes we're going to say we're going to save the world you're welcome we are saving the environment here so the message we've all learned is if you have a ford raptor also buy a tesla tow the tesla behind it and then you're going to save the planet that's that's the way yeah i'm down with that it's not bad it's not bad yes this is science hold on a second some of you may be thinking that the conclusions of this video break the laws of thermodynamics surely converting energy just once in the truck is more efficient than converting the energy three times first in the truck then into the battery and finally from the battery to the wheels of the tesla but here's why the laws of physics remain intact the model 3 weighs about 2 000 pounds less than the raptor and it's far more aerodynamic when you drive the raptor with a full gallon of gas you're moving the entire truck's weight and all of the aerodynamic drag associated with it at a very low efficiency if you convert it to electrical energy in the tesla you're able to travel further with that same gallon of fuel because you're moving less mass with less aerodynamic drag at an exceptional efficiency even though you obviously did lose some energy by charging it it's also worth noting that the'.1 miles the tesla travels from a gallon of charging does not include the 3.4 miles the truck traveled so on one gallon of gas you can actually drive 21.5 miles with both the truck and tesla combined double the range of the raptor alone absolutely fascinating and one more cool conclusion from this based on our 310 watt hours per mile usage rate that's the fuel economy of the tesla if you pull the car around for one lap with the raptor you can then drive at a leisurely pace for 5.6 laps wow with one left one left around you get 5.6 not a bad deal yeah i'd say it's a pretty good trade-off you're really good at math yeah that's amazing so this was awesome thank you jacob for suggesting this idea it worked out really well a big thank you to toronto motorsports park for letting us film out here it's been awesome hanging out with you guys and really appreciate it this has come out really fascinating and the good news is we genuinely have helped the environment we have yeah with raptors yes we're adapters yeah fort raptors tesla's electric cars this is it and racetracks that's right thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below and also you should head over to their channel i'll include a little end box card somewhere i'll cover up one of your faces we don't need both and you should go over to their channel and watch their review of this tesla model 3 a good time and i got to go around cliche corner which was a lot of fun so yeah go check that out see you later [laughter]
