sun microsystems exploded onto the silicon valley scene with an incredible business model and astounding growth sun eventually became one of the valley's most important and iconic companies worth some 140 billion dollars at its peak but over time that brilliant sun burnt itself into a husk the company's decline was long and painful in this video we take a look at the dawn and dusk of one of silicon valley's computing pioneers sun microsystems in 1978 a stanford student from germany named andreas andy bechtelsheim becomes a no fee consultant for the xerox park research laboratory there he sees the most amazing thing a bunch of alto computers networked together at the time chip designs were starting to be done on computer but designers did not have individual computers powerful enough to run those softwares andy comes to the belief that what park had powerful personal computers like the alto would work far better and since xerox had no interest in commercializing park's work he can build his own version at stanford so in 1981 he joins this project to build low-cost personal workstations for computer-aided design or cad work the hardware was based on the motorola 68000 chip the first commercially available 32-bit microprocessor the project and that first workstation computer was named sun which stands for the stanford university network notably the sun 1 workstation computer had a bitmap display like the alto and an ethernet connection for networking a few years later it would run an older version of unix unix system 3. by 1981 andy and the team were making a good number of these computers printing custom circuit boards in margaret jack's hall unfortunately stanford ended the project when it started to gather some real commercial traction andy's first action after this was to license out the sun hardware design he found a few customers charging them ten thousand dollars each however these licensees did not want to build the powerful and personal workstation that andy really wanted to do if you want something done right well then you have to go do it yourself but first you need to put together a crew a secretary connected bechtelsheim with another fellow stanford alum a recent nba grad and serial entrepreneur named vinod khosla kosla had once worked at a company called daisy systems a pioneer in the electronic design automation or eda market the company eventually failed and one of the reasons why had been the lack of sufficient hardware coastla grasp that these workstations could meet that need he and bechtelsheim wrote out a six-page business plan laying out the strategy of building and selling sun workstations at a price range between twenty five thousand and one hundred thousand dollars each that is about seventy five thousand to three hundred thousand and two thousand twenty two dollars son recruited two more co-founders kosla had a very good friend named scott mcneely a harvard grad with whom he had previously worked on a failed startup called data dump six months later bill joy then a grad student at uc berkeley joined as a full co-founder working on software product design joy was then known for working on the berkeley software distribution of the unix operating system mcneely reached out to two venture capitalists uc ventures in west coast ventures he showed them the workstation and quickly got some funding later on kleiner perkins and august capital joined in as well sun microsystems opened its doors in february 1982. coastla served as ceo mcneely was vp of manufacturing bechtelsheim in hardware product design with joy joining him later on the software side the workstation is a bit of an interesting product category back then is someone needed computing power like for cad work they had to reserve time on a larger more powerful computer the mini computer they communicated with these mini computers through something like a vt50 computer terminal this somewhat ironically named mini computers called mini because it was smaller cheaper and less powerful than a mainframe computer from ibm but it still cost over twenty five thousand dollars at the time or about 190 000 today what son first envisioned and sold back in those days was more like a high-end desktop computer more like a mac studio or a mac pro perhaps the workstation has more power than your average low-grade consumer computer enough power to run these complicated cad softwares however it was also affordable enough for the average prosumer to own on their own sun microsystems had orders before the company even started people and universities and research institutions had heard of the sun project at stanford and put in pre-orders interest really searched when they heard that bill joy joined and that the workstation would eventually run the berkeley unix operating system the team worked tirelessly to design and ship their new workstations their first workstation had only 256 kilobytes of memory and sold for about eight to ten thousand dollars at fifty percent gross margin the sun too with better specs and berkeley unix installed followed later that year there were other workstation makers at the time sun's main competitor was apollo computer apollo had started a year before sun and was their main competitor the eda and cad companies also made their own hardware sun's advantage was that they leveraged open and available resources their first workstations were made from off-the-shelf parts standard power supplies motorola microprocessors and fujitsu disk drives for software an off-the-shelf operating system berkeley unix this later turned into sun os a unix os which after that became solaris for networking they used tcpip which had been recently declared the standard for all military computer networking networking in particular had been important as it allowed users to collaborate from their own spaces through its open business model sun produced really good widely adopted technology the vision of selling standardized widely compatible computers caught fire one workstation for each user people loved it sun opened its doors in february 1982. they became profitable by may ultimately generating 8.5 million dollars in his first fiscal year the fiscal year after that sun grew to 39 million the year after that 115 million managing all that growth however proved to be a bigger challenge it was a bunch of 27 year olds running the place and there were growing pains the board wanted son to recruit some more experience so they recruited the 42 year old owen brown but brown clashed with coleslaw and quickly left scott mcneely took over as interim ceo despite being so young he ran the company well and eventually the board decided to have him remain as the company's leader coastla left sun the next year in 1985 joining john dorr at kleiner perkins there he would make incredible investments like juniper networks which returned 2 500 times its investment today he runs his own firm coastal adventures every six months from 1982 to 1987 sun doubled the number of workstations it shipped in 1985 they launched their sun 3 workstation series featuring an upgraded motorola processor the motorola mc68020 sound 3 introduced a brand new distributed file system standard network file system or nfs sun license the nfs code to others for a nominal fee turning nfs into a widely adopted standard the sun 3 was an immediate success accounting for a third of total sales in the quarter after its release in september 1985. son had to open a new factory in nearby milpitas to handle all the new orders by 1987 sun had eclipsed its once biggest competitor apollo computer creator of the personal workstation market apollo did have better hardware but customers chose sons cheaper computers the sun 3 was 15 cheaper than anything apollo had apollo would eventually be acquired by hewlett-packard in april 1989 and soon thereafter shut down in march 1986 son ipo with 210 million dollars in revenue they raised 45 million dollars the biggest tech ipo in three years in their first annual report it says our rejection of proprietary systems in order to concentrate on our model of distributed computing technology standards and high quality is itself an innovation and in a very real sense this is sun's proprietary product from 1986 to 1988 sun's revenues quintupled from 210 million dollars to 1.1 billion the company was moving fast on all cylinders but soon developed the problem over time it soon became clear that one of the company's critical partners was not keeping up and that was motorola the company that provided son's microprocessors they had just one design team and could not keep up with sun's demands one memory bug took them two years to fix it took them just as long to go from 10 megahertz to 12. son tested an intel compatible workstation which did not go very well after which bill joy came up with the idea of designing their own microprocessor using a thing that ibm recently wrote about called a risk architecture the key point about risk is that each instruction performs just one function ibm claims in their writings that this could potentially speed things four times over so in 1987 the team led by anant agra finalized the spark cpu fapped by fujitsu it was indeed much faster than what others can offer and eventually it would be used in sun's next big workstations the sun 4 or spark station series released in 1989. sun makes the majority of their money selling systems they leveraged open off-the-shelf parts to create cheap high-powered workstations for specific technical applications and government corporate or wall street but what did open mean encouraged by their success with nfs in 1987's son partnered with 20 investor at t to collaborate on unix over the years the unix tree had gotten complicated and sun wanted to unify this gnarled tree sun envisioned a new unified unix has the pathway out of workstations into the broader consumer market however ibm hewlett-packard and other unix licensees rebelled fearing what sun and att might do with unix they created the open software foundation or osf osf mcneely calls them the opposed son forever foundation started signing up vendors and developers under the banner of being truly open with no single company in charge sun and at t formed their own competing organization unix international and signed up companies like toshiba and motorola and others the unix wars that it was called had long lasting effects on both sun and its competitors it crippled sun's microprocessor strategy son would try to license its risk-based smart chip designs to other companies but insisted on retaining control over the ip preventing any fork killed any chance of spark's widespread adoption a few years later in the united kingdom another company selling wrist designs advanced risk machines limited or arm would be founded when it comes to software the war stalled technical progress on unix itself and divided its community neither side really produced a competitive commercial product though the sun in att collaboration would eventually produce the solaris operating system anyway the wars opened the door for a new competitor microsoft in 1993 microsoft released windows nt 3.1 an operating system produced for workstations and server computers nt took parts from unix ibm and others to create this single business oriented operating system that was 32-bit and had networking and file sharing for multi-user collaboration it was the right product at the right time unix was distracted and some parts of it sat in dubious legal territory linux an open source unix-like operating system with a big role to play down the line was not yet desktop ready apple and the mac was post jobs and had no idea what they were doing to a lot of businesses microsoft was the only game in town sun's competitors like ibm and hp rapidly started adopting windows nt for their own workstations sun for their part felt that unix was a far better product and refused to adopt windows however it soon became clear that windows nt and windows 95 after it combined with intel's rapid improvements in cpu performance were eating into sun's original workstation market so throughout the 1990s sun switched to a more vertically integrated business strategy selling complete systems centered on spark for the hardware and solaris for the software as microsoft and intel increasingly encroach on the high-end workstation market sun moved upwards into the enterprise server market in 1996 sun acquired create business systems some of the famous supercomputer maker cray had adopted the spark and solaris technologies to enter the commercial business market that had failed to make a splash sun snapped up the division for 15 million dollars as it turned out signs of vertically integrated stack from networking to processor to operating system was perfect for the server market solaris is known for his symmetric multi-processing capabilities which means you can add a large number of spark processors to the system for easy scaling without much latency windows and intel on the other hand can handle just four to eight so intel might make a far faster individual processor than sun can but sun servers can still perform better on a system basis because you can add in up to 100 processors has the internet started to become a thing in the 1990s this web connected server market grew to become even larger than sun's old workstation business being in the internet server business however turned out to be a double-edged sword for sun ebay yahoo dell bloomberg merrill lynch and even microsoft adopted sun enterprise servers for their web operations the company grew revenues 50 to 60 percent each year things are good then the internet bubble popped and sliced that multi-billion dollar business by nearly half thousands of sun systems units were being resold on the secondary market at fire sale prices management struggled through several unprofitable years they made 1.85 billion and 927 million dollars profit in 2000 and 2001 then lost 587 million in 2002 and then 3.4 billion in 2003. good times r d costs remained persistently high due to sun's need to support technology ecosystems like spark solaris and java their popular programming language java alone required 4 000 developers a year then came open source for a long time sun used the open verbiage compared to its entirely preparatory competitors in the 1970s yeah sure sun was open but it was not truly open in the way we might think about it now for instance until 2005 you cannot download and look at the solaris source code you needed to sign a contract and even then they would not let you see all of the source code and we already talked about some of the issues they had with spark frustration with these practices would give rise to the grassroots open source movement personified by linux for a long time throughout the 1990s linux was a hobbyist's toy then suddenly people realized i had gotten good enough to be used in real business critical production environments businesses and organizations found that they can scale up by creating clusters of linux servers all of them the same with commodity hardware widespread linux adoption annihilated sun's enterprise server business and with that the company had no more tricks up their sleeve throughout the 2000s the company attempted to get back to their open routes by open sourcing their technology they acquired various technologies like the database mysql and data storage company storage tech paying too much for something that made nothing but with the global financial crisis roiling the industry investors got tired of the endless losses and a good offer came along in 2009 oracle bought sun for 7.4 billion dollars from 2000 to then sun had lost over 10 billion dollars of revenue and over 90 percent of its stock value the company has since been digested and his products rebranded sun was a brash company they were known for sharp elbows and not playing very nicely with their competitors and when they were the uber of the 1980s and 1990s growing 30 40 50 a year that was fine but this attitude eventually got to them has technology trends changed around them sun refused to change sign on or collaborate and in the end they became this lonely outpost of technology far from the leading edge it would be interesting to contrast this attitude with microsoft before and after satya nadella became its ceo and nadella had in fact worked for sun before joining microsoft in 1992. i wonder if watching what happened that sun helped shape his attitudes in microsoft's subsequent turnaround all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the channel sign up for the newsletter and i'll see you guys next time
