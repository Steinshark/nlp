hello everyone and welcome we are looking at a 3d printed inline four-cylinder engine now inline four-cylinder engines are really common in economy cars for their advantages in size and cost and smoothness and efficiency now this particular engine we're looking at here is a 22 re out of an older generation toyota tacoma or 4runner looking at our different components we've got our fan right here which as you can see is belt driven it's just got a rubber band making that rotate we've got the intake manifold right here which actually has a functional throttle you can see that that opens and closes in there pretty neat intake manifold there you've got the valve cover here up on top so you can see the gear driven cams right here so a single overhead camshaft which will be rotating to open the individual valves if you're paying attention super closely you'll notice that the cam timing is actually a bit off but you can definitely get an idea of how this valve train works using the single overhead cam and these rocker arms to open the individual valves on each side checking out the other side of the engine you can see the exhaust manifold so you've got the four different pipes leading into a single collector we can remove this and then looking inside we can see the individual exhaust valves opening and closing there's one exhaust valve and one intake valve for each of these cylinders now you can remove this cylinder head and then we can see the pistons underneath and you can see quite obviously why they call this an inline four cylinder four cylinders all in a row now you've got cylinders one two three and four and you're going to be firing for every'0 degrees of crankshaft rotation and that's going to start with one three four two so you've got power power power power power power power kaboom again the technical term one of the interesting things about inline four cylinders is why the pairs of cylinders move in the way that they do with the inner two pistons moving up and down together as well as the outer two pistons moving up and down opposite the inner cylinders now part of the reason this is done is for an even firing interval you want to fire every'0 degrees so you need at least one cylinder at top dead center for every'0 degrees of crankshaft rotation but this flat plane crankshaft design is chosen to keep the engine balanced and minimize vibration you can see that for first order forces the pistons moving up and down opposite one another balance each other out that said for secondary forces the forces do not balance out as they both point upward at top dead center and bottom dead center this tends to limit the size of inline four-cylinder engines because as they get larger and rev higher they tend to vibrate more this can be countered using balancing shafts but that means a more complex engine design now if you're a bit confused on the differences between primary forces and secondary forces as well as balance shafts i will include relevant links in the video description now the cam timing is obviously a little bit off but pretty cool to see you know you've got your pistons going up and down you've got your single overhead cam rotating and that's opening the individual intake and exhaust valves now some of the advantages of this style of setup you know it is pretty common in economy cars and you know part of that is because of how compact this is it's generally pretty simple to work on because you've got a single cylinder head rather than a v or other styles of engines that split the cylinder banks up now you do have a higher center of gravity as a result of this style of engine just because you've got your cylinders stacked in a line but they're vertical rather than horizontal or in a v and you also do have a secondary imbalance with these inline four-cylinder engines as a result of the secondary forces of those pistons moving up and down now a huge thank you to eric carroll for lending me this 3d printed engine you can find a link to it in the video description if you guys have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below thanks for watching you
