- hello, my friends and
welcome to mystery tech. this, well, i mean, i feel like i'm in the
thumbnail right now. this is from norway. wait, wait, did someone just send us this? - [ken] that was a po box item. - po box, you're not even d-- you're not even doing work right now. well at least it's got a
lot of bubble wrap in it. - [ken] also this has been
sitting around for four months. - it's been sitting here for four months? - [ken] so if it's food, don't eat it. oh, what is that? - it's popcorn (laughs). - [ken] oh, never mind, whoops. wait, really? no, no. really, oh no, oh no,
oh that's gross, oh no. - oh there's something
else wrapped right here. - [ken] maybe i shouldn't
have had that out for four months. - i like that you're
saying that as a joke, but it actually was food. more things? oh, there's more food too. we've got vapesa, vapsebol drops. milkenshul. you guys have too many letters, man. just chill with the letters. we also have more popcorn. so if we wanna make some more popcorn. as if we don't have enough already. and another package to be unwrapped. just keep going here. oh, it's fi-- - [ken] what's that look? - just put your phone in
it and you watch videos. wow, okay, that's, whoa. oh, so it's like room
for your phone and stuff? do i look ridiculous right now? - [ken] little bit. - all right. that looks okay, right? wait, now i've got it backwards. - [michael from vsauce] no time keeping devices. no phones, no books, nothing to write on. - i will say this is actually
better than i thought. so the way that this works
is actually pretty clever. the lenses are nice
and, when you put it on, it actually does feel like you're looking at your phone full sized,
especially if you have a phone with a fairly high resolution, like the iphone or the oneplus. it actually does look pretty decent. how much is this thing? - [ken] $89. - $89 on indiegogo? mm-mm, nope. - [ken] and that was the early pricing. - this is interesting. this is not $89 interesting. it's a cool idea. but 89 bucks? mm-mm, mm-mm. let's move on, shall we? - [ken] yes. - okay. anime music wireless. you sick, sick, son of a (beep). what makes these anime? i don't understand. it's designed by shirow masamune. how long have you been sitting on this? - [ken] a year. - a year?? ken, is this the recycle mystery tech? why are these, i just don't
get why these are anime. they're white, is that
like an anime color? i don't, i don't get it. - [ken] i think japanese
corporate was like, "yeah, people will buy it
if it has anime on it." - i mean, you bought it so it worked. powered by aptx. okay, so aptx works. about to go into the anime vortex. i really hope josh is nice and
gave me some cool graphics, when i say things like that. (bell chimes) - [ken] let's do this one. (cheerful music) well? - all i can think about is you with glow sticks at some anime rave and doing some crowd dance or something as everyone cries about
how amazing the music is, that's all i can think about right now. - [ken] wow, that was
actually pretty accurate. (hysterical laughter) you actually described that pretty well. - i've known you for too long, my friend. these headphones don't sound good, but ken sounds amazing. (breathy laughter) yeah, no, these are trash. - [ken] have you ever
watched drake and josh? - drake and josh? a couple episodes. i wasn't, i feel like i was
slightly too old for it. - [ken] okay, bull(bleep), no one's ever too old for drake and josh, but-- - well that's a questionable-- memerex? - [drake and josh character]
what's a gamesphere? - [josh] only the most sophisticated gaming experience ever
created by humans, and it's-- - i don't get this
reference at all, but okay. - [ken] you might not get it, but a lot of people will get it. - what is this? - [josh] it's spherical. spherical! - okay... i assume this is a cd
player from drake and josh. - [ken] it's the gamesphere. - it says the sphere boomball. - [ken] it's a gamesphere. - i feel like this is
some meme i just don't get and now i'm just gonna look dumb. - [ken] okay, i've brought the cavalry. - hello everyone. - [matt] it's spherical! - spherical. - it's spherical! - [kevin] what are you idiots doing? - i don't know. i'm doing mystery tech
and everyone showed up and started yelling drake
and josh references. - so you actually haven't heard of this? - i've never heard of this. it just looks like some stupid boom box. - it was like the gamecube
before the gamecube. - the gamesphere instead of the gamecube? - i think it was pretty much
a knockoff of the gamecube. they made the gamesphere. - oh, and it's just this thing? - yeah, i think that was kind of the idea, why they made a gamesphere. - i mean, you've obviously
got this as new old stock. how much was the sphere boomball? - [ken] $100. - for an old cd player? - [ken] it's for an old game console. - it doesn't play games. - [ken] it doesn't have to. ooh, that's kinda cool. - [austin] what is cool about this? - [ken] it looks like
a helmet, look at that. dude, hell yeah. - [austin] this is too many pieces. - [ken] that's great. (rap music) - is this "money in the
grave" mixed with... with little jon, wait, what? [music] i mean where should
i really even start [music] [music] i'm creeping in the dark. [music] doesn't look like it's gonna spin. how 'bout hit play. no, hit play. - [ken] what is up with this? - are you trying to tell me that a spherical cd player was
a bad idea 17 years later? - no, aw, maybe it was a bad idea. - you realize that this cd player is older than most people
watching this video? - oh yeah, they don't
probably know what cds are. - so if you're not familiar with what this was supposed to do, imagine spotify except you had to buy physical disks
and put them in a sphere and then you can play it track by track but you can only play one album at a time. very archaic technology, i know, but this is what ken grew up with so the gamesphere, it is. i gotta say, it's not looking too good for this mystery tech right now. - [ken] oh, wait till you see what i got. - i mean, i've seen a lot of trash. anime headphones and a stupid gamesphere. - [ken] it's not stupid. - [austin] oh, something
that's actually cool. so this, my friends, is
the sega genesis mini as well as (gasps) the tower? the tower? oh, this is cool, the genesis mini is very much in the same sort of
style as something like the nes or the snes classic in that you have a ton
of games pre-installed. it works via hdmi, however, this, this is what i'm really excited about. oh, dude. the little switches work, what? dude, all the buttons
are like real buttons. that is so cool. so this is one of the things
i don't like about the nintendo consoles and even
something like the ps classic and the, i mean look at the
little attention to detail. i mean, this switch,
i doubt does anything, but it feels just like the original. you got a reset switch,
you got on and off. this is really nicely done. so if you guys are not
familiar with the genesis, this was a console back in
the late 80s, early 90s, and one of the cool parts
about it is that it had a very long lifespan
which meant that it got several major upgrades
including the sega cd which included cd functionality as well as the sega 32x
which you can almost think of as like a, like an xbox one x compared to the one, except instead of buying a new console it was an add-on. so theoretically, all of these
things would work together which would mean that you
could play genesis games, you could play 32x games and sega cd games all with one of the most ridiculous looking towers that have ever
graced anyone's living rooms. there you go. that was a real thing that
you could buy in 1993. now, it's small and it
doesn't do anything, but it looks cool. all right, would you care to play some virtua fighter with me? - sure.
- alright. - [ken] let's do it. - [austin] get up, get up. wow. - that's pretty...
- that's not good. get out of here. (laughing) (sega jingle) - you know that sega sound bite is one fourth of the cartridge size? - really?
- yeah. this thing is really rad, right? i mean the fact that they've done what seems to be a very
good job with the emulation. pretty solid game selection. i love this hardware. the fact that you get a tower of power even though i'm not even
sure if you can actually buy that here in the states, but i mean, this thing's legit. i would say good job, but
you didn't buy this, did you? - [ken] no, i didn't. - thanks, sega. (sega jingle) - wait, no. - you can't do that. it touched the table. what'd you give me, you can't, no, no, no, no, no, i want the other thing back. what did you give me bread for? i see you, you can't edit
your way out of this one because you grabbed the wrong item. a toaster? this is just a japanese toaster? - [ken] it's not just
any japanese toaster, it is the japanese toaster. - what is wrong with this episode? is this the "ken gives up" episode? it's just a toaster. - it's not just a toaster.
- it's a toaster. this is it? oh, okay. - [ken] so, this toaster is
very famous, or infamous, for only toasting one slice at a time. - no, wait. - [ken] to make the
perfect slice of toast. - how much was this
amazing japanese toaster? - [ken] after import, it was $450. - to toast one piece at a time? - [ken] yeah. (ken laughs) - there've been a lot of
dumb things on mystery tech. there's been a lot of money wasted, but $450 for a toaster that
toasts one side of the bread! one piece at a time! what is wrong with you? alright, ready to toast my stale bread. medium toasted, 45678, no no, 4568... 6. and then it's normal. okay, start. - [ken] akihiro iwahara
of mitsubishi said they "wanted to focus on a single slice "and treat it with respect." incredible, exquisite, some might say. - i'll be the judge of that. okay, it's pretty good toast. i've never had toast
that tastes this good. it's just for audio, don't
use the video of that. i was trying to get a
really good clean crunch for a transition. here you go, my friend. it's very warm. - it is very warm, it's not overly. - no. - oh my god. - pretty good, right? - that is really well done. it's even, what the hell? - i'm gonna take this home tonight. that's really good, right? - [ken] i hope so for a $300 toaster.
