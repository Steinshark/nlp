faze clan has suspended three members and booted one entirely over their involvement in a shady pump and dump cryptocurrency scheme we've remained in contact with them and we we've asked them like well i have personally asked them yo where where's the response why have you guys not addressed this yet what is going on do not believe what you're hearing online if you don't know coffee zilla is man this dude there he is right there goes into the trenches the people behind this coin at least from what it appears to be running a standard pump and dump is not only disgusting but it actually makes me sick to my stomach why is he listening to the influencers telling him you need to change the thing that's preventing this from being a scam to one minute thereby making it a scam in face case not innocent but there are a lot of other people that are guilty that there is like some type of mastermind here who's the name tell me well this is awkward i didn't plan on talking to you guys until my next installment on save the kids because this story is not over i don't know if you guys remember how he left it but we still don't know who the true mastermind is but in this new video that i've been working on i've been digging deep to unveil the truth about save the kids and i think we found most of it i teamed up with some ordinary gamers to look closely over the blockchain to find out who's truly responsible in fact he just uploaded a one hour video exposing some of what we found but that's not even all of it and all i want to do is tell you guys that story right tell you the story of how influencers with 50 million followers could be behind a coin called save the kids which did anything but and instead scammed the fans who invested instead of that though today i got something from our boy phase k sorry x phase k and after repeatedly reaching out to him them for comment on the new evidence that i had found i got this this is a seasoned assist letter from fraser k's lawyers basically they're saying you know we're going to sue you if you don't hold on let's see here if you do not immediately by the end of the day tomorrow at the latest publicly retract the defamatory statements and cease and desist for making other such defamatory statements in the future okay well that tomorrow they're talking about is actually today which is why i'm making this video to inform the boys at fraser's law firm that unfortunately i'm gonna miss the deadline boys because even though of course i don't want to get sued this is nothing but bullying to try to get me to shut up about exposing one of the biggest crypto scams this year and even though keeping my video up means apparently i'm getting sued for millions of dollars they tell me my conscience is clean i'll happily fight this in court and listen i'm not gonna hide behind lawyers here instead i'm gonna walk you through this absolute toilet paper i'll i'll show you the ridiculous bullying that these guys are trying to do to get me to shut up and not only that i'm going to let you in on a little secret opinion of mine that this lawsuit is a tactic to silence the new evidence that's coming out about k he knows the kind of things that i have on him and he knows it because i've been asking him for comment on it and he hasn't been responding apparently he's been prepping his lawyers to come at me instead but that's going to backfire on him because today i'll be sharing a taste of that info with you including a brand new phase k wallet that nobody knew about but first let's deal with this little legal letter here at the risk of boring you i'll be posting the full letter on my twitter account if you want to see it there but i'll just be going over the most important parts here we are the litigation council for fraser quadrati aka face k we write to you regarding your false and defamatory public statements about mr quadrati since june 2021 and demand that you immediately retract them in his public manner i as you have made them they go on to say that i'm not only defame frazier k they also say i've extorted him which was news to me listen to this they say to it you wrote k i'm serious man this is our dms by the way i guess asking for comment is extortion now i'm serious man you got to start talking we've found so much more on you and if you keep hiding behind these ridiculous two-minute statements it's never gonna work if you guys don't know i'm referencing faze k's response video where he didn't say sorry and instead tried to play the victim but hold on we'll continue here i said not only that we want to take down pepper but you staying silent isn't helping okay here i'm discussing the fact most people involved in this investigation know peppers involved and we know that k knows that so we're looking for that evidence i'm just asking him look share that information with us now listen to this they say despite knowing that sam pepper was the bad actor here not mr kadrati okay so apparently i'm asking for evidence on sam pepper being the bad guy while apparently knowing that sam pepper was the bad guy and this constitutes extortion so let me break this down for you guys at home asking for comment on new evidence saying hey because we had lost communication he just stopped responding in my messages and i'm saying look we have new evidence you need to respond to it it looks terrible right that apparently is extortion according to phase k this demonstrates your malicious intent and willingness to report false facts to comport with what you perceive to as your best interest again what do i know as facts i'm asking face k for the facts on sam pepper and i'm being told that's extortion but that also i knew the facts that k won't provide me like what are you talking about dude here's the thing that pisses me off this whole time they're saying like basically i'm purposely misleading people in order to you know get the craziest headline possible but if that were true i would have just said everyone involved was equally bad i didn't instead i went through everyone's wallets that i had and said you know how bad i thought it was face jarvis face nikon not as bad as phase k right phase tico i've publicly exonerated because i had a look at his wallet he talked because he's innocent and it was proven that he hadn't sold his save the kids token so if what they're saying is true and i'm looking to promote myself and your videos rather than conducting a factually supportable and careful review of the truth as any reputable reporter would have done i would have just thrown everyone at the bus instead i pointed out the people who had a habit of pumping and dumping and i pointed out the people who didn't and all the while i asked everyone for comment because of course in a case that is this serious i have to ask you is there more information of the story they also tell me that i made among other attention grabbing false and the family story statements about mr kadrati let's take a listen mr kadrati aka k engaged in malicious selling is what i said yeah i would i'd actually say that's true i mean what are you talking about you sold saved the kids which you were an ambassador of in 24 hours how is that not malicious selling you're supposed to be an ambassador of a charity token and you sold everything in 24 hours they also say i said he dumped all his kids tokens immediately also true but here's a good one they also included a joke i put in my video they said i said phase k should be called faze rug actually hey that's a good joke what i mean by that is that he not only sold save the kids instantly he has a history of doing that to every or nearly every project he gets involved in you can check it for yourself on the blockchain boys and it kind of just continues like that but here's another one that's kind of important to talk about they're apparently upset because i said it's all leading back to phase k which it was because manny and lucas they're talking about facebook who himself is insisting oh no i didn't make any money that he's the victim in all this okay there i'm just quoting what he told me again because i asked him for comment which i shouldn't have even done in the first place apparently because it's extorting phase k i'm sorry i keep calling him faith sorry k i'm not trying to dig that in i just just have it they're saying i'm extorting k by asking for comment so the very fact that he got to say in my video that oh no i didn't make any money and that he claimed to be a victim is because of this thing that i did which is asking for comment so they conclude we demand that you cease and desist if you do not mr kadrati has instructed us to commence litigation against you and all those with whom you act are acting in concert and or have been supplying you with false and defamatory information wow maybe some ordinary gamers because we researched this thing together so they might be hearing from this guy's lawyers too got a cease and desist and they're saying that anybody who's who's helped work on this might be sued i mean we'll have to take it to court but that also means the discovery phase and that also means whoever is really behind this and the true inner workings of save the kids is going to get exposed and i have a pretty good feeling that it's not going to be good for the party that's suing they say among other damages your false statements have caused phase to terminate mr kadrati's relationship with it and mr khadrati may as a result lose millions of dollars of revenue and that's of course what they're suing me for you see here's the thing their lawsuit is saying i caused this i'm the i'm the guy responsible for getting k removed from faze clan because faze clan had no involvement with our members activity on the cryptocurrency space but you know who actually already admitted to this not me i didn't say it faze k himself came out prematurely you know before i even had time to make my big video and said conf fast to his altcoin thing he said himself it was irresponsible for me to speak publicly about coins without knowing more look so you're admitting what you did you got you kicked out of faze clan you know what i mean like you promoting cryptocurrencies and rugging your followers got you kicked out of face clan i had nothing to do with it i'm just the guy who caught you along with my boys some ordinary gamers and barely sociable like honestly it's so insulting that he's implying here that faze clan can't do their own investigation like it's an insult to your own company that you were just kicked out of because they just suspended other people but they kick you out meaning they thought what you did was worse and that's their decision i mean i didn't call faze clan telling him you know what what to do right they're making their own decisions based on what they want to do and you're upset about it and you're trying to blame me but honestly that's not a surprise because fraser failing to take responsibility for his actions seems to be a recurring theme see have you guys seen this video titled the truth about save the kids this was released by frasier after a long wait instead of bringing evidence he brought a two-minute video where he never apologized and said once again that he's the victim i know i haven't posted in a while and there is so much that i want to say about what's happened in the past month but because of legal reasons all i'm allowed to say right legal reasons like suing me i guess now is this please please do not believe what you're hearing online all of these people making videos think that they know the truth and that they know who's responsible when they just don't honestly this thing is so embarrassing he's saying he wants the truth out there but he's tangled up in legal stuff while trying to tangle the people who are talking also up in legal stuff so they can't say anything so he refuses to give any information anyone and he refuses to let anyone else get any information out otherwise he might sue you and i know that it sounds bad but let's give frasier a break he says he's found the guy responsible there's one bad guy so we've uncovered significant evidence which confirms that a dishonest person abused his trust with me to scam everybody he's talking about sam pepper but he's afraid to say his name now this is a predictable but ultimately feudal decision to try to blame everything on sam pepper why not because sam pepper's innocent he's definitely not i've known he's not i've been asking frazier for information to confirm that by the way for a long time the reason it's stupid is because sam pepper and frazier have been running around in crypto doing these scams for a very long time and they run in a lot of the same circles in fact i'm about to show you one of these scams right now live and mind you this is 10 of what i have i had to make put this video together in one night because i have to respond to this before apparently they're gonna sue or whatever so just so you guys know this is 10 of what we got and this will directly contradict frasier's little goofy theory that sam pepper you know abused his trust and that oh k didn't know what was going on right like how how is he he been involved in this stuff before now he's just an innocent naive crypto investor so let's talk about moon puck moon puck was yet another scam where the developers had most of the liquidity and people got rugged pretty quick in fact this scam was so bad that even sam pepper himself felt bad about what he did to his fans he said in a tweet yesterday i spent all day hyping up the fact i was gonna promote a tweet a token and like i effed up i chose one that was pre-sale thinking people would like that they are getting in early but instead this made it unfair after it went live people saw the devs held huge wallets this was stupid on my part not to check this and left people feeling like the project was a scam so this thing was so sleazy that even sam pepper is like yikes now with that background on moon pug pay attention to this avatar that is something called a shadow people sam pepper promoted these nfts you know who bought one of these nfts take a look phase k new verified shadow people collector and just underneath it to verify it even more phase k responds with the devil emoji quite appropriate now you guys should be familiar with the rest of this process using this nft number i just cross-checked the time of sale and find out who owned it at the time that would be this wallet right here now all we have to do is cross-check the bse scan to go to the bap20 token section and boom see he participated in moon pug he got money from the deployer wallet meaning he was involved before the public could be and what did this guy do when he got loaded up with tons of moonpak well he dumped it as fast as he possibly could in a little over four hours this guy got rid of all his moon which means that if we go to the day of launch we can watch as frasier dumps his coins here's the start of the sale he gets in early it pumps really high he sells off hour two hour three hour four and by this hour he's out now remember that as we zoom out this guy got in around here sold all the way here is completely out of the coin and of course everyone gets wiped out and the truth is the amount of money he made wasn't trivial i went transaction by transaction finding how much money he made each time he kept trading for 10 wrapped bnb with a total of 20 out transactions that means he made about 200 bmb which at a b b price of 523 dollars means he made about a hundred thousand dollars off of selling this moon pug in the first few hours this is why i'm so sick of fraser claiming to be naive naive people don't know how to rug a coin naive people usually don't have multiple wallets and naive people sure as hell don't know how to make a hundred thousand dollars from a pre-sale of a coin so in conclusion i want to close this by saying that in my opinion okay you are a self-serving hypocrite you claim in your response video that you just want to help people and get to the bottom of this and one way i can pay that forward is by making sure that this con man gets the justice that he deserves but that isn't true is it in reality you're trying to sue people who are investigating this whole thing all the while claiming you're gonna do your own investigation we're conducting a very thorough independent and aggressive investigation how could it be independent you're like one of the main guys yo i know i was accused of this but i'm gonna investigate it independently and you got in trouble and look i get it you're upset you got caught and now you're trying to use your vast resources to shut up the people who are looking into what you've done and meanwhile you're not responding to comment and if anyone asks for comment you say they're extorting you but in my opinion the people you're really betraying here is not me it's your fans right like the least you could do is apologize to them for what you've done and you haven't done that right like not once during this thing does kay apologize he doesn't say sorry instead he throws sam pepper onto the bus which i'm not saying sam pepper's innocent he even could be the mastermind as i said a week ago we don't know right i'm looking into it i'm asking everybody but let's not pretend that kay and sam haven't been involved in the crypto game for a while now so i'm gonna close this video by addressing k i guess look no puny lawsuit threat is gonna make me stop investigating getting to the truth of this and the reason in for that is because i know all you have is money you have piles and piles of money no one's disputing that clearly we just you know but what you don't have is the truth because if you did have that you'd be standing up loudly talking to anyone who would listen instead anyone who asks you questions is apparently extorting you so i don't know that's all i basically have to say good luck throwing your piles of money around and in the meantime i'll just continue my investigation to everyone else who's out there listening quite dramatic i apologize i hope that i can just get back to work keep investigating and i'll be presenting you guys with a new video exposing the truth about save the kids very soon [music]
