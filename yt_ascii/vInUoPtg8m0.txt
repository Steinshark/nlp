[music] hey what's up mkbhd here and today was the first apple event of the calendar 2021 year another virtual one and another pretty action-packed one the spring loaded title was well deserved so this video is me breaking down and reacting to all three of the major announcements because there were three and each of the three was very different from the other also this video is sponsored by expressvpn so for more info on that stay tuned to the end but i'll also have a link below on how to get three months for free so today was april 20th 4 20. and it was a very busy 4 20. the apple event was filled with a lot of great transitions per usual at this point it feels like i have to watch the keynotes once for the new products then one more time for the key specs and all the facts and information and then one more time for the cinematography it's really good like how is our audio so good where are their mics how are they that stable on a boat in the middle of the bay but anyway at the end of the day we have three new major announcements air tags m1 imacs and m1 ipad pros there's chapters below if you're that impatient but let's just start with air tag shall we this was the the one that we were looking forward to for the longest time they were rumored forever it was just a question of when apple was actually going to release them so now they're unveiled and this is air tags so they're a little quarter-sized puck that connects two iphones find my network so you can find them anywhere and they have a little speaker built in so you can ping them and they'll make a noise but the main way you'd find them is the same way you'd use find my iphone or find my mac then when you're within bluetooth range the ultra wideband u1 chip in iphone 11 or iphone 12 will show you exactly how far away it is and where to look and guiding you to finding it simple but super useful air tags just make a lot of sense and this find my network has been so useful for so long because it it runs off the backs of everyone else's iphones so when someone passes by an air tag that's been lost it passively updates the location of that air tag in the background and it just keeps everybody's stuff on the map if you will also if someone finds a lost air tag they can touch their iphone to it and it'll show a name and a phone number and they can get in touch with you if that was yours so they'll cost 29 bucks for one or 99 bucks for a four pack which i was thinking about it that's not it's not that bad that's right about the same price as the cheapest tiles but it's just super well integrated like if you were picking between this and any other if you have an iphone this is in the ecosystem actually my main question would be what would you find with them to justify a four pack i feel like they were really smart about doing four instead of three so if i had four keys are the obvious one backpack for me would be the other and then maybe maybe a pet collar or something like that or you could give one to a spouse or something like that it's pretty slim 1.25 inches tall and weighs 11 grams so i feel like you can kind of put it anywhere a tile could go it's ip67 water resistant it's made of metal and apple will let you engrave that metal if you're into that with a couple letters or an emoji but the real customization is in the color of the band you choose to put it in also what why is the hermes version so expensive i'm sorry i've never known how exactly to pronounce that but the fact that it's literally 10 times the price of the normal sleeve for the mermaid whatever it's called i wow but also worth noting the spec also lists a user replaceable cr2032 battery which is pretty nice that's the same type of battery you might have in a watch or a garage door opener one of those circular batteries which is not the case for all of these find my devices some older tiles didn't have user replaceable batteries so when they died you just that was it they were dead you have to buy another one newer tiles i use replaceable but that's pretty sweet i could easily have seen apple being the company that went the opposite route and said we made a shiny metal one you can't take the battery out they didn't nice but yeah i'll definitely be getting my hands on air tags asap to show you how they work what that experience is like how well you can actually find things with them and whether or not they're worth the money so definitely subscribe to see that video if you haven't already all right next up we gotta talk about we got to talk about these imacs so all the colorful teasers leading up to this event we're kind of hinting at new colorful imacs right maybe it's hindsight 2020 but it was clearly a throwback to the original colorful imacs that came out many years ago so here they are now it's 20 21 and the first colorful apple desktops and a long timer here this new imac redesign in seven very bright colors red orange yellow blue aqua green and silver so the gist here is these are completely redesigned imax from the ground up as you can probably already tell and they have m1 ships inside so there's new performance new internals and then a new outside that i don't like very much like to me okay this imac design is actually super impressive technically speaking right it's got the squared off design now just like the pro display xdr the tilt adjustable hinge on the back and it is crazy thin crazy thin 11 and a half millimeters and the whole thing is 10 pounds which is insane that's about the same thickness as an apple watch two air tags stacked on top of each other thicker than the whole computer believe it or not fun fact this imac is so thin that you actually can't plug in headphones from the back anymore because a typical headphone jack is 14 millimeters deep and the whole computer is 11 millimeters deep so they put the headphone jack on the side now at least they kept it i actually think the size is better but there is a larger 24 inch 4480 by 2280 display up front that gets closer to the edges and also now has white bezels for some reason and there's still a pretty solid metallic chin that now has no logo on it and it matches the color of the back of the imac and the base and the sides are actually a different accent color than the back and the chin so basically the red imac will have a red body and red sides but a salmon-colored chin and stand it's an interesting two-toned look they've got going on and then the insides are completely redesigned around that m1 chip now we already knew the m1 chip was great in the macbook air and the baseline macbook pro but also in the mac mini so it makes perfect sense that well there's actually tons of room inside this imac to continue to be great plus they've dropped an improved camera system and speaker system in here but apple actually showed the inside of the imac and just look at this thing most of the computer is just in those tiny pieces down at the bottom and like a slot basically where that chin is the rest is all thermals and ribbon cables they also made some color matching accessories like this magic mouse and track pad and a new magic keyboard that has a touch id fingerprint reader in the corner very cool but just it's ugly right i'm not crazy am i this replaces the 21.5 inch intel imac and there's got to be a larger 27-inch imac replacement coming with like an m1x chip or something and i feel like that version has got to have a way smaller chin and way less crazy colors again this machine despite me thinking it's pretty ugly is technically very impressive being this thin fitting a whole computer in such a thin profile getting dolby atmos supporting speakers in there the performance of the m1 the instant wake all that great stuff that comes from the m1 chip that is super great the power adapter that it comes with plugs in magnetically into the back with a color matching cable and there's an ethernet plug on the brick of at least some of the specs so you don't have to have a cable that runs all the way up to your desk four usb c ports on the back two of which are thunderbolt 3. i wish there was an sd card slot but it looks like there isn't one also there are only two ports if you buy the cheapest model but the fact is i saw this and it was really cool to see colored imacs again but this imac is only really pretty from the back like you you get it out the box and you're obviously like wow this is super thin you put it on your desk then you never see the back again i have no idea how thick these monitors are i also don't really care two inches three four inches i don't really care so i personally think it would have made a ton of sense for apple to put most of this computer stuff behind the display instead of in the huge chin and make this imac a bit thicker right now it's literally half an inch thick maybe make it one inch thick i don't know one and a half it would still look great it would still be very thin but it would look way better without that chin oh and then turn the bezels back to black while you're at it please i'm never gonna get a real answer about why exactly they did it this way maybe it was thermals that they couldn't put it back there i don't know but what i'm pretty sure of is that that's exactly what they're gonna do with a higher end m1x 27-inch imac that comes out probably later this year that higher-end redesigned version will probably look much better because at the end of the day keep this in mind this bright beautiful new imac we're looking at is just replacing the baseline 21 and a half inch model which was not very up to date there were people complaining about you know it maxes out at 512 gigs of storage the one it's replacing maxed out at 256 gigs of solid-state storage then it would do like a one terabyte fusion drive so this is actually a much better computer than the 1080p outdated 21.5 inch imac that it replaces but i feel like there's no way future higher end apple silicon imacs look like this with the white bezels in the chin i'm just saying also i was scrolling through the site just like looking through the design and if you get to just the right point on the page it's at this moment where it's like changing colors and it looks like this kind of split tone imac and it looks actually pretty sweet but you can't buy a split tone imac i'm sure dbrand's already on top of this but anyway last but certainly not least was the third and final big announcement which was the new m1 powered ipad pros which again are very technically impressive because you know the thing we are all worried about with the ipad pros is are they too slow not really but this new ipad pro is in the same familiar design still just as thin and impressive and unibody metal as ever but it's now powered by that crazy powerful and efficient m1 chip and this is super curious to me the a12z bionic was already pretty incredible for the ipad pro and it was optimized for a device with that thermal profile and with that battery the m1 chip in an ipad just seems like huge overkill so this is now an even more powerful tablet than ever before widening their gap and the m1 chip now also means that the usb-c port at the bottom is now a full-on thunderbolt port for those high speeds there's now up to two terabytes of mac storage on the ipad pro which is massive and it gets 5g support on top of that already pretty useful cellular option and then the larger only the larger 12.9 inch ipad pro gets upgraded to a mini led display so this is something we're also looking forward to for a while some of us were secretly hoping for oled the ipad pros have been 120 hertz lcds for a little bit this is probably just as good so now this 120hz display will have 1600 nits max brightness and hdr supports the full p3 color gamut and there's about 2600 local dimming zones for hopefully some really deep inky blacks and sharp high contrast bright scenes but i'm really looking forward to seeing what that mini led ipad pro looks like versus the lcds we've seen but it should be great for things like photo editing whatever video editing you might be doing on the ipad but also especially watching movies because let's face it a lot of movies on ipads have the black bars at the top and the bottom those should be even darker since pixels are off even more inky blacks when watching movies so should be a pretty good upgrade i'm just super curious if we're actually going to notice a performance difference between the a12z and the m1 chip in an ipad pro i mean it's it's just ipad os at the end of the day and it's going to be doing processing and maybe those types of compilation times are faster but will battery life be better the ipad pro actually has a bigger battery than the macbook airs but you know it's 120 hertz display so it balances out i don't know we'll have to test we'll have to see but hey at the end of the day even if this thing is nuclear powerful it's still an ipad so it's going to be amazing at all the things that ipads were already pretty good at but also just as limited so i mean this there's nothing i'd like more than to try final cut pro on a small 3k touchscreen with an m1 chip but i can't because ipad but hey at least good on apple for not resting on their 30 million light year lead on performance specifically in tablets but yeah that's basically it those are the three big new bullet points there was also some other small stuff announced at this event there's a new apple tv 4k and there's also a new remote for the apple tv which is nice there's also a new purple iphone 12. so mid cycle refresh stuff honestly i probably will end up making a video on that we'll see but those are the those are the main things and my reactions and my thoughts to them anyway let me know in the comments what you guys think of the announcements but specifically do you also think the new imac is as ugly as i do because i seriously anyway there's a lot of other hands-on and more videos on this sort of stuff coming up so if you want to see that if you want to see air tags in action if you want to see a purple iphone but if you want to see the new ipad pros and m1 imacs be sure to subscribe so you can be first in line to see that stuff hit the bell even while you're down there anyway thanks for watching now a word from the sponsor shout out to the sponsor of today's video expressvpn so some of you like to pause and take note of the apps on my phone during videos so some of you have already seen expressvpn on my

we're all kind of spending a lot more time online than ever before so the thing is when you are browsing from your own home your internet service provider you know whether that's comcast or verizon whoever it is can see every single site you visit even when you're in incognito mode and you're hiding it from google theoretically they can still see everything you visit and they can sell that information legally so with expressvpn it reroutes your connection through secure encrypted servers elsewhere so they can't see what sites you're visiting nobody can so anytime your device connects to the internet that data is safely encrypted and then the cherry on top expressvpn lets you choose the location of those servers to make it look like you are from that location so that lets you access content that's not available in your region by making it look like you're from another region so you can access thousands of new shows that are on netflix or bbc iplayer like i've been watching a lot
