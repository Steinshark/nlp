why oh that's so nice the case is on fire the case is on fire our friends from hacksmith industry came all the way to vancouver to show us something amazing elias has absolutely no idea what it is i am so stoked do you want to see this i think so as long as it's not too dangerous we brought two don't drop don't get hit by the flames and don't die there's nothing in this no this is just a flame expander to make sure that we don't get liquid propane on the computer oh my god that's the ignition source that's we're gonna light the whole thing off oh shut up i'm in just like i'm in to tell you about our sponsor amd amd's radeon rx 7900 xtx and xt are some of the best graphics card options for 4k gaming under a thousand dollars check them out at the link in the video description pretty simple setup got liquid propane goes into our electronics box so right now we're just running it at full power and then that goes into our propane expander this gets sub-zero theoretically this can drop down to negative 42 degrees celsius and then we have our flame expander that just has you know a nice warming effect all right so you can just oh that's fun okay is that on no it's not on that should be on yeah probably yeah yeah what could go wrong we do have a fire extinguisher handy can someone actually be holding this no okay that'll be here let's just see how we're doing here wow minus 25 at the cooling side and what's our flame doing more than 130 yeah can someone me the principle of this i mean i understand that the liquid propane is extremely cold right air conditioners work by having a liquid that expands that cools the thing you compress that compressor and turn it back into liquid yes here instead you're just burning it think about it this way right let's say you have a natural gas line going into your house instead of just burning it for your natural furnace you can also use it to cool your computer and that tank will last a good two hours i mean it's not the first time we asked mother earth to take one for the team i guess the flame expander is standard 240 millimeter mounting so that just goes right on you know top mounted cpu cooler are we actually doing that yeah it is literally the hottest cpu cooler this goes for a while hey yeah there's a lot of liquid in here right so like all of that has to evaporate before it actually shuts down give her a little you know yeah i can actually warm it up with your hands it goes quicker for the components of our sub-zeroed on fire pc we have an i9 13900k for the motherboard it's a strix e z790 for a gpu we have the strix 4090 and this thing is a freaking beast now we do have two not a flamethrower pc coolers and we just want to put two of them on the cpu that'll be so much more fun all of these components spare the gpu are actually going in the spiffing brits pc so tom if you're watching this i am incredibly sorry that i put vaseline all over your motherboard before we go any further we need to just set a baseline 39 512 points in cinebench she freaking rips what do you call this fiery boy you know what they say any machine is a smoke machine if used wrongly enough ah it's actually fine 38 degrees that'll feel a little bit warm to your hand give a man a fire keep them warm for the day set a man on fire keep it warm for the rest of his life one of my absolute favorite things on these new asus boards is that instead of having to stick your hand in there to hit the little pcie release thing there's a little switch a little button right there now you might be wondering why did i take this apart if we're not going to be sub-zero cooling and that's because i want to have an external voltage controller so what we are doing is by just very simply sticking a little header here that allows us to connect to the i2c bus and with that we're going to talk to the voltage controller and be like what about you give us just way more voltage than you think you should and then it does then we have a very fast gpu right now since we don't have a 3900 the only way i can make a mounting bracket for it is by buying a mounting bracket that already existed and then hoping to match up the bolt patterns i think this is a cooler master bracket that i got from amazon and hopefully it fits onto this motherboard oh i think i can do you one better we have this thing it has all of the bolt patterns piece of new so you go like this we're actually going to want to take this socket cover right off and underneath it we're going to put a little bit of artists eraser when there's air and your sub-zero condensation forms condensation on the back of your cpu you know where this ends foreign [music] to see now dear viewer i would like to apologize the storyline for the strix and the external voltage controller ends right here we tried to get it to work later but sadly our monitor was melting and we ran out of time instead of installing this retention bracket on that came with the motherboard we're going to use this thermal grizzly cpu contact frame before we put this on though please everybody clip this and send it to spiff there we go i forgot to conformal coat the bits all the little chips that are around here will have a solution how do you feel right now [music] i can get in into lots of cooling on a single into line iron heck yeah get fit two beside each other there so we got two radiators the plan is to put one here and then that will create a lot of fire now instead of three brackets we have a single double bracket basically we've just mutilated one of our mounting brackets so we can mount two of the coolers onto a single cpu that'll give us full coverage of not just the dye but also the integrated heat spreader that will actually double our total cooling capacity alex my motherboard is stuck you it'll be fun next time alex wow you're cooling a computer with a fire extinguisher no no this piece of near pretty might be a little bit bigger than the case can handle hmm let's just mount it like normal using the thing you brought add some more dielectric grease that'd be fine neoprene's nice but since we have schmut it just do that yep all right i can tell you this isn't going to be enough you will literally have water dripping off the back of this bracket we have to keep air off it the best part is if we do this outside there probably won't even be any condensation on this it still smells like propane in here you guys see the thing that they add to propane to make it really nice and smelly it lasts for about three to six months is what i've read online i just did the math on how much heat this is going to create okay well for reference electricity a kilowatt hour is equal to 3 400 btus we're going to be close to half a million this might actually be more expensive than i'm running liquid nitrogen you guys know that we just have like bolt down kits right yes but i don't know where it is going back to my office it's in i looked for that so long yesterday do you know why i keep my bolt through in this bin in my office because we had lots of them and nobody puts them back where they're supposed to be which is why we don't have those other ones and mine is not in here anymore what the hell happened to my bolt through why can't people return things oh this is cute i did find one cool thing in here though check this out this pen has a lee and lee catalog i would call this whole thing half baked but with like half a million btus i think it's probably full baked maybe even over baked one thing's for sure it's baked see my initial prototype was 200 watts and alex is like that's not enough double it i was like okay so that was 400 watts and alex was like i wonder if we can put two of them on here yes i know i work with them every day what do you want if we had 200 watts on this thing that cpu would be hotter than the sun this is what it takes to make me even more grateful for my team that i work with working with someone else's as soon as i asked contact you're probably like oh no should we you've had enough thoughts alex this ain't no amateur hack job that's why we're using propane that's one of the worst things you've ever said man i've seen builds from our community using actual computer cooling components that look less clean than this yeah i feel like there's not many people that are running the 3900 with a 40 90 all overclocked modded and sub-zeroed so we might set some high scores here you'd be surprised how many nerds have already set those high scores the difference is that their system is not practical day to day yeah in the canadian weather it's great for heating your house fifth fingerbread's gonna get us computer it is going to be covered in dialectical grease and smell like propane it's going to be very confused yeah in fairness his computer was already going to be kind of confusing anyway because it's going to be cooled by t so well he's british virgin people from vancouver they don't clear off any of their stuff realize how long it would take to just like i cleaned out the spot under the fan so it won't be sucking snow up into the power supply that's thoughtful it was brandon's idea there's no in the usb connector fine once you turn your computer off it'll solve itself when i have the ability to dump over 20 liters an hour of propane through this computer i see nothing that could go wrong feel like we're going through a nuclear launch sequence or something all right alex you want to go ahead and hit it sure [music] yeah further away oh oh that's so nice yeah that is very nice so that clicky noise is actually the solenoid being controlled by the pan header keep the flame at a minimum while the cpu is not doing any work i see we're at minus 10 degrees celsius so far minus 11. but and this is with restraint this is with the regulator going our pilot flames this is a proud canadian tradition the annual computer cook should we be worried about the flames being on the lines it'll be okay for a little bit they're directly in the fire though yeah it's probably not ideal yeah they're they're kind of smoking they're they're cooking and we want to get these out of the way yeah there's a bit of wind if you've got a bit of wind factor going on oh i don't know that i want this to be that close no no it's fine it's fine because we're going to rotate it this way it is oh yeah that power supply is now sucking in snow just yeah perfect oh okay yeah it should be fine well do you want to hit it again ah oh your mother is getting a little toasty now ideally we don't cook the monitor ah wow the front of this case is looking pretty gnarly wow she's sweating boys all right hold on becca monitors warping a little oh that's not great oh that's too hot on the hands that's really hot wow okay all right so we're gonna overclock this thing or what let's get a baseline run with the with the cooling distance to tj maxx 100 degrees starting to give us some froth on the back as long as the frost doesn't turn into water we're good cpu package one degree celsius 39 795 points what was our baseline 39 500. oh so we got like 300 points wow xtu has a new automatic overclock should we just hit it and see what happens let's see what it thinks of this cpu package we're currently consuming 260 watts 40 481 points though should we just give her the beans see what happens all right we are now deregulated who needs regulations but you can't be any geek off the street oh my goodness i don't know if max was a very good idea the fittings are on fire the case is on fire oh yeah the plastic at the front of the case is on fire who was it who didn't want to have the fire extinguisher handy you i think i can solve this ah did you turn it off yeah i turned it off oh boy why yeah we can just press that one okay it's back on in case it hasn't been adequately covered yet the flames themselves are not what are doing the cooling these are propane cylinders instead of having them right side up so they release gaseous propane we flip them upside down so that they release liquid propane which is between negative 40 and negative 45 degrees celsius that runs through this regulator right here which then dumps that liquid propane directly onto our cpu now obviously liquid propane is gonna have to go somewhere it gets heated by the cpu turned into a gas and then released through these tubes into our flame expander up here where obviously it's going to be lit on fire so you can roast marshmallows all right do you guys think this can do six gigahertz yeah and we're gonna turn it on to max again ah it's running extended bench right now at 60 gigahertz oh it's actually at 95 degrees so it did six no problem what score did we get 40 990. yeah i think that we can do 41 pretty easily here crackers oh yeah i could really go for some by the way i love your portable marshmallow roaster if you wanted hack some dust store would you like a pair of safety glasses too safety oh 41 604 6.1 gigahertz not too bad 4.5 on all the efficiency cores this thing's actually ripping it may not be as cold as some methods of cooling but it certainly has plenty of cooling capacity oh wow that's really hot since we're getting some liquid coming through at full power the bottom is actually completely frozen over if we had a maze style design or otherwise more complex evaporator head over the cpu it's possible we could be seeing much better heat exchange and getting better efficiency out of our propane cylinders oh it's hot so it turns out having flames on your stuff does make it go faster oh i don't know if we can do 6.3 all core six points all core 6.2 that would be impressive so hot let's do your math do this what's up jay also the cpu is running at 6.4 gigahertz right now nice okay oh yeah it's a little unpredictable oh no the back of the monitor is all liquidy again oh balls oh my jesus it's very ergonomic now no more sharp corners i don't think that's whoa oh and it crash okay crashed and burned just like this segway to our sponsor ah north security if you keep up with the tech news you'll know that hackers
