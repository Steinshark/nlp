ladies and gentlemen welcome back to my road to gm series this is episode number three and in this series i am taking you through the trials and tribulations of somebody coming back to competitive over the board play the first two episodes of the series i did some game recaps this episode is very special because in this episode i actually filmed a live chess lesson with a grandmaster so first of all let me know your thoughts in the comments about how you like it obviously if this one doesn't get that many views cuz people just don't enjoy the content i won't upload stuff like this but this lesson is split into three parts in the first part i spoke to grandmaster artur nixon lvan grandmaster he has a channel as well and some courses out there i'll put them in the description and first we talked about my struggles and what he thinks i need to do better in the second part of the lesson we analyze games that i played so he gave me his hypothesis of why i suck as a chess player not exactly in those words and he showed me examples from my own games we will analyze those and in the end he gave me homework so i'm going to take you through solving chess positions and analyzing them and that's road to gm episode number three enjoy the openings they're not a problem to you because you are getting really good possessions with white and black against even very high rated opponents but it's what happens after that and i pinpointed the two big topics which maybe which of them can be dissected smaller the first one and the probably this is the big one is i don't think you pay enough attention on your opponent what he is going to do when we go through i can show you these examples is that i think that there's somewhere a problem right there right that at some point you are like very focused on what you want to do you have great ideas and then there's like some some big moment you you miss completely your opponent's response and everything goes downhill very quickly right after that yeah so there's been many games like this the second problem which is also a pretty big one but not as big as the first one is that very often you go for unnecessary complications yeah so let's say you got you get a great position and again i compiled the list of the games you have a great position but i think you you're a great artist lovey yeah so you you like you like playing really creative chest and sometimes at some moment it comes out at the wrong moment so these unnecessary complications i i think it's also holding you back i'm not sure you aware of that or not and sometimes i also felt that when you're were playing which you know again lebby maybe we can divide this in smaller topics i felt there's a lack of patience yeah so you're like you're starting and instead of maybe immediately instead of preparing things you're like immediately going at a opponent suddenly starts some crazy complications and i again accumulate a lot of games when you go down yeah very very quickly against gms so this is something i think you can absolutely fix i don't remember the the the the last couple years of games exactly right now because that's not what my brain has been focused on but i'm sure in analyzing those games and probably rewatching some of the recap videos that i myself recorded i definitely say and will remember things like i completely missed this move not even that i miscalculated but just completely missed ideas the problem for me is that i know some of this stuff and then i don't know what to do about it yeah but listen le i have to ask you you are about the gm title you are very serious about this right so this is not just content you mean yeah the the name of the series let's put it this way is content for now it's you know get back to 2350 and 2400 and then 2431 which is my peak and get a bit of confidence back because i've never in my life showed up to a tournament and thought i was going to lose every game and then that happened to me in new york when i scored like one of my worst results ever i like i remember preparing for the games and just thinking whatever i prepare i'm going to lose this game somehow and that's a very weird feeling like i never felt it in my life yeah i would like a little bit of confidence back and just to play and be focused and understand my opponents are also human and they suck just like me so the only only one who is stopping you it's you yeah so i i respectfully disagree to anybody who said it's impossible i mean it's totally doable the question is do you believe it yourself if you believe it then you're going to do it and i think what you need l desperately is the first gm norm that's what you need because everything else doesn't matter you need the first gm norm i can relate to this because when i was em but i wasn't playing chess for like seven nine years at at some point i decided to go back to chess and i didn't know if i can do it and i think also you don't know for sure i mean it's like you want to do it but you don't know for sure can you do it i mean nobody really knows for sure can you do it and and i was pushing very hard to go back at a competitive chess and when i got the first gm norm i knew it i'm going to do it yeah that's it i mean i didn't need nothing else i didn't need the ratings the norms i knew it i'm going to do it i'm going to do it because i am capable to play at this level and you already told me you were close before the first gm norm it's going to be really really hard once you get it it's only a matter of time yeah that's it's probably fair i imagine that this is going to require some sacrifices how much are you willing to sacrifice maybe you're going to somehow make it without a sacrifice yeah i mean sacrificing this this is the free time yeah yeah this is the time that you are doing something else yeah i guess it's impossible to persuade you to do less content and focus more on compet competitive chess but i think you're are going to get there at some point that maybe there are going to be moments when you want to focus more on your personal growth yeah and speaking about ways you can grow which is immediately where we got to the next topic i think you need practice it's not only it's not only these training sessions is it with me or anybody else with whac or somebody else i think you you need to practice all of this and i made a comparison how many games you have played in the past years how many games i have played let me just share it think that you are you are you should be playing more games when you are really seriously thinking about the gm title i don't think that you imed have to jump to 110 and i'm not sure that you can do this with all of your commitments to play 100 games a year but i think that finding the time to play to practice is very important and i think that it's a good idea that you are planning to play tournaments in a row so it's not like you play one tournament a month because very often it's a good idea to pay a play a streaks of tournaments let's say three four tournaments in a row couple of days faing between this is what i talk about saice so that's a little bit about what he noticed in my games themselves and naturally we jumped into analyzing some of the games do i still have your attention by the way you still interested is this exciting for you u this was like a 2hour lesson and this is kind of broken down into a 25 30 minute video so you understand i had to cut out a few things but this is basically what we trained i mean this game yeah this is this game i definitely remember i'm so sorry i'm showing you really tearing ap no no no it's it's it's good because like i need i'm not i i i don't think i'm good enough myself to go through these games and kind of like stick my own face into the that i did and then actually actively learn from it this entire game there was a sequence of moves that yeah i i was just missing his concepts and i i missed one chance and then i was regretting it and but i remember yeah i i this game i i very vaguely i mean obviously he just played g5 i can't remember what i what i did though yeah so here i'm not sure what happened i i tred to understand where was the mistake i think this was some hallucination because knight h7 again it's based on miscalculation there was nothing wrong with h takes on g5 and it's pretty obvious he's going to take with the knight knight takes on g5 yeah and then i mean is rook d4 just a free pawn exactly yeah just rook d4 because because in terms of the theory of calculation we we start with the forcing moves first always yeah we starting with forcy moves capture stretch checks i this is what i'm usually chanting to my students capture stretch checks capture stretch checks every single move so rook takes on d4 is a capture there's no e5 i just don't see how white continues he plays probably something like rook e3 which i imagine is what you didn't really like from here because rook h3 is a problem even though white's attack looks scary maybe you could argue i mean yeah is this still obvious by the way now that i'm looking at this is there still 95 yeah yeah exactly but but but i think that you still have a lot of good moves to consider and u on the top of the choices at least i have rook d5 if i if i see nothing else i play rook d5 and something like bishop f5 i'm very secure or may exactly yeah queen d6 so what about it yeah so knight f6 queen f6 there's nothing exactly one check you go to e7 but it's very easy to fall for ghosts and you not the first one not the last one yeah so we are always very much concerned about the opponent's attack that's why it's so much easier to attack not to defend because we tend to defend from every single threat the same is it a real threat is it illusory threat somebody said is never underestimate the resources of the defense and we tend to give too much credit for the attacking chances and let's say there's this position in general i mean i could pull up some similar examples from your games as well and you don't see any real threats it doesn't mean that your position is bad so if your opponent is unable to make something immediately like in one or two moves by definition your defensive resources increase that's how it works and even if you don't see it very often you can just base it on your logic how you treat chess i mean i don't see anything immediately here okay i i i'm of course i'm afraid of this knight on g5 but knight e5 i have queen d6 there's no rook h3 there's no nothing okay maybe he can play bishop h3 bishop c8 and rook h3 later but it costs time and my understanding of chess is is that if he is going to spend so much time on playing for example this bishop h3 bishop c8 and rook h3 but definition i'm gna find something g6 knight h5 this is something that you could not see from afar yeah but your logic says that if he is so slow with his ideas i'm gna find something also knight f4 knight f4 there was this yeah there was also this one moment wait yeah so you play knight h7 g g queen g3 i think you missed this check i was not really sure so there you go we already miss yes yes yes i i definitely missed it and i pun c7 yeah but but it's still okay for you you i know but i didn't think so i remember yeah like i i i was already spiraling completely queen c7 bishop d7 i think was the game yeah queen c7 bishop d7 rook e3 and with the today's mindset i guess what would you would want to do after you commit the first mistake this is where you take your five minut break and this is where i would step in and say ly take a five minute break and basically start the game from scratch again it's so incredibly easy to say there there's nothing more i can really say and and i think you got to find this you got you got to find the strength after you feel that you have committed this first mistake that you are not spiraling out of control by the way li you also notice one thing about your games so only the first 50 games there was one thing which i started to feel you have very few similar games okay maybe there's more yeah i don't see repetition of your plans it's like you're playing every single game it's like the one the only and i often can't compare it meaning i have played myself in certain systems hundreds of games games yeah and for example in the ati sicilians oh my goodness you wouldn't believe how many games i played in in certain lenning r dut games i i played oh my goodness gazillion games and somehow when i was going through your games i had trouble to get this feeling that you are repeating your played system so it felt like you're again like an artist yeah so every game you're like okay let's just let's just do this yeah this looks fun this looks interesting i mean let's see how it works but when we're talking about the result it's not a bad idea just repeat what you already have practiced maybe i have a wrong impression no no i think it's correct i think i put like somehow too much emphasis on playing something that i haven't played before i mean except in the caroan let's say i mean caran i'm i'm or french but yeah it's it's definitely an issue i i think i'm i i get a bit worried about people having some opening surprise for me so i i just make it a mindset like i need to play something to surprise them first and then you know then we'll figure it out but that again is probably the incorrect approach and i tend to not play the same opening or system repeatedly also because i don't play a lot so it's kind of what you said earlier i i don't yeah yeah maybe because i think this is what you might want to consider to change especially when going for the result and i i do stand to what i said i think your openings are completely fine and one of the biggest fears that in general players are afraid of we are afraid of what we don't know and for some reason we believe very often that our opponent might know more than we do which is rar i mean not rarely but not not very often the case yeah so i think it's fair to assume that you are the expert in the lines that you play you know it again we go back to the psychology what where what is this from he played it two years ago you should remember oh my yeah i maybe i've like blocked these games out of my i'm trying to i was white yep it's a pretty nice looking position yep justin lee is your opponent new york spring yeah that was round two or three run threee that's correct i won this game but it was a very stupid game it was yeah yeah very very entertaining game i i yeah yeah i recall something here i did i play rook d2 in the game no you played rook f1 and here i think i miscalculated bishop e2 probably something like this yeah yeah i'm curious what what it is that you missed here because the pawn is under attack and i assume that you you felt that this is this is simply impossible because i mean it's a pin again the the assumption is the matter of all screwups essentially mh and we we can't do this so we should be culating everything very carefully here so after bishop e2 again i see very quickly that knight e2 is nothing queen e2 the bishop on g2 is dropping rook f6 queen takes on g2 there's no threats your king by the way is a bit weakened i assume you thought that there's going to be some sort of a pin but yeah i don't know what happened here because after rook d2 e1 bishop f1 yeah yeah simply bishop f1 so i'm i'm not even sure how to how to explain this because when you're are playing rook f1 you are assuming that your opponent will want to obviously check can i take on e2 so if you're dropping the pawn on e2 you are like completely sure that this is not possible so this was some weird culation even though you won the game yeah so here yeah yeah i guess i mean i have no idea maybe i thought rook f e1 but then queen c4 is possible whereas rook d e1 queen c4 is not possible because of rook f6 and then somehow i was like oh he he he blundered so i quickly play rook e1 and then he takes on f1 and i go oh like that's the difference is that he i think that's probably what i missed because otherwise it doesn't make any sense that if i move my f rook it it no longer attacks the knight on f6 so i was like okay rook rook d1 and then i forgot that he can take on f1 because maybe maybe you know one more thing i can advise to you whenever let's say you're planning something and your opponent does play it anyway let's say you think this is a mistake and your opponent does anyway you always assume maybe i'm wrong and i i have done this mistake sometimes myself as well it's like oh yeah but you're blundering right rook rook e one that's it your your queen is pinned and you're losing something but it's a good idea to slow down at this moment especially when your opponent has played something that you didn't expect because maybe this is the classical two mistakes in the row you have just committed the first mistake and maybe you can still fix this maybe this position is not so bad because after rook e1 you are entering this position which is probably pretty bad yeah and there's there's no way going away from this and if you realize oh my goodness i actually missed this f one maybe you can limit the damage here still can i i don't know i didn't check this i didn't check this i mean i think that you simply had an extra pawn now you gave it up i see some moves like bishop h3 i see moves like simple knight e2 and let's say a bishop move somewhere for example takes takes and some bishop move i mean this bishop c6 a move yeah can i can i do this i would i would want to stop here for a moment but probably i would first breathe for five minutes i would try to understand why my opponent is so stupid that he's blundering right now what i'm missing yeah what i'm missing why is it why is he doing this yeah so i yeah i i definitely i mean i completely didn't see bishop f1 i i even now i'm trying to calculate like rook d e1 queen g4 so maybe i convinced myself he blundered and then you know like i mean there's even rook e to bishop f3 very complex lines you're showing me there maybe oh i don't know i i i probably just convinc myself but this is winning i think i don't see anything but if that's forced then it's winning yeah no it's not rookie one check okay this will be a nice example of the calculation all the forcing moves captur stretch checks capt yes yes yes so yeah this is something we could talk about separately no no but i i remember yeah now that you pointed which is funny because i guess rook d2 is the best move in the beginning i asked did i play rook d2 i don't know if it's the best it is you're up aon yeah no r d2 e4 win but i think this is this is also one of those moments when you're lacking this patience yeah it's like let me finish off the opponent right now and somehow it it combines together with miscalculation yeah that that you miscate that you miss something from your opponent this impatience yeah so this is something that you can point point out that you tend to make these mistakes maybe you are losing the the so-called concentration by the way i can tell you this love because this is happening to me all the time especially in online blitz i'm playing online blits i get winning positions and i start not to care i literally don't care because i'm bored with those positions and i lose so many rating points because i'm bored and i cannot force myself to play this piece this position with an extra exchange extra piece for me the game is done that's it yeah so this is again is some sort of a psychological thing deep inside so i think that you for you it could be something similar you feel okay the game is already over although this is happening over the board let's just finish the guy immediately boom there's a blunder yeah no i will say for me may maybe it's that i but yeah specifically in these title tuesday games it's it's not i don't think it's that emotion it's the emotion of like oh here we go don't screw another one up you know and i freeze a little bit when i should just play i mean i i watch hikaru have two minutes up against people in a plus five position and win when he's losing so is unfortunately a pretty bad example because we what we don't see is his amazing work he has input before and he's playing bullet everybody's looking at him the guy plays bullet i can play bullet as well yeah yeah it's something by the way i think that you can also improve one of your one of your drawbacks one of the things that you can improve is the the defense how you are holding on because for you as i already said at the very beginning you you're when you get in trouble that's it yeah very quickly we're out of here let's get out of here but you can hold on to those games and after committing this very first mistake that you find the strength willpower and not to give up yeah and and keep fighting because very often after this first mistake the game is not lost by the way the typical excuse for many players is after they commit the first mistake oh i very quickly make the second mistake they they lose they say i was losing anyway yeah i was losing anyway what do you want what do you want from me no you're not losing but it's the mind which says that you are losing and the mind does a lot of terrible things those were two out of a few examples that we did and then we were out of time we discussed a little bit about openings i can't really show that in these videos because if my future opponents were privy to the discussions of what openings i'm going to play that would be a major advantage right that would be like filming teams practices or things like that that sometimes happen in sports allegedly so instead of giving you that footage i'm going to give you footage of me solving positions that he gave me training positions from some of my own games and he prompted me with certain decisions to make what's up nerds welcome to chess homework number one in the road to gm i will likely be uploading this portion alongside my very first chess lesson video with arur nixon's lvan grandmaster it's currently 11 o' at night i actually just finished the very long day but i'm feeling fresh because i took a nap and i also just ran a mile with my wife so feeling pretty good the way this is going to work is i'm going to read the prompts of every single position grandmaster nians sensei nix son if you will has chosen examples from my own games i believe just like the first chess lesson we went through a lot of my old games and he gave me prompts and i'm going to spend about 5 minutes analyzing each position i will fast forward so you don't have to sit there and suffer and then i will explain my thought process and we will see if if i was correct all right this one sucks like this is not a particularly pleasant position so the things i considered here the very first thing i considered was the move h6 and the point is that of course if white takes i just go here if white goes back then i'm very happy because then i can just play knight b6 and if white goes here i thought about g5 to push the bishop out trade it and then play knight here and then i thought i just develop you know my bishop and i'm fine i rejected this because of the move rook to e7 and i couldn't find a good solution for this where now it's very difficult to move like if rook to e8 there's bishop f7 or rook f7 knight d five i mean you know even something like this looks very bad because i don't know how i'm going to defend this pawn and white's second rook is going to come in and i'm happy to note that it's it's plus one here so i thought about h6 and i rejected it because of that so i i'm not going h6 then i thought just to play knight b6 you know and basically say look guy if you want to take here great and i rejected this first of all because this kind of looks really bad and knight takes f6 looks like a problem bishop b7 knight c5 i didn't like that very much and i also just didn't really like knight e5 as well so i decided not to play knight b6 then i was really confused because i just thought the position was bad so i started calculating the move rook to e8 and rookie eight looks promising actually i calculated here various things like rook takes e8 knight takes e8 you know rook e one and then playing something like king to f8 to try to protect but i think i ultimately settled on this move and the simple idea here is that everything is defended and if white plays knight e5 i'll play bishop 2 e6 and in my mind i calculated takes takes knight c4 is a discovered attack and i can even play king f7 and i thought i'm not worse so probably i would play rook to e8 but now that i'm here maybe you know d5 is a little bit scary maybe knight b6 is the way to go because rook e8 does feel a bit slow but i thought anytime white plays d5 i can maybe i can maybe bet trade and and and you know play knight to c5 or something like for example maybe even now and if bishop takes f6 rook e1 rook e1 gf i mean now that i'm looking at this this does not look particularly thrilling to defend now that i'm here although i still don't really see a way that white is going to punish me but yes this this does look a bit unpleasant this move d5 is something that i have to but i can probably trade even something kind of like king f8 i mean it's it's not you know it's not pretty but maybe it does the trick so i would play rook e8 after 5 minutes of thought and let's see what what the way to go is it seems like instead of rookie eight straight away the computer wants h6 first and then rook e 8 which is very interesting i guess so that the move g5 is always possible is it because rookie d5 no it's takes takes oh knight g5 oh that's bad oh that's real bad but it's not even that it's actually if knight g5 i have rook f8 it's actually trade trade i just stopped the thought here and i completely miss knight g5 oh that bad bad bad bad bad that is bad i looked at rookie 8 i calculated all those lines and it's h6 with rookie 8 that is the key idea h6 followed by rook to e8 and knight b6 is bad because of what because of takes takes knight e4 bishop e7 i thought knight c5 yeah okay i mean at least one thing i calculated correctly but h6 rookie 8 is the is the is the key is the key that one i got wrong for sure because i calculated rookie eight and that is just a bad move after takes takes takes takes and now knight g5 which somehow yeah somehow this move completely escaped and i'm just the pawn down okay that one i got wrong this is the game in spice cup against jonathan chen young player also small edit the coordinates were wrong the first time i think white was on seven8 small d but then the pieces moov the other way so this was a game that i played over the board in st louis in 2021 and in that game i actually repeated the position once i went back and thought my opponent was going to go here but then the game took a different turn so the first thought i had was bishop to b4 which i quickly rejected as you can see because of the move knight to e4 and the point is that if we trade bishops you know my opponent is going to get the knight to d6 and i'm i'm going to be in some trouble here so i didn't play and let's just let's just remove this so i didn't play that because i i i understood that you know the move knight to e4 is a problem which led me then to consider taking the knight which seemed quite unnatural and then the move b4 and the move b4 i would play so that i could then you know make more progress in the position and and and try to get these two moves going so i calculated b4 knight e4 and then something like knight d7 followed by c5 i didn't i mean i i didn't see a clear reason not to do this and the computer just disagrees with me completely and says this is wrong i didn't see a clear reason not to go for this but i simply decided that allowing the knight to be on e4 was bad it was just not a good thing for me so then i was like why don't i trade and the point is very simple if my opponent trades the queen then i will trade the queen and i will play c5 and i'm probably just better with black the computer agrees so then i thought what about bishop takes and so i very quickly calculated i would play b4 i would play c5 and i'm not worse i mean i'm just not worse i'm going to play play bishop b7 i'm going to castle i put my knight out computer agrees computer slightly prefers bishop b4 it just thinks this is kind of like a game killer it thinks that you know just an equal position and last but not least against this move i was calculating for a little while and i decided that there was nothing wrong with c5 i mean i thought about bishop e7 it looked a little silly to do this and and you don't need to get out of the way you can just play c5 and i i calculated a few lines after c5 namely i calculated c4 and i i actually decided that i i liked both retreating and not retreating i also briefly calculated b4 but basically you can take the pawn because the queen is also hanging and so queen c4 i thought i mean i can even go back and i can you know i'm going to go here and maybe even play c4 myself so for example bishop here i can play bishop d5 and maybe even push but i don't have to do that so bc c5 and i i looked at a lot of lines i looked at b4 there's this funny line d5 takes takes c4 and you know i try to win the pawn back but there's no reason to even play any of these moves you can just so i'm happy that i in this one i came to the right decision the right decision is i should probably trade because allowing the knight to stay there is just bad i didn't think it was s worthy of bad like i thought i could go c5 and maybe i'll figure it out the engine is not convinced it does not believe in my position so i mean i i didn't see like a gigantic difference but i guess it is quite a big difference but you you you should take the knight on c3 and and i was correct my my hypothesis to trade the knight and basically push quickly c5 is the way that black should play in this position so i'm glad to end on a good note i calculated knight c3 i i evaluated accurately i played c5 and i didn't miss really anything from the opponent's side hi it's me again if you made it this far in the video i just want to say thank you really seriously sincerely maybe you just skipped here because you're just curious about you know what's what what's at the end at the end i praise people who watch the whole video so if you haven't watched the whole video you bozo certified fda certified bozo go watch the
