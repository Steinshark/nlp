ladies and gentlemen chess is hard and it's so hard that on this channel i created a playlist called how to lose at chess where i take some of the best games that have been sent into me by viewers by subscribers you should be a subscriber if you're a viewer by the way you know just look down see if you've clicked it or not and some of these games are just absolutely catastrophic it like you you folks managed to do things on the chessboard that i never thought were possible and every single time you send me in a game to the how to lose a chess playlist it just gets better and better and today's video was no exception in today's video we have the equivalent of the hunger games it's 600 elo chess we've got kings making mad dashes all over the board and the beautiful thing about showing a game like this to all of you is there's still so much you can learn while also hysterically laughing and crying like if if your stomach doesn't hurt at the end of this game not because of the taco bell that you ate but because of the game you know if you're not laughing that hard then i failed so without further ado let's check out this game that was sent in to me this is a game between yamda and link rated 600 and the game begins with the move d4 and we have a dutch defense now i don't recommend the dutch to beginners i don't recommend the dutch to beginners because your king gets very weak dutch is an opening that's a little bit better for intermediate players and actually i have a just kidding i'm not gonna fake promote any con i i'm going to make a course on the dutch for intermediate players but i i haven't done that yet now one of the best ways to play against the dutch defense is the staunton gambit which is just gambiting a pawn but getting very quick development with knight c3 bishop comes out but white plays bush before white is a london player okay now you you wouldn't necessarily correlate a london chess game with excitement for all london is boring oh london no no no no no no no no so knight f6 just developing a night life is good e3 developing the bishop the night the night right now black plays g6 so black is playing the leningrad dutch i don't think black knows that black is just trying to put the bishop on g7 in castle build a little fiancetto for the bishop white plays knight d2 now bishop g7 and here white does something absolutely just genius okay absolutely genius if you're wondering why their time is like above five minutes because they're playing five five every time they make a move they gain time i think they're playing five five they are playing five five white does something genius of course if you're in the opening you want to play c3 bishop d3 knight f3 but white does something here by the way this is mini lesson number one white does something here called adjusting to what they see and they're not just pre-moving the moves of the opening they're not just going like they're they're going wait a minute this king could be opened up with the move h4 this is brilliant brilliant move and the point is that white wants to go h5 and sacrifice to attack the king and castling doesn't really prevent white's idea it just makes it a bit more risky white just goes h5 and then sacks the rook just sacks the rook to infiltrate with the queen does white have any decisive attack no in fact white is down two points of material but look at the evo the computer actually thinks that white is doing very well the reason for that is white's gonna back up castle long and started an attack on the h file this is fantastic stuff this is one of the reasons i don't recommend the dutch to beginner players because it's very tough to deal with and against the good well-prepared opponent like they're gonna do stuff like this i mean this is really really sophisticated stuff against the dutch and if anybody wants to learn a good weapon against the dutch defense specifically the leningrad look at this you got this h-pond stuff to open up the h file and this is this is potentially bad news now i love black's next move this is a very sophisticated move queen e8 because when you see that your opponent is gonna try to attack you what is your opponent's most powerful piece it's the queen so why not trade the queen look at the evil go go all the way down to black's favorite one trade but it's an equal trade right no queen e8 white has advantages point five point six if white backs up now in the game white plays bishop c4 check not a bad move at all bishop c4 check is a very reasonable move black canal block the check or move the king blocking in this case is better because you can also build up a wall in the center but black plays king h8 and now white avoids a queen trade by bringing the queen back and why does white just has a better position why does white have a better position because despite being down material white's pieces are way more useful the utility value of two knights and two bishops is significantly higher than the value of a rook and and these other pieces which haven't moved at all because the rook is an end game piece and you know white just has very clear attacking possibilities so here comes knight c6 and what black needs to do now is build in the center if you can you should build in the center everything happens from the center okay it's like best example i can give you a big city all right you travel in a big city you get access to anything all right restaurants shows a bunch of different cultures nationalities cuisines all right like you you're at the crossroads of everything new york tokyo singapore a lot of other big cities all right i was gonna say los angeles but you know new york over la so you got to be in the center i don't like what black does here black plays b6 now you'll notice the eval skyrockets what how can the evaluation skyrocket off of a mistake like what what does that even do what where's the blunder well it has nothing to do with this you see folks as you get better at chess you're gonna realize not all moves are just like the same i mean the move b6 is not you're not blundering a rook or a queen it's the fact that you're not addressing the demands of the position and the demands of the position are as such you gotta attack the center you gotta fight back because what does white want white one's this well you can interrupt that like you can maybe push back fight back against your opponent all right by playing a move b6 you're not fighting back and now white can very easily play a night move and rook h1 and that's exactly what white did white developed tonight of course i don't like knight e2 you should go to the center but after bishop b7 rook h1 white is just crushing i mean white has played a breathtaking game of chess alright and unfortunately black plays h6 doesn't guard and just allows this and that's it the game is over but the game is not over because if the game really was over this would never be a youtube video buckle up if you're still here get ready for the ride of your life bishop takes h6 and the game is lost i mean the game is all but lost bishop h6 queen h6 is mate any backwards bishop move is also made the only way that black can survive here is by giving up the bishop and then blocking this and even then you will lose in a matter of moves so queen g6 is what black plays and now white needs to back up white does not need to take if you take the king takes and actually the king is safe that's exactly what white does white gets a bit of tunnel vision just because you went in once doesn't mean you got to go in a second time all right bishop g5 bishop f4 well in some cases it does but not in this case in this case bishop takes g7 is wrong because actually the black king gets the safety and not only does the black king get to safety black now can actually fight back on the h file which is nuts all right like it could go from bad to worse here white plays knight f3 and by a miracle of god is not completely lost i mean it looks like white is just losing here queen g3 rook h1 right well as it turns out white can actually use the knight defensively but the thing about this move is it's not just defensive it's also offensive why is it offensive you're attacking the queen right you're actually attacking the queen and the computer here thinks that this is the best move giving up the queen taking this queen losing the rook and taking this and just being down upon like the computer literally sees nothing better and black being 600 here also doesn't see anything better and we all know that when the position is nice and close you can always rely on a 600 level player to throw everything in the garbage and now black is completely lost again okay black is completely lost black is completely lost because black has offered a trade of queens forgetting that that is defended by the pawn and that knight can take the pawn with check knight takes f5 is check and now the only solution that black has here is to take the knight lose the queen but take the rook boom boom check game goes on is black lost unquestionably but the game goes on so knight takes up five now your options okay sack the queen and get a rook at a knight or move the king and lose immediately now you guys are probably thinking oh he's setting us up i mean obviously the king is gonna move right no actually in this position black nope yeah black lost the game on the spot queen g4 and that's it that's it the king is out queen g7 is making a couple moves king's out in the open these pieces are useless the rook hits nothing rook hate and there is m on the eval bar there is no sign of life for black queen to g7 is game over because after here you have knight to g3 mate you also have a variety of other mates i mean you have probably g4 king e4 and about 700 different ways to mate as long as you don't let the king come here but instead white plays the move knight back to g3 is that a blunder no it attacks the rook this is the thing that's a thing you can you don't always have to give mate you could just eat all the pieces black plays rook h2 and now 94 is made in one clean mate and considering that you just moved the knight there you would think that knight e4 is a natural follow-up but okay queen f5 king g7 queen f7 king h6 knight f5 king g4 f4 king g4 it's mate in one you gave all the necessary checks folks you know what they say you know what they say when you have mate in one look for better this is mate in one but this is a force mate m5 because this is queen g6 mate king cannot come forward queen g6 everything is cut off game on okay fine it's not made in one you accidentally blunder the knight you blunder the night but it's fine because you have another night remember how a couple of moves ago night move was made well you just lost the knight so you might as well go knight g3 the king has no legal moves actually after knight g3 knight g3's game over and white played knight to okay bishop d3 fine king is on e6 check king is out in the open the king now officially has zero legal moves if you give a check in this position chances are it's made chances are it's made if you give a check you could give a check with the knight you can give a check with the pawn you can give a check with the pawn pawn pawn knight all mate kings got absolutely no legal moves literally none and here white successfully managed to not only avoid mating the king okay not only avoid mating the king in one in this position white managed to completely remove the letter m from the evaluation okay completely remove it because now the king can sneak in over here and if you think that that is exactly what is happening in this game you are right but of course black is a lunatic and does this okay now probably an m will appear on the evaluation board because check and instead of running into the position now a3 can probably lead to a checkmate queen f5 king to b4 and an m has reappeared and m has reappeared because actually queen b5 king a3 the king can come help is that above the pay grade for this level oh ten thousand percent so that does not happen c3 is played and there we go folks the king has now escaped the king made it from f6 all the way to g7 h6 g5 g4 f5 e6 d5 it's made a million different ways c4 b5 a5 b4 a3 i got news for you there are now no more checks well there are two checks but they both lose the queen and the black king now instead of moving any of the other pieces black takes the pawn not needed but for good measure and white plays b4 and white play and black plays rook to g2 trying to set up a battery now you may notice that queen to d5 wins a rook you're right queen g2 that's just the fork all right rook to g2 now you guys are probably thinking well that would black's gonna win i know how this goes i've seen this a million times no you haven't you you the white's position is still completely solid all right white just hasn't been able to mate that's okay queen f7 check king a3 queen just all right now here come the rooks here come the rooks okay but there's still no threat the queen g4 attacking the pawn on e6 now here black has to find rookie 2 bishop e2 and utilize the pin with bishop a6 i mean that's not findable black of course plays e6 now white in this position is still winning because this blockade is so strong the queen can still get in and you know you can still take everything and you're obviously still winning the only thing that white has to do in this position is just make sure the knight stays protected by the bishop is a great piece you just don't want to move the bishop right because if you move the bishop then i'm gonna take the knight on e2 so naturally white moves the bishop and hangs the knight on e2 and is now completely lost so white probably had about you know 10 different mates fumbled and not only did not deliver a mate and now is just in a regular winning position white is now lost okay well white did in this game was basically have a person interested in them on multiple dates who made multiple suggestive statements that they would like to pursue something and instead decided to go back to their room and i don't know play etch a sketch or whatever the kids do nowadays vape whatever all right don't do that bad for you i do i don't know okay king to d3 and now now it's made for oh my god how does this happen constantly have the same story in all of these videos the amount of mates that were on the board for white is is sickening it is sickening and now black just wins black wins because black plays rook to teach it's not even complicated king to c4 and that's it the game is over the game is over you just give a check the only legal move and now knight to a5 that's it the king is just absolutely made it and and black does it in a slightly different way here but black still finds the checkmate king to c4 and [music] oh yeah of course the white king has walked out all the way so instead of checking it multiple all right fine rook f2 rook f2 sounds good minus'. queen to d1 black does not get oh oh black founded b5 oh my god oh my god knight a5 check we just went over this knight a5 king to d3 it's not made but it will be bishop b5 i mean it's it's oh my god b5 wait what oh no oh no king takes b5 oh my god oh my god 97 what is going on what is going on queen to c1 check king to a2 bishop the king could have just gone to the corner the black king could have made it to the white corner and lost by the way because of bishop d3 bishop c4 but that would have never happened this should be one check king to b3 the position is equal this is an equal position how is the sequel c4 now black plays c6 the white king's gone running the white king has now made it to the opposite end of the board these two kings never interacted and they managed to cross over the opponent's territory knight to f5 and now white says i have no idea what to do bishop takes pawn takes and now king oh my god how much longer is this game gonna go on this is now a queen and rook end game huh well the good news is that now you know the king is going to feast on pawns black is gonna feast on pawns i don't know what's gonna happen rook to c2 queen b1 check king takes and in this position black played the move queen takes b6 and queen takes b6 was in fact a free pawn but because the rooks are standing together on the second line they can check and they can pin the queen to the king and in terms of a cruel fate white needed to sneak around to eat the pawns but by taking one white opened up the lines and lost their queen and the rest of the game is straightforward my friends as black took the pawn took the pawn took the pawn and in this position devastated and gutted white resigned now did white resign correctly no i don't think white should have resigned i think i think white should have went here and hoped for this because i got news for you i'm not sure black would have checkmated with the king in a rook in 25 seconds on the clock but we'll never know folks this was a game and a half the black king was violently hunted out of his kingdom made to run circles in the woods multiple checkmates in one snuck into the opponent's territory white still held on to an advantage only to throw it all away and the king for white now made a walk of shame out as well it was mate multiple times they snuck into their opponent's back rank and unfortunately it was the perseverance of the two rooks on the second rank that created an unbreakable bond and impenetrable fortress and it was on move 58. that white resigned what a game what a game what a game that was amazing that was sensational thank you for joining me on this journey now get out of here
