does your breath smell like bacon after you brush your teeth are you still considering which album will influence your fourth nickelback tattoo is your favorite james bond played by pierce brosnan if you answered yes to any of these questions there's something seriously wrong with you but if your answer to the question is are you a doesn't take no from nobody well then i've got the car for you beside me is the mercedes g wagon and it's 140 000 of bad dude bravado and it's ready to take you from wherever you are now to wherever you want to end up i'm looking at you tom get off your phone and get back to work so how do i know this is the baddest vehicle on the road made for bad boys like myself who frequent the gym who eat raw hamburger meat for breakfast and who watches sports on tv where people get long-term brain damage from frequent concussions in exchange for short-term capital gains well i've got 10 reasons for you and you're not going to like them because you're about to open up your wallets and spend everything you've got to land one of these in your driveway and take out a massive loan because it's 140 000 the first thing you need to understand is that this engine uses nano slide technology which means this vehicle is great for the environment mercedes estimates these spray-on cylinder liners save 10 million gallons of water a thousand tons of iron and 4 000 goldfish a year versus cast iron sleeves and two of those facts are actually true plus there's a button with a green light it's almost enough to make up for the fact that my diet consists entirely of steak and that i drive 140 000 safe deposit box which gets 14 miles per gallon on the highway reason number two multi-spark ignition what yep these spark plugs can fire up to 4 times for every power stroke and you're asking why do you need to fire a spark plug more than once and i'm asking would you rather have four pieces of bacon on your cereal in the morning or one piece of bacon glad we're on the same page reason number three hot inside v the two turbo chargers are tucked inside the v of the engine that keeps the hot stuff near the hot stuff and it keeps the hot stuff away from the cold stuff i know i'm an incredible professor you may just want to pause and reflect on the knowledge you've just learned reason number four side pipe exhausts which cause dust to kick up as you're driving through dirty areas which makes you look cool plus when you rev the engine the whole car will lean from the torque the sound reminds you you are a man despite how much you had to spend to prove it number five this bad boy is rocking four wheels which is great because you need wheels to get places number six is simple step inside and listen to the satisfying sound of shutting the door after all if what you're driving looks like a bank vault it might as well sound like a bank vault which brings me to number seven if the car looks like a bank vault if the doors close like a bank vault well then it better lock like a bank vault which it does listen to that have i said bank vault yet number eight is the windshield which is all up in your face that makes it easier for passerbys to check you out from outside the vehicle because what's the point of going to the gym so much if nobody can see your gains number nine is the color scheme this leather is called saddle brown so gather around and settle down because this here's the story of saddle brown there is no story the interior's brown the exterior is brown if you're a man you know that's the only acceptable car color and finally we get to number 10 not only does this vehicle have a locking differential but it has another one and it has one more now i did the math and it turns out that adds up to three locking differentials i know good looks and great arithmetic the point is that with these three locking differentials if someone spills canola oil in the grocery store parking lot you're still going to have enough traction to get home so what are you waiting for quit strumming that guitar that you don't know how to play or looking in the mirror and wishing you had chest hair and get on over the benz dealer and get yourself a g okay but for real this thing is awesome
