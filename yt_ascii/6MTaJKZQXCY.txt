this week has been crazy in the tech world there have been so many updates from big tech making changes ai monitoring you while you work have you heard about this and so many other things we are going to be covering today before we get into it though make sure to hit that subscribe button for more tech coding career tech news you know all the all the good stuff and leave in the comments any other videos topics you want me to make all right let's dive into this week's biggest news in town [music] foreign [music] really blew my mind but it really shouldn't at the end of the day have you seen this article that came out it was by ibm and it was actually a report they released and it says in ibm executives surveyed estimated that 40 of the workforce will need to reskill as a result of implementing ai 40 of workers will need to reskill because of ai now when i first read this and i saw headings on social media i think the immediate reaction especially on social media was really trying to drive fear around people and the loss of jobs that would come from this but when you really take a minute and dive into this report and what it means it's not as though ai is going to take over your job but you will need to continue to reskill and i mean we talk about this all the time on videos on here as how important it is to continue to build up new skills but now more than ever is a time to do so whether it's through taking a course online going into your local even your local college if you prefer in person what whatever the case is reskill upskill you get the point forty percent though it's pretty wild oh and i didn't mention this is within the next three years this isn't 10 years from now even five years from now this is within three years i'm curious to hear though has ai already impacted your job do you use ai in your job is this the future of how work will track you this video was released and i found it super interesting to see how it made me feel first of all okay check it out give us a watch how does this make you feel what is happening here that you are seeing is it is using computer vision to track how the employees are working how fast they are working how many cups of coffee they can pour how quickly all of that what does that create though for work culture on one hand it's you know great because of people who are working will you know working really hard will get rewarded but on the other hand is it creating this hustle culture that we have worked so hard to really get away from and also to what happens if you check your phone what happens if you take a little too long of a bathroom break or too long of a break like point being where does it stop if these rules are implemented there was another video circulating with computer vision as well and this one was more around your posture and i found this one really interesting because at first i was like this is great i love this i would definitely want work to implement this and use it where okay let's put up on screen here so you can see what's happening right now is it will go red if someone has bad posture and then if they correct their posture it will go green i shared both of these clips on my social media and the response was so interesting on one side people were all for this they were similar to myself when i saw this video they were thinking this is really interesting this could be really good and help with health effects and the other side was like if my employer is monitoring anything other than the bare minimum of what they should be i'm out which brings up the question where is the line of what your employer can monitor and who decides that is it your country's government is it your employer do us as employees have to put our foot down at some point curious to hear your thoughts on this coming in at number three for this past week's biggest tech news is around apple did you hear the announcement i was so pumped when i heard it so on tuesday they announced that they will be sending out or they were sorry sending out press invites for the morning of september 12th that is when this big event will take place and this is going to be an in-person event at the steve jobs theater inside apple park this is going to be massive i'm sure you've heard or seen the rumors of what is going to be announced specifically around the iphone 15. this is apparently going to be the biggest iphone drop in a long time with new features and i'm pretty excited about here are some things that the iphone 15 is rumored to have one being that it will bring significant upgrades to colors so new colors better battery performance and a switch this is the biggest update in my opinion a switch from apple's proprietary lightning connector to the usbc which would bring faster charging and then also to improve camera capabilities so there's a lot packed into there now when i heard that they were releasing a new iphone before i heard the new features i was like there's i don't need a new one and i think that's how a lot of apple users have been feeling they're happy with whatever iphone they have and they're not looking to upgrade and we've seen that you know a lot of news actually on this that the reports of iphone people buying the new iphones right as they come out has really significantly dropped so there's no surprise that they felt this pressure that for this next iphone release it needs to be pretty significant then i was thinking okay this is great i want to get the iphone 15. i want to see all these new upgrades but then i'm kind of like you know what i don't know if i want to be one of the first ones to get the iphone 15 with this new charging port because a lot of times when you're traveling with your friends or family now what's going to happen is if they don't have that port if they don't have the usbc iphone 15 you're not going to have a charger if you forgot yours so i'm on the fence about that curious to hear your thoughts so this next one is pretty wild probably the wildest thing to come out of tech news this week i feel like i say that for everything we talked about but i don't know this is this is next level okay what is it tech billionaires are planning to build a california city from scratch let me explain let's take a step back on this one it's pretty wild so who are these investors well it's an elite group this is what they keep on saying in the articles it's an elite group of tech executives tech founders you know the whole big tech thing but some other tech entrepreneurs and investors that recently joined include linkedin founder reed hoffman stripe co-founders patrick and john collision billionaire and philanthropist lauren powell jobs and moritz of sequoia capital so we got some big money behind us here and what what is going on all these tech billionaires just got together and we're like let's build our own city screw the cities that already exist it's pretty wild it's actually called they're being called a utopia they're saying it would be as walkable as paris and create tens of thousands of jobs which of course are saying that and maybe that will be the case but they have to say that in order to really sell the community or cities around this this area about it so here's more about the land they bought up so they spent 800 million 800 million to scoop up this land it's in solano county and the hope is to transform it into a city so right now it's not zoned to do so they've been fighting i believe in the courts or starting to to get this approved that they can actually start building on this land and building the city and may i remind you this area where they are building is desert it is flat it is dry it's not like this lush green area to build on they're starting from nothing which i guess if you're a tech billionaire is your last problem residents though that live around this area are very angry i'm reading in the los angeles times actually and what they say about it is some of the things the residents are worried about is what is going to happen to you know they have tons of livestock around this area what's going to happen to the livestock what's going to happen to their quality of life if this massive city is just like plunked in the mid middle and then surrounding areas they'll be affected and what does that mean for the cost of living it impacts so many people i'm really curious to see if this gets approved and if so how this all unfolds and i'm even more curious to see how people will react to this would you want to move to a tech billionaire city to other small things but big things that i want to update you on one is google just launched watermarks for ai generated images this is a huge step in the direction of being able to have some guidelines or some restrictions around ai up until now it's really been the wild west with ai generated images check out my latest thumbnails or ai generated content not knowing what is real and what is false obviously something like images a lot of times you do know is ai generated i mean for my own thumbnails i always encourage like i'm like yes this is ai generated very obvious for the ones that are anyways and it's a fun way to to make content but i do think it's a really good idea to start labeling what is real and what is ai generated especially when we get more into deep fakes and what that means in various industries last on the list is i just found this really interesting which is computer scientists develop open source tool for dramatically speeding up programming language python i found this really interesting because one of the issues that i've heard over and over again using python in production is a lot of times they're notoriously slow actually it says here in this article it is 60 000 times slower than code written in other programming languages so a team of computer scientists at the university of massachusetts recently unveiled a prize-winning python profiler called scaling now this is pretty interesting so what essentially we'll do is scaling will identify where python is having trouble in keeping up the areas in the code that python is having a bit of trouble then it uses ai to leverage the same technology actually that is used in chat gpt to suggest ways to optimize individual lines or even groupings of the code so really how to refactor or reformat the code and refactor the code in a better way that will make it run more efficiently now i found this quote from the founders really interesting he said computers are no longer getting faster future improvements in speed will come less from better hardware and more from faster more efficient programming i thought that was really interesting and thought provoking and it is true i think as programmers a lot of times we kind of take for granted we think a lot too late oftentimes about how to code efficiently or maybe it's just myself and you just start coding in the way that you are comfortable with in turn you're like ah this could have been done in a better way to really speed things up so very interesting all right that is the top five well in this case six biggest things to happen in tech this past week if you haven't already hit that subscribe button and i'll see you all soon thanks everyone [music]
