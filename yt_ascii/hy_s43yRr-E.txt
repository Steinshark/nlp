now about once every 3 months i usually get a nice jonathan blow video in because it tends to make everybody angry and there's usually some pretty good points to talk about so i hope everybody's excited about this have any idea why game developers put up with the mess that is openl vulcan metal direct x12 and all the problems with day one drivers you know i i i i don't even have time to let him cook before i have something to say that you know what just came out of his mouth just goes to show i swear is there is is there like a simple development environment is there one that exists is there is there just one that is there any development environment ever that exists that it's just simple c webpack oh okay roblock it's just interesting because even something like game development i mean he is right there's like even that opening thing that that question with the opening statement which just has so many different possibilities like the the the the the the minor differences between shader languages and all that just it it gets so painful and then when it gets to when it gets to the actual like the actual graphics language or libraries those are also wof w the problem is at the end of the day that if you're a game programmer your job is to make a good game right loved it i loved everything he had to say about it and in the old days when games were smaller and the underlying systems were simpler it meant you could work with the system more directly and tweak things and reimplement things right now everybody has to deal with such big and complicated systems they don't have any time to question things or think about changing them or even to understand the system they're working with really like nobody does or a few people do so isn't it funny how much of this exact argument he's making right now is is you could you could you could swap the word game development out for web development it's just kind of interesting like well i mean even judo even back end like how many people how many people have more microservices than customers right like there's people that that they they they have like seven different services and everything they set up before they even have a single customer they don't even know if the thing works and they have the world's most scalable system just throw that thing in a monolith like what are you doing thanks i'm hurt i'm sorry i didn't mean to anyways it's just interesting because you could almost replace exactly what he just said with anything at this point so like there just isn't time to [ __ ] do anything thing because we're drowning in dealing with all this stuff so for somebody like me to take all this time and say i'm going to spend half my time working on this programming language oh dude my cake has a trijicon sro on it for some reason because i shove hell yeah hell yeah you know if your cake if your cake doesn't come with a sight i'm just saying your cake your cake's not that good okay oh oh you like red velvet that velvet better better come with a revolver site okay i want a red revolver i there's something i did want to circle back to it i was hoping he was going to jump on it his very initial line where he said that your job is to make a game and make a good game i think there's something really insightful there and it's something that i just have been feeling a lot lately which is i i keep i feel like i keep saying this and i i feel like this is something that zoomers specifically and some millennials really need to hear and i'm going to say this very gently okay nobody cares how hard you worked people only care what the outcome is if there's some dude at your company that does what somebody else does in 40 hours in 1 hour ain't nobody caring you don't know what he does he works remote you have no clue what's happening he just goes out and he works and he comes back and he did everything every other people are doing maybe he's doing it in one hour maybe he's doing it in 100 hours people just don't care how hard you work cuz at the end of the day if you don't deliver anything if you don't make a good game if you don't make a good website if you don't make any of those things then it doesn't matter that you worked really hard i know that i know that's like a really unpopular opinion you're saying it matters to you well guess what you don't matter i don't matter like it doesn't matter that i like what you build bu at the end of the day you will get fired not because someone thinks oh wow he's a really hard worker just can't quite you know no one's going to dude what company would be like well we're going to keep on that really hard worker that doesn't really deliver like like no one no one's going to keep that person on right and it's sad i mean of course i'd like the person that's that's working hard i like that person i'm happy with that person i'm happy that that happens but hard work alone doesn't doesn't get you what you want you have to make something good oh i like this asmin gold take okay this is not an asmin gold take okay first off this is a my take but yes i think asmin says something along the along the lines of something similar esque it yeah okay it's just very unusual because nobody feels like they have the time and the observation that i made back back in 20 dude shut up it's how how long have i been saying this for how many years do i have to say this before i before it's my take you can't just just because a man says it a few weeks ago doesn't make it not my take you shut up 14 a long ass time ago that made me want to start down this road was yes i'm drowning in all these problems but the reason i'm drowning in all these problems is the decisions we made in the past so we're just going to continue to drown in these problems ever more unless we start making decisions differently right when most people have not made decisions differently and things have been getting worse just like i thought they would and i mean covid also added to that to the point where we have these aaa games coming out that are obviously like barely anything happened so like the new battlefield the new cod the new overwatch like those games barely got worked on in real terms like lots of people spent lots of hours supposedly working on the game but most of those hours did not produce anything useful that hurts a little bit for a lot of people that's a there is a lot i mean get i mean game industry is is is is probably the most susceptible to this where hard work doesn't get you much but i mean dang dang that's rough i'll put myself over here so you can see jonathan blow part of that's work for home but part of it is just that's where we are today in terms of interesting do you think that's part do you think part of that is work from home i'm a little i i struggle a little bit on that one what makes work from home accent that issue you think so do you think it's more specific to game dev can someone ex can here here here digital digital hobo yo you said yes specifically in game dev hit me why why in game dev does work from home make things work or harder i don't know if that's true or not that's that's a hard one i that's a hard one i don't know if that's true hope i gotta see this yeah let's see okay hold on hold on because making something fun is very sensitive very small misunderstandings can ruin the fun in a game okay hey let the guy cook hey hey the there is okay there is there is some level of truth in that statement in the sense that i mean how many games have recently been released that are so close to being fun but they're just not fun they're they're close the day before was a scam the day before was clearly a scam pal world is fun ask thor no i'm sure thor i'm sure thor has a great take on this but it's it's just such an interesting it's just such an interesting thing i i really don't think remote has the play in it because i will say that the le dang it the problem is is my best ideas i've ever had have all come from in-person meetings i don't know what it is maybe it's just maybe that's just because that's how i grew up and maybe that's just just kind of like how that all happened where where i just kind of like i just accidentally had that kind of you know interaction perhaps it's a skill issue absolutely they weren't your ideas well yes they weren't our like they were out they were our ideas but there's something about the in-person working that i can definitely see that there's like some extra spark that i have of collaboration that's a little bit difficult to describe doesn't mentioned and it there's just something different you know and i i chat is so useless and i will say that i i get that and maybe that's what he means by that that remote work you lose just a little bit of that whatever that is and you know i've had some great i've had great meetings working like i've had great meetings being remote but i don't know if it's quite the same right i i don't know if it's quite quite the same i don't think it's a lack of eq causing a distant relationship and people use the abuse of power i i don't know i i i don't know if it's it's a lack of quote unquote eq i don't i i'd have to think about this more because i don't i don't there's always been something about work from home that i think there's some there's there's a fraction of people that can do pure remote work and they can do it well i've seen it happen i've seen people do a great job and they i know it happens okay wordpress whether you like it or not they literally have always been a remote company and they built something that every website used before web like when websites were horrifying to run and so they they've done it so i know it's possible i i'm just more curious is it is it is it a permanent thing that happens all the time is it is is the norm to be more successful or is it something that we look at where we think the norm should be more success you know like how often are humans just simply incorrect in their assumptions like how how often are you wrong about your assumptions where you're saying hey the world should operate like this and then the world just does not operate that way every day brother every day yeah i know it's just like could i be wrong i mean i i'm i'm totally willing to be wrong on the remote dev thing but in my head i think that the best form of communication is in person there's there's just things you can't get suck it i think inperson communication will be the most clear yeah shut up okay and then each type of hr meeting in 15 minutes hell yeah yeah dude i use windows for streaming shut up why don't you just shut up that's actually that's actually a meeting that's going to go off again here in a few more minutes to remind me that i have my weekly meeting with vim that is not a joke i literally on my work calendar have a i have a meeting called vim weekly to make sure that i consider anything that i need to fix shut up let's keep going our techn my thoughts don't need to continue at this point i think everyone kind i think any person here okay last thing about remote talk any person i don't believe any person that says they can have the same level of communication outside uh remotely as they can in person and what i mean by that is you just simply don't get body language and that's a huge thing you don't get body language you don't get the same level of communication that just simply exists now you can get like 96% of it right if you have people that are truly great at communicating you can get that tell that to my ex gosh people just so wild obviously text communication is is far below right i think we can all agree that it goes i i i i hope most of us can agree that it goes in person video text like text i do not feel is a very great way to communicate cuz i will i can't tell you how many times in the last week i wrote a very specific piece of text with like here's what's happen here's the problem here's what's happening here's the exact diagnostics and someone was like i was a little too long and i i kind of got lost just like [ __ ] so then as i explained it to him he's like ah now that i reread this this makes total sense i'm just like damn it right like text is just hard text is just like text is is real do i do tldr at the top but the problem is that tldr on a a tabular data is almost impossible the part of it is it's called a graph and you put a graph in and people don't read the graph just that's where we are today in terms of our technical systems and all the crap we have to deal with to do anything so nobody feels empowered to fix anything because everything is too big and too horrible and then also i actually really like that can we just take one quick pause here if there was a bug in react would you feel empowered to fix react i don't think you would i think that most people if they are honest with themselves they would probably say no i'm not that empowered to fix react ain't nobody got time for that that's a laughable question i know there's always going to be somebody that's like hell yeah i can he's like okay why don't you go do it then tough guy i want to see you do that i think what he said there was really is a really insightful comment which is the empowerment to fix things yeah i mean so part of the problem is what are you going to do if you don't like the situation with shading languages for example because you don't right what the thing you would have done in the old days is just make a make a shading language and make it run everywhere and then maybe people will use that you can't do that now in part because everything is so complicated at making a shading language even work on one gpu is almost impossible in part because most of the information is proprietari and in part because it's so much more complicated so making the equivalent of c but for shaders today is at least perceived to be impossible for even a group of people to do let alone one person right and so we're just in a very horrible place and that's why things are the way they are cpus have vastly different is say so did cpus back when c was made that is not an excuse it is not good good on j blow for saying that an excuse it's much easier to implement support for dx12 vulcan metal than support for every vendor in gpu generation combo that is an excuse dude cpus in the past didn't even support the same kind of integers they had totally different representation for floating point numbers if they had them at all they stored strings in different ways and yet we still made programming languages that ran across these cpus it's that not that hard what you're saying you're repeating propaganda i think he makes a good point which is things can take a long time they can be difficult but hard is different right when we're talking about hard and simple when it comes to programming simple means that the the problem itself is easy to understand now to get from point a to point b maybe a million steps right so having to write out these different kind of ways in which you're handling the different compilations from c to whatever target platform you're having maybe they are simply simple it's just a process of learning them going through it making the correct making the correct breakdown and then moving on from it right like implementing websockets is really not hard there's nothing hard about web sockets it's just timec consuming right it just takes a little bit of time to go okay so i have to i have to be able to okay the first the first two bytes represent this now if the first two bytes have this you know 126 within the within the least significant bite then that means i'm going to have another two bites that i have to go read out to be able to get this and if in within the first bite there's this one you know there's one of the flags is one there you go there's the second part then that means i have another four bytes to read out the server mask right it's like it's not hard there's nothing hard about it right there's there's truly nothing hard about websockets same with there's truly nothing hard about http right if you want to know how http works at all it's it's not wild it's it's actually pretty straightforward it's it's it's more shockingly simple than you [music] realize and so is it a lot of work to create create a proper i know so much windows shut up okay it's it's that's shut up okay i'm turning them off i'm turning them off everybody they're getting turned off i usually just like to keep them open because because if i don't i forget to turn them i forget to turn them back on and then i miss meetings okay and then you know what i also realized i should probably go like this p-9 slack get get the hell out of i just saw slack disappear so i know slack was running i almost exposing work emails again the first ever quad druple a game i want to play that anyways just something to think about simple and hard right make sure you kind of have that in your head why why does this propaganda exist it's because the makers of gpus want to stand between you and their hardware they want more more of a vertical control over the system that is why we are in the situation that we are if there were an open- source gpu imagine somehow that there were an open- source gpu that was like community-owned which i don't i'm not philosophically arguing for this because i don't think it's possible but im jonathan blow the guy that he's not he's not the biggest fan of open source imagine it were community owned and there were no trade secrets and it was just just as fast as an rtx 4090 right people would have no problem making programming languages for it and if there were three of them that had different architectures people would have no problem making programming languages for them the reason we can't do it is because nvidia amd and intel don't want us to do it that is why that is the reason and then also because they're so complicated that we would need massive amounts of help anyway they want to be in control of what languages run on their thing and that's why we're in such a mess like again people who who repeat this reasoning that the gpu ises are too different have literally no idea what c ran on like there were so many different computers dude c ran on connection machines it ran on vaxes it ran on shitty home computers it ran on everything i mean that it's true the bro's cooking he's he's true i i don't know what these vx machines are okay no but this is true this is genuinely true by the way so i guess i guess does that mean does that mean the the only way to really get over this is that you have to create a language that transpiles to shaders is that is that like is that like is that is that is that the is that the answer is that you have a generalized shader languages that simply trans transpiles i i'm not suggesting that this is a good idea odin lang is is that what odin lang does glsl then yeah what about hlsl that was popular one day i is not popular anymore no it kind of is right hlsl 2 isn't that like a thing these days isn't that for the xbox xbox it's interesting what he's saying because there's a huge portion of complication that just simply comes from exactly what he's talking about where people are beholden to certain certain aspects and they're and they're unable to get past it because of proprietary nature of things and i understand why people do propri like i'm not here to knock against proprietary nature i'm not i really am not because i don't necessarily the thing is is that companies optimize for one thing their favorite thing which is the only thing they really should optimize for which is making money and so is it shocking that these type of things are proprietary right they they they make money and that's the purpose i mean you can't have a company that's like ah we don't care about making money they're not going to be a company for very long right it's it's not going to work out and so like i i understand why these things happen i know money i'm shocked shook right now shook and so it just the worst part is is that it directly leads to this type of situation which sucks what's an isa instruction set architecture the interface language that the cpu speaks that you tell it what you want it to do the real reason there isn't a uniform shading language is that all these gp u vendors see their shading language or their it varies depending on who you're talking about right so now it's more about compute languages being all right we're having we're having we're having dumb we're having dumb comment yeah so we're going to check out yes i understand that there are individuals who make a company right they go off and they make these nice little these nice little trading card games and all that it's very very nice they make all these nice little games and this is what they're doing for what they're making this is fantastic this absolutely exists but guess what they're not a company they're going to be a dude or a group of people that just simply want to make something and that does exist but you know what they're not doing they're not all working full-time on this and doing nothing somewhere they have money somewhere somehow they're continuing to live their lives now they may have been able as individuals collectively come together and done this but this is not like this is almost like the inverse point this almost proves my statement even more is that the only way they could say they actively don't want money is if each individual person contributing to this is either doing it purely out of hobbyist desire or b they have so much money they just simply want to make whatever they want to make and that's that and they want people to play like both of them are more charity bound than anything else like it it's literally you're the point you're trying to make is not actually happening here okay okay hey i app i appreciate you did just say while that while that's actually true okay thank you app appreciate it i'm just saying it it is not it's it's [laughter] those don't worry about whatever that that was from earlier in the stream that was from earlier in the stream proprietary right because they want to get in on the neural network stuff and all that but so like operate so there's operating system vendors want a piece of the pie so they have their own you have like metal shading language which apple wants to use to lock you into apple operating systems right hlsl microsoft wants to use that to lock you into microsoft op systems and so forth and then you have gpu vendors who on the back end they see their driver for hlsl and you know vulcan and metal and whatever as being a competitive advantage for them because they invest resources into it and all that right and it it's stupid like it's interesting because we saw something like this in the past so like that it is interesting that it's interesting about that idea of competitive advantage because if one gpu company can have you know the only quote unquote vulcan shader available then they uniformly get to be the one that gets to be put on on all vulcan styled on all vulcan hardware right and so that's pretty like i can see why the i can it makes sense when you think about it from a perspective of how you get the mones right so if your driver works the best with microsoft then you're going to be probably more likely to be recommended by microsoft this is probably why lonus flips off nvidia and hates it for this exact reason let's see let's see as a developer do you not feel the need to remove these company standards or practices that limit devtech from growing the problem is is what does that mean and i i do mean this in the most like i think it's fully in apple's prerogative to build a computer in its own world garden and their whole goal is that they're going to provide such an experience that everybody everybody else wants to use them because it's so good for just just that little wal garden that's their prerogative now do i think that makes for better developer experience no because now we have you know now you have to have some weird crossover app type language to be able to build mobile for both things or you're building a swift ui and you're building a cotlin ui right like you have to do both it kind of sucks no man force them to open up like i don't think that that is good right like i honestly don't think that is a good i i don't think that that's good i think it's up to their prerogative if if you could make a product so good that people want to buy it non-stop that's your option right i don't want that option like me personally i i think overall that's not that great but at the end of the day if you make all the customers happy and you make a product that's extremely popular in some niche group of people then you have to develop for that niche group of people and in this case obviously apple they they go they go heavily more towards affluent people right i mean just in general apple products are just more expensive than than android products and there's like a you know you you hear all these people on twitter being like oh those green bubble texters nothing nothing sounds more stupid than that but i say that as an as an android user by the way but i mean like that's their prerogative like i get why this exists and i i don't think it's great but i also think it's their option to have like i don't want the other side of the coin the other side of the coin is that the government controls what you get to do because right cuz that's the that's the only option there's two options the consumer controls it or the government controls it you get get to make the choice in this theoretical situation we're developing i'd rather make the choice of consumer chooses than than government chooses false dichotomy well at the end of the day if it's coming to o forcing a company to open up or not that's a binary choice right that is a binary choice you're giving me a binary choice therefore there is a dichotomy so either you let the consumer choose which products and if the and if the consumer chooses proprietary locked things that's that it's a liter dichotomy is what you just described you said force them to open up or not i'm sorry that you described a dichotomy and i gave you both sides of it i was thinking maybe to stop the business monopolies and give it and give it to the big government monopoly that that we all think is run effectively and trustworthy i don't know anyone who is doubting the offic efficacy of the us government i know like can we just take a moment and realize what the the other option is like i don't think any person here looks at the us government goes wow that's efficiency you know what i think i want to model myself after i'm going to do a startup and model it after the government nobody says that i i'm not saying monopolies are good either but i wouldn't call apple a monopoly apple does not have a very large share of the market what is it 80 2080 i think us government has my best interest at heart yeah i know again if i had to choose i would choose one over the other you don't trust the government well the government will do if you have a good government the government will do what is best for the for the general public but again like all problems with statistics you may not reflect the general public and that that's what gets difficult right it's just like i would hope that the government has you know we can just all believe in this you know thing you know but it's just either way we can move on apple versus google in terms of making a product on a phone how is one better than other in terms of development yeah i i i don't i don't do i don't do those things but people seem to like apple generally false dichotomy in that the consumers don't get to choose anyways they choose not to play video games but they won't yes well i mean in a sense they do get to choose that they choose iphone android or freedom phone right but they but in the us there is a large set of choosers that choose iphones when they have the financial ability to choose no one seems to choose freedom phone okay where's the where where's my freedom phone right i don't know it's it's hard i the thing is is that i i really like if a company can create a competitive advantage with a really great tool would i want them to forcibly open up let's just say that netflix's recommendation is really really good okay i'm just say this is a theoretical i know a lot of you are going to say it's horeshit but let's just say that it's really really good and it makes all the other video services horseshit should they be forced to open it up i mean because that's where this goes when you make one person forcefully open up a walled garden it's going to be extended to all other walled gardens and that's where things get difficult right like you got to got play these things out you know i don't think it's the same well guess what some people might think it's the same right that's the problem is you may not think it is back in the workstation keep people who made these computers had their own c compiler usually right and they saw it as a competitive advantage but eventually now we have clang and gcc and all this stuff that are generally better than how those comp comp ilers were in the past you still have borland mentioned by the way some proprietary compilers so for example intel still makes a c compiler nobody really uses it though except in very specialized cases as far as i know is there a good faith rational for metal's existence i mean look here's the thing in a sense there's a good faith rationale for any programming language's existence right because you need it to be possible to have new ways to try to do things better that's how things improve so you shouldn't ever say hey we should lock down all the shading languages we don't need anymore no right but if you think metal is a better shading language let us use it on any gpu that we want on any operating system that we want right and then people will use it if it's better but that's not how it is right you can only use it on apple operating systems you intels is intel's lvm branch basically yeah i mean their c compiler went way back in time before lvm was a thing but it's probably a completely different compiler now right hey thank you adam i appreciate that clip out and some of the editing i mean i do i again i i actually completely agree with what he is saying is that if if there is a language that is better and if it were opened up people would choose it i'm not saying that our environment is the most efficient because obviously it's not the most efficient because we have a bunch of stupid choices like how many different programming languages right now can you choose to write a back end in really like how many different ones like of the super popular ones that people seem to write you got rust go typescript javascript i'll call them the same thing you got cp we could keep elixir and like that's just like there's five that are just really easy to say and then you got java and python which guess what after these five java and python probably takes up a larger share than the five i just got done mentioned we're at seven separate languages and we haven't even talked about the biggest one yet php php is probably the largest language of them all and guess what here we are so it's like is is that solution better i don't know i think i like it honestly real talk i think i prefer that solution but they're not locked down like the gpu stuff is the gpu stuff is much more complicated because obviously there is a lot of proprietary stuff especially now that ai is becoming more and more valuable a i mean i'm sure the whole bitcoin a thing has caused a lot of this problem in the sense that bitcoin and ai if you had a gpu that was somehow efficient in one of these two things you actually got a huge boost in sales so remember back in the day when bitcoin mining was a thing 2013 i was mining bitcoin you'd want to use a specific amd gpu and amd gpus went way up up in price and then that was no longer the case so they went back down in price right and so there's like this whole thing that happened where whatever the technology was would dictate it so obviously amd wanted to make that as proprietary as possible they wanted to be as protected as possible is that bad or good that's just what happened i'm not saying it's great i'm not saying it's good or bad it's just like that is just that's that's what happens and then you have these kind of like you have these things in which people will try to corner a market in a specific way anyways i don't like it but i don't think the alternative is better sorry game developers that you have to honestly you know i what i'm really sorry about is that the game developers you're the ones that hold the bag sorry a jen
