- you're probably thinking, this video has to be click bait. - no, no, no. - well, look at this. this guy has one viewer, which is us. subtract us, and he has zero viewers. - streamlabs is unavailable. - try his second streamlabs link. he has two just in case. oh no, it's a downloaded link. - next one. - he's not gonna react, i don't think. - dude, people sleeping
have the best reaction. maybe we can wake him up. - try to wake him up. no, no, no, not on a sleeping guy. no, no, no. - it's all right. - no, stop it. - we've got to prove to
them it's not click bait. - that's so much money. - $10,000 to a guy sleeping who's probably not gonna see it. - $10,000 donated. it worked. he woke up. - thanks for the dono. - thanks for the dono. - no way, man. oh, mrbeast? - hey, what's up, man. - $10? - $10. - there's three extra zeros on it. - he just goes back to sleep. - dude, people sleeping
have the best reactions. - i wonder what he's gonna do when he realizes it's $10,000, not $10. - hopefully get some new sheets. - you don't like his sheets? - those are ugly. - well, guys, he went back to sleep. sorry for waking you up. - oh my- - i had 10k just burning
a hole in my pocket, thanks for taking it. - great start. - this is good content. - hey, they want me to
donate to small streamers. - what do you mean, mrbeast, you have $10,000? you really sent me $10,000? - yeah. - is that funny? thanks for the 10,000. let's do a collab or something. - that's the collab
everyone's waiting for. - just me sleeping. - guys sleeping together. - yep. oh yeah, guys, before we go any further, let me introduce you to my children, this is chris, this is chandler, they're both proud of yous all. our next victim is this blue-haired man. invest in beast, plz. i don't know if i did 100,000 or 10,000. i hope it's 10,000. - invest in beast, plz. - you good, bro? - is this real? - yeah. - is this real life? hey, what is mrbeast's twitch name? - 6000, mrbeast6000. - you're lying. - i swear to god. - dude.
- no way. - he's just like, no way. - i'm freaking out. i'm actually freaking out. - isn't it funny how some
people when they freak out, they just say i'm freaking out, that's their way of freaking out? - i'm freaking out, i'm shaking. mrbeast6000, thank you for that. how many zeros is that? - i said the same thing. - i don't know what to say. - thank you. - yo, there's another person in the chat, we're no longer the only viewer. we gotta abort. - can you please elaborate
by what you mean by invest in beast? - since you asked, i'll
go ahead and explain it. you're probably wondering, where did this $100,000 come from? as you see from this screen shot, these twitch videos typically
get copyright claimed, which means i won't get
any of the ad revenue. so if i'm not getting any ad revenue, and there's not a sponsor on the video, where is the $100,000 coming from? - i don't know. - let me tell you. it's coming from shopmrbeast. - oh boy, that's my favorite website. - i'm going to start using shopmrbeast as a method to fund my videos. you guys are investors. by investing in merch,
you're funding these videos. - and you get dope hoodies in return. - you invest in the stupid
things i like to do. - yes. - and sometimes good things. - yes. - so now i think it's time to show them the great design shopmrbeast has to offer. this first hoodie is on beast. this hoodie is guaranteed
to get you more friends. invest now! this next hoodie is the
classical beast logo hoodie. you can't go wrong with this one. and this next hoodie is gold beast, and it's actually made with real gold. i don't know why there's
a disclaimer there. so yeah, guys, invest in shopmrbeast, so i can continue to do videos where i give away $100,000. i have lots of big plans, but i need your guys' help. - invest! - and finally, you can support these boys by using their codes at checkout. here's a list of all the codes, chris, chandler. bailey and ethan are the editors. tareq's the camera man. whenever you use their codes at checkout at shopmrbeast.com, they
get kickback of the sales, so if you think chandler's extra funny, use his code and he'll make some money. whoever, if you like someone, use their code at checkout,
it'll support them, and remember, invest in the merch, so i can keep spending lots of money. this boy has zero viewers,
and also zero frame rate. which means, we should
give him some money. ask him to pick a number
between one and 10 and we'll donate that in thousands. - mrbeast, pick a number
between one and 10. 6,000. one and 10. six. - six. - six. - number six, number six. - all right, it went through. - no way. - dang, this dude can cry. - oh my god, dude. - nice. - mrbeast, thank you so much, man. - don't lose the game, it's not worth it, it's only six grand. - oh my goodness. - i'm sorry, i'm not
trying to cry right now, i don't wanna do this. oh my god, i'm shaking, man. i've never seen that much money. - the dog's like, what? - calm down. i've never seen that
much money in an account. oh my god. i can't believe it. - i like when people are like this. - oh god, let me get a grip, okay. thank you, first of all,
man, you are awesome. i can't even get my words straight. check me out. - the plug. - yeah, i'm gonna use it. thank you, mrbeast, man, thank you. you are awesome, dude. i'm gonna sit here and
try to play this last 12. - tell me he gets another
thousand if he wins. - you don't know how much that is going to change my
life, bro, you really don't. oh my god! - see, guys, this is why you should invest in shopmrbeast merch. see how happy this guy is? - no, no, no! - no. - [chris and chandler] rock,
paper, scissors, shoot! - chris won. chris, you can tell to
buy merch with your code. - i'm using the code chris. shopmrbeast, i'm gonna go there right now. i'm gonna grab something. - yeah, boy! wow, can you find the donation button? most people are like,
you don't have to donate- - but you can. this guy's just like, "tips appreciated!" - all right, let's make this guy's day. - donate whatever you wanna donate. - you should go to- - yeah, for the record, chris currently has the most code uses. - use code chris. - all right, well, i guess
we only have $4,000 left in our balance. wait, so use $4,000 from paypal and then 2,000 from the bank,
yeah, let's do that, yeah. - you should go to
shopmrbeast and use chris. 6,969... yo, you're lying. no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no way. bro, are you serious? yo, are you serious right now? - yeah. - yeah. - he kind of looks like joe weller. - yeah, a little bit. - you should go to shopmrbeast
and use code chris. - he's doing it. - what's he doing? - he's going to shopmrbeast.com and he's using code- - bailey. yes, he's buying the merch on stream! - let's see, does he use code- - bailey! - will chris get a kickback? wow, that's some next level strategy. you give him $7,000- - of your money. - so you can get a kickback
on the sale of the hoodie. - make sure you guys to go shopmrbeast.com and use whatever code you want. maybe it's chandler, maybe it's- - bailey! - yeah! - we'll blur his address. - oh, he's punching the air. - this guy has three viewers. we're one of them, chris'
phone is the other, which means, zero actual
people are watching him. [music] hey there, delilah, what's
it like in new york city [music] - all right, that was beautiful. 10,000 it is. all right, fine, if he gets this kill, he gets 10 grand, no kill only five. oh, oh, oh, kill, kill. all right, chris jerk. oh wow, why'd it take
my perfectly even number and turn it into that garbage? - look at that fake money. - chris jerk. - jerk. - chris jerk. chrise jerk. - that is not how you say my name. - fake donations? - fake donations. - why would you even do that, man? like, come on. - he's pissed. - gets money, is mad. - all right. - he just left his stream. - that's gotta be bait. that has to be bait. no way, no way. you're joking. - next up is this female. have we done a female yet? - i've never done a female. - anyways. - you clicked the wrong link there, bud. you know, the big one that says donate? - you know what, his face is now blurred. - oh, code chandler. - ethan's gonna be like, i'm not gonna do that, just because i don't
wanna put in the work. can you drop that to 10,000
for tax purposes, sir? - she gets 11. - i was requested to tell you under 10. - oh, because if it's over 10,000 it gets flagged by the irs? - yes. - well, irs, here you go! my account's gonna kill her. - oh wait, you should do all nines, 'cause we're all nine year olds. - guys, it's time to put
chandler on the spot. no, don't touch it, stop. stop, stop, stop. this is a $10,000 donation. you can say whatever you want, me and chris can not change it. what are you saying to this woman you're about to give 10 grand to? - let's just jump into it. - 10 million people are watching, you give her 10 grand and
this is what you're gonna say? - oh, that's cool, you put use code chris. - wait a minute, it says use code ethan. - yeah, it probably does now 'cause our editor is a dingle-dong. - all right, send it. what, really, it didn't pop up? - she's devastated. good pick, chandler, you picked somebody who
doesn't have notifications. - this can't be real. i don't, like- - dude, she went from
zero viewers to four. - the power of money. - she started from the
bottom and now she's here. - hey, chandler. - hey. - watch this. - no! why would you say that? all right, chandler,
you're banished, go away. - see you at mcdonald's. - she laughed. it's okay, she laughed,
that's all that matters. - let's give her money. - me, that was me. - whoa, she sounds like anime. she gets lots of money,
'cause we like anime. - oh, . - use code chris. - dude, that's embedded in my head. - hey, go to and use code
chandler at checkout. - it's 'cause you put
a link, it mutes links. - what? holy . - she broke the accent. - hello? oh my god. what? - i told you it was a voice. - no. excuse me? - that's what happens when
you use code chandler. - you bring out the real in people. - people lose their ability to speak. - i might cry. how can i not? oh no! that's the best dad hat. sorry, i'm just like ordering
that stuff right now. - bro! bro, no, no! - you better focus, bro. - that is not real. - you're gonna wanna drop somewhere. - no! i get another 2,500 if i get a kill within 30 seconds of touching the ground. - all right, and starting now. oh, oh, oh! - that counts. that counts. - boom, all right, send it. - mrbeast, give me $2,500, dude. come on, come on, baby. - gg. - bro, i'm actually about to cry, this can't be real. dude, i got it. no, no way! no! oh my god. - dude, he's freaking out. - his dad came in. - it's real, dad. - he's doing the thumbnail face. - all right, guys, welcome. we're about to donate to this dude. - welcome to my youtube channel. - welcome to my twitch talk. - mryeast. - all right, someone

money to promote my code. - confusion has set in. - he's so confused. - dude, look at his face. he's like, what? okay, scream. - he's about to poop money. - guys, is that real? - yeah, is that real? - i don't even know
how to react right now. is that real? - wait, he's in a tournament? - don't play with my heart right now. - is it? is he in a tournament?
- don't play with my heart. - he said, "don't play with my heart." - no way, you guys are all trolling me. - look at the chat. code chris is better. i agree. chris, i love you, yeah! - dude, there's no way,
guys, is that real? - they're on top. two on top, three on top. - what? there's no way. there's no way i just got $10,000. there's no way. no, mrbeast, bro. dude, listen, i'ma react as if... i'ma take it as if it's real, bro, 'cause there's no way. mrbeast, i don't think
you understand, bro. there is a lot of people out there, you know what i mean, that
troll posing as you, man, 'cause you're such a
beautiful man, obviously. you're a beautiful specimen. my father, i've been looking
for you my whole life. - yo, focus up toby! focus up, dude, $10,000 isn't- - dude, i think this is the
real mrbeast though, dude. - what? did you get donated that? - yes. - no way, dude.
- bro, if mrbeast is in your chat, bro,
it's about to get real. oh my god, no way. - dude, what happened? - that's so dope, man. - why'd my audio go out
in my left ear, dude. what happened? my left ear. oh, . - how did he not know? - oh my god! - let's go, baby! let's go! - don't forget to invest
in the merch, like i said. this video will probably get claimed, probably won't make any money. use whatever code you like, whoever you wanna support, support them. - chandler.
