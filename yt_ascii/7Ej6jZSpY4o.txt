ladies and gentlemen there's a story that i haven't been able to talk about for a long time the story of the person jay mazzini kidnapped but today i'm breaking my silence on this because the kidnapping victim of jay mazzini just got arrested for taking a bribe from jay mazzini to change his story and you better believe i have a lot to say about it let's get into it ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee time and as some of you original zillow holders know pump the stock one of our first investigations that really blew up was the jay mazzini story we first covered him doing giveaway scams that eventually moved to bitcoin it eventually resulted in criminal charges being pressed against jay mazzini it's quite the insane story and while the walls were closing in he actually kidnapped somebody that he thought ran a scam page that was exposing him at the time he thought he would kidnap this person and it seemed like he was going to try to get that person to remove or delete the scam page that story went everywhere we everyone knows he got arrested for that later he got charged with the bitcoin stuff but initially he was picked up for that kidnapping charge and so he got charged with that okay that victim goes on instagram by the name of mj moves i would not suggest going and following him because i don't i get the weird feeling now given what i know now that there's this weird clout element to things obviously not to say that any anything that happened to him is as a result of clout but judging from the situation after talking to him and after everything that's happened now i get this weird feeling like after everything happened he kind of had this angle to him like or where he was trying to get something out of this terrible situation which happened to him and it makes me uneasy about the whole thing because as some of you know i talked to him right after the incident he was still like wounded i mean i'll throw up a picture of him after right after the kidnapping i mean he had been beaten he had been stripped naked there was a machete held to his neck i mean it was a crazy story that has been reported on a lot and we talked about it during that show afterwards he came to me he said hey steven don't show this thing because of the fact that hey i'm working with detectives i don't know if they're ready to have the story up i say fair enough but i'm not trying to you know hurt your case now during that time jay mazzini's locked up and i guess it's coming out now that the family of j mazzini then approached mj moves the guy who was kidnapped with kind of a what seems like a bribery deal okay about his statement to the feds this is the the headline man allegedly kidnapped by jay mazzini charged with taking bribe to recant statement and apparently our boy mj accepted this thing and got what allegedly in a hundred thousand dollar payment in return for a new statement that was meant to facilitate the release of one of the defendants from jail aka jay mazzini now to be clear it's a little confusing because i guess if he had gotten cleared from that charge they're basically paying him a hundred thousand dollars to get jay off but even if that had happened i think he still would have been in prison for the bitcoin stuff it's not clear but yeah they were trying to get him off of the kidnapping charge with by by basically paying the guy off with a bunch of money now around the time this stuff happened i'll just give you guys kind of full transparency here i had heard rumors that this may have happened and i did call mj moves about it i picked up the phone i won't be too specific here because even though i think what he's done is terrible here for the victims of jay mazzini i still want to respect his privacy to some extent as much as i can but essentially the conversation was you're not thinking of taking a bribe are you and he's like well i can't tell you that basically i'm like don't do it that's idiotic i just because i had all i had heard was rumors i didn't know what was true what was not i just heard rumors from some of the various people covering this i said this is a terrible idea do not do that it's going to hurt the victims who have been affected by jay mazzini and now it looks like he allegedly took it okay and of course it looks like i was right that it was of course a bad idea to take a bribe you know because he was arrested for this and charged with accepting a bribe i believe he's out right now on release but i think that he's i think that he's just waiting to be like go to court for this and this ladies and gentlemen is sort of what i meant by i felt like well i feel now i guess i didn't know then that he had his own angle because it seems like he was trying to use the situation not at first but at first it seemed like he was just like trying to get justice and then he later used the information for his own benefit now at this point that's kind of my involvement in this whole thing i know many of you guys wanted to cover this because you go what the heck you know the guy who was kidnapped was you know now charged and stuff but i also want to cover the instagram stories he's been putting out there because he's been talking about it publicly a little bit now initially when he got kidnapped i think he released a story that said like the plot thickens which weird thing to say when you've been arrested but then he's kind of goes on social media later on and he's still cavalier about it in a story they say are you doing well i'm doing just fine he's doing an ama about his kidnapping charge here he's answering you know why did you change the j mazzini story let's see what he has to say i added more to the story and they're claiming that i'm lying but all i ever did was reveal more truths okay so he's saying i didn't change the story i just accepted a hundred thousand dollars to add more truths yeah i'm gonna have to say i don't really buy that too much it's and it's so frustrating to see this because again jay mazzini hurt a lot more people than just this guy obviously this guy probably the most but yeah this is not not helpful this one he's talking about the family of jay mazzini contacting him since they've been trying to harass me ever since trying to harass my family anybody that can get close to me they tried okay here's another question he was asked did jay snitch on you i'm just gonna go through these quick no why would jay snitch on me i don't know maybe because he's willing to kidnap you to shut down the scam page i mean it's absolutely crazy this is one of the things i've got to say i mean again i'm still i'm still planning to not release the interview just yet because i still don't want it to you know affect the situation negatively but i remember even during the interview him being like insanely naive with regards to jay mazzini i mean it's like it's crazy how much this guy even after everything that's happened somehow still like is kind of just has this attitude of like oh yeah sure like i'll do whatever it's actually completely weird like i don't know how anybody would have this attitude about somebody who kidnapped them here's another one saying why not 250k no comment but i don't comment on you guys don't know okay and i'm gonna keep it like that but you little eighth grader you would have been bought with a thousand dollars so get the out of here with your stupid comments okay this is annoying i don't actually think that's true i don't think everyone would just take a bribe from somebody who who kidnapped them that's extremely weird especially if you know how many people they've taken money from you know where that money's coming from it's like so frustrating to hear him say this you've got to understand guys like in a way i almost feel like that he's betrayed all those people that i've also talked to about james it's so frustrating because it's like oh he was a victim but then he's kind of using it to his own devices so frustrating all i'm gonna say is his wife is the reason he's locked up and everyone else is off up and she's the reason that we're going through all this to begin with and she's also the reason you guys all got scared i don't really know what to think of that one i do know quite a bit about the story some people have said that his wife behind the scenes had stuff going on honestly you guys have seen how this stuff has moved it is not some puppet master pulling the strings okay yes his wife got arrested after him but jay mazzini he was doing his own thing too this guy i think he's just trying to blame it on the wife i don't know what this guy's thinking and ladies and gentlemen that was basically the last relevant story he's posted about this it's shocking given how much trouble he's in how much he's talking about this publicly but yeah he is and so of course we're going to cover it i've got to say i mean i can't express how frustrated i am on behalf of a lot of the victims who are were are finally seeing justice you know for what jay mazzini has done and this guy's basically undoing it or trying to undo it for a hundred thousand dollars extremely frustrating to see and yeah i'm i'm bothered by it for me personally i can't release our interview in good conscience right now because of all the things that have come to light but ladies and gentlemen that pretty much is where we're at with this story we'll have to see you know whether he ends up going to facing any serious charges for this it seems like he could but i think that puts the lockup count on jay mazzini as like three arrests now jay mazzini jamizini's wife and now the guy jay mazzini has kidnapped this has become quite the story we will continue following up on it so with that said ladies and gentlemen thanks for watching i appreciate all of you and i will see you guys in the fraud are next the same as choice
