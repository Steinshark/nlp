bad commercials come in all sorts of different flavors but tech companies in particular seem to have a knack for green lighting truly awful marketing campaigns and then when the public response is predictably terrible backtracking and pretending the whole thing never happened fortunately for us and unfortunately for them the internet never forgets and for today's video we're going to be taking you along something we call the bad commercial cruise it's going to be so full of cringe that you'll laugh you'll cry and you might even pee a little but not related to laughing that's not a thing that people do i can tell you something people do check out this message from our sponsor mexico whether you're in need of a webcam or accessory for your vr device mexico has a great selection of products to choose from learn more about them at the link down below thank you [music] hey steve i think those girls are checking us out yeah steve excuse me my roommate and i just wanted to say that we love your ass okay who actually calls it that like i don't think i've heard anyone ever i don't know what they're talking about yet what really our asses swivel actually these are into asus oh asus products here's a hint for brands if you want people to pronounce the name right then spell it right okay i want to know who would prove that because even if you're trying to get people to pronounce it correctly like doing a commercial like that is just horrible the idea was that it would go viral but they're also just driving they say the name asus so many times yeah oh i disagree with this practice generally i think it's dangerous that's why we make the most advanced personal computers in the world how is he holding that mouse and why soon there'll be just two kinds of people those who use computers yeah i'll be home for breakfast and those who use samples he's on the phone when they say those who use computers because this actor has clearly never touched a computer in his life did you see how he was using the mouse wow what is that amazingly it's still so aptly and that they spend only two percent of the commercial actually showing the product the rest is just lifestyle you look like a real how wide is the person you're driving so what you doing well muffy buffy biff junior and i are going on our sunday drive oh no you're not you're gonna play position [music] i actually love this commercial oh my god someone just wrecked their kid is dead sir she's trying to take her helmet off i don't understand the point of this commercial it's fun for the whole family oh my god that is awesome that is like fodder for parodies 20 years later oh i love it when it comes to keeping your gaming gear peak performance oh the games people play i'll tell you this seriously reminds me of your early youtube videos really yeah harsh vaughn that's not nice oh man just look at all that crap flying out of there i can't see what you're talking about enough skin fragments to clone yourself no that's good mom would be so proud no now okay we have done that before yes do not use a vacuum vacuums can cause static discharge and could severely damage your computer that is a very good point oh my gosh how long is this did they play this in movie theaters like how am i not gone by now is this a commercial or is this just this seems like an instructional yeah falcon dust off is totally a thing i guess they just did a gamer brand like gamer skin on their existing products no music the whole time no background music who would watch that what i want to know is how popular these videos actually were as nintendo begins to take on new forms it's important that we can measure how addictive they truly are animal testing i don't think they would touch that these days this is a nintendo commercial boy micro extremely portable extremely stylish there was a lot of really edgy gaming commercials oh really they actually got that shot of the puppy in the air that was awesome and that shot of the car going by it i wonder if they did that in two shots or if there's actually a risk they would have got run over i'm so glad you made it home because i just sold you on this website ship them out wow again completely would not fly today i'm running a puppy mill i just don't even have words to describe the feeling for that one i am so like i'm angry i mean i guess if the commercial's supposed to make you feel something mission accomplished yeah i guess they're what they're going for is you can sell anything but they spend the whole buildup of the commercial demonstrating this dog's loyalty and love just for you to be like see you later buddy i was writing paper on the pc and it was like and then like half of my paper was gone it devoured my paper was really good paper what's wrong with her you just don't have a teenager yet okay i'm ellen feist and i'm a student i wonder how ellen's career is going this is one of those ads where i feel like apple should have been smart enough not to break that cardinal rule don't insult your customers if you didn't even know what a switch was does like i don't even know what that commercial is for they're just saying like slash switches like switched to apple yeah the commercial meant nothing to me i was just like what is this i think apple counts on you to know apple okay i'll tell you guys a little secret i'm also a hardcore gamer [music] i travel a lot of course this is msi that was definitely on purpose you said it not me woohoo yes there are two types of memory long dim and short dim hey no i think you mean dim and so dim and b there's no way that voice came out of that person why did you say of course msi because msi's just look what percentage of this frame is breast it's got to be msi check out the girth on that cable management hole in that dresser over there yeah what the hell is that that's a glory hole hey dan ready for the game are these the same guy those guys look way too similar yeah the two generic 80s guys i've got to sense something for my mom's birthday it's tomorrow well then book plane tickets for our trip next week and my kids gotta go to the library and ask for your life story pal america online can do all that yeah how about sending your mom some nice flowers all you do is click on marketplace place an order i can't get flowers that fast today that the things

the men's stuff yeah fantasy football worldwide email of course there's my personal favorite live chat that's how i met my new oh hold on hold on met my new met my new kayaking buddies his desk has a glory hole too probably do you know what a glory hole is i think so i'd like to preface this one by saying that this series was a major inspiration for me it showed me that no matter how bad my ideas were no matter how bad my production values were there was definitely a worse waste of money than booking with linus media group incorporated okay now i'm going to compare it guys check this out asus has given me its latest high-tech product chinese food is delicious you're right i just love sushi you're just jealous i'm gonna get patty it's hard to even begin it reminds me of a morgan freeman quote he said acting is reacting these guys are not reacting to each other at all they're all in a vacuum now for no reason whatsoever they get curious holy come on very already it was widely criticized for just being utterly tone deaf in its sort of profiting off of geek and nerd culture like say nerd word everyone laugh this is really hard to watch yeah i know that we're in like the tick tock generation now with no attention span but it's hard to believe things were this boring this was particularly boring like nothing is happening you're gonna be the first to see it i think you're gonna be really impressive i want to see you so much it was like this when we opened the box yeah you brought back an effective product are they talking about me no no of course not this is the e-pad transformer holy what a twist i can't believe it took that long to finally show what your product does what's with all the women in these that's just how women are oh according to tech marketers yeah now it gets better they produce not one but five episodes of that dross six is that because it worked no or because it invested in a gigantic set and all these actors and scripts and basically produced the entire campaign before showing it to anyone at which time they realize holy crap this doesn't work at all and is not funny at all if they had cut that down to 30 seconds it would have been not good but better now this guy's competing for your budget and here's jake paul i actually love this what yes this is like youtube era haley what okay wait hold on how are they doing this did they just play it in reverse no no no this is fake it has to be fake like yeah they're not throwing them at his ass i don't know the first one looked convincing yeah a little too much at this point we get it same way every time and that is jake paul what are they trying to say about the product it's thin okay i feel like if this was updated i would see this on on facebook or tick tock yeah this is like a little short there's a modern-ness to it yeah i don't know why these guys are all dressed in unitards are they wrestlers i love it it doesn't quite get there for me but it's close i'm very into it oh this is like a music video style oh no yo ms raps i feel like this is taking the piss like this is like a parody of itself i feel like it's self-aware we're in we're inducing something new [music] they did a good job rotoing that yeah i i was gonna say they've got shadows and everything the pattern with all of these is that they're like 10 minutes long and i just don't know when they're ever screaming i can't tell who they're pitching okay so they're pitching partners so those people waiting to hear the lunch and learn seminar were super bored but now they're stoked yeah so it's it's partners think you really i've heard of this one [music] are you the one who sings this in the office i've heard people say i mean i've heard linus sing it but i don't know about at the office i don't know if i remember seeing this or if i remember similar like gateway ones i never saw this one i don't think this is gateway this is a buck a day like the the one dollar who did the one dollar a day financing it was a big thing at this time my friend financed a computer and i remember telling him what an idiot he was because by the time he finished paying for it he would have paid so much he could have bought two computers i was like but then he could play in real tournaments so he had the last laugh this is a first party ibm commercial that's like a biggest banger yet yeah hell yeah okay apparently it works are you kidding me okay is that even the same person ace drop bill ma with the master of vehicle design what did that have to do with computers i mean it was obviously pure sexy teacher imagine a hot teacher comes in and then like she just ripped all her clothes off you're like whoa this is really going down and then she has a new pc and you're like shut the front door the functionality of this gaming beast including a comment with g sensor and then they had the budget for all these glam shots but they didn't have the budget to make sure that the english translation of the script makes any sense at all and this is new this from like four or five years ago no yeah yeah asrock m8 is not old 15 2015. yeah yeah and find a voice actor on fiverr she's leaning over for absolutely no reason other than for her to be leaning over they could just move the computer closer oh the face that she's making yeah it's kind of creepy she looks like someone who'll smile with her teeth when she's like genuinely smiling there you go ssds make her genuinely happy why is she still wearing a bikini well you want to take that off too yvonne gross can i see your clothes get ripped off again i want to see if it is the same person okay it's just muted colors right now so and then her hair's down and she doesn't have the glasses all right i think the colors just freaked me out before i was like whoa she was a brunette now she's a redhead life isn't all about money nah easy to say when you have it i guess what i'm really trying to say is how much will it cost to keep this from your mother oh 39.95 that's all you need for these super cool nintendo 64 game like really yeah i knew they did some edgy stuff and sega did some even edgier stuff like the sega do what nintendo commercials where they like tried to be even edgier than nintendo but there is no way you make that commercial today it's like they're trying to say the prices of the games are so low you can afford them even with a bribe from your cross-dressing father yes i would think that guy is going to give him quite a bit of money it just seems like it's fighting itself narratively you know this is the year 2000 with where are the flying cars i was promised flying car this is definitely a matrix thing buying cars why why why because billions of people all over the world have worked together on the web 24 hours a day seven days a week you don't need flying cars we were busy working on the web okay are we supposed to know who that is though oh i've never i never oh yeah i recognized him definitely a real actor well i like it they really hammered home to wear all the cars creepy oh hey yeah how's it going over there man it's incredible you want to see something cool yeah sure here give me your number i'll say tech does not get girls from the folding phone to the new sports car if i wanted to pick up dudes with facial hair attention from women negligible yeah i think the subtext here is that the guy on the other side is just so gross yeah she'll take anything here oh it keeps going oh no and he's taking lots of pictures of her hey i didn't realize you were following me down the hill taking pictures this also is only like seven eight years ago that's brutal man that should have ended up i could have just taken a selfie with it that's enough hey she was clothed that could have been a beach scene true can i borrow your laptop for a minute sure look at this that's my girlfriend it's porn porsches really yes do you suffer from omg igp or oh my god i'm gonna puke okay if you share a computer with this guy you might tell him to download internet explorer 8. really and you will never be surprised by harry dot com again that commercial is better than the entire browser okay well that's not subtle oh they're bunnies it's energizer here we go no it's not nope oh from the people who brought you the big bang theory it's e-pad story power to charm i've seen this one yeah okay hell yeah rgb alicia's got great cooling at least she has her hands on the right part of the keyboard screwdriver could use an upgrade yeah they actually have progressed since last time hey guys we're going to show you how to build a gaming pc with an amazon yeah the voiceover is better this is straight up dubbed you know this has to come from the very top of msi otherwise they wouldn't keep doing it like the marketing officer met with the ceo he's like this is my vision for our company's brand brand voice and they were like are you sure because this is a really bad move and goes god damn it all except nothing less msi at least has had the good sense to private that video we had to find it somewhere else but we did that video was one of the main inspirations for this video mom dad hey it's me steve this year to avoid any confusion i love this guy putting my wish list on video all i want is a computer it's just 849 and double throw in a free dvd upgrade i'm sort of all this steve's i know how much you love free stuff i actually love this happy holidays your son stephen he had to think about it for a minute yeah steve became like the quintessential like kind of chad name wait a second foreign your kids will use computers to learn oh this is cute we're looking out from the inside of the computer that's pretty cool i'd buy that for him deserve that oh my god you were hilarious on laughing gas by the way she doesn't remember oh oh my god what is that body horror okay wait is this kid growing yes yes yeah he has shame now oh that's how many times has he startled the globe okay i wish parenting were that easy this is an xbox commercial weird okay i want to have a cool theme make your phone look special follow me shine bright like a diamond let me show you some fantastic effects is this like a hobbyist like fan commercial or is this a real commercial official cyanogen mud you know what i'd go out with this guy he seems pretty cool all right okay download cm launcher 3d now it's to the point i don't feel the need to click away from it oh wow what an awful party [music] david directed a commercial or something like it's just really uncomfortable sponge cake [music] okay do you think we needed to see which game you opened before that or you think it's better if we don't know until i think it's better we don't know i think the party should have been people were having fun and it was wholesome before though it looked like kind of depressing yeah yeah overall that's a that's a b-plus oh no yes yes we are here is that your uncle did you invite him no he him he must have look it's funny this is not the worst acting we've seen today guys i'm actually pretty impressed al's amazing by the way he's not my actual uncle but i would totally go camping with him one misstep in this commercial is the character the character of uncle al was never introduced we we still haven't been close to him the camera that never gave him a medium close-up yeah this video shoot was the moment when i realized what a terrible father i'd been because both of my children especially my son thought that this was camping you told him you were going camping no i told him we were doing a video shoot and it was you know camping and he thought it was actual camping though because he's young because he hadn't been camping and he'd never been camping oh so like we've taken them every year since then little ltt short with my uncle roy that's a concept that didn't continue which they honestly would get as many conversions just with this part big giveaway yeah we'll be taking home okay yeah it's the end of it just like it's the end of the part of this video where you don't hear about our sponsor best buy in the metaquest 2 vr headset easy to set up the metaquest 2
