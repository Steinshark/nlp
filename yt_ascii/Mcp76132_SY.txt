hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about the 2.4 liter boxer engine that's going to be used in the 2022 subaru brz now a common complaint of the previous generation brz was that it didn't have enough power and it is going to gain some power now a lot of people i think are disappointed though that it is not getting a turbo charger and thus the you know increase in power that a turbocharger could provide but in this video we're going to be talking about why i'm actually happy with the decision and the route that subaru went with this engine i think it's very cool engine and so we're gonna look into some of the details of this engine and why it's a great pairing with this 2022 brz now you can think of the new brz engine as a bit of a combination between the old brz engine and subaru's latest turbocharged engine which came out in the ascent a 2.4 liter turbo and so this is a 2.4 liter naturally aspirated engine so it has the same bore and stroke 94 by 86 as the subaru ascent though it is naturally aspirated like the previous brz uses a high compression ratio 13.5 to one previously on the brz was 12.5 to 1 this requiring premium fuel however on the subaru ascent a lower compression ratio because it's turbocharged but it's able to get away with 87 octane gas so regular gas used on the ascent and it is using a turbo with 14.3 psi so you know nearly double the amount of air going into this engine versus this one from a pressure standpoint however this is able to take advantage of a few things like that premium gas and a higher compression ratio one of the things i'm excited to see carry over from the previous engine is the fact that it's using direct and port injection so when subaru went to the 2.4 liter turbo on the ascent it is just direct injection and this is using a similar block however it has direct and port injection as well and so we'll talk later on about why that's important our engine getting a bit of an rpm increase so redline is 7500 versus 7400 for the previous engine significantly greater than the ascent engines 6000 rpm 205 horsepower previously now we're up to 228 horsepower the ascent engine does have more 260 but the brz is getting a nice torque bump as well so'4 pound feet versus 156 previously and the really good news is that torque comes on a lot earlier at 3 700 rpm versus peak torque in the previous engine was at 6400 rpm so quite a bit earlier now compared to the ascent engine yes this does have quite a bit more torque 277 pound-feet starting at 2000 rpm 50 more than the brz however one of the very beautiful things i find about this new brz if you look at the lightest weight model so you know the entry level manual transmission versus the previous lightest model of the brz we have just 17 pounds of difference here about 2800 pounds regardless not a noticeable weight increase even though it does have you know a larger engine with significantly more power and torque so that is exciting to see that it's going to keep its handling characteristics i believe and yet still have that nice little bump in power well very easily you might say well jason i want more torque i want 50 more torque i want this engine in the brz not this engine and so i want to do this little thought experiment where we toy around with putting each of these engines in the brz and then seeing what the force pressing us against the seat actually is because that's ultimately what matters we get excited about acceleration and the more power you have the more acceleration you can have which is going to plant you further back into your seat and you know it's going to feel exciting so let's put the two engines in and see how they kind of compare because i think this engine can really hold its own so here we have our little model brz we've got our engine which goes to the transmission which goes to the final drive ratio which goes to our wheels and so what we're looking at here is we're going to have a vehicle that in second gear hits 60 miles per hour that's our goal hit 60 miles per hour in second gear that'll give us a good zero to 60 time we can put that in the magazines and everyone's going to want to buy our car right and so that's what our goal is now what we need to figure out is what is our gear ratio in order for that zero to that 60 mile per hour top speed in second gear so what is our second gear gear ratio here's our two engines one of them has a 6000 rpm redline one of them has a 7 500 rpm redline trying to figure out second gear we know our final drive ratio is 4.3 and we know our wheels are our size our tire size is 215 over 40 or'. so we can calculate the diameter from that gives us 24.8 inches or about 630 millimeters and so now we're trying to figure out if we're traveling 60 miles per hour what is our wheel rpm so 60 miles per hour one mile per minute we can figure out our rpm by multiplying the circumference of the tire pi times its diameter multiply that by rpm and that will give us our velocity so we can do the math and our rpm turns out to be 813.2 rpm that's our wheel rpm okay so if we know our wheel rpm we can multiply that by our gear ratios and that will give us our engine rpm so we know what our engine rpm is we know what our wheel rpm is we know what our final drive ratio is the only ratio we don't know is our second gear which we're hoping for 60 miles per hour so we solve this equation we get 813.2 we multiply that by 4.3 we multiply that by x our second gear ratio and we set that equal to our engine rpm 6000 rpm and that gives us a gear ratio of 1.716 if we are using the ascent engine and then we can do the same math using the brz engine same numbers except the only thing that changes our rpm our red line is 7 500 so that gives us a gear ratio x is equal to 2.145 now we want to figure out what is our wheel torque and so to figure out wheel torque we take our engine torque and we multiply it by the transmission gear ratio and the final drive gear ratio so for the ascent engine what we have is 277 pound-feet multiplied by our gear ratio which we calculated at 1.716 multiplying that by our final drive and we get a wheel torque of 2044 pound feet now if we do the same math for the brz we take our'4 pound feet multiply that by our gear ratio 2.145 multiply by 4.3 we get 1697. so although our engine had an improvement of 50 percent in torque or wheel torque the feeling will actually feel pressing against us is only improved by 20 and the reason for that is because if you have a higher redline you can use more aggressive gearing to reach the same vehicle speed so it does turn into an advantage having this high red line meaning you can get higher wheel torque and so yes what i could have just done instead of all this math is just taking 7 500 divided that by 6000 1.25 and multiplied that by this wheel torque right here and then compared those two numbers but you might have asked well why does that work and here's the math explaining why that works now the other thing to keep in mind okay so if we were to put this in this 2.4 liter turbo engine in the brz it would have an advantage you know 20 more wheel torque great that sounds good but also we're going to add weight so it's not even 20 it's probably going to be less than 20 because we have to add in weight in order to have this heavier turbocharged engine with the inner coolers and the turbo that kind of stuff you know the added you know if you have to compensate for that added torque with bigger brakes with you know bigger driveline components that sort of thing so it adds up and that means you know the real torque advantage the feeling pressing you into your seat isn't all that much greater if you were to go with the turbo engine now another exciting thing about this engine is the torque curve so the previous generation brz engine had a very well known flaw in that torque curve and that from about you know a little over 3000 rpm to a little below 5000 rpm it had a decent little dip in that torque curve and so that's disappointing and so you know i asked subaru why it has this they didn't give me a definitive answer but it does have that torque curve i've heard you know something saying it's emissions related ultimately it's probably something about you know airflow just at those rpm that it just doesn't work out whether it's the exhaust or the intake likely airflow impacting that torque curve there but ultimately it has a very high peak torque meaning you got to get those revs all the way up if you want that useful power and you know that mid-range has a dip in it which is just disappointing to have and so for the 2022 they have not released a torque curve however i did see a image of the you know the dash of the new brz and on that dash you can see the torque curve and it shows a significantly smaller dip i believe than the previous generation and on the previous generation brz the dip is shown quite well on the dash just like it is with the 2022 brz so exciting to see that there's not much of a torque dip there it looks like a small one but not like what it was and you're hitting that peak torque so much earlier on so you're able to carry that torque throughout a very large range of the engine rpm so it should be quite fun to have that even torque throughout the rpm so why no turbo well you know right off the bat easy answer cost and complexity if you wanted a turbocharged brz it's going to cost significantly more so custom complexity also another thing that was interesting is the subaru ascent engine has a bottom mounted turbo charger and so that would raise this engine up giving you a higher center of gravity and you know that's one of the key attributes of this brz is having such a low center of gravity very nimble and also you're going to add weight you know it could be about 100 pounds of added weight putting in all of the turbocharger equipment so you know having that weight versus keeping the weight nearly identical and yet giving you a decent little bump in power and torque i think that's going to be really fun and then finally we get to throttle response and i think this is kind of user dependent you know some people probably don't care as much about it as i do i think throttle response is a critically important attribute for how fun a vehicle is and you can't really be naturally aspirated in the world of combustion engines so super responsive pedal feel you don't have turbo lag you don't have to wait for a certain rpm for that turbo to actually be effective though that's less of an issue these days with our turbos that are spooling up you know pretty low rpm and then precise throttle control and a good example within subaru's lineup is the subaru wrx you know you get in that core you give it 50 throttle you get 100 of the acceleration you get full boost and it's like that's not what i asked for and so with naturally aspirated engines you have much more precise control you get exactly what you asked for with that throttle pedal so that to me is very important and if you wanted a turbocharged brz you know the supra exists unfortunately not with the manual transmission i wish they'd throw a manual in it but the supra exists i will say you know for the turbo people out there if it did come with a turbo from the factory one of the nice things about that is it makes it generally quite a bit easier to add a significant amount of power it's simply a flash tune and you've got quite a bit more torque than even what it's coming from the factory width so with naturally aspirated engines it's a bit more difficult to extract more power out of them and finally i want to talk about d4s so this is toyota's technology that they used in the first gen brz so using both port and direct fuel injection and they're carrying that over for this 2.4 liter so i'm excited to see the port injection one big benefit of that port injection helping to keep those intake valves clean not have deposits build up on them because those direct injectors cannot spray and clean off the intake valves so the overall schematic of how this looks you've got your fuel tank with a fuel pump that's sending low pressure through lines to your port injectors then you have a high pressure fuel pump that is pulling from those low pressure lines turning that into high pressure and then that is used that high pressure is used for the direct injectors so what this looks like in the engine of course you've got your cylinders laying flat as this is a boxer engine so you've got your intake manifold up top you've got the port injector spraying into that manifold into those runners leading to the piston and then directly firing into the cylinder you have the direct injector now what's the purpose so there's three different ways that you can now spray fuel into the engine you can just use port you can just use direct or you can use a combination of both so using port that's important for startup port is used exclusively for when you are just cranking and starting up the engine this helps give you a good air and fuel mixture it gives it more time for that air and fuel to mix of course if the engine is cold you're not going to have that fuel vaporized quite as easily so you want to use that port and give it as much time as possible port and direct this is used at kind of low rpm low load well mixed air fuel ratio and you're going to have stable and efficient combustion you can also choose to use a stratified charge where you have a really lean mixture from this port injector for most of the air fuel mixture and then you have a little rich pocket by that spark plug in the center and then you're able to combust that lean mixture and get efficient combustion and then finally if power is the desire at high rpm high load just using the direct injector for maximum power and this is because it has a cooling effect within the cylinder brings those temperatures down reduces the likelihood for knock and allows you to make the most power possible by advancing your ignition timing now one other thing i found interesting about this system is how they have their startup programmed and so it's kind of interesting the way they switch between these different modes for starting up the car so when you're strictly just starting the engine pushing that push start button you're just using port injection and then once the engine is running it switches over to port and direct and then it starts to use late ignition timing to help heat up that catalytic converter then once the catalytic converter is heated up it wants to focus on heating up the engine so it transitions to direct and then transitions to port and they said going this route is the way that they've you know had the smoothest transition for that engine idling and so then you're focusing on warming up the engine once your cat is warm by using just port and then once the engine is warmed up and you're just sitting there idling it will switch to just direct injection once everything's warm that's your idle your perfect idle control so interesting the startup strategy there if you just start the car and let it sit there and you know warm up that's the strategy that goes into it overall a very cool engine i'm quite excited about the fact that weight was maintained very closely and yet they got a nice bump in torque so i think it's going to be a fun thing to drive i'm looking forward to testing one out thank you all so much for watching and if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
