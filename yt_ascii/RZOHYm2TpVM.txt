there are things in life i don't like like mayonnaise on burgers or pineapple on pizza but there's only one thing that i truly cannot stand you gotta sell something i don't know what you gotta sell but you gotta sell something this is what's happening tonight it's the master class on how to go from zero to a seven figure revenue business when people say oh is this get rich quick you better hope that it is the get rich quick schemes that's actually how this channel started with the series called fake gurus dedicated to exposing all the grifters out there who got wealthy by selling people on how to get wealthies that sort of thing and there was a point at which believe it or not we were winning the war the message was getting out there hey don't buy a get rich quick ski but if i'm being honest we've been away for a while talking about krypto right and i've been slowly but surely hearing whispers on the wind that the grifters and fake gurus they're back and this time they've teamed up like a gang of hyenas they've realized their safety in numbers and to be honest i don't know if i can stop them i'm talking of course about jordan belfort and brian rose's alliance and course that's right the piss drinker of wall street and actual wall street fraudster together they have joined forces and individually sure i could probably take them but together i'm not so sure i'm worried that their powers of persuasion might be too much even for me coffeezilla the internet detective so i want to warn you guys ahead of time hold on to your wallets they may try to take them from you in this video and we're going to investigate the return of the fake gurus here at london real studios i will be hosting a two-day crypto defy nft and metaverse mastermind with the wolf of wall street himself jordan belfort [laughter] jordan is an industry titan who has become a household name for his ability to build multi-million dollar companies and work with the who's who of business and the blockchain no wait wait wait wait pause it real quick okay a lot to unpack here i feeling pretty unpersuaded to be honest with you first thing i got to say i love how they describe jordan belford as being famous for building multi-million dollar businesses i mean that's one way to frame it i guess i mean here i was i thought jordan belfort was famous for scamming people going to jail and then having leonardo dicaprio play him in a movie but you know who am i kidding i'm not hosting the crypto mastermind the wolf in the rose that's what they call this by the way the other thing i want to talk about real quick is the price for this two-day event this mastermind i mean how much would you pay to get the two titans of this industry teaching you a hundred bucks maybe two hundred dollars for two days wrong answer the price of going to this event is 24 000 ladies and gentlemen that's almost the price of a bitcoin just so you can hear the two biggest grifters on earth try to sell you on buying bitcoin i mean they really do pitch themselves in this as sort of the experts in the field of cryptocurrency with gourmet catering throughout each day and a strictly limited number of places available this is a unique opportunity to be personally tutored by two of the most recognizable former wall street traders who are now at the forefront of the crypto industry i mean once again i don't mean to quibble here but most recognizable how this is a more shameless duo than if elizabeth holmes and trevor milton started a how to start a business master class i mean you're right you'd be technically recognizable all right and can we just talk for a second about jordan belford i mean what happened to that guy i thought he was like teaching how to sell a pin or something instead he's selling investment advice again and you'd think he would have learned his lesson i mean he ruined his life as a scammer got federally indicted went to prison and then he came out he probably thought his life was over only to have his career resurrected by none other than leonardo dicaprio you'd think at that point you've made it right you've you've been the guy who got struck by lightning and survived you'd think you'd hang it up you'd ride it out being the guy who got the second chance and made the best of it but instead jordan belfort is selling shameless crypto masterminds and this isn't even his first one the new york times actually reported on a previous one he did charging 40 000 a pop which i guess the lowered price is because of brian rose being a part of it which makes sense and look i'm not saying this is illegal right they know that it's not illegal to sell overpriced courses it's just a pretty scummy disgusting thing to do because they know they don't know how to make you rich with crypto they don't know whether the price is going to go up down left right or sideways which is why instead of actually investing themselves and making money that way they sell you on how to do it and tell you that they're you're gonna make money i mean just to give you an idea of the absolute lack of credibility of these guys let's actually talk about some of the crypto calls they've made in the past brian rose for example on may 5th posted a live stream about tara luna saying why you need to know about it how it had all this value locked in it that was two days before it crashed to zero and brian deleted this tweet he also posted on may 3rd about crypto.com's best kept secret and why you need to know about chronos the day after they slashed their rewards and their price started to fall and plummet and look jordan belfort is a little bit better but only slightly like in 2017 he said bitcoin was bad but then in near march 2021 near the all-time high of bitcoin jordan belford all of a sudden jumps on the bandwagon and says he's a bull says it's going to 100k i think what happens first before anything long term is i think it goes higher technically probably to 100 000 or more but what happens over the long term i still think it's an open question i'm a bull certainly for the short term and i love blockchain technology overall now of course bitcoin did not go to a hundred thousand dollars in the short term and instead is trading at 27 000 which is half of the price you would have bought it at had you bought when jordan belfort suddenly jumped on the bitcoin bandwag and these are the guys mind you who are supposed to teach you the secrets of wealth in crypto the only real secret being that there's anyone still left buying these guys ridiculous courses because jordan belford is an actual former criminal who got indicted for defrauding people and brian rose is a well-known grifter who dances on a new topic every day one day it's the digital freedom platform then he's running for mayor now he's doing this defy grift which he will of course abandon as soon as it's inconvenient so if you're buying this understand that you're not learning about the opportunity you are the opportunity
