- sit on the toilet behind you. yeah, it's a little high up. sorry about that. last one of you to get off the toilet gets a chance at $1 million. (contestants cheering) and as weird as this sounds,
i'm actually being serious. here's what i mean. you are currently watching the
third video of this series. the first video is "last to fall" and the second was
"last to stop swinging." the winners of these four videos will compete in a fifth
video for $1 million. so we grabbed some toilets. we put some people on the toilets and we grabbed a million dollars. and now we're here. and today's video special. chandler's actually the
coach of two people, - josh and brian. - and chris is also the
coach of two people. - jenna and george. - if you guys win, chandler gets a hundred
grand of the million. same with chris. so they're motivated. feel free to make them do anything. and you guys can't rest
your feet on this thing. they have to remain dangling, 'cause you're literally
just sitting on a toilet and it can't be too easy. all right. it begins. (toilet flushes) so you've been on this
toilet for about two minutes. how do you feel? - i feel nothing. - same, i know. you've been on a toilet for
two minutes and 20 seconds. how do you feel? - it's pretty comfortable. - they've both been training. they spend a lot of time on the toilet. - you've been on the
toilet for three minutes. how do you feel? - i feel like a solid stool. - [chandler] good job. - how do you feel? it's been about three and a half minutes. - feel good. and i've spent a lot of time on the toilet practicing for just for this day. - as did i.
- made for this. - so, chandler, which of your
two people is your favorite? - oh, you gonna do that? - you could have just said both. (upbeat music) so we have a baby doll and a trash can. if you make it in the
trash, you get nothing. but if you miss, we jacked
up your toilet very slightly. start off with you. - you got this. sink it. buckets. (buzzer buzzes)
- [all] oh! - since you missed, we have to call in the plumber and he's gonna move
your toilet up slightly. if you won't notice much of a difference, it's on the first pump. how many did you do? so then we have to do two per. do you notice the difference? - nope. - after about 50, you'll
probably be literally hanging. throw away that baby doll.
(buzzer buzzes) plumber. there we go. with time, he'll go
higher, higher, higher. here's a little sneak peek
of what it'll looks like at the end. yes, he knows what not to do. (buzzer buzzes) give him a crank. your turn, sir. (buzzer buzzes) - jenny, how you feeling? - pretty good. gonna win it. - [mrbeast] how you feeling right now? - a little softer, but still firm. - feeling good. i'm definitely ready to win this. - here's a magazine. here's a magazine. here's a magazine. here's a magazine. we're about to do an hour long time lapse. and i didn't want you guys bored. (upbeat music) here's a plunger. here's a plunger. here's a plunger. here's a plunger. chandler, we have four bowling balls. - oh, those are actual bowling balls. - what do you think we're
doing with these balls? - bowling?
- no. - we're gonna see if they can
pick 'em up with a plunger. first one to do it wins. - is that possible?
- yes. - how far do they have to pick it up? - just an inch off the ground. - all right. - there's a certain way to do this. it's top secret. okay, so whoever stops trying
last is actually the winner. it's literally impossible. you can't pick a bowling
ball up with a plunger. you wanna give us to countdown? - three.
- go! (dramatic music) - [cameraman] can you reach? (dramatic music) - [brian] got it. - [chandler] oh, he got it, he got it. - [cameraman] was it not
supposed to be, be possible? - you can't pick up bowling
balls with a plunger. - the challenge was whoever
got mad and quit first won, but you actually got it. you won in an unconventional way. how can this plunger
pick up a bowling ball? we're gonna give you some squatty potty so you can rest your legs. - [brian] helping us out? - nope. i need something else. - [chandler] here you go, sire. - you now get it for five minutes. so do you feel relieved? - yes, a lot actually. brings all the pressure off my leg. - yo, we have the same hat.
- wow. - all right, what can i get you guys that will make it easier? - a lot of snickers.
- snickers. - maybe a dog? - that's a lot more difficult than candy, but i'll look into it. i guess if a dog will help me get a hundred thousand
dollars, i'll get her a dog. if that's really what she wants. all right, i got you guys candy. i'm working on the dog. i know you want some snickers bar. i think there's some snickers in there. yeah. and i got gummy bears, and i know you like the sour patch kids. you guys are gonna do great. gonna help me out. let's do it. the dog that has been requested. oh, she came right to you. does that make things easier for you? - yeah.
- oh. - yeah, i love dogs. - does anybody else wanna see the dog? - [josh] absolutely.
- you wanna pet him? - oh, that sucks, get a better fit. - chris, like, honestly, i'm starting to not like you at all now. - you had your feet up
so it's easier, yep. - i hate to ruin your
pooping conversation, but your five minutes is up, sir. so we're just gonna. there we go. (upbeat music) - josh, what would you like to eat? - chicken nuggets. - all right, what would you like? - i want something that you
recommend that's from this area. - why do they always do this to me? - i'm gonna get our food delivered. so i'm gonna give you guys the phone. y'all pass it back and forth,
get whatever y'all want. it's on me. we got the popeye's. we got some nuggies. we got tarter sauce and ranch. who got tartar sauce? what's wrong with you? - [cameraman] your coach got
you food and chandler didn't. - [mrbeast] there's no way. - [cameraman] oh! - oh my god! i will never hit that in a million years. - turn the lights red. this is very serious. take this plunger and do a plunger flip. - [chris] you got it. don't worry. any second now. - plunger flip. plunger flip. and if you land it like that, you win and we'll put two squatty potties if you don't and you land it
like that, we do two cranks. this is a big deal. we're gonna go down the line. this is why the lights are red. it's a big deal. (buzzer buzzes) - this is gonna be hard. you ain't gotta do 'em like that, man. - here you go. - all day. (buzzer buzzes)
except for today. - just nail this and
everything will be fine. - i got it. - i can't believe he just did that. (buzzer buzzes)
(jenny laughs) fourth time. - [cameraman] he doesn't win these. (buzzer buzzes)
oh. too much back spin on it. - if you're ever in a mrbeast video, practice your plunger flips. - all right, you've had a couple of pumps. how do you feel? - feel great. - so you can take a couple of pumps. how about you? - pumped up, got a lot of energy left. - get it. - chris, we forgot something. - what? - lights back to normal. - oh we did forget it, thank you. thank you. you guys are gonna win it. and then one of you is gonna win. i don't know who that's gonna
be, but you're gonna do great. - all right, josh.
- senpai. - had a lot of cranks back there. - yeah.
- you leaning a little bit. so how are you doing? - i'm doing fine. - good luck, duck.
(duck quacks) (upbeat music) - there is a million dollars on the line. what would you buy if you won? - a house, a car, pay off parent's debt. - chris, with your a hundred
grand what would you buy? - a lot of food. like a lot.
- good. - unhealthy amount. - if you won the million
dollars, what would you buy? - a pomeranian. - how about you, sir? - i would buy my mom a house, and i would put more money
into my youtube channel. i need to buy my house as well. - two houses, okay, okay. - i would definitely buy a house, probably pay off my mom's
house and get a car, and then just spend
much of money on my son. - oh, that's sweet. i kind want you to win. - i kind of want me to win too. - but only one of you guys wins. - i'm gonna get another car. i'm gonna get a really, really nice car, and probably an animal. (upbeat music) - hey, chandler, you can flush
all your hopes and dreams of winning down the drain. - oh, what'd you say to me? - (screams) tp! ow! (chris grunting) don't you throw a plunger at me! - that should've took
care of that right there. - can i just borrow this, sir? - i bought this for my contestant. - make it in mouth and we'll
give him a squatty potty. - that's risky, sir. - oh! give him a squatty potty! - we'll give you a squatty
potty when we're done. (buzzer buzzes) - [cameraman] you hit
her right on her shirt. - all right.
(drum rolls) all right. two people have won so far. - two for two! here you go. - [cameraman] they both get them. - [brian] i had it. - you're welcome. we're gonna call his mommy. here's your son, see?

of just stare at people, but he is a good guy. - any takers? you're tired. - you're tired. there's no shame in the game. you've lasted longer than
chandler could ever dream to last. - if you're not gonna be
good for like another day you might as well just end it now. there's no need.
