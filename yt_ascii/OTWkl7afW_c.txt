i can guarantee you that whatever wi-fi speed you're getting at home is slower than what it says on your router's box even if you're sitting right next to the antennas but why and how can the router companies get away with putting these speeds on their marketing if it doesn't reflect reality it's like the feeling you get when you compare the burger in the picture to the one you actually get well those speeds on your router are theoretically possible in other words what you'd be getting under optimal conditions but the bad news is those optimal conditions don't really exist one big reason why is interference this can come from many sources other wi-fi networks wireless controllers drones and even microwave ovens among other things these can all mess with your signal but what if you live in the middle of nowhere you have no gadgets in your house besides a router and a laptop and you only ever use a toaster oven you'll still be fighting against obstructions like walls and furniture and even if you have a clear line of sight between you and the router you still have to think about signal attenuation just as a radio station gets more staticky the farther away you drive from it the radio waves that make up wi-fi signals invariably get weaker over distance this is especially true with higher frequency signals on the 5 and 6 gigahertz wi-fi bands the higher the frequency the more data they can carry and the faster they'll be but the laws of physics also dictate that they'll be shorter range adding more power to boost the signal often isn't an option as there are legal limits on how much power a wireless router can put out in order to stop it from interfering with other electronics this means if you get too far away or there's just too much interference to where the router and client can't reliably hear each other they have to negotiate a slower speed as sending less data over a certain frequency is a good way to stabilize the connection so it might end up working just fine but you won't see anything close to the speed on the box but did you know that even if you could reach those unicorn-like optimal conditions like in our country house with just a laptop right beside the router that number on the box is still probably exaggerated like grossly exaggerated we'll tell you why right after we thank secret lab for sponsoring this video secret lab chairs are engineered to keep you incredibly comfortable for long hours at work and play their titan evo 2022 chair it features four-way lumbar support ultra comfy lines of different seat materials and more all chairs come with up to a five year extended warranty and a 49-day return policy so head to the link in the description and check out secret lab today even under the best conditions possible you'll still need to make sure your devices support the same revision of wi-fi as the router and have the same number of spatial streams to take advantage of the full bandwidth the vast majority of client devices phones laptops etc don't support more than two spatial streams so even if your router supports more that speed on your box won't reflect what you actually get on one device but it can help in terms of performance when multiple devices are doing something bandwidth heavy like streaming video but this wi-fi 6 router is a great example of something even more egregious it promises you'00 megabits per second of speed wow in all likelihood that's way faster than your home internet connection but upon closer inspection that number is derived from adding the 5 gigahertz and the 2.4 gigahertz speeds together and wi-fi 6 just doesn't work that way you have to pick one band or the other so while the'00 is technically correct in that it's the right theoretical total bandwidth it's very misleading in terms of what people think of when they hear speed and we also have to say a quick word about channel width if we're talking about wi-fi 6 you can have channels up to 160 megahertz wide meaning lots of space to move data but not only are some devices unable to receive a 160 megahertz signal you open yourself up to a lot more potential interference and signal attenuation meaning many folks have found 160 megahertz channels to be fairly unreliable and although wi-fi 7 is on its way soon which will support broadcasting on multiple bands at once and better performance with y channels this doesn't mean we should let manufacturers off the hook for their borderline dishonest claims about their products or expect that they'll label their wares in a more realistic way going forward but of course we're not trying to say it's as egregious as something like the hawaii chair that was crazy so thanks for watching guys if you like this video hit like hit subscribe and hit us up in the comments section with your suggestions for topics that we should cover in the future
