nfts are here and they're quite polarizing a lot of people wonder what's the value well today we find out i'm joined by my buddy leon lush yes sir who's a commentator who has gotten very interested in nfts like myself and today i want to challenge us challenge you leon in a battle of what nfts are truly worth do they have inherent value so i've had a third party collect some nfts of all all values sizes shapes and today we're going to guess the price and winner gets the very distinguished title of king of crypto now i know oh that is distinguished that's important for me yeah i know myself included i i take this job very seriously and i'd hate to hand it over to someone like yourself with all respect and love of course so let's get started this is guess the price of the nft let's go i am pumped you excited yeah dude i'm excited listen there's nothing i like more than speculating and right now we're sw normally when i speculate i lose a bunch of money but right now i'm not going to lose anything except maybe the kip the crypto king title so i'm excited right right right all right let's get this started round one this is a guess the price of the nfc okay i guess it's multiple choices i didn't set this up blue eyes white okay part of the rare pepe crew these are early on chain nfts oh you know your stuff oh my god so i don't know how rare so there's so many different ones and a lot of them come in like different issuance amounts so i'm gonna i want to take a stab i want to say five eth so what is what is that in price what does that give you okay right right now five eighth about 20k all right i'm going 40k okay i'm just stab in the dark i have no idea oh okay oh multiple choice now that's right so all right so did you say 40k one of your answers i'm locked in i'm locked in so you're locked in at 40. so i'm gonna i'm gonna probably guess a now that i'm seeing these answers so you're bma i think it's a hundred thousand dollars all right of course that makes sense yeah that that totally makes sense right all right in my defense it says at the time so now that we're in a bit of an nft bear market maybe it's closer to my price or your price but no yeah that's probably one of the rare i guess pepes okay yep 998 crypto punk white hair is a relatively rare trait i believe i'm gonna look at the multiple choice i know the floor at the time he grabbed these i love that 502 is a choice oh man that's not the answer nope nope for the white one i think the floor was probably like 240. i'm gonna say c half a million dollars for this that's i know for a fact that it's c but you know i have insider knowledge on this this is actually not a real trade this was a wash trade this wasn't this wasn't a real trade the guy half a million dollars that was 533 half a billion dollars yeah half a billion dollars that's a wash tray i remember this on twitter as well yeah he flash traded himself as like a meme to either drive up the price or just to be funny about it all right i think okay yeah we both get that so we're one to one right now yeah let's get to this next one la cunar a shallow depression now this one i feel like i am not familiar with it oh it's a video too nice [music] now we're getting places it's very ominous that's it that's it okay okay so i'm gonna go ahead and say what i think this is worth the closest thing to what i think this is worth which is sixteen hundred dollars i think it's worth about a dollar to be honest but yes i think i'm going with a myself yep i'm unfamiliar i think this one he's trying to get us on yeah easy yeah all right hey is that a we're two for three right now is that a testament to like maybe not all the nfts are the most expensive because sometimes you see these things like there are some like some of the x copy stuff some of the art block stuff that is relatively interesting from an art perspective still feels super overvalued occasionally when you see him selling for like three four hundred thousand dollars you can understand from like an art speculation that just looked like a six-year-old figured out how to use windows movie maker well yeah but then you have the eth rock but okay so then there's the other side the other extreme which is the more stupid it is the more expensive it is yeah so there's that too all right we're round two we're through round one two out of three both of us so round two which still there will be no nft sold for the most amount so this is going to be a comparison thing oh this is spider-man okay good stuff harry good stuff lopez likes to stick his long nose into the other pros business i i'm gonna go with a i'd have no idea but i just think the a is the more relevant i was going with a2 yeah i'm spider-man you know what i'll go b you know why not because i really believe in it but because it sounds like it's part of a crypto collection and those always do yes well son of a yeah that's right that's right dude just put it in series of a thousand and people love it i don't know what it is right like what's better than a one of one a one of 10k yeah yeah exactly okay this is this is impossible oh the pudgies yup i'm locking b in right now you're looking b and c now i think it's gonna have to be a because it looks like it's got like the pineapple's gonna be a rare trait so i'm going a oh shoot that's a good point ah yes sir yes sir 400 400k dude let's go that's definitely a rare yeah it's like the dude for five thousand dollars 100 people with a pudgy due rag right i haven't seen the pineapple one very good showing your skills here listen pays to waste your entire life on twitter oh my which sold for the most amount of money i'm i'm gonna go with because that's the only one i've seen out of those two but a oh man but a does look like it could have been like an establishment it could have been like an establishment i'm gonna go a cause i would rather have a yes i'm gonna stick with b but i like you i like your answer because okay i'm just gonna say this either a sold for a lot of money it was a one-of-one rare thing or you just like blew me out of the water of course of course and you're sold for 200 000 well mine sold for a hundred dollars yes you can never go wrong with the collection dude final round here we go guess the price of the nft to the closest amount okay this is what we tried to do initially yeah yeah this is this is where you can't you can't fake this okay you can't fake this knowledge man yeah doge kitty kitties all right i'm gonna go ahead i'm gonna we have to write that this down yeah yeah that makes sense that makes sense i gotta pay a pen get something i got pen and paper right here okay i'm gonna go ahead man okay 50k i went going i went 12k oh man wait sold for 2e 375 dollars when was this that means i have no idea i mean that means eth was worth 170 at the time oh it was worth it yeah right so this is so this must have just been held for i don't know a year two years maybe if you're looking at last sale so but if we're going i guess we gotta go on price of the time yeah we gotta go a price at the time because that's what the person felt like they were paying but that means you win and you're up two which puts me my back against the wall here bad and i need to i need to tie it up here i almost minted the crypto dad but then i realized doing anything on ethereum is like pouring paint then in your eyes so i decided not to [laughter] minting especially so we are guessing at the time when do you remember when this was this isn't too long ago a couple months couple probably like three two and a half three months ago peak hype i would say i'm gonna tell you this right now leon that's a critical mistake you just made i just sucked you for all the information yeah i can't believe you fell for that my nemesis listen i am a benevolent and a loving crypto king all right i will i will i will spread some i will spread some some bread out for the ducks i'm gonna go this okay i got 20k i got 50k which i think might be aggressive but that's very aggressive 160. yes sir i'm getting i'm getting absolutely crushed right now dude what bug 16 yeah that's definitely one of their top 10 rares in there you know what i'm realizing i should have started at a more manageable opponent here all right you know i didn't realize how much you you you were how much you were on crypto twitter here i don't have a lot of i don't have a lot of friends in real life right i just spent my days on my cell phone looking at jpegs yeah it said post pandemic syndrome just side note who would have thought that so many people if you just pay people to look at jpegs they will do it yeah oh yeah absolutely or or don't you could actually take their money and they'll still look at it kill frog 3376 all right let's look let's see what this is i'm gonna go ahead and say all right i'm not gonna i may be spreading disinformation here but i'm gonna say this is an 100k item you're i feel like you're close so again this is a generative one obviously 10k pfp mint dracula is typically a rare trait so i would put him in like the top 20 to 40 out of 10k so i think hundreds not too crazy i'm going to say i'm going to say 120k i'm gonna prices write you a little bit but you still have the whole you have the whole window under 100 so it could be i'm not sure how popular this actual collection is so that could be my my bad i think you're gonna go way off here but oh man that was close oh that's close baby wow damn dude i was actually about to change my answer at the end there and be like i'm changing going like a hundred dollars and thank god i didn't no no you nailed it so man that was that was without a doubt the closest one we'll have today off by a couple thousand direction is that wait i think that might be the game ball game i'm down one oh bonus round thank you harry thank you can we get some bonus round music please huh so this is not familiar with the meme or wherever this is from it looks like a pepe chad it looks rare it does look rare i don't think it's part of a collection though see that before it told us like if it was it had like a number this is just this is hard mode this is what you get for going to the bonus round yeah this is all the marbles on the line oh man that thing looks so rare i feel like i should know this collection too but everything is just 24 pixels all right i know what i'm doing i know what i'm doing all right i'm i'm bumping it up whoa okay 150 for me 110. okay let's go let's see what it is sold for eight thousand six hundred sixty six dollars yes the king of crypto is here oh my god this this feels so rigged dude wow
