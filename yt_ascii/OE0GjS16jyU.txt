some of the fascinating work you've done is in the space of supersymmetry symmetry in general can you describe first of all what is supersymmetry ah yes so you remember the two buckets i told you about perhaps earlier said there are two buckets in our universe so now i want you to think about drawing a a pie that has four quadrants so i want you to cut the piece of pie in fourths so when quadrant i'm going to put all the buckets that we talked about like that are like the electronic corks in a different quadrant i am going to put all the force carriers the other two quadrants are empty now if you i showed you a picture of that you'd see a circle there would be a bunch of stuff in one upper quadrant and stuff in others and then i would ask you a question does that look symmetrical to you no no and that's exactly right because we humans actually have a very deeply programmed sense of symmetry it's something that is part of that mystery of the universe so how would you make it symmetrical one way you could is by saying those two empty quadrants had things in them no so and if you do that that's supersymmetry so that's what i understood when i was a graduate student here in at mit in 1975 when the idea when the mathematics of this was first being born supersymmetry was actually born in the ukraine in the late 60s but we have this thing called the iron curtain so we westerners didn't know about it but by the early 70s independently there were scientists in the west who had rediscovered supersymmetry bruno cimino and julius vests were their names so this was around 71 or 72 when this happened i started graduate school in 73 so around 74 75 i was trying to figure out how to write a thesis so that i could have become a physicist the rest of my life i did a had a great advisor professor james young who had taught me a number of things about electrons and weak forces and those sorts of things but i decided that if i was going to have a really opportunity summize my chances of being successful i should strike it out in a direction that other people were not studying and so as a consequence i survey ideas that were going that were being developed and i came across the idea of supersymmetry and it was so the mathematics was so remarkable that i just it bowled me over i actually have two undergraduate degrees my first undergraduate degree is actually mathematics and my second is physics even though i always wanted to be a physicist plan a which involved getting good grades was mathematics i was a mathematics major thinking about graduate school but my heart was in physics if we could take a small digression what's to you the most beautiful idea in mathematics that you've encountered in this interplay between math and physics it's the idea of symmetry the fact that our innate sense of symmetry want wines of aligning with just incredible mathematics to me is the most beautiful thing it's very strange but true that if symmetries were perfect we would not exist so even though we have these very powerful ideas about balance in the university of some sense it's only when you break those balances that you get creatures like humans and objects like planets and stars so although they are a scaffold for reality they cannot be the entirety of reality so i i'm kind of naturally attracted to parts of science and technology where symmetry plays on a dominant role and not just i guess symmetry as you said but the the magic happens when you break the symmetry the magic happens when you break the symmetry okay so diving right back in you mentioned four quadrants yes - - or filled with stuff we can do buckets yeah and then there's crazy mathematical thing ideas for filling the other two what are those things so earlier the way i described these two buckets is i gave you a story that started out by putting us in a dust was to flashlights and i said turn on your flashlight i'll turn on mine the beans will go through each other and the beams are composed of force carriers called photons they carry the electromagnetic force and they pass right through each other so imagine looking at the mathematics of such an object which you don't imagine people like me do that so you take that mathematics and then you ask yourself a question you see mathematics is a palette it's just like a musical composer is able to construct to construct variations on a theme well a piece of mathematics in the hand of a physicist something that we can construct variations on so even though the mathematics that maxwell gave us about light we know how to construct very issues on that and one of the very issues you can construct is to say suppose you have a force carrier for electromagnetism that behaves like an electron that in that it would bounce off of another one it's that's changing a mathematical term in equation so if you did that you would have a force carrier so you would say first it belongs in this force carrying bucket but it's got this property of bouncing off like electrons and so you say well gee wait no that's not the right bucket so you're forced to actually put it in one of these empty quadrants so those sorts of things we basically we give them so the photon mathematically can be accompanied by a photino it's the thing that carries a force but has the rule of bouncing off in a similar manner you could start with an electron and you say okay so right now the mathematical electron i know how to do that a physicist named dirac first told us how to do that back in the nineteen late 20s early 30s so take that mathematics and then you say let's let me look at that mathematics and find out what in the mathematics caused us two electrons to bounce off of each other even if i turn off the electrical charge so i could do that and now let me change that mathematical term so now i have something it carries electrical charge but if you take two of them i'm sorry if you turn their charges off they'll pass through each other so that puts things in the other quadrant and those things we till we tend to call we put the s in front of their name so in the lower quadrant here we have electrons and this now newly filled quadrant we have select ron's and the quadrant over here we had corks over here we have squirts so now we've got this balance pie and that's basically what i understood as a graduate student in 1975 about this idea of supersymmetry that it was going to fill up these two quadrants of the pie in a way that no one had ever thought about before so i was amazed that no one else at mit found this an interesting idea so that's it led to my becoming the first person in mit to really steady supersymmetry this is 1975 76 77 and in 77 i wrote the first phd thesis in the physics department on this idea because i just i was drawn to the balance drawn to the symmetry so what boundary what does that first of all is this fundamentally a mathematical idea so how much experimental and we'll have this theme it's an really interesting one when you explore the worlds of the small and in your new book talking about approving is that right right that will also talk about there's this theme of kind of starting and exploring crazy ideas first in the mathematics and then seeking for ways to experiment to validate where do you put some supersymmetry and that's it's closer than string theory it is not yet been validated in some sense you mentioned einstein so let's go there for a moment in our book proofing einstein right we actually do talk about the fact that albert einstein in 1915 wrote a set of equations which were very different from newton's equations and describing gravity these equations made some predictions that were different from newton's predictions and it actually made three different predictions one of them was not actually a prediction but a post diction because it was known that mercury was not orbiting the sun in the way that newton would have told you and so i science theory actually makes describes mercury orbiting in the way that was observed as opposed to what newton would have told you is that well it's one prediction the second prediction that came out of the theory of general relativity which einstein wrote in 1915 was that if you if so let me describe an experiment and come back to it suppose that a glass of water and i filled it up filled the glass up and then i moved the glass slowly back and forth between our two faces it would appear to me like your face was moving even though you weren't moving i mean it's actually and what's causing it is because the light gets bent through the glass has it passes from your face to my eye so einstein in his 1915 theory of general relativity found out that gravity has the same effect on light as that glass of water it would cause beams of light tube in now newton also knew this but einstein's prediction was that light would bend twice as much and so here's a mathematical idea now how do you actually prove it well you've got to watch yes just a quick pause on that just the language you're using he found out i can say he did a calculation it's a really interesting notion that the one of the most and one of the beautiful things about this universe is you can do a calculation and and combined with some of that magical intuition that physicists have actually predict what would be what's possible to experiment to validate that's correct so he found out and in the sense that there seems to be something here and mathematically should bend gravity should bend light this amount and so therefore that's something that could be potentially and then come up with an experiment that could be validated right and that's the way that actually modern physics deeply fundamental modern physics is how it works you earlier we spoke about the higgs boson so why did we go looking for the answer is they had back in the late 60s and early 70s some people wrote some equations and the equations predicted this so then we went looking for you
