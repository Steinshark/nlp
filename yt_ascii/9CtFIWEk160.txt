well the good news is that skynet's probably gonna happen you know the bad news is you're probably gonna be alive during it because chad's gpt can now see hear and speak so guess what you know all those weird images dolly generates where it's like the guys are walking and there's just like pile of human body parts with like a gun sticking out of it because that's just what it imagines people laying down it will now tell you those nice nightmares in the voice of samuel l jackson so that you can go to sleep with right that's what you get you get all of that for free we are beginning to roll out a new voice and image capabilities in chat jeopardy they offer new and more intuitive type of interface by allowing you to have a voice conversation or show jeopardy what you're talking about their training data cut off in 2021 trust us okay the training data of chat gpt cut off in 2021 we all know it's a fact they definitely haven't been training chat gpt5 we know it to be true oh it's 2022 now even better all right we are now beginning to roll out a new voice and image capabilities in chat jeopardy they offer new and more intuitive type of interface okay we already read that one nice job just replacing it maybe they should have considered chat gbt to help him write their article head voice and image give you more ways to use chat chipity in your life snap a picture of a landmark while traveling and have a live conversation about what's interesting about it oh man talk about history getting hallucinated dude because it's not like chad gpt doesn't just lie to you it is okay first off it is exciting why are you guys acting that way of course that's exciting just for a moment i know it's just the end of correct history that's all history will live on in incorrectness when you're home snap a picture of your fridge and pantry to figure out what's for dinner that would be sweet i'm not gonna lie to you that would be pretty awesome that would be pretty dang awesome if i could just open up and just like snap a picture of a bunch of stuff and be like help me make dinner tell me what i need it better be good this is a pretty good use case honestly that would be a pretty good use case i would like that unless if they just hallucinate the difference between paprika and cumin okay very disastrous really that's a follow-up questions for a step-by-step recipe after dinner help your child with a math problem by taking a photo circling the problem set and having to share hints with both of you or you could just learn math and teach your child i'm just saying it's it's not like it's hard okay the nice part is i know that i i at least can help my kids through high school that's kind of like my goal was that no matter what they do i should be able to help them through high school and also chat gpt is incredibly bad at math this did you see those did you see that study about chat gpt if you tell chat gpt to take deep breaths it does better with math look at how effed up that thing is it just literally mimics human behavior hey there robot take a deep breath okay your actual answer is this do you are you happy that you're getting answers and code from something that you need to remind it to breathe the thing that can't breathe you is now you need the reminded i'd actually fear chat gpt less if it were much better llms process natural texts is so error prone and potentially rng that it's terrifying that skynet might do something accidental rather than intentional that's actually a fair take that is a fair take the chance of chat gpt accidentally launching a nuke versus chachi pt maliciously launching a nuke it's probably a fair take anyways all right we're rolling out the voice and images to chat jeopardy to plus and enterprise users over the next two weeks voice is coming on ios and android opt-in in your settings terrifying they're recording us all and images will be available on all platforms speak with chat gpt and have it all talk back you can now use voice to engage in a back and forth conversation with your assistant speak to the devil himself speak it with with it on the go request a bedtime story for your family dear goodness gracious what is it gonna do to you imagine an entire set of kids being raised by chat gpd it's worse it's just humans without critical thinking literally just the law of averages with standard d instead of standard standard deviation it just has standard error how much is it gonna break i don't know all right to get started with voice chat you got to do all this kind of crap this i mean oh here here's a little a little example once in a tranquil woodland there was a fluffy mama cat named lily lila lila lila one sunny day she cuddled with her playful kitten milo under the shade of an old oak tree milo lila began her voice soft and gentle you're going to have a new playmate soon milo's ears perked up curious a new playmate my mom horde again yeah little baby sister we all know what cats do okay they're disgusting i had three cats and then i had 16 cats in a matter of weeks this [ __ ] sucks cats are disgusting they literally get pregnant have babies and then they're off try to get pregnant again they're wild they're impossible they sound more like they all pervert from from family guy hey there hey milo hey guess what milo i got a little playmate coming your way don't worry milo we can just go we can go get that playmate together oh no oh no i'm gonna get it canceled stop it chad stop giving me great ideas reported hr well bloody hell you do it way too well thank you thank you very much you're welcome everybody you're welcome for that the name is chad gbt reading speaking and reading images is most certainly going to end with a lot of really really problematic points because here's the deals that once they start getting all this data they start training it really really well i mean you gotta think of the implications here right they don't like you they can make a whole bunch of extrapolations hey chad gpt give me all the people that act like this act like that i don't know i'm always freaked out about those kind of things because now not only do you have something that just gets stuff wrong they're going to start making it to use decision to make decisions about people i don't know i don't like it i don't like the idea freaks me out okay freaks me out don't tread on me that's it again
