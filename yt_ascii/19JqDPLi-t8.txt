that interview i did for the qa was the worst interview of my life to this day what is up guys welcome back to tech intern my name is jason goodison i'm a software engineer at microsoft and i'm here today to talk about rejection as an intern that thing that we all absolutely hate so i'm a six time intern and i interned across three countries and two continents a lot of people hear that and they assume that you know i just waltzed in and you know had any pick at any tech job that i wanted and you know that i'm like a fantastic genius listeners talk to me all the time and tell me oh i'm so excited that i can even talk to you like you're an engineer at microsoft that's so cool like that that's incredible that's my goal and when i was you know in my first two years university i thought the exact same way i thought you know i could never be smart enough to be an engineer at microsoft like that's beyond that's beyond me so today i want to talk a bit about the failure and the failure that ended up getting me into microsoft i want to show you guys that failure is something that we all experience in tech especially as interns so the first thing about failure is i feel like we shouldn't even be using that word when we say that we get rejected from internships we get rejected from jobs we often use the word failure like we failed to do this we failed to do that but the truth is it's not a failure like applying to a job and not getting the job does not mean that you failed if anything it it's teaching you and you're learning and you're getting better every single time you're learning what recruiters like about your projects and about your life and every single time you're getting a little bit more information it's a little bit more piece to the puzzle it's not failing until you give up until you say you know what i am not smart enough for these jobs or i don't even want an internship that's failure like that there is locked in failure because the rest of it is just a story it's a it's a way that you're getting to where you want to be but once you give up that's failure so like i said i thought that i was not smart enough to be an engineer at microsoft in fact when i was in university i remember i applied to microsoft and google for the first two years and then i never applied again i actually did not apply to any of the fang companies for the majority of my time at waterloo the reason for it was i just thought i was not smart enough but i did an internship at yahoo and i worked with an engineer at yahoo who was an intern with me and then when it was time to full-time jobs he applied to microsoft and he actually got the job at microsoft and i remember being so baffled like but he can do it like we worked on the same team and he's a smart guy but he's not significantly smarter than me like if he can do it then surely i can do it so guess what i applied and i got the full-time job like if if i had never heard that from my friend and just been okay with that failure and just gave up i would not be where i am right now so that's the number one thing guys you cannot give up you got to treat this like those rejections you got to treat them just like stepping stones not like failure failure is giving up rejection is part of the process okay so let's talk about my time at waterloo when i was applying to internships let's say i applied to let's say 80 internships i applied to 80 internships for each of my six internships okay and every time i apply to an internship i got like i think i would get like five interviews every time i had to apply to internships so i'm doing 80 applications i'm getting five interviews that's a that's a recall rate of like six percent i think let me check that math 6.25 that's a callback rate of 6.25 percent yeah i'm talking with people that tell me all the time that they're getting rejected from 10 jobs and it makes them feel like they they want to give up it's part of the process the last the very last point i want to leave you guys off on first off if you're getting any value out of this i highly recommend liking and subscribing to the channel it helps me out a lot the very last point i want to talk about is this one particular job interview that had me feeling really down this was my worst ever job interview so i had applied to work at blackberry i sent a bunch of applications in and i got two interviews one of them was for a qa position and the other one was for just a regular dev position as a bluetooth engineer i went to do the very first one which was the bluetooth one and they asked me a bunch of questions like very low level questions things i had never been asked before especially you know being so early on in in my university career here's one of the questions how do you determine the endianness of a system like you have a computer and you run this program it'll tell you am i even saying that right endianness or is it endiness basically like our bits read left to right or right to left i write a program to do that and i had to ask them to define what endingness was like was it big endian or little endian i didn't know either of those definitions so i came out of that in that interview just feeling absolutely horrible they also asked me to find a loop in a linked list and guess what i didn't get that question either so i left there feeling horrible but it was okay right i had the interview the next day for the qa so i went back for the qa the next day and this was the worst interview i've ever done in my entire life essentially they i stepped in and i was not privy to how qa engineers go interviews go i really should have researched it and studied for it but i wasn't smart enough to do that so essentially they were saying okay what if you had a problem at work what would you do and i would say what i would do like i would try this i would try that and they said what if that wouldn't work and i would give them another solution to say what if that wouldn't work i'd give them another solution and they just kept drilling in what if that didn't work what if that didn't work what if that didn't work all the way until i was like i've tried everything like if if i still couldn't get it i would ask my boss and then they said what if your boss wasn't in today and i felt like giving up i felt like i just wanted to stand up and leave the room like i couldn't do that anymore like i felt like i was being attacked from all angles they started telling me i was contradicting myself i just felt horrible like i actually felt so bad coming out of that interview so fast forward about a week or two and i get an email from the bluetooth the very first interview i did at blackberry the one where i couldn't tell the endianness of the system and i was given the offer i was given the offer to the job and i was completely blindsided by that like i didn't think that they would even consider my application after that interview and they ended up doing it and i ended up working like fairly closely in proximity to the guy that gave me the worst interview of my life in that qa job so the point is just because you can't get into a company through one door doesn't mean you're not smart enough to get through the company like that that interview i did for the qa was the worst interview of my life to this day yet i got in through another door even though that interview was also bad if an interview is hard it's hard for everyone right so it was hard for me and i went and i thought that i must have failed but you know what if it's hard for me it's hard for everyone if it's hard for you it's hard for other people okay just because you get rejected from a company does not mean that door is closed there's not one door into a company there's tons of doors into a company i really hope you guys enjoyed this episode of tech and turn and check out some more of our videos subscribe below and hit the like button i know everybody
