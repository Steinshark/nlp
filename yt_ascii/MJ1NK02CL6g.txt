[music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] at this point i'm completely blinded by tire smoke and yet the thermal camera sees perfectly clearly after the burnout you can see the garage floor covered in hot rubber and the rear brakes have heated to over 300 degrees celsius or about 600 fahrenheit the rotors even got a bit of color from getting so hot the tires themselves have now turned into a pile of debris it's time for newer nicer wider rubber if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below thanks for watching [applause] [music] you
