shanghai micro electronics equipment or smee is china's ambitious project to replace asml the company has been around for a while and they have received a lot of attention and cheerleading in the chinese media but recent high-profile export bans to china have brought them special focus in this video we're going to take a closer look at this undercover company what they have been able to produce and how they are doing so far i lean pretty heavily on a deep dive profile by equal ocean about s-m-e-e i highly recommend it for additional detail if you are curious to learn more about this company and its future challenges for everything else i relied almost entirely on china-based sources keep that in mind please before you start screaming at me in the comments china's first lithography machine was created in 1977 the gk3 two years later it evolved into the jkg3 the first domestically created lithography machine for large-scale commercial production the gk4 prototype came a year later in 1978 it was a contact lithography machine able to print chips on 75 millimeter wafers contact lithography is where the photo mask is in direct contact with a photoresist coated substrate it has its uses but is also known for high defect rates the united states invented and commercialized contact lithography in the 1950s so at this point china was two decades behind after this the next stage in the commercial tech tree would be the proximity aligner this introduces a gap between the mask and the substrate after that would be the step and scan device or stepper the chinese would try to develop these two simultaneously in 1981 the institute of semiconductors of the chinese academy of sciences successfully developed two proximity aligner prototypes in 1985 after six years of work the 45th institute of the ministry of mechanical and electrical engineering developed the stepper of their own this machine quote unquote inspired by the 4800 dsw made by us-based gca printed designs using the 436 nanometer g line in 2000 china began research on machines using argon fluoride lasers on the 193 nanometer wavelength since the west began shipping its first such devices in 1990 there has thus remained a large technology gap the government apparently must have thought a change of direction was needed smee was founded a few years later in march 2002 china's 12th five-year plan which covers the 2011-2015 period included 16 major national special projects lithography was ranked the second highest which is why it would be called the zero two special project the special project had multiple goals the top focus was to develop manufacturing equipment capable of producing 22 to 45 nanometer processed chips other goals include carrying out forward research on 14 to 22 nanometer processes work on 65 to 90 nanometer special processes capture at least 10 percent of the domestic lithography market and attempt to open up the international market smee was thus deemed the country's national champion for turning these goals into reality the company's first office was in the shanghai zhangjiang high tech park in the putong district of shanghai the company's semiconductor-related neighbors included smic gray semiconductor and spreadtrum the company's founding general manager and chairman was ha rong ming he worked hard at the task saying in an interview i really have nothing worth writing about i can't tell the wonderful stories you want to hear i just did one thing in more than 10 years except for business trips i go out at 7am and go home at 10pm saturdays are guaranteed no rest and sundays are not guaranteed this was the whole of my life for more than 10 years over the two decades of its existence smee has developed its products on the back of extensive r d as of 2019 the company has filed for over 3 000 patents and received 1 600 of them nearly 700 of those patents are in foreign countries which is notable to support its journey the company has received extensive support from both the chinese local and central governments smee single biggest owner with 32 percent of the shares is the shanghai sasak the commission overseeing all of the city's corporate assets but there are a few other private shareholders including some vcs lithography technology is a very protected space dominated by three companies with government backing smee encounter import restrictions almost from the very start for instance high level optics from carl zeiss of germany none of their best stuff could be imported into china thus for its first products the company decided to target a portion of the lithography market where the competition is less intense and the requirements less strict lithography for advanced packaging processes advanced packaging describes a set of processes for placing a chip in its protective casing and connecting them to the outside world it is an essential and previously unheralded part of the semiconductor manufacturing process trends like chiplets have unlocked great performance advances and stimulated the need for advanced packaging technology the idea was that the company can cut its teeth in back-end lithography and then work its way up from there to front end lithography where the big boys play the strategy has shown traction smee products are now good enough to hold 80 percent of the domestic market in back and lithography corresponding to 40 of the global market in 2019 they shipped over 50 units their major back-end customers include chiang jang electric group taiwan-based ase group and tongfu microelectronics after that smee began expanding into lithography tools for other niche semiconductor products power devices micro electromechanical systems or mems and leds leds are probably the most promising market of these finally the company started developing for the front end with the intention of selling those to companies like yangtze memory and smic more likely yank c since smic is pretty locked in with asml unlike his japanese competitors canon and nikon smee is built in the asml model they want to be the final system integrator for the lithography tools various parts the company works with a variety of suppliers to help build and put together a new lithography machine at the heart of it the core factors for a machine success include one high precision optics two the light source three high precision mechanics and four software for the light source asml relies on companies like kymer for its optics they rely on a joint venture with carl zeiss these are so important to the whole machine that asml either holds significant equity share in the corporate entity or owns it outright equilotion identifies smees carl zeiss to be two companies chang chun up optotech and beijing gua wang technology company but they also note that chiang chong is no longer associated with the smde so that leaves beijing guo wang they're in the midst of building an optics manufacturing factory so they likely won't be able to supply an immersion-ready optical system in mass until that is done sme's chimer would be beijing rs laser opto electronics technology rs laser's product is underpowered compared to what asml uses for their immersion systems i have never heard of any of these companies and presumed them to be staked back entities spun off from universities or research laboratories something that is not really a problem for asml but has relevancy for smee has to do with the requirement for domestic suppliers there remains a number of core technologies that still have to either be imported or purchased from foreign companies for instance photo masks the plates that hold the chip pattern to be printed onto the wafer the vast majority of these are made by japanese companies topan printing and dai nippon printing though equal ocean again notes that a chinese native company jiangsu nata opto electronic material company limited or just nata has created a photo mask that successfully works in an asml immersion system so maybe those can get replaced in due time but that is just one example ball bearings from sweden valves from france and grading alignment systems from the united states none of these are made in china and without them it is hard to ship a commercial grade working machine i do not want to give the impression that once this one thing is done then everything else is all good as of this writing in august 2021 smee systems are for the 90 nanometer 110 nanometer and 280 nanometer processes as i mentioned earlier these are specialized systems for back end lithography led mems and power devices lithography systems are generally grouped by their laser light source you have eyeline machines krypton fluoride laser machines argon fluoride laser machines argon fluoride immersion laser machines and finally uv machines the majority of smee systems use eyeline and krypton fluoride lasers but their most advanced system the ssa 600-20 scanner for front-end manufacturing at the 90 nanometer node uses an argon fluoride laser which i will shorten to arf because it sounds cute a prototype of this product the 600-10 was first profiled in 2011. it had a field size of 22 millimeters by 32 millimeters and can process about 50 wafers an hour comparable canon and nikon machines can do up to five times that number that was over 10 years ago since then it seems like they made just one more iteration from the 600 600-10 to the 600-20 which as of 2019 is estimated to not be selling in relevant quantities the company's recent sales are still in the way outdated eyeline lithography machines which i do not think bodes well the most prominent piece of news about this company's future pipeline is that they have an argon fluoride immersion system which i will hereby refer to as an rfe system because that is also cute this machine is said to be capable of the 28 nanometer process node this 28 nanometer tool is right now a prototype china has in general been pretty good at building prototypes lagging the leading edge by about 10 or so years the 28 nanometer node a half step node after the 32 nanometer probably first began shipping sometime in 2011 so it fits the pattern the issue is getting from prototype to customer clean rooms in high volume china has never been able to turn its prototypes into commercially competitive products something i've been wondering is why they put so much resources into prototyping this 28 nanometer machine when they have hardly commercialized and sold any of the 90 nanometer prototype machines from 10 years ago anyway the goal now is to deliver commercial ready 28 nanometer rfe machines in 2021 or 2022 so you get headlines saying that china quo unquote will or confirm to have such machines by 2021 or 2022 but it seems likely to miss this deadline beijing guowang the critical optics supplier is working on a foundry to build sme's optical systems but equal ocean points out that construction on said foundry is not expected to be completed until september 2023 considering the lag of integration and all a 2024 ship date might be ambitious and even then the product is not expected to be commercially competitive kind of like with press release announcements of some revolutionary battery technology that recharges in five seconds microwaves or dinner and never leaves the laboratory chinese new sources tend to blow up the headlines here's one such example in november 2018 the institute of opto electronics technology at the chinese academy of sciences announced that they created a 22 nanometer quote super resolution end quote lithography tool cctv announced that with multi-patterning a special technique processed nodes below the 10 nanometer level can be achievable but the devil is in the details as it turns out the tool is not even close to being commercially ready the accuracy is low and the tool's field of view is just a few square millimeters which means it will take forever to crawl across and finish just one wafer layer by contrast asml's twinscan nxt 1970ci a comparable duv machine capable of the 38 nanometer node and below offers a field of view of 858 square millimeters 26 by 33 this is a shipping product capable of doing over 250 wafers an hour i feel like this one is a significant issue we hear a lot of stories about chinese companies offering outrageous sums to some engineer to come work for them but that does not seem to be the case for smee and asml for chinese job info sites entry-level college graduates make about 45 000 usd a year though i have also seen much lower figures phds on average make about twice as much smee's average phd salary is about the same as asml's company-wide average salary glassdoor notes that at the higher end some staff software engineers make nearly 200 000 usd a year imagine what an optics phd might make even considering the difference between shanghai and the netherlands there is a significant pay gap smee eventually going public someday might help even out this gap a little but not significantly we have also not yet discussed the very real job benefits and working atmosphere associated with working at a dutch company share purchase plan pension plan commuting allowance 40 days of paid leave 8 holiday allowance and so on it will be challenging for sme to be as generous in their benefits holidays commute housing or otherwise the company has nowhere near asml's capital base europe's most valuable tech company at 300 billion dollars or even that of a canon or nikon rather sme is one of china's national champions and bears expectations on par with cadal or huawei thus the company has adopted huawei's working practices this means long working hours considerable political intervention tough annual assessments for bonuses and a jack welch style bottom five to ten percent layoff each year this is based on comments from chinese message boards and job sites human capital is a lifeblood of the semiconductor manufacturing industry it's one of those industries where the right person can bring immense value to a company's competitive edge and is not like high precision optics and mechanics phds grow on trees i feel there is a significant gap between how the two companies work and treat their employees asml spends a lot of time and effort thinking about the best ways to develop their people and reduce turnover sme's huawei inspired approach on the other hand is likely to lead to a hard time acquiring and retaining the same type and level of talent smee's efforts get a lot of ink in the chinese press they refer to the photolithography effort as the mount everest of the intelligent manufacturing industry as is the case with any such high-profile effort there is a lot of steadfast cheerleading and rah-rah optimism here's one commonly encountered example as an ancient civilization with history of 5 000 years china has countless wisdom and strengths judging from china's four great inventions two bombs and one satellite aerospace manned spacecraft space station and many other scientific and technological achievements there is nothing that can't be done by us chinese strong rhetoric and yes sure anything can happen but so far the reality is that smee is at least 20 years behind asml in bringing a commercial-ready upper-class lithography device to the market immersion lithography is just nascent and euv is even farther away this is a reality that even chinese sources readily acknowledge such rah-rah words and outrageous claims are counterproductive it leaves behind pessimism when deadlines are inevitably missed and prevents people from facing the actual problem in front of them on the other hand i also don't want to say that china's semiconductor production equipment ecosystem is dead on arrival for instance the progress in backend lithography and led lithography is heartening especially as china gains market share in the display industry furthermore a few chinese companies have managed to build a strong track record in certain semiconductor equipment areas one has even managed to acquire tsmc as a client we can go over them in the future anyway one final thing on smee i'm seeing that the company is considering an ipo sometime in the future at valuations i reckon to be in the 5 to 10 billion dollar range but no official confirmation yet assuming they do that they would release a lot of new information in their prospectus and i can do an update if that happens alright thanks for
