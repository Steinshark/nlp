bitcoin has been the official currency of el salvador for an entire year so how's it going well here's what the media is saying the results have been mixed at best president bucheller has invested nearly 100 million dollars of public money on bitcoin most of the coins have not risen in value since being bought using bitcoin remains a challenge at this grocery store we held up a line for 10 minutes as the cashier waited for our payment to clear they said that the transaction was declined but on my bitcoin wallet it showed that it had gone through okay so it doesn't look great from the start and with the imf telling el salvador to ditch bitcoin and rethink crypto we might be tempted to end the video there but bitcoiners would say that's a mistake of course the imf international monetary fund wants people to rethink bitcoin just last week the international horse fund was telling people to rethink cars in fact maybe all this fud from the lame stream media is just them fighting against the future that will make them obsolete that's what the bitcoiners would say they think el salvador is the first in a long line of dominoes it's the first of many countries that will inevitably accept bitcoin these are just technical glitches these price falls i mean they're just hiccups in a longer plan but then again bitcoiners aren't exactly unbiased themselves of course they're going to be fans of el salvador with it becoming a crypto tax haven billionaires became fans of the cayman islands for the same reason so yeah i'm kind of sick of hearing from bitcoin bros too in fact everyone is even the family members of these guys are starting to put their foot down here's one of the most popular bitcoiners saying that he's actually been banned from his family's thanksgiving all because of bitcoin so max is is thanksgiving we didn't even notice it because we're not in america but what do you what the hell are you doing here even though it's thanksgiving right well simon you know we didn't get invited to any of our families thanksgiving this year because they're so sick of us talking about bitcoin we tried they hung up on us they're just like go away we're sick of you that's why i always say you don't talk religion politics or global financial policies at the dinner table you just don't do it that by the way is max kaiser and in addition to being on the thanksgiving do not call list he's also one of the reasons that el salvador planned to issue volcano bonds this is a scheme to use geothermal energy from their volcanoes to mine bitcoin of course all that computer mining equipment cost money so the government was going to issue bonds to pay for all that new infrastructure but at the last minute has delayed the fundraising so this is quite a complicated story there's a lot of competing stakeholders who all want you to believe something different but what i want to know is what is the truth what's the real situation with bitcoin in el salvador a year later it's time for a deep dive on this we're gonna start at the most obvious place price obviously a lot of the conversation around bitcoin for el salvador is going to center around how it has performed as an asset and here things aren't great el salvador bought the dip many times and then the dip dipped many times they spent over a hundred million dollars on bitcoin in total at an average price of 45 000 bitcoin is now worth roughly 20 000 which means they've taken a 50 loss on these purchases which is a huge waste of resources so sure you could say they're huddling but this is a pretty big fail but of course that's not the whole story a big reason bitcoin sounded promising in a place like el salvador is because a large amount of money being sent there is from overseas this is often called remittances and these international wire transfers cost a ton in fees for el salvador and the idea is is that some of that money they could save if they use bitcoin because in theory if bitcoin could lower transaction fees abroad even if it did nothing else that could be a net win for el salvador but this only works if people actually use bitcoin and that's kind of a problem because this isn't silicon valley where everyone has a phone crypto and borderline personality disorder this is el salvador 70 of their citizens don't even have a bank much less cryptocurrency so it might be a huge challenge for el salvador to get its citizens to actually even use crypto in the first place and that's what we're going to talk about next adoption el salvador's plan for crypto adoption is actually pretty simple they want their citizens to download something called chivo which is a crypto wallet app and here they've been pretty successful chivo has four million downloads and almost 70 percent of el salvadorians say they know about this app however this is where the good news for el salvador sort of ends because a working paper by nber or this they say that the primary interest in chivo was driven by a 30 bonus that the government gave away with each sign on which for context minimum wage in el salvador is only 12 a day so downloading chivo and getting 30 for free was the equivalent for some of working almost three days straight so it's a no-brainer now of course the government would hope that people would continue to use this chivo app well after they've spent their initial free thirty dollars but a survey from that same paper shows that this is probably not the case sixty percent of el salvadorians said no to the question of using chivo after the thirty dollar bonus and over seventy percent haven't loaded money onto chivo beyond the free bonus so a lot of people were just using it for the free handout not only that even if you have bitcoin on your app it's hard to use in el salvador since a reported 80 percent of businesses do not accept it as legal currency despite it being so with all of that said where does that leave us with our earlier question about remittances and money being sent overseas well the numbers are in depending on who you're asking and over what time period remittances through crypto are roughly 1.6 to 3.9 of the total value of remittances which is is not is not good because one of the key arguments for bitcoin is that it's going to be used for this thing right it's going to lower international fees but in order for that to happen you have to use it so the most optimistic scenario here is that people haven't figured out that it's good for that or that more people are going to use chivo in the future however a lot of reports say that el salvadorians just don't trust bitcoin to hold its value which you can hardly blame them for given their experience with it but speaking of that holding its value this brings us to another argument for bitcoin which is about banking or more specifically people who don't have banking as i said earlier the majority of people know software don't have access to financial institutions as this reporter for cnbc explains 70 of people in el salvador don't have access to bank accounts so for them the concept of having a savings account is almost foreign and those are the types of reasons that the the government is putting forward to try to get this widespread adopted all right that argument makes sense crypto is going to allow people without a bank to have one and that could be really cool however there's still problems here because that same survey it turns out shows that the people who are most likely to know about chivo and cryptocurrency are exactly the people who don't need it they are most likely already banked and already educated have cell phones with internet this is sort of the opposite of the typical profile of the unbanked you'd be theoretically targeting so those are the main arguments for and against bitcoin within el salvador and that's how it's been doing on each of those things from price to adoption you know remittances and also access to banking and it's been pretty rough i have to admit however remember that el salvador's decision still has some vocal supporters which i don't want to neglect starting with the actual el salvadorians some would say that bitcoin is a huge benefit to them because it allows them to do things like pay electric bills in a way they could never do before [music] how long more or less would it take you in the past to do the same thing [music] three hours and now it's just boom instant in your phone let's see okay look that's honestly heartwarming i have to admit and if there's a silver lining here it's people like that benefiting but in the press i have to say those aren't really the people on the front lines pushing the bitcoin narrative forward in el salvador that award goes to rich people who don't get invited to thanksgiving but do get el salvadorian citizenship via the president himself because of volcano bond donations so the idea was floated hey you know put a hundred thousand into these volcano bonds and you're on the fast track to citizenship or permanent residency so i tweeted that you know i'm we're very interested in this we would love to become salvadorian citizens and within a half hour we were getting tweets back and feedback back from the president and other people in the government saying you know we'll make you citizens asap you know by the end of this year okay this finally brings me to my main question i want to leave you with right because people on the bitcoin side are going to say it's going great people anti you know crypt are going to say oh it's always going terrible but i really want to leave you with this thought who is the bitcoin push benefiting obviously in the press it's all to help the poor people right we have to bank the unbanked but if you actually look at what el salvador has done not what they say they're doing you really have to wonder whether this is about helping poor people or if it's about helping people who are already well off i mean if you look at their plan to issue volcano bonds to wealthy investors they're giving citizenship to wealthy investors they're giving a tax haven to wealthy investors they're planning a bitcoin city supposedly in the shape of a bitcoin the thing literally looks like el dorado you think most of the citizens are going to be able to live there they plan to look out at the top of the volcano that looks like you're going to sacrifice to the satoshi gods i mean who are you catering to at this point if the answer is thanksgiving refugees that's fine but at least say that and be honest about it because from where i'm sitting i see most of the benefit going to the people already at the top so anyways that's basically my assessment of el salvador next year we'll check in again to see how it's doing see if things have changed because remember it's still early so maybe everything turns around and the bitcoin bros are right i don't know i'm open to that either way pump the stock thanks for watching and i will see you in the next one
