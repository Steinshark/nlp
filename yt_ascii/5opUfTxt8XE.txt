the problem with modern civilization in many ways is that that we are so obsessed with predicting everything and making everything straight line and and and dependable and not being irritated by anything that our mind sort of falls asleep in a sense and and everything is like the prediction we come with and we need some somehow to sort of refresh our sensory input from time to time and i think many ways to u sort of get around your everyday reduction of the [music] world hello everybody i'm speaking today with tor nanders who's a danish author i'm primarily interested in his work he's written about 30 books the book i know best is probably his most famous book called the user illusion i've been thinking a lot about consciousness lately it's a what would you say a preoccupation of mine and i a a few decades ago i spent a lot of time reading books on consciousness the user illusion tor norrander book was the best one of the lot as far as i was concerned and it taught me a lot and so i figured the other day that i'd reach out to him we haven't talked before and so that was what happened and i got a chance to investigate his thought more elaborately we talked a lot about consciousness as a reducing function which is a very interesting way of conceptualizing it it's something akin to eldis huxley's speculations although he elaborated it in much more detail and much and very usefully and also associated that with our ability to communicate verbally in a way that i think was in keeping with the relevant neuros pychological literature and what we know about perception so norrander hit the target very specifically and i thought it'd be fun to talk to him about that and to share that with all of you and so that's exactly what's going to happen so mr nord trenders i really became interested in your work because of the user illusion which i read quite a long time ago probably about 10 years after you published it i believe it was published in 1991 and yes i was 98 oh okay okay so so i see all right so it probably would have been around 98 when i when i read it i was quite interested in the in the psychology of consciousness but i had a hard time finding any books that i thought were really credible you know i read dan dennett's book and i also read jeffrey gray's book and gray is a real genius he he wrote a book called the neuros pychology of anxiety which i think is one of the best neuroscience books ever written maybe the best but i didn't think his work on consciousness hit the mark the same way your your book however i thought it was unbelievably helpful and i want to focus on one element of it maybe you can tell me how your thinking has developed i really liked your idea of and let me make sure that i actually get this right you talked about linguistic communication as a form of unpacking right it was like a sequ a sequence of compressions okay so i want to walk through that because i don't know how much of this now is my idea and how much of it is yours because it's been so long since i read your book but so this is how it seems to me and then i'll i'll have you comment on it so i've been trying to understand what it means to understand something we use that word understand it's an interesting metaphor so i'm i'm thinking about consciousness as a multi-tiered phenomenon so i'll start with a description of the world so we're we're in the you could imagine the material realm is a place of patterns and complex patterns some of them last for a long time some of them are short term they differ in scale but the material world is a place of patterns and then on top of that living creatures have a behavioral realm and they interact with one another but their behavior also codes the material world because we have to just like if you're walking across a field your pathway is going to map the terrain the behavior of living creatures maps the physical patterns and it maps the interactions between mostly between them and members of their own species okay and then now in the human case you have two additional layers of what's real you have an imaginative realm and the imaginative realm seems to me to be where we capture the patterns we primarily capture the patterns of behavior in the imaginal realm that's what a dream does because dreams have characters and the characters act out a drama of sorts more or less coherent we make that more coherent in literature and in drama in fiction and so that's the imaginal realm and then on top of that we have the linguistic realm and it seems to me and i think this is in keeping with your ideas that the linguistic maps the imaginal and it can be unpacked into the imaginal and the imaginal can transform the behavioral but all of that there's a harmony between all of that that constitutes something like understanding and so the first thing i'd like to know is like does that bear any resem lance to your ideas and and then what do you think of that conceptualization i think it's very complicated in a sense i would i would like to to start with a more basic sort of observation which is the observation that if you look at at our sensory if you look at the sensory system of human being our eyes our skin our hearing and and smell and taste and all that there's an enormous amount of information that goes into us for in every second and you can measure that and in fact that has been measured since mid last century h and people didn't really know what to do with that information because it's a pretty high number nowadays people are acquainted with the with the concept of bit the bit of information and it it turns out that it's it's something of the order of 11 million bits per second enter our sensory apparatus on the other hand you could you can ask yourself how much can we be consciously aware of and again you can measure this there's been measurements of this since the 60s of last century and the interesting thing about this number for how much you could be aware of is that it's so much smaller than what we actually take in from our the world around us like we take on the order of 16 bits per second from the outside world into our awareness but we take 11 million bits from the outside world into our system whatever that is so so so the problem or or or the difficult thing to understand is that there's a reduction of a factor 1 million from the sensory intake to what we actually aware of right and that seems immediately very surprising so somehow consciousness conscious awareness is very different from sensing the world when you talk about patterns and recognizing patterns that will be the sensing of the world that every every animal would have to do and we do of course also to to survive but what is that which we are conscious about h and it's it's a tiny little part of what we take in and of course most of what the information we take in at every any second is not really worth contemplating in that second like i see behind you windows and it's obvious that these windows are not falling down on you and you don't have to reassure yourself every second they're not falling down they're not falling down they're not falling down that wouldn't be very helpful so you have to select what you are aware of and the point about consciousness then is and this is where the linguistic part enters the the equation the point about consciousness is that if you take the the origin of the word consciousness it's from latin it's cons skira it's knowing together so when i take in a lot of information from the outside world a and i'm aware of a little of it it's very much so that what i'm aware of is what i share with other people i point to something and say it's red and you have a concept of red i have a concept of red and somehow we sort of calibrate our way of seeing stuff but there's more to the quality of red that by i actually see so consciousness is about sharing awareness of the outer world or the inner world in a very very compact fashion compared to what we actually take in and therefore the language is very important the social relationships are very important the co- awareness is very important and you could say that the whole the whole show starts with pointing when you have infants you point and when they're old enough they actually understand that the interesting thing about pointing is not the finger but what it what it is pointing at some animals understand that also but sort of directed shared attention is very much sort of the stuff of consciousness so it's it's it's in a way it's a social thing it's something you share with other people but of course you can have consciousness on your own and most of us have a lot of conscious awareness without other people being involved but that's sort of the the the the collective mind that we have internalized so that we can share our experience with other people without actually talking to them or or being present together with them and so so that was a major theme of this book was trying to sort out this thing that we are we're doing an enormous selection in what we are aware of in conscious aw okay so i want to i've got a three or four things to to elaborate on from that okay so i want to lay out another schema so the things i here's what i'm going to dig into you talked about pointing you talked about the consciousness we have when other people aren't around you talked about sharing and trade so let's let's dig into each of those so so i've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how stories what a story is and how stories shape what we point our attention to okay so i understand that relationship between pointing and and verbalization but also pointing and specification of attention okay so i'm going to i'm going to bring in some other ideas and i'll get you to comment on them so i was quite taken by my studies of jj gibson so gibson wrote a great book called the ecological approach to visual perception and i think there's some brilliant things in it and i've been elaborating on gibson's ideas in the context of of narrative and i guess narrative is relevant to the idea of sharing because a lot of what we share are stories and i think stories are pointers to value that's a way of thinking about it so so let me lay out a phenomenological world for you and tell me what you think about this so imagine you specify a point with your aim okay so now you're determining a destination this is what fl what bees do when they communicate about where the pollen and the and the nectar is in flowers they specify a treasure house of value okay so that's the that's the point that's the destination okay so from the from gibson's perspective once you establish a point then the world lays itself out as perceptible objects and some of those are tools they're all what he called affordances they're all they're all the phenomena that are now relevant to that goal and you can break them he broke them into roughly into two classes tools and so a tool is something you can use to move yourself along your pathway and obstacles and i've been thinking about elaborating that so i think what happens when you when you specify a point with your aim let's say you your your perceptual system produces a pathway forward right that's your root and then the root is accompanied by the things that are relevant you you talked about the fact that you know we we are taking in 11 million bits per second but compressing that to 16 almost all that we perceive is obscured as irrelevant it's not even part of our conscious experience so what stands out well pathways then tools and obstacles so those would be like material those would be material entities but then i think there's a parallel in the social domain friends and foes so friends share your aim and accompany you along the way and they can be helpful and foes are human obstacles but also can obscure or interfere with your aim so tools friends o obstacles f and then there's one other element which i think is very cool i just figured this out i think the other thing that we perceive are agents of transformation and those would be like magical creatures in a fairy tale and an agent of transformation changes your aim and the reason they're magic is because the world of the aim that they specify doesn't play by the same rules as the rule of the aim that you inhabit right so okay so now the the reason i'm telling you this that's relevant to it's relevant to the pointing idea because that's kind of the landscape that emerges as a consequence of pointing but it also is relevant to the sharing idea i've been thinking that you know when we speak with each other we're offering each we're offering the fruits of our imagination that's a way of thinking about it each word is actually a storehouse a value or a pointer to value and so you could say the reason consciousness d and this seems to be very much in keeping with your thinking is that we can offer people pointers to a destination or specify a destination and again that's not much different than bees do when they're you know when they're doing a dance to specify where the honey is and so it's the fruits of our imagination that we can encapsulate in words and maybe we have that private consciousness our ability to think on our own so that we can build up a storehouse of value so that we actually have some to trade with other people okay so well so that's a that's a take on the things that you just described so i'd like to know what you think about that it i come to think of of of the of the paradigm of predictive processing which has been very influential in the past 10 years in in understanding how we perceive the world carl frist a british guy is one of the leaders of of the field and and the basic idea there was a philosopher very much in in in explain yob hovi explaining this paradigm of predictive processing who kind enough to say that the that the deep idea behind it actually was in this book the user illusion oh oh that's cool that's cool it's nice of him to say so yeah yeah yeah but but the point is that what i what us illustion tries to say is that first we take in information and then we create create a sort of a simulation of what that information is and then only then do we experience we don't experience the right take in we experience our own retelling of what we take in and predictive processing paradigm is is is basically saying that all we experience when we go about in our stuff in the world is our predictions of what will happen next what will this guy do what will this monkey do will there be a fault in the terrain when i walk there so it's all about predicting so in that sense it's all about storytelling everything we know about the world is storytelling and then of course it it turns out very often that our stories are wrong we are corrected we we we understand that there was something wrong and so we correct our storytelling we we make it more and more qualified and we and and when we get to know people we we have a better ability to to know what to expect from them and so on but it's all a question of creating a story not inconsistent with the information we take in and there's one thing here that's i think is very deep and that is if you take children they're afraid of the dark you go into the forest in the evening h as a kid and you are scared because of of what could be in the dark if go there in the daytime you're not scared at all why is that that's because there's nothing to contradicts the inner fantasies of the kit when it's dark there's no information that runs counter to the idea of many many weird trolls and demons out there but in in the daylight there's so much information that contradicts your ideas so in a way all of our perception of the world is a hallucination we create under the condition that it does not contradict the sensory data we take in so we are constantly constantly telling stories so telling stories is what perception is all about and of course human beings have taken this to a higher level than we expect a mouse to take it to but it's basically the same phenomenon that we we try to create a consistent idea of what the world is like but it's what we experience is our own dream if you like or our own fantasy or better word is our own hallucination and it it so this will explain all the things we see in in when when when the light falls and and you you enter into to twilight zone and then suddenly there's not enough information to contradict all the weird ideas you have in your head do you ever read the fine print that appears when you start browsing in incognito mode it says that your activity might still be visible to your

interviewed him for this podcast second of all with a two students of mine jacob hirsh and raymond maher we wrote a paper about the same time that friston was working on his entropy theories on anxiety as an index of entropy and so this is partly what i talked to friston about yeah yeah well and it ties in with this idea of root specification to a treasure so friston pointed out that and and this was in keeping with the work that we were doing that if you're imagine you've specified a route to a given valuable destination you're proceeding along it and all of a sudden there's a an obstacle arises that makes the path more complicated and maybe inp initely more complicated so you're driving to work and your car quits well you're not going to get to work and that's that means the complexity of your day has radically increased especially maybe if you're on the outs with your with your boss plus all the other routes that are dependent on the functionality of your car have all been thrown into disarray that's an entropy problem it's marked by anxiety so a lot of negative emotion is an entropy increase marker but friston pointed out something fascinating see i hadn't figured this out which was that if you move forward to a specified destination so let's say a specified treasure house each step you take that works decreases entropy because the path to the treasure house is now shorter and requires less energy expenditure so he could actually relate both positive and negative emotion to the concept of entropy this maps really nicely on this gibsonian view because if you have let's say obstacles and foes well they elicit negative emotion and they tell you that your path is in danger your pathway or the aim is in danger and on the positive emotion side you have tools and friends and they indicate that the pathway to your destination is clear and maybe even more efficient than you'd hoped and so okay so there there's that so that's cool because it ties emotion all the way down to entropy which is a very fundamental grounding of the and it also includes emotion now inside the narrative frame and so then you mentioned prediction and so you know i mentioned jeffrey gray and gray's work on anxiety is based on a prediction model but i found that that was inadequate and i'll tell you why and you tell me what you think about this see the prediction model the expectation model has kind of a cold cognitive element to it it's it's like you're a calculating machine and what you're trying to do is minimize discrepancy between what you expect and what plays out in the world but if you you can tweak that slightly and substitute desire for expectation and that way you can pull in all the motivational systems so one good way of conceptualizing motivation as opposed to emotion it's a rough split is that a motivation system sets a goal so obviously lust does that thirst does that hunger does that anger does that and so it specifies an aim and then the emotions the negative and positive emotions calibrate in relationship to that aim and so what your what your contrasting is actually desire specified by motivation rather than like a rationalistic exp expectation and i like that because otherwise you're in the expectation models or the prediction models motivation doesn't have a place and that's a big problem because obviously there are ma multiple instinctual motivational systems and a lot of the stories we tell are predicated on those jealousy stories or quest stories or rage stories they're predicated on the operation these fundamental motivational systems okay so there was there i tossed at you the entropy issue from friston and then also the issue of motivation so i'd like your thoughts on those on those ideas i i think you are very right in saying that that it easily becomes too technical if you think about prediction and and and and testing your predictions but emotions are basically all about testing your predictions so it's it the emotional language is another way of expressing the same mechanism that you f you feel fondness for someone because you expect good stuff to come out of your interaction or you you you fear someone because you fear that bad things will come out that these are emotions so basically what you see when you perceive something is already packed with emotions there's an example of of if if you go into a a forest and there's a small tree trunk there the the lowest part of a tree it's it's fallen over in the storm but there's only a small part of the tree trunk left in in in the forest and you come there in in in in bad lighting and you see that thing and it looks to you like a troll like some alien weird creature now what would be the rational thing to do here for a perception system would that be to to analyze closely the thing and then decide no it's the tree it's it's it's the bottom of a tree it's not it's not a tr or would it be to say oops it's a troll i better react on that of course the the meaningful thing is to start with the worst hypothesis in that situation it's a troll right and then because if it is in fact as the remnants of a tree well it'll stay that way so you have time to find out so the way we perceive is you're of course familiar with the gastal psychology the idea that that it's a whole sort of creature it's a whole body of the creature you see rather than details we don't sort of analyze the image of a person from one end to the other we immediately see something and we immediately have an emotional response to that and we all know that that we meet people in life that in the split second we know i like this i don't like this guy i like this woman i don't like this woman we are very fast in our in our emotional response to what we take in so so yes it certainly is a very emotional process and i think when you try to an part of the reason that when people analyze this prediction processing model as very intellectual is that it was inspired very much by the training of robots because to train robots you had to use the same idea of of sort of of moving towards something that you liked rather than that you all the ai systems do that right they're all goal trained all of them and that's why they can now mimic human cognition even linguistically right it's very interesting that's that's right that's it's all reinforcement learning towards a goal exactly yes we do that but but but i want to say on the pointing on on on that's what you what you were saying about pting reminded me of something i read in a book many years ago by l watson a british biologist who most famous for his book super nature that he wrote in the late 70s i think h he's very interested in supernatural phenomenon that's that it's what i find personally most interesting but he's very interested in that and he has one fantastic example in that book and that is if you have the eg of of of a frog and you and and the egg to become a new frog needs the sperm from from the male frog and it turns out it doesn't really need the dna from the sperm what it needs is the asymmetry introduced by the sper sperm moving towards the egg so it's more like the then the moment that you introduce the asymmetry into the spherical egg this is the point then the egg will reorganize and become a very small embryo for a frog so the idea so it's i'm not trying to say that sperm is not relevant to frogs or to humans not that at all but it's more that the symmetry breaking you have a sphere and you introduce this is the difference this is a point and all that's like a reduction well that's like the reduction that consciousness consists of so and that's and that's that's that's a point so so okay so a couple of things i want to talk about your your idea that children hallucinate terror in the face of lack sensory information well that's a good definition of the negativity bias right and the idea would be well if you can't tell what's going on the worst case come is you die painfully and and immediately and since that ends the whole game you should be very attuned to that and so as you pointed out misapprehend a tree stump as a troll is a zero almost a zero cost mistake misapprehend a troll as a tree stump that means you're dead right and so and that's really relevant because people have this pronounced negativity bias and you could imagine too that in landscape that where the sensory information is poorly specified the mapping the mapping faculty of the imagination has free reign and the fact of that free reign that's a high that's a high entropy state in and of itself right because if you don't know where you are or what's going on anything could be happening and anything isn't emotionally neutral it's terrifying as as story that's perent to that and and also to your your interest in anxiety is is is a concept from danish doctors in the 17 and'00s in greenland you know greenland part of the danish kingdom and and we had doctors going up there to help people there and they observed a weird phenomenon they call kayak angst that's danish for kayak anxiety the greenish uh people went out in kayaks to hunt seal and other stuff and they were very skilled and able and and and and skill and and clever people but sometimes they suddenly had a very strong anxiety episode and they refused to go ever again out in a kayak which is oh yeah oh yeah pretty bad if you're if if that's your living going out in the kayak hunting for seals and other stuff and and danish doctor said ah that's just because they drink too much or they have too much coffee or whatever but it it turned out that that it's it's a true phenomenon in the sense it it has no simple explanation other than the fact that if you sit on a kayak and the sky is blue and the ocean is blue and everything is blue yeah yeah you suddenly lose sort of the the orientation yeah and and and you see weird things happening pilots report the same thing when they fly into to to clouds they lose orientation and they suddenly see weird stuff you have john ly putting people in the 60s and in these isolation tanks with body war water and no sound no vision no anything and after a few hours they start hallucinating weird stuff you don't have you you don't have to lsd they will hallucinate just if you take away their sensory experience and yeah well that you're pointing to something very important there which is that pointlessness is chaotic and anxiety-provoking a priority well this is a really useful thing to know ethically and psychologically because part of what it means is that the point constrains terror like it's it's better than that if if friston's model is right not not only does the point constrain existential terror but it also elicits hope and so that would mean to some degree that the sharper the point and this is sort of analgous to the sperm idea the sharper the point the more what would you say the more promising and the less threatening the terrain right so i don't know if you know this you probably do but you know the word sin is derived from an archery term and the yeah the archery term is greek actually the derivation is the same in three languages three separate languages came to the same conclusion aramaic if i remember correctly hebrew and greek the greek term is hamartia and hamartia means to miss the target and so right to sin is to misspecify your aim right and the worst sin of course would be to aim in the opposite direction or perhaps not to aim at all right there's some ambiguity there both of those are very bad but i think we actually understand this neurophysiologically it's much in keeping with what you just said that kayak anxiety my wife experienced that once when she was swimming she had the sense that she became suddenly aware of the cavernous volume of the lake that she was in and it it it didn't scare her so much she never swam again but it scared her enough so that she talked about it for a couple of years when she went swimming but it sounds it's so interesting it's it's that it's that sudden realization of the expansiveness of everything you know here's a weird side note from that in the story of exodus when the israelites are lost and po and aimless in the desert they get all fractious and continually and they rebel and like they behave very very badly they mis aim constantly and at one point moses their leader is very upset with them and he retreats away from them along with god and but keeps his faith and his point his direction and as a reward god decides to show himself a little bit more to moses but he does something odd when he does that he puts moses in the clift of a rock so he can hardly see anything and when he walks by he just lets moses see us back and part of that the reason i'm bringing that up because that's protection that's protection against kayak anxiety right you can well imagine what would happen if we all of a sudden became aware of the 11 million bits per second instead of the 16 and even that 11 million is a compressed version of actually what's there right because even that itself is is highly screened so have you looked at the psychedelic research pertaining to percept okay tell me tell me what because it sounds sounds similar right it sounds like what's happening with psychedelic exper experience is that the domain of the narrowed consciousness expands and you get a massive increase in positive emotion because of that but also a potential massive increase in negative emotion the whole emotional landscape multiplies and do you does it seem to you logical that that is a movement that's neurologically induced towards like away from the 16 bits per second more to the 11 million yes i and i think alis harkley in this book dos of perception from the 50s of 60s that i quote in in the user illusion book he he used masculine i think it was and yeah it was masculine and and talked about this this opening of of of the mind and and by many of course his seen as sort of very early bird in what's happening now these years with the psychadelics and the studies of how psychedelics will will change the outlook of human beings on the world and allow them to take in different kind of information and and perhaps very much and carl friston by the way is is involved in some of that work also yeah yeah and it people talk about this psychedelic revolution going on right now which will have a a huge impact on on many of of of the the the the problems people have with their with anx xiety and and with depression and so on because it will open the mind and it it gives sort of a direct attention and i think the problem with modern civilization in many ways is that that we are so obsessed with predicting everything and making everything straight line and and and dependable and not being irritated by anything no rain no wind no interruptions that our mind sort of falls asleep in a sense and and everything is like the prediction we come with and we need some som how to sort of refresh our sensory input from time to time and i think there are many ways to to do that psychedelics is certainly one physical exercise is another meditation is another there are many ways to sort of get around your everyday reduction of the world are you or someone you know fighting the battle against cancer for the last 25 years invita medical centers have been pioneering personalized cuttingedge treatment programs for patients all over the world invita has been the leader for patients looking for advanced immunotherapy and genetically targeted therapies all while focusing on fewer side effects and better patient outcomes as a global leader in oncology care invita is committed to healthcare freedom for all they've spearheaded a revolution in employer health insurance options empowering companies to provide their employees with access to not only top doctors hospitals and technologies but also the first ofit kind nationwide personalized medicine coverage invita is doing all of this plus offering significant tax and cost savings full transparency and liberation from the grip of commercial insurance carriers whether you're a patient in need or a company looking to break free of monopolized healthcare insurance invita could have the solution for you to learn more about their treatment option visit inv vita.com or visit invit health.com to learn more about their company insurance programs that's invita spelled en nv.com for treatment options or inv vah health.com to learn more about their company insurance programs so so some of friston's co-workers have been making the psychophysiological claim that what the psychedelics are doing is ain into a stress response like it's a highly magnified stress response and the logic there is something this is relevant to the issue of point so imagine that you're reducing the 11 million bits to 16 okay now then imagine all the ways that that reduction could conceivably occur like all the different ways 11 million bits could be reduced to 16 there's a lot of them okay now the advantage to the reduction is you you only have to deal with 16 but the disadvantage is well what if you're pointing in the wrong direction okay so let me tell you a story and you tell me what you think about this so i think that's what the tower of babel story is about okay so because so let let me let me outline it so the babylonian towers that that story refers to were generally ziggurats and a zigurat is a structure that has a point at the top it's essentially a p it's a stepped pyramid and at the top that story emerged the babylonian kings there were many of them were engaged in the same kind of competition you see in modern cities right they were going to build the highest tower and that would announce the builder of the tower as something ain to god like a god emperor and so these were god emperors of the technological enterprise the people who build the towers of babel in the biblical story are the descendants of cain okay so they're resentful and miserable and genocidal they're a bad lot and they're the first builders of cities and it's those people that build the towers of babel and so these are points in the wrong direction right so because what the what the b as far far as i can tell what the biblical corpus is attempting to do is to specify a point it's the point of the cross actually but it's trying to specify a point as an antidote to the pathological points that might otherwise emerge what happens in the tower of babel story is that as the tower increases in presumptuousness that's a good way of thinking about it and and sort of a a bitter and and what would you call it a bitter and prideful rigidity even the ability of the people who inhabit the tower to communicate becomes impaired right and this ties into our discussion because we've already made the case that words themselves are something like pointers of value right they're compressed point as a value and if the value hierarchy itself is path pathologized if the point is wrong well then the words are going to become not only meaningless but in some ways counter to to meaning itself and that that seems to me also relevant to the point of let me see there was another element that you brought in that was but oh yes i know what it is when when the when the psychedelics hit let's say if that's a magnified stress response imagine if your point is very miss aligned well what you could do is reduce the intensity of the point and broaden the attentional horizon and the danger there is now you're in the desert but there's many possible directions now that you could go right so it could snap you out of a false point and i think that's why people find these experiences or can find them transforming and illuminating right is because they they allow people to replace that pathologically narrowed point that has depressed them or left them nihilistic with a reintroduction into the richer rich richer sensory realm with the possibility of a of a reor reorientation i think that's very true in in the sense that what we basically did when we moved from being hunter gatherers toist who were cultivating the land and and and taming the wild animals into into our animals so which is the story that the bible is about that most monolithic monotheistic religions are about this transformation from h gatherers to farmers and the farmer believes that everything come from his work from his little piece of land and from what he puts into it the the the hun gatherer thinks that everything around him brings him something evil or good stuff nice or not nice stuff edible or not edible stuff but the world is open and you go into it and you find something you would like to eat the farmer believes that he controls and creates everything so i think it's very much also that's interesting it's about sort of contracting yourself to the city and building up in the city rather than going out into the open land and and finding something to eat and i think much of the way we have evolved in in social terms in the past actually 10,000 years since we introduced agriculture has been more and more contracting ourselves to a small space controlling everything and forgetting about the wide open space out there and and even if if you look at at at this what you see when you're going into a landscape controlled by agriculture you see concepts you see wheat or you see rice or you see maze or you see very basic stuff but it's all the same so it's like a concept that has been transformed into a field rather than if you go to the wilderness there so many different things at the same time and so we have we have compressed enormously this information and and we live in a simplified world that we created ourselves we found it efficient that's why we did it but it it also takes away from our mind the ability to see to see multitudes and i think what what what happens then you could say we take out entropy from our life and and what happens with with i think with people who experiment with the psychedelics is that they experience suddenly this multitude coming back they open up their minds to multitudes so that's interesting so there there's another biblical illusion there possibly you know in in the story of cain and abel so the builders of the tower of babel are cain's descendants but cain is an agriculturalist right and so you could imagine so tell me what you think of this hypothesis so that as the agricultural endeavor got underway you pointed out that one of the consequences of that was that people started to believe that the world was a place where the fruits made themselves available as a consequence of direct human labor and and effort and that could be contrasted with the hunter gatherer maybe even with the herder that would be able with the herder mentality which is more like well it's more it's a more it's a more wandering and diverse way of looking at the world now you could imagine that as agriculture got established that did enable the aggregation of more and more people right the builder of the building of larger and larger and more integrated civilizations and you could imagine that as well pointing to exactly the outcome you described which would be the presumption of civilization right and i mean the prideful presumption in a sense now you're talking about a a a very strange sort of complex compression because your point is that once we transform the world into a linguistic matrix and conceptualize it we can can then transform the world itself into an analog of that matrix so that so is that partly what accounts for your interest in in agriculture because i know you've written books that are relevant to that endeavor as well i was wondering what the connection was right because it's not obvious no it's not obvious at all and and and in many ways it was an accidental event in my life that i became interested in nutrition and the way we produce food and how it it it it influences our body but then i then i what what really changed my attitude to all this and and was fantastic experience for many years was that i it dawned on me suddenly that the real problem in the way we produce food these days is that it's so over agricultural lied it's over abstract it's over civilized in a sense and that we've forgotten all about what nature itself provides and offers us in the form of wild food for and you can you can you can you can measure generation after generation that people lose knowledge of the richness of the real world of what's out there on its own wild and wild means of its own will it's it's having a it's not our will it's it's the na's will and then i in studying that i came across a trend in cooking in find in in gastronomy in restaurants that happened also to have its leading force in my own country of denmark in the maybe you've heard about the restaurant n which was started like 20 years ago and became after 10 years the leading restaurant in the world which was absurd because denmark in terms of gastronomy has always been sort of a joke nobody would ever consider denmark to be a country where you would go for f dining and people would fly in and than england what yeah worse than england yes yeah that's not good we sold the good bacon to the british and had the bad bacon ourselves so yeah yeah denmark was was a m mud pile of of shitty gastronomy but suddenly you had the best restaurant in the world and why was that that was because that byi the chief the chief chef of noma a good friend he became a friend renee said we only want to serve stuff that grows where we are and grows at the time we serve it the seasons in which we serve it so we will forget about all imported foods we will forget about all the agricultural foods and we will serve the wild foods for people on the plate and that was a radical idea that turned out to to be fantastic in terms of of taste and and smell and and and and all that stuff but it was also a fantastic idea because when he then gathered chefs from all over the world who were interested in his way of thinking in in a number of of big events he called mad which is the danish word for food where you had all these people and i was i was so lucky that he asked me to give the opening lecture for these for these events and my basic point was that we moved from wild to tame and now we'll be moving back again in that we moved away from wild food all that nature offers we wanted to control everything and we ended up as a species eating almost only four crops it's really surprising if you if you if you count the number of calories that human beings eat more than 50% of these calories come from just four crops like wheat and and rice and potato and lace and so on corn i think you call it and no monkey would would accept that monkeys eat 300 different kinds of of vegetables but we eat only four and all the the brain power of the chefs is used to make four very boring things to eat edable all year around so so you have chefs that come in and and can can take a potato or a steak or whatever and make that interesting in interesting in interesting in 500 different ways so gastronomy and and fine dining has sort of collapsed into taking a few very poor raw materials and making them interesting even though they're poor and the new trend is to use the skills and the intelligence of the chef to go out into the wild nature and say what is edible here it takes a lot of skill and a lot of knowledge and a lot of care to to bring it to the plate and to make it taste good but then it's much much richer than anything you get out of with control civilized agriculture so the the revolution or the renaissance in in fine dining was to understand that chefs should go out and study the edibility of planet earth rather than to create fantastic recipes with with their gastronomy skills right right so that's a return oh that's so interesting because because that's that's a return that's a return to the to the to the garden with multiple with to the to what would you say to the abundant garden it's it seems to me that there's a powerful analogy there that the if we think of what the chefs are doing as a form of art that your sense tell me if i've got this right it's in keeping with what we've been discussing that that civilizational hyperfocus on four crops has abstracted us away from the underlying entropy so that's good because we don't die but also from the immense quality that's associated with that richness and so a fine dining experience like the one you're describing is a reintroduction back into that plenitude i'm wondering if beauty itself can be concept ized that way you know because a modern the modern architects built these buildings that are extremely pointed right they called them machines for living that was the germans contribution to the blight that constitutes our cities right machines for living hyper efficient pointers in a single direction and they got rid of all excess ornamentation but we could say that the excess ornamentation is actually a pointer to the plitude beyond that merely efficient point like here's something i figured out about the difference between japan and the united states back in the 1980s so i did a lot of different reports on the japanese economic m miracle back in the 1980s and one of the things i learned about the japanese is that if they get the point right they're unbeatably efficient but sometimes they get the point wrong in which case they're moving like mad in the wrong direction which is an engineering problem right you can imagine hyper efficient engineers pointed in the wrong direction like they are in china with the surveillance state well in the united states which is a way more diverse society which also has a much higher tolerance for eccentricity and criminality the americans are incredibly robust because there's always something crazy going on somewhere in the united states where the new point might be established you know when you get that homogeneous society that's pointed to a single pinpoint if that becomes the wrong direction which it tends to across time anyways then it's pathological efficiency in precisely the wrong direction so there's this you know in the da ching the dao itself which is the proper pathway through life the proper journey is a balance between chaotic plitude and pointed order right it's not order itself it's not the narrowing of the plenitude to a single point it's the dynamic balance between them and okay so one of the things i've been thinking about is that that the sense of meaning the instinct of meaning you could think about that as a kind of meta motivation it's like an amalgam of motivations that have become unified and that's what lends your life the sense of meaning right the sense of meaningful pursuit that seems to be a marker to me it's a biological mar marker for the optimized balance of plitude and focus right so it it it retains the focus that's enables you to be efficient enough to get to where you need to go because that's obviously relevant if everyone was walking around on lsd all the time nothing would ever get done because you can't focus there's just everything is amazing and of course that's amazing but you know what are you going to do if you have to eat so but then if you narrow too much you get the problem that you're describing and you're seeing that reflected in the agricultural enterprise right it's this this hyper so it's it's a focus on four crops but it's also a reduction of the plenitude of the material world itself in accordance with that mapping with that initial mapping see i think we do this to each other too you know is that it's something very dangerous in relationship is that you build a model of the person you're with because you want to predict them and control them that would be the cognitive you know the cognitive explanation and then what people do is they punish each other for deviating from that expectancy set and that keeps them you know narrowed and boxed in but over time it turns your relationship into well people get bored because they've people get bored with their spouse often because they've turn them into a simulacrum of their imagination they interact with the idea of the other person rather than with the person an analogy i think for all for this kind of discussion is is a raindrop running down the hillside or the mountain side if you had an engineer to solve this problem we have this raindrop at the top of the mountain and we want it to the bottom he would take his ruler and he would draw a straight line and say that's the way to go de a raindrop and the raindrop will say no i can't do that and he will come with some kind of machine and dig a channel for it to run down and now what the rain real raindrop does of course is to go a little this way a little that way around obstacles and ds in a zix saac motion all the way down and what it does all the time is to move downwards but downwards is not the same all the way along so it it becomes a very rich thing rather than a straight line i think william blake the the british poet and painter uh some hundred years ago he said that the the the the the straight the the the straight the straight road is the road of of of of of the intellectual road is the road of genius yeah the straight road can become the road of the luciferian intellect right that's really attempting well so and also in the d ching you know that that raindrop analogy is is used quite frequently in the da ching to to refer to the da because the da is exactly the course that water takes when it finds its way down hill and you might say well why not make it hyper efficient and the answer is well what richness do you sacrifice in that single-minded efficient pursuit right and it's a tricky business because you could imagine you're you know in a in a relationship you're trying to negotiate two things you obviously have to come to terms with one another so that there's some mut ual understanding and some prediction and some control but then at the same time you want to have the person develop and transform if you have any sense and you want to have enough variability in their behavior so that they're still well interesting which is good indication of the relationship between meaning and that balance between order and chaos is like if you sterilize your relationship with an excess of predictability you you just your fantasy will start taking you into other relationships that's what'll happen right everything that you've sacrificed to that single-minded aim will make itself manifest in the imagination that's pulling you to a richer experience so know one of the things that i did when i was doing marital counseling for my clients was if they were dissatisfied with their with their spouse let's say said well what are you fantasized about in relationship to a new relationship right what what fantasies spontaneously enter the theater of your imagination and they they would tell me you know in as much detail as was necessary and i would say well why is it impossible for you to seek that within the confines of this relationship you know it might be well she's not like that or he's not like that or she would never do that or he would never act that way it's like well people are pretty damn strange and there's a lot of mystery in them and if if you're dancer you can get a lot of interesting possibility out of people where you thought there was only a stultified actuality one of the things i noticed as a therapist and as an interviewer you know if my clinical session got boring it was because i wasn't paying enough attention i was substituting my presumption for the person and so if i have attended more deeply they would start revealing more of themsel and then they'd become like and this was even true for so-called simp there's no simple people but i had lots of clients who were they weren't intellectually gifted put it that way you know they were people who would have been struggling you know often they didn't have a high school education some of them weren't even literate but if you got them out of the box that maybe you wanted to put them in they were just as unbearably interesting as anyone else and that's there's a norvegian writer fiction writer called axel simus who who wrote in one of his books that that man which does not who does not understand that any woman contains every woman in right right he's an idiot i mean the way you approach your spouse is is understanding she is every woman in this universe and that that could be someone you don't like or someone you like or as ects of being a human being is present in that other human being and the same of course goes for me as a man in that same relationship that i'm the best of men and i'm the worst of men y y y yeah and and the one of the reasons that it's it's it's a it's a good thing to to stick to your relationship to to be faithful to your relationship is then you allow this multitude of possible persons to be there the moment you start thinking oh i would like rather to go over here or there or i would like to change things in that and that way and have have another object of my love then you reduce that person and you don't see the the depth the the richness inside inside that other person and i think that's what a strong and good relationship is about that is what love and openness is about is to allow the other person to be fully rich fully full wonder my wife just about died a couple of years ago and and so did i at about time time like like it was a narrow it was a narrow path pathway you know and i had a pretty good relationship with her before that very good i would say i've known her since she was like 8 years old so we've known each other mostly our whole life you know and she changed quite a bit after she was ill and really for the better once she started to recover and i was much more i would say grateful to have her around i mean not that that wasn't there to begin with it was already there i loved my wife but the the like the demonstrative like a true demonstration of the possibility of her absence woke me up a bit more and one of the things that's happened is that now when i see her i can see her at every stage of her life at the same time it's really something and also what's happened like she shed a lot of her self-imposed constraints in the aftermath of her brush with mortality it lasted like nine months it was very torturous experience so she changed a lot it's taken multiple years for the full manifestation of that change and it still hasn't happened but it's a wonderful thing to see her and maybe it's also reflection of my change in attitude like she's taken off a lot of self-imposed constraints i think we're afraid of our own entropy and know our own possibility and in doing that i would say she's become more like a child again you know and and there's there's insistence in that in wordsworth for example also biblical insistence you know that unless you become his little child you can't enter the kingdom of heaven and it has something to do with that imaginative plurality that you described right because one of the things that's magical about children is their capacity to magically transform and to enchant the world and they do that because they're going in many directions they're not narrowed and you know that makes them in need of discipline and civilization but there's something wonderful about that so i'd like you to comment on that but i'd also like to ask you you know what you just said about relationships that's not something that everybody knows so i'd like to know how you figure that out hard hard work how did i figure that out yeah that well and you can say it not only did you figure it out but you can articulate it and so yeah that's a good question i don't know the answer to it actually but i i i think that it's it's i've always had a tendency to be very monogamous is that what how you say the word in english yeah yeah yeah and faithful to but in in the modern world i mean you you're serly monog you have you you have have more than one relationship but one after the other as a young person you have several girlfriends but you're faithful to each of them all the time is is that understandable absolutely yeah and and so i i and that was unusual in the circles i live where living in in the 70s that people were sort of all over the place all of them and i was like sort of i had this instinct for monogamy and i was sort of wondering why is that so and i realized that it it it was because it made me discover and and explore the richness of the other person instead of just comparing to someone else and and wanting to change someone else and then of course i've been cultivating that emotion and that way of living for for quite some decades now and and it it i think it's very obvious that that the moment you start comparing people yeah that's a commodification yeah and you see the label this guy i'm talking to has these opinions and this track record and so on and and and you you you confuse the person for for the lb yeah and all you see is the labeling and and life becomes very boring and of course what i've been doing with food and agriculture what i've been doing with how we how how our cognition system works what consciousness is all about i've been doing a lot of work also with environmental issues and so on it it's the same basic story all the time that we confuse sort of the the label for the real thing we confuse the terrain for the map yeah the concept for the real stuff and and i think that what we do when we are not sort of faithful in our love relationship is that we we do comparisons all the time instead of saying okay this is it i'm not a perfect man in any sense but all aspects of masculinity and many aspects of femininity is in me y and and and and that's every person is a universe did you know fast growing trees is the biggest online nursery in the us with

terms and conditions may apply right right well this is certainly something that i learned in this is why i love doing psychotherapy because that the art of psychotherapy is to have that realization making itself manifest constantly during the conversation right because that and that means the person is on the cusp of optimized transformation so i've been thinking about this tell me what you think about this i think this is extra cool so i spent a lot of time looking at the misalignment of aim i spent a lot of time investigating evil a lot and evil is actually something you can point to quite simply in some ways it's a rare person who wouldn't think that a sadistic owitz guard who enjoyed his job was that's evil and and people will dispute that but you don't have to talk to the people who will dispute that you know you it's not it's not it's not useful it's fairly easy to point to but the antithesis of that is not easy to specify like good is good as such is harder to specify as a point than evil is but i think you tell me what you think about this so i spent a lot of time studying yak pp who i think is absolutely brilliant you know about pp yeah well he's sp aot yeah yeah emotion and motivation but he spent a lot of time studying play especially in children and he was the first person to identify the play circuit in mammals that it was actually a special specialized circuit and to differentiate it from the exploratory circuit because a lot of neurophysiologists had presumed that exploration and play were identical they're aligned because they're both in the positive emotion space but there is a separate circuitry for play and i think that play i think play is the antithesis of tyranny and i think that play is the place where that plitude makes itself manifest in a manner that doesn't blow the frame badly enough to terrify right so yeah right exactly so so you can see that right i mean that's why children are driven to play but that's also so in your relationship you said that you've been able to discover let's say a multitude within yourself and within your partner and that and that you've also practiced that which i would like to also ask you about like my sense with my wife is that when when we're doing things when things are optimized we're playing house that's a good way of thinking about it that that sense is replicated in our adult life and it's what children are aiming at when of course they do that kind of pretense play when they're when they're young so i want to know what you think about that idea of play because play also has to be voluntary right it it can't be compelled no force in play you know unless you're playing force which you know is a special case you can do that but it's still voluntary so i'd like you to to tell me what you think about the play idea and then i'd also like you to you said you've practiced this way of looking at things so i'd like to know about that because people don't understand what a practice like that is you know we practice all sorts of things like basketball skills but we don't practice perceiving other people as a multitude let's say that's not a standard practice so play and then that practice i play i agree is is beautiful and wonderful and i think it also it's it's it's a wonderful example the the two concepts i would put up against each other would be evil and love rather than evil and good and that's because i i see everything is relational in my worldview i don't have sort of entities out there apart outside human interaction there's something evil in itself there's evilness a lot of it in human interaction and love in a lot of it i see evil as closing the barrier to the other person ignoring their their their pain ignoring their problem ignoring that you do bad stuff for them i see love as the total openness h i exchange everything with you i don't with withhold anything i don't i don't reject anything i just take it because it comes from you and i love you and and in in that sense i say players is a wonderful example of of exercising the ability to to exchange fully with the other person well while eo is i don't want to play with you i don't want to i don't want to have anything to do with you i i have done with many audience audiences a little game that i call the tickling game which was inspired actually by a a new a new psychological experiment done many years ago in england by a group of scientists who were studying whether you could tickle yourself right right which you can if you're schizophrenic apparently exactly and chris sth who made that discovery was part of this group oh okay okay so they made a tickling machine so you could move you know sticks that in a complicated way would actually tickle your skin and then could tickle yourself even if you are not a schizophrenic because you know when and how the tickling would be but basically when you tickle yourself your brain already knows what your hand is doing so there's no ticking sensation but if you tickle the person next to you he or she will will have a giggling and and and it will tickle and sometimes i do with with audiences i ask people experiment two rounds first round tickle yourself doesn't tickle very basic second round you tickle the person sitting next next to you on the left and you and you have these 800 people going from just sitting there to yelling and screaming and no in two second it's dramatic effect and then you say oh somebody didn't get any fun here so now you t to your right people scream and yell again and this is a beautiful example of in my view of that the only thing that's interesting about other human beings is that they're surprising or they surprise us they do things that we cannot control that's why they're so interesting and so nice to us we like being surprised yeah yeah but of course if you went into the to the to the what you call the subway the metro train the uban the s the train in the city and suddenly somebody would tickle you that wouldn't be fun that would be scary so you don't want to you don't want no no control like in the train and you don't want full control like when you tickle yourself what you like is sort of the in between of between control and and and and predictability on the one hand and lot of control on the other hand and that's that's the nice thing that's the do you suppose that okay so you contrasted evil with love and so one of the things i was thinking about when you were talking about this game was that like it seems to me that love is manifest most clearly in a state of play one of the things i've noticed with my wife for example is that if there's anything between us you know an obstacle conceptual obstacle a disagreement about something it's much more difficult to enter into that state of play that has to be clear cleared away before that can really happen and so that's an that's in keeping with pp's findings because pp found that play was very easily suppressed by virtually any other motivational state right so things have to be optimized okay and then i wonder if that if that play like is a play is play a reflection of the love that puts someone on the border between the predictable and the unpredictable in that optic ied way you know cuz you see people doing that if you're playing one-on-one basketball with someone you want a competitor who pushes you right you you don't want to be exactly in your zone of comfort you want to be a little bit outside that right you want to have that it's a glimmer of what's being suppressed by your aim you want to have that still around it's like a halo that's another way of thinking or penumbra something like that right something that's glowing that rem rems you of everything that you're not attending to at the moment there's something very rich about that and you know your your thoughts about monoculture agriculture for example are an indication of the you know there's a there's a there's a there's an insistence in the old testament this is very relevant this is something i've been discussing with some my friends a lot when the old testament people set out their fields you know there's there's always some uncertainty about borders so there was an insistence in those societies that the margins were for gleaners right that's where the poor could find their sustenance and the idea under that was that your boundaries although necessary shouldn't be so tight that there's no room for experimentation and the marginal right which i think and also i found out in keeping with this by the way you know there's a hierarchy of dna repair as a consequence of m mut ation so there's there's core dna structures that if they mutate they're repaired with 100% accuracy right and then there's a hierarchy so that peripheral there are peripheral genetic codes that are allowed to mutate because experimentation can take place there on the fringe without demolishing the ho so that's echoes that echoes that idea of the center you know the focal center with the experiment al fringe that that seems to echo everywhere and that's something like the antidote to that narrow-minded technological efficiency that when did you start to become concerned with that specifically was that associated with your investigation into consciousness with the agriculture problem or yeah yeah the idea of this pathological narrowing yeah i think it's already in the in it's very much in the consciousness thing not of course as fully developed as it became later but it but this this worry that if you exchange sort of the the terrain with with a map the world with a concept the the person with the idea of a person which is very much what consciousness does then you you're you're you on the wrong on the wrong way there's a thing about our language which i think was pointed out about 100 years ago which is which is a very basic thing about language we say this flower is red but no this flower is many things yeah one of them having the color of red this man is angry yes but this man is also many other things than angry this man that's why i don't like sort of to to make evil and objective thing in the world because i think this man is evil yes but he's also other stuff this man is good he's caring and so we are not the the we are not the mental states the emotional states the trait states that we have we are more than that we are we are much richer and we have a language that all the all the time we say he is happy yes but he's he also needs to go through the tlight at a moment you know you understand so so i think studying consciousness very much brought my attention to this very very simple fact that we tend to reduce everything h and it's it's practical in the sense that i can point to the to the flower and say it's red you can n and say it's red and and we are in correspondence here and it's good but we also lose each of us lose a lot of the experience and the and the sensing of the flower if we reduce it to being red have you talked to ian miguel christ no i've heard his name yes okay well so i just i know i and then we just did another podcast which will be released soon so his sense he's done a lot of investigation into hemispheric function right and his work is very much in keeping i would say with with the main thrust of your work the and and i think he's got the neuros pychological terrain mapped quite nicely is that the right hemisphere seems to be i would say more comfortable in the domain of plitude and the left hemisphere is is the reducer and you know the it's possible tell me what you think about this on an ethical side because we've talked about i talked about this with ian because people with right hemisphere damage get kind of tyrannical and authoritarian and they get very reductionistic and and much more than someone who's neurologically intact and i asked him well is that worse among people who were already that way before the brain damage right is there individual variation so if you were a narrowing intellect with an authoritarian bent were you more like that if you damaged your right hemisphere and of course there isn't enough case history to know that but i'm wondering there's an insistence in archaic literature i i've really seen this in the biblical corpus i just wrote a book about this which is going to come out in november i'm lecturing about it now so it's very much on my mind that that narrowing proclivity is a it's like the sin of adam's job in the garden of eden his job is to name and subdue right to name and put in place but pride it's the pride element that seems to warp that it's like it isn't even so much that we narrow it's that we narrow and then we fall in love with our own narrowing and that's the pride and then we want to substitute that narrowing for reality itself this is what god warns again about by the way in the story of of adam and eve when he tells both of them that they can't eat of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil this idea is lurking at the bottom of that it's like you can do what you want but you can't you can't replace the moral order with your own set of preconceptual and that's what you're pointing to right i don't want to put put words in your mouth but that's but that's what's lurking underneath this it's not merely it's not the reduction per se because that's necessary to have a point it's something like is it the totalitarian insistence that we got the reduction right and that's that yes we we confuse the world with our image or our concept of the world we confused the person with the idea have of the person yeah so you can see it's my sense that that's allied with the totalitarian proclivity because i think that becomes pathologized when it's allied with force right it's that yeah well it's that not only do i want you to be in the box i put you in plus everything else but if you're not then look the hell out from me because i can i can oppos that so here's a cool thing so the in the story of moses moses is leading the israelites to the promised land right so it's a it's a it's a quest story and that's the land of milk and honey right it's the land of eternal promise and so that's always what we're doing and that's what a leader is always doing if he's any sort of leader at all now moses fundamental temptation is to use force which is the temptation of a leader and he uses force a number of time times in the story but when he's on the verge of leading the israelites into the promised land god tells him the israelites run out of water and god tells moses to use his words to elicit water from the rocks and moses doesn't he hits the rocks with his rod of authority he strikes them twice and god god tells him that he won't enter the promised land as a consequence of that and i think that's i think that's a story of the eli of narrowing and force right it's that well leader has to specify a direction and that does mean the sacrifice of all other potential directions obviously and then you might say well when does that go too far and it's something like well when it's no longer invitational when it's imposed it it crosses the line when you don't listen to the rock the only way you will get water out of the rock is if you listen to the rock and interact with the rock if you just punish the rock or hit the rock you you're not having a fair interaction with the rock and i so what power is is about not listening doing stuff to people without listening their for their cries and and the sorrows yeah of course if you're the president and and you can hit that bottom and you can kill 100,000 people there's no way you could know about the screaming you produce and that's power so so okay so that ties into your now earlier you juxtaposed love against evil and you assimilated love to relation and you said everything in your world was relational so the insistence in the biblical corpus is that our fundamental mode of being in the world is relational right that's what the covenantal idea is attempting to express it's relational and there's a so but i'm curious about see you said something very specific there right because you associated love as the antithesis of evil and you immediately also expanded that to describe relational and you said that your interaction with the world is relational at every level okay so what do you mean by that and and how did you come to that understanding on on several levels one thing that i've been dealing a lot with in the past year has been the quantum physics that seems very different from all of what we are talking about here but there's in in this quantum physics a strong tradition of interpreting it as all relations relationships and all the problems you get in interpreting quantum mechanics is when you when you say it's out there it's an object it's independent of me and when you start thinking that way you have all these dilemas and and paradoxes of quantum mechanics if you think of it all as relationships you enter into and that it's not meaningful to ask what is the world like when i don't interact with it that that is not simply not a meaningful question to ask because if i don't interact with the with the world how could i mean doesn't make sense to ask how how it would be if i don't do that so in many walks of life i find the same basic structure it's relational and that you have to accept that unperformed experiments have no out coms i mean if if if you don't do things nothing happens and and our social relations of the same nature that it's all about interacting and what is this guy like really if i don't interact with him i don't know what is this guy like really if you don't interact i don't know i'm a relational preacher in that sense and what's happening inside my head is relational and i think that's that's in many ways the most fundamental aspect of this whole consciousness thing is to understand that my consciousness is the collective of human beings in my head i sort of i i see and understand and put words to the world through some kind of eyes of everyone the the collective eye of everyone yeah yeah that's my consciousness and then i have my private experience my sort of mystical experience my psychedelic experience if you like i'm not very much into that but but you could have that and that's sort of very direct and very w but but it's also very private and and and then you can have this i see the world through the eyes of of my friends and their concepts and that's what consciousness is about and that's why it's so useful and also dangerous if we if we forget the rest okay so that so is it fair to say that you you've concluded that that that there that the that what's real is no difference there's no difference between what's real and what emerges as a consequence of what's relational and that's that's the pinpoint of consciousness i mean right it establishes that see and i'm the reason partly the reason i'm curious about this is it it's because of the implications of what we've been describing it's like well if the phenomenal makes itself apparent as a consequence of your aim then reality itself emerges in consequence of your aim and i actually believe that's i don't know how true that is but it's pretty damn true like the way a person is going to reveal themsel to you is very radically dependent on your aim in the interaction and this is true even for very bad people like i've had some people in my clinical practice who were they were terrifying people and you had to step very carefully around them but it was possible to do that not always not i'm not going to get like wildly over optimistic about that but it was dependent to some degree on my skill in specifying my aim you know like i would say the more dangerous the person the better targeted your aim bloody well better be when you're dealing with the more look the hell out right they're very a particularly dangerous person is likely to respond very violently very violently to even minor moral errors on your part that's for sure when you're dealing with them but it is it is an unspecified question to the the degree to which reveal reality reveals itself in accordance with our aim is a very is a very much unspecified question i think the relationship is far deeper than we dare to imagine i come to think for some reason this may maybe a while tanking to take the first time i was in new york city of new york many years ago as a european you know as a naive european i was i was worried it was in back in the 80s i was worried that the crime and i would get into trouble at all kind and i met another danish guy in new york and i asked him what what do i do you live in this neighborhood that's known for high crime rate when i come to visit you how how how do i do that without getting you know knocked over and he say it's very simple just look as if you just appear to other people as if you have a purpose with what you're doing right right right yeah you want to go somewhere and therefore you go through this street because you want to go down and visit me and they won't they won't touch you but the moment you come in and you say i'm an interested tourist and i would like to see people live in in a poor life and new york is all crime and i want to see that yeah they'll hit then you're a prey animal yeah and yeah but but also you are intruding in their world yeah right right yeah yeah absolutely well when you have when you have your i want to go there go there because i have a friend to visit and that's my aim that's my target that's what i'm doing then you're not annoying them because you're you you're doing something and i think that yeah in in interaction with people who have who are in trouble who have difficulties in life it's important to that yourself you show that there's something i want to do with my life i'm interested in stuff i'm also interested in you not because of of of i i want to sneeze on your life or something but i i'm just i'm open to you but i'm going this way and i think that's it's it's it's an anecdote to illustrate this what you're saying actually y yep well look sir we're at our 93 minute mark so that's pretty good that's actually a pretty good place to end too and so i just i'll close this way so i have a list of recommended books online it's hundred of them and they're books that were you know had a market influence on me and i picked the books very carefully and yours is one of them that user illusion i think that's the best book that is the best book on consciousness i ever read and i read a lot of them so i would recommend that book to anybody who's watching and listening it's it's it's quite the tour to force i thought it was very well grounded scientifically it's very well written it's very accessible and it really helped me think through the relationship between compression and focus and reduction and consciousness and that was useful i'd already been interested in huxley's idea you know of the reducing valve which you know as as as a function of consciousness trying to to to think that through but you you elaborated on that made it clear in a way that i have i haven't actually seen anyone else do now you know friston's work and so forth is a nice elaboration of that and i think the same about gibson but but your book pulled in the linguistic in a way that i thought was extremely original and useful so so for everybody who's watching and listening the user illusion that's a book i'd highly recommend it it's got a lot to teach you and it's deeper than you might think too because it's an elegant book and it's clearly written and it so its depth is somewhat hidden which is also the mark of a master author right so yeah and i had a blast talking to you today we went all sorts of interesting places so i'd like to thank you for that for everybody watching and listening i'd like to thank you guys for your time and attention and as always and i'm going to continue to talk to tor nor trenders on the daily wire side of things i'm going to walk through his life in a bit more detail he's written a lot of books we only focused on one really and and made reference to some of the others but we'll flesh that out a little bit and see where else we can we can get and so if you want to join us on that venture please feel free to the film crew here in toronto today thank you very much for your time and and your help and for how smoothly it and to the daily wire people who put this together and make it free for everyone which is you know pretty good deal for everybody as far as i'm concerned they deserve continual thanks for that and to you thank you very much for spending 90 minutes with us and letting us know sharing the fruits of your thought thank you for having me that was a great great fun all right sir [music]
