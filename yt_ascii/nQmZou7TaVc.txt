preventing a pathogen from entering our respiratory system at first glance may seem obvious the first thought might be to trap them by preventing particles from moving through a filter but looking deeper at the problem reveals the true scope of the challenge with every normal breath we take we inhale around a half liter fear the pressure difference between the atmosphere and our lungs during inhalation peaks at around 8 centimeters of water for comparison a typical shop vac can pull a vacuum of around 200 centimetres of water or about 25 times that of our lungs pathogens can vary widely in size with bacteria generally ranging in size from 1 to 20 micrometers to viruses which can range from 17 nanometers up to 750 nanometers the rhino virus that causes the common cold for example is around 30 nanometers in diameter while hiv sars cough - and some strains of influenza hover around 120 nanometers physically creating a sieve that would prevent a 30 nanometer particle from passing through would be absurdly impractical as an opening would only be about 200 oxygen atoms wide our respiratory system is simply not capable of moving enough air through such a filter it would also be unsuitable for inexpensive mass production modern n95 respirators however managed to accomplish this level filtration in an efficient manner which can be easily powered by our breaths inexpensive and easily produced in bulk they accomplish this exploiting the peculiar characteristics of particles at these scales n95 respirators are part of a class of respiratory protection devices known as mechanical filter respirators these mechanically stop particles from reaching the wearer's nose and mouth another form of respiratory protection is the chemical cartridge respirator these are specifically designed to chemically remove harmful volatile organic compounds and other vapors from the breathing air both classes of respirators are available in powered configurations known as powered air purifying respirators these devices use battery-powered blowers to force air through either a chemical or mechanical filter allowing for the use of more gross of filtration the filter type in these systems must be matched to the contaminants the n95 designation is a mechanical filter respirator standard is set and certified by the national institute for occupational safety and health in the united states the number designates the percentage of airborne particles removed not their size while writings up to n 100 that can filter up to 99.97% of airborne particles exists n95 respirators were determined to be suitable for short term healthcare use in the 1990s other designations include oil resistant ar and oil proof p respirators which are designed to be more durable and maintain filter effectiveness against oily particles and industrial use surgical grade and 95 respirators possessing fluid resistance were specifically cleared by the united states food and drug administration for medical use internationally other similar rating standards are used to designate respirators the european standard denotes masks as ffp one two or three with ffp two being the equivalent of an n95 respirator others such as china use a designation system similar to the u.s. some of these standards such as the one used by europe also denotes the maximum allowed inward leakage of the mask modern mechanical filter respirators work not by netting particles but rather by forcing them to navigate through a high surface area maze of multiple layers of filter media this concept allows for large unobstructed paths for air to flow through while causing particles to attach the fibers due to a number of different mechanisms in order to achieve the high surface area required a nonwoven fabric manufacturing process known as melt blow is used for the filter media in this technique high-temperature high-pressure air is used to melt a polymer typically polypropylene while it's spinning this produces a tough yet flexible layer of material composed of small fibers depending on the specifications of the layer being produced these fibers can range from 100 mark meters all the way down to 800 nanometers in diameter how these fibers capture particles are determined by the movement of air through the filter media the path of air traveling around the fiber moves in streams the likelihood of a particle to stay within the stream is primarily determined by its size the largest particles in the air tend to be slow moving and predominantly settle out due to gravity particles that are too small for the effects of gravity down to around 600 nanometers are primarily captured by inertial impact and interception inertial impaction occurs on larger particles in this size range when a particle cannot follow the air stream around the fiber because of its inertia it impacts the fiber where it's captured in the interception mechanism smaller particles stay within the air stream but due to their size are naturally brought close enough to come in contact with the fiber in contrast particles below 100 nanometers are mainly captured through a mechanism known as diffusion random movements of air molecules caused these very small particles to wander across the air stream due to brownian motion because the path taken through the filter is drawn out the probability of capture through inertial impact or interception increases dramatically particularly at low airflow velocities as a supplementary capture mechanism some manufacturers such as 3m also employ electrostatic coatings they capture particles through charge though the quantity of charge and its longevity are difficult to quantify it has proved it to be a highly effective method of capture in testing because of the complex overlapping methods by which particle filtration occurs thus most particles are not the most difficult to filter in fact the point of lowest filter efficiency tends to occur where the complimenting methods begin to transition into each other around 50 to 500 nanometers particles in this range are too large to be effectively pushed around by diffusion and too small to be effectively captured by interception or inertial impaction this also happens to be the range of some of the more harmful viral pathogens interestingly the more respirators worn the more efficient it becomes this is due to the captured particles now becoming part of the filter medium further offering more surface area to capture additional particles the downside of this is that the air flow now becomes more restricted with the mask eventually becoming unusable because of this the ideal lifespan for a typical n95 respirator is about eight hours in addition they are easily degraded by liquids even in surgical grade masks disposable is recommended once bodily fluids have compromised them the weakest point on any respirator is how well it seals against the face air will always pass through the facial leaks because they offer much lower resistance than the respirator carrying particles with it with substantial leaks a respirator with a higher filtration efficiency rating may actually offer less protection than a properly fitted respirator that has a lower filtration efficiency rating because of this potential for operating under a false sense of security training and constant fit and seal testing are critical to their effective use [music] [music] [music]
