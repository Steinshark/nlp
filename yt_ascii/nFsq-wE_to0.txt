you got it finally we talk a lot about coding and 
software engineering on this channel but there's   equally if not more jobs that do not require any 
coding skills that pay over a hundred thousand   dollars annually that you can do whether you have 
coding skills or maybe you don't but you want to   break into tech today we are going to be covering 
some of the highest paying non-coding related   jobs in tech before we get into it though make 
sure to hit that subscribe button for more tech   encoding related videos leave in the comments any 
questions you have or other video topics you want   me to make because as you know that is how i make 
these videos okay let's just dive right into it   when i was first getting into tech or when 
i think of when i used to anyways think of   the tech industry i'd always associate it with 
very technical roles and i think a lot of people   do that as well especially 
if they are inexperienced or   haven't really been in the tech industry before 
you think oh i would love to get into tech but   i don't want to learn how to code or coding 
just isn't for me so clearly tech isn't for me   and it couldn't be further from the truth yes 
there are a lot of amazing technical roles that   you can do within tech of course but there are 
equally actually probably more definitely more   roles in tech that do not require any technical 
skills any coding skills when going through   different roles in tech that do not require any 
coding i'm going to be using levels.fyi i'll link   it down below but it's a really great site and i 
find it to be one of the most reliable sites for   accurate total compensation for total 
packages within the tech industry so   oftentimes when i make videos that i reference or 
refer to different typical annual salaries or   full annual compensations i usually go to levels 
fyi because it's accurate and it's very reliable   and it has a ton of different data points based on 
different companies in different locations and as   always i feel like we need to have a disclaimer 
here stating that yes different roles or the   same role will vary based on compensation based 
on company and based on where you are working   so these are based out of cities throughout the 
united states but if you are not located in the   united states this salary this total compensation 
or salary might vary based on where you're located   the first one on the list is product manager 
there's no surprise here that product manager   would make it onto this list as it is a very 
high in demand and popular role that requires   zero coding skills of course like anything if you 
have some background or technical background it   always helps but it definitely is not required and 
when i go on to levels fyi the average salary for   a or sorry average total compensation i should 
say for a product manager varies from'0 to   160 and once again that really varies so for right 
now it says mastercard for the company mastercard   is 169 000 wells fargo is'0 000 so as you can 
see the salary range does vary but overall you can   easily make over a hundred thousand dollars with a 
product manager role so what exactly is a product   manager what do they do this is something when i 
got into tech and i had my first product manager   i was like what do you do like you seem to be very 
busy and you do a lot but i don't understand what   you do when i think product manager i like to 
think of them as almost the point person the   key person through developers designers the client 
it's kind of like there there's this like swirl or   tornado going around all these moving parts and 
they are in the middle of it making sure that   everything flows together smoothly other roles or 
other duties in a product manager's job would be   to ensure that the product planning and execution 
goes smoothly that everything runs smoothly that   we are meeting the clients needs or meeting 
the needs of the new features we are building   and they have a role where you really need 
to have strong communication skills excellent   planning skills breaking down problems and 
also being very flexible different problems   will come your way pretty much on a daily basis 
so you need to be able to really take different   things from both the technical side to the client 
side different problems coming at every angle   and be able to not completely get stressed out 
but rather take a step back and just solve it i   actually have and i'll pull up on screen here 
a little product manager job description that   i found and i think it is a good job so this 
would be something that if a company was   looking for a product manager they would use and 
it says here the product manager is responsible   for product planning and execution throughout 
the product lifestyle cycle so from beginning   to end so some expectations include defining the 
product strategy and roadmap that's a huge thing   for product managers to really define the road map 
of when new features are going to be implemented   and the timeline for those and also another 
thing that's really important is to be an   expert with respect to the competition if you are 
going to be a product manager you need to know   what competition is out there what they are 
putting out and just be aware of that as well   the next role i want to talk about is tech sales 
and this is very wide term so tech sales can range   from so many different definitions because 
really at the end of the day a technology sales   individual could be selling some really complex 
software to more different solutions it's really   varies and i think that's why the term varies 
as well one thing though that remains the same   is if you are a good keyword good because there 
are many different kinds of tech sales people   you can easily make over a hundred thousand 
per year of course with tech sales you get   bonuses a lot of times if you sell a certain 
amount you get another bonus on top of that   there's a lot of different incentives put in place 
to ensure that you are meeting your quota when   i go on levels fyi for tech sales now once again 
this can completely range it says for microsoft   in actually this is in the uk it is and fourteen 
thousand dollars annually for aws in san francisco   it is a hundred and eighty thousand annually 
and well where else we got for ibm it is 200 000   annually and this by the way once again this is 
total compensation so they are actually including   base stock and they say they're including bonus 
in this so i'd be interested to know if there   is another bonus on top of this or if this is 
including the average percentage of bonus as   well and i'm sure we all know what tech sales do 
they essentially interact with other businesses   to help solve or provide solutions to their 
problems and they do this through selling   different softwares for the company they are 
working for and one thing about tech sales is   you do not need to be a technical person but you 
really have to have a deep understanding of the   technology you are selling so there is going 
to be a lot of time spent learning about the   technology you are selling what it can do the 
whys the hows the whats the whole what is it   what how what why when all the w's and really 
understanding it because your client might be   a very technical person other times maybe they 
won't be but you really don't know what kind of   level of experience to the person you are selling 
this technology to that you will be engaging with   so you need to come in very technically aware 
and technically armed with what you are selling   technical sales is really for anyone who has 
strong communication skills you need to be   outgoing to some degree and you also of course 
need to really enjoy speaking to other people   also you have to enjoy getting told no sometimes 
and thinking of it as a step forward versus if   some other personalities get told no they just 
get really sad and down and might not be a job for   them but you need to be able to stay motivated 
even if you get a lot of doors closed on you   because you have to be hungry if you're getting 
into tech sales but it can be a very lucrative   career next on the list is technical recruiter 
and there's many people even people i have worked   with before that start out as an engineer and 
actually go into recruitment because they maybe   want to break from the coding side of things they 
go more into technical recruitment but there are   a lot of amazing technical recruiters out there 
that actually have no coding no tech experience   and i know if you're watching this you're probably 
like yeah i've had so many terrible experiences   with technical recruiters for myself i actually 
had one where the job was for a javascript role   and i got on the phone with a technical recruiter 
and they're like tell me everything you know about   java i hardly know anything about java i thought 
like this is javascript it's totally different   but you have to say it in a way that 
you don't make the recruiter feel   silly or silly for messing up such a what they 
think could be such a simple mistake but for the   person who's getting interviewed it could be a 
make or break because it's completely different   so i've had both really good experiences with 
technical recruiters and also some really bad ones   but overall if you want to be a good technical 
recruiter you do not have to have a technical   background but you do need to spend the time 
doing the research and having an understanding   of the different technologies out there especially 
for what you're recruiting for for a technical   recruiter the average salary based on levels.fyi 
for example for stripe in new york city is 138   thousand we have wayfair which is in boston and 
that is 108 000. some places as well for technical   recruiters they will have bonuses or incentives so 
if you bring in this really wonderful employee or   you know you're recruiting and you find these 
people that are for more technical or very   difficult jobs or difficult roles to fill you will 
get an added on bonus for finding those people   the next one on the list is ux researcher 
and sometimes this is combined with ui   and ux but if it's a big enough company they might 
have separate roles for each and a ux researcher   systematically studies and targets users to 
collect and analyze data that will help inform the   product design process so when you are researching 
for user experience you want to understand who is   the target market what is what is their habits 
what is their likes what is their dislikes you   want to know the people so well ins and outs of 
who you are targeting and with this information   you give it back to the product designers so 
that they can design the best product possible   for the knowledge that they are given or for the 
information they are given for ux researchers a   lot of times this includes different interviews 
diary studies usability testing you might be doing   a b testing for example on screen if there is a 
button in the left hand corner how does it perform   versus if it's in the right hand corner things 
like this to some of us might sound very for me   for example as a software developer that sounds 
so it just does not sound fun to me at all but   i'm sure a lot of ux researchers think my job does 
not sound fun so i'm glad there's something for   everyone but they get very integra intricate and 
intricate i can't speak intricate in what they are   looking for and they really really analyze the 
finest details because it is true these little   human behaviors differentiate so much and can make 
a huge impact on how the product is designed and   can almost make him break a product so for ux 
research if i go to levels fyi let's see here it is a very high paying one for example spotify 
in new york is 145 000. we have microsoft in   california which is 167 000. what else do we 
have here for someone just starting out in user   experience at american express it is a hundred and 
ten thousand so as you can see another role that   easily is over a hundred thousand annually okay 
let's talk about the next one which is marketing   operations and this is something that a lot of 
my friends started out in marketing and when i   was younger because it used to be a few years 
ago i feel like marketing was like the hottest   the hottest job to do if you stare in marketing 
or advertising you're like really cool and hip   and with it and maybe that's still what it is 
today i'm just maybe i'm just not with it's my age   i'm just kidding but marketing operations 
is a really interesting job and especially   when you combine it with technology so the 
marketing operations is expected to manage   multiple marketing automation platforms such 
as the website ecommerce solutions review and   approve software that we are using content 
management system so maybe you are using   wordpress for the blog for your company's blog 
or shopify for the e-commerce side the marketing   operations person handles all of this they have 
to have although it's not a technical job you   do have to be able to really be able to navigate 
different websites very well and the back end of   things for especially content management systems 
or e-commerce sites you need to be familiarized   with a lot of these different tools okay let's 
go to levels fyi and see what the salary is okay   marketing operations okay so for stripe since we 
were speaking about stripe in california for a   very senior marketing operations person we are 
looking at 256 000 annually once again this is   for a very very senior marketing operations person 
but i included this because it's so great to know   that with non-technical skills you can still enter 
the tech industry and really make so much money   okay another one is from amazon or sorry facebook 
in california as well and that is for a hundred   and forty thousand annually so a little less 
senior of course but still an amazing paying role   and i think it's interesting the pay difference 
based on company and how senior you are and also   on location that really takes factor as well okay 
those are some of the top paying non-technical   roles that you can get working in tech and i 
was super excited to make this video because   as i mentioned at the beginning we 
speak a lot about different tech and   technical roles and how high paying they are 
and how amazing they are and all of this but   i really wanted to i never wanted to make 
people feel that if they aren't interested   in coding that there isn't a spot in tech for 
them because there definitely is tech is one of   if not the fastest growing industry in the world 
and being a part of this industry there is so many   different roles and skills required both soft and 
technical rules i hope you found this video very   helpful and valuable make sure to leave in the 
comments other videos that you want me to cover   give this video a thumbs up and i 
will see you all soon thanks everyone you
