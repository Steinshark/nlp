ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio want to do something a bit different today i want to share with you guys by the way we're in the studio and knight of course came in had to get in the studio at night you guys know how it is i want to talk to you guys a little bit about some free advice that changed my life you guys know first of all how i'm a fan of free things second of all generally speaking you know i'm not trying to tell you guys that i have the answers but i'm just gonna tell you something that helped me out because i realized the other day that i've been in the game the youtube game for seven years this is actually my first video that i ever uploaded right here it was a piano video and that's seven years ago february 1st 2014. now it's private and it will stay be staying that way to be honest i knew nothing about cameras lighting anything else now you see me i'm in the 10 million dollar studio you say stephen you just maybe maybe you were just born like this maybe you just know how to make the stuff because you're you're you're just gifted the answer is no it was a long process and i want to share with you guys something because the truth is if you're going to do anything ambitious it is going to take a lot of time of just being bad and you have to get comfortable with that i know that seems counterintuitive but if you can just cut get comfortable with the fact that you're going to fail for a long time to achieve what you want you can improve your odds because when i started youtube i knew that the odds were stacked against me so i just said to myself if i can endure failure for longer than your average person my odds go up right there's no guarantees in life obviously it's a very hard thing to kind of break into but my odds improve enormously and so you guys now see the coffee zilla you see the 10 million dollar studio you see the lambo and you say stephen you're this big shot success whatever and the reality is that no it was just a lot of work in fact when did coffee break start because that's when i first like started to get a little bit of success coffee break started three years after my first video so in three years i got 400 subscribers now how do you deal with that how do you well i'll tell you how i dealt with it and you you'll find your own way but this is a video that i've shared probably i don't know probably 10 times just this week it's one of my favorite videos on the internet and it really helped me when i was sucking i thought i'd share it with you guys today maybe you'll get a little bit of it out of it maybe not i don't know it's just a different kind of video this is by the way who who is this because right we don't just listen to random people this is ira glass critter of this american life it's one of the most successful podcasts and he does really interesting stories but he's about to share with you about like the gap as we'll call it nobody tells people who are beginners and i really wish somebody had told this to me is that if you're watching this video you somebody wants to make videos right and all of us who do creative work like you know we get into it and we get into it because we have good taste do you mean like you want to make tv because you love tv you know what i mean because there's stuff that you just like love imagine little coffeezilla watching this no subscribers no one's watching i'm trying to ditch chemical engineering a stable career path to do youtube how could i do it this changed my life okay so you've got really good taste and you get into this thing that i don't even know how to describe but it's like there's a gap that for the first couple years that you're making stuff yeah what you're making isn't so good okay so it's not that great it's not it's not really not that great he's lying to you it's gonna be worse than not great it's trying to be good it has ambition to go but it's not quite that good but your taste the thing that got you into the game your your taste is still killer and your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you're making is kind of a disappointment to you you know what i mean like you can tell that it's still sort of crappy a lot of people never get past that face a lot of people at that point they quit ding ding ding ding ding ding guys i would just like say to you with all my heart is that most everybody i know who does interesting creative work they went through a phase of years where they had really good taste they could tell what they were making wasn't as good as they wanted it to be they knew it felt short you know and like and some of us could admit that to ourselves and some of us are a little less able to admit that to ourselves but we knew like it didn't have this special thing that we wanted to have the thing i would say to you is everybody goes through that and for you to go through it if you're going through right now if you're just getting out of that phase if you're just starting off and you're entering into that phase you got to know it's totally normal and that is the statement that completely changed because the idea that it's normal to fail over and over and over in the first years of getting into anything and by the way he's talking about creative work here he's like obviously in radio i think it applies to everything i think this advice applies across the board i think it was mark cuban who said try to get your first you know failure in business out of the way as quickly as possible if you're going to go into entrepreneurship in other words it's normal it's completely normal to fail especially when you get started and so often i feel like the whole if there was a a through line with fake gurus it would be people trying to take shortcuts in life in order to find success faster people trying to find blueprints for something that doesn't really have a blueprint i can't tell you how many times i've told people what the things i've learned on youtube and what actually is holding them back when i watch their videos is just they haven't put in the time it's not some magic formula it's just they haven't made enough stuff they haven't put enough hours in and that's what people are always trying to you know replace i mean the easiest way to see this is in the gym you know everyone knows how to get ripped in the gym it's just work out the reason most people are not you know ripped cut is not because they don't have the the best trainer in the world it's because they don't want to put in the time you and i both know that and yet for some reason it feels like this is kind of hard to find advice these days and why because you can't sell it nobody's selling this advice the most important possible thing you could do is do a lot of work that too huge volume of work put yourself on a deadline so that every week or every month you know you're going to finish one story you know what i mean whatever it's going to be like you create the deadline it's best if you have somebody who's waiting for work for you somebody who's expecting it from you even if it's not somebody who pays you but that you're in a situation where you have to turn out the work because it's only by actually going through a volume of work that you're actually going to catch up and close that gap yeah and that's also something that i really internalize especially with coffeezilla i mean only a year year and change ago i decided i needed to start not just doing you know i needed to do more videos i was putting out a video a month and i was like that's too slow and coffeezilla really i started to kind of find my voice when i started to do more videos i don't know if this is true for everyone i know some people like to take their time with videos but that really resonates with me as far as doing a huge volume of work and look i know for a lot of you none of this resonates maybe you don't care about this maybe you have a job maybe you don't want to you know do something kind of off the beaten path but i also know that a lot of people do and you hear the stats of you know how often people fail and you want to know how you can give yourself a better shot well i'm telling you how i gave myself i feel like a better shot at least was internalizing this message and being willing to commit basically four to five years of very little success very little success on youtube until finally things i kind of started to figure out you know how to make videos that are worth watching if that makes sense and i still feel like i'm finding that out every day i mean i've told someone just the other day like most of my videos are disappointments to me which is true and i am committed to making them better for you that's the purpose of the 10 million dollar studio that's the purpose of always trying to change things is because i'm obsessed with getting this stuff better you know it's not always going to be about fake gurus but my real craft my real passion which is making videos and entertaining people i will always be getting better at that i don't know if this resonates with anyone and it's a different video it's outside my normal wheelhouse but yeah i just thought i'd share share with you a little coffeezilla at night i hope you enjoyed i'll see you next a trick trying to time me on a dream but that was where you lost me wake up and smell the coffee
