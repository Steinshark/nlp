we need to go all in from a hardware perspective they need to see that we are willing to stand up and allow an ally to have what they need to have to aggressively prosecute their own defense and by the way i believe if we had done that early on in russia we wouldn't be in this circumstance with ukraine and we should take that as a lesson for china and taiwan and other areas in asia [music] hello everyone watching and listening today i'm pleased to speak with lawyer federal prosecutor and former new jersey governor now running for president chris christie we discussed the unfortunate and disproportional power of teachers unions the potentially perpetual state of the ukraine russia war the impact of the biden laptop scandal and why donald trump at least in mr christie's opinion might not be the right republican candidate going forward all right well thank you for agreeing to talk to me today and and to everyone who's listening and watching it's quite an exciting development as far as i'm concerned to see these long form dialogues take their place in the in political discourse because it really allows people the opportunity to unfold their vision so i i thought the first thing i might ask you cuz i think this is the question that's foremost on my mind and should be on the minds of people who are watching and listening is why do you think that you would be a good president what what is it that makes you stand out from the other the rest of the pack say on the republican side or on the democrat side as well why should people be concentrating on your campaign well facts first off thanks for having me on and i look forward to this kind of long form conversation as well i think it's much more informative for folks i i'd say three things come to mind immediately the first is that you know i think we've gotten in in our country too small in terms of our politics we're arguing about what i think are relatively small things in the grand scheme of what our country should be working on we're dividing each other into smaller and smaller groups we're pitting each other against each other and anger seems to be the predominant emotion i i want to be president because i want to do the big things this country i think has always been at its greatest when it does big things and you know for me some of those examples of some of those things are our educational system k to 12 i think is failing our country and our families miserably when a third of our kids can't read at grade level in this country we need to have a radical change in the way we educate kids k to 12 and i'm going to go into some more detail on that hopefully later in the conversation but i want to put parents much more in charge of those things and empower them to do it second crime in this country has become a a near epidemic problem in our cities and it's affecting quality of life and the ability of people to enjoy all the great things that we have in america's cities and and this is because prosecutors locally have decided they don't want to prosecute quality of life crime and violent crime in the way that they used to i think if you don't have a sense of the rule of law and law and order in your country that that diminishes everyone's ability to enjoy their lives and to make the most of them and so as president and i would make sure that we send federal prosecutors into all the cities that have significant crime problems if the local prosecutors won't prosecute that that violent crime we will and make sure that we clean up what's going on in our cities third i think that america's got to continue to play a leading role in the world and i think we have too much dissent in our own party which is fine to have the argument but i think the argument needs to be resolved on behalf of america being a leader around the world and so that's why i favor our support in ukraine and would enhance it increase it because i think it's a proxy war right now between the united states in the west and china china supplying the the money for russia to prosecute this war and the expansionism that has always been a part of russian foreign policy is right on display and we need to stop it right where it is because a free and secure europe is very important to america's political and economic future and and lastly what i'd say is that we don't talk to each other anymore in government we we tweet at each other or or whatever it's called now ex at each other we we use social media to do that stuff the the reason i'm different is because i was a republican governor for eight years in a democratic state with a democratic state legislature and i had to figure out how to work with the other side to accomplish things that mattered and that were consistent with my principles there's nobody else in the race that's had that experience and that's most what it's like in washington dc and we need a president again who's willing to spend his or her political capital on building those relationships and trying to get things done i've always operated jordan in my career in politics on the principle that it's harder to hate up close and the the more that we get to know each other the more we get to know each other's families what motivated us to get into public life what our priorities are what we really want to accomplish the greater chance we have to be able to get things done for the american people and so so i think that makes me a lot different than any other candidate in this race and it will allow me to solve problems like immigration solve problems like our entitlement programs and their impending bankruptcy and the effect that would have on the american people so that's why people should be focusing on me and on my on my campaign okay so you outlined four basic categories education law and order let's say foreign policy america's role in the world and then dialogue between republicans and democrats let's let's start at the top of that list on the education side i know that as governor you introduced a number of educational reforms i was reading today that at at least at the moment there's no long-term indication that they've actually improved educational performance that's not surprising to me because it actually turns out to be quite difficult to to reform education in a way that actually makes a difference and and maybe that's wrong i haven't done a lot of delving into the direct consequences of your reforms but i do have some specific questions on the education front so and here's one that's really perplexed me for a long period of time so i worked at harvard in 92 to '98 and i spent a lot of time analyzing research that was done in the departments or in the faculties of education and the faculties of education since the early 60s have abdicated their responsibility entirely they generally they generally train the least motivated students at university often the ones with the worst grades de devolve into teaching because they can't figure out what else to do the quality of research that the faculties of education have produced to call it appalling is barely to scraped the surface they've championed whole word reading they've championed self-esteem training emotional social learning multiple intelligences like a whole emotional intelligence a whole panoply of of con concepts that have no scientific standing whatsoever and have done nothing but hurt kids and they've become they're likely among the most woke disciplines the farthest left disciplines that have emerged within the university yet they have a hammer lock on teacher certification and that gives them access to 50% of american state budget so one of the things i'm curious about i also noticed that you ched the republican governors association i cannot understand why the republican governors haven't taken teacher certification away from the faculties of education i mean why are they allowed to have a hammerlock on teacher production there's no evidence whatsoever that they're good at doing their jobs and plenty of evidence to the contrary so well that's a specific question i have but i'm also curious about what else you're devoted to on the educational reform front and why you think it would what why you think it would work well let me start by talking about your specific thing it was one of the big fights that i had in new jersey that i wound up not being able to win because i needed legislative support to get it done and as hard as i tried to do it the teachers unions as you know are an enormous political force and while i diminished a lot of their influence i couldn't get off of the teacher certification front and i think you put your finger on something that is extraordinarily important if you're going to reform our national education system is the idea that great teachers do not often come from departments of education in our universities and colleges and so that's one of the one of the fronts that we have to have a national conversation and arguments about more broadly i do think that when you talk about the hammerlock on 50% of state budgets you're right and in some instances is even more in terms of the amount of money that's spent we're spending about $800 billion nationwide a year on k to2 education and i think it's time to have the federal government lead the way and encourage states that are already providing educational choice and those that are not to move much towards much more towards a choice model and not just for underprivileged folks but for everybody and that if public schools will only get better if they have to compete and if they have to compete in a meaningful way against other options private schools parochial schools but also within the public system a broader availability of charter schools and renaissance schools which operate much differently so when you look back in in new jersey one of the places where we had we our reforms did have a huge impact was in the city of camden where they they had six of the 10 lowest performing schools individual schools in the entire state and what we did was take over the board of education there and we encouraged the development of charter and renaissance schools in the city and authorized them to compete with the traditional public schools and what you've seen jordan is an enormous increase in both the reading and math scores if you look at the last 10 years in the city of camden there's been enormous increase in that in the in the k to5 range and i think that that competition is leads to other reforms that are really necessary for instance you know having a longer school year having a 10 and a half to an 11 month school year rather than the school year we do now having longer school days you know kids need more time both every day and throughout the year to be educated in the right way and especially kids who come from our inner cities and may not necessarily have the supported home to encourage the type of learning that becomes holistic and so we need to reform this in every way we can and provide more choice and give parents the financial resources they need to be able to effectuate that choice so if you want to go to a public school if you have a good public school in your in your town continue to go to it and your money will go to public school but if you choose to send them to a charter school renaissance school private school pral school you should have the resources in an account to be able to spend on your child's education rather than continuing to cow toow to the public sector teachers unions that as we saw most starkly during coid care only about protecting the least of their members and not in the main in educating our children so so i would like to delve a bit more into you said that when you tried to transform the hammerlock of the teachers union say on te on on on the provision of teaching in new jersey that you you battle to a standstill and that was partly because you were also facing a democrat controlled legislative assembly and so of course that makes it more difficult but i'm i'm i'm still i'm i'm my curiosity in this front isn't satiated yet because it looks to me like such a colossal failure on the republican side both at the state level local state and national level to allow you know we're in the midst of a terrible culture war it's not exactly obvious that the even the classic liberals or the conservatives are winning it's clearly the case that the radicals have got a hold of the education system they're doing that through the faculties of education i can't understand how it can be that the republicans have essentially been blind to this for 60 years it's 60 years now given that the long-term future of the political state rests upon the information that kids are receiving in schools with regards to their political education but now you but you have hands-on experience with this you tried to fight the fight and it was very very difficult for you to bring about any reform so so two questions there why exactly was it so difficult what is it that the teachers unions manage with their access to these great walloping chunks of financial resource and also why do you think why are you convinced that the provision of choice among parents is the proper primary target in relationship to educational reform first on on the the battle on certification i agree with you by the way in in states where republicans control everything it's it's astonishing to me that you wouldn't focus on teacher certification and taking that out of the hands of the professional teachers unions and and so to me it was one of the things that we focused on very early on so it wasn't something we missed it it it gets to your second point which is i give you for instance in in in my state we have 200,000 members of the teachers union in our state that create through their dues which at the time i was governor were $700 a year so the teachers union was collecting $140 million a year and they didn't pay a nickel chore teacher salaries teacher pension or teacher healthare and that money was just a slush fund to reward their friends and to punish their enemies that's a lot of money jordan in a state and when and and the best indication of it is if you look at the state capital capital in trenton new jersey when when i would look out the front door of the state house beside the state house the second largest building on state street in trenton was the teachers union building it it was no mistake they wanted to send that message every time a legislator walked in and out of that building that they're bigger and stronger than any other interest group in the state now look i campaigned against them and won twice statewide it's possible to win these things but in a state legislature dominated by democrats they essentially buy them jordan i mean they just buy them both in terms of buying them with favor but also buying them through fear and intimidation and you know they went after the senate a democratic senate president in my state because he went with me on some educational reform issues most particularly pension reform for teachers and health benefit reform for teachers so they'd have to pay more into those systems to make them more solvent they went after him three different elections and the guy is the president of the iron workers union in new jersey a fellow union member they went after him three times the third time they finally defeated him and he's out of the legislature now so they try to show persistence with their object lessons and in a state where you have a democratic legislature or a democratic governor you just saw this in pennsylvania josh piro ran as a centrist democrat for governor promising that he would provide educational choice the republican legislature put the bill on his desk and he vetoed it under pressure from the teachers union and broke his word that he gave during the campaign and during the transition and so it's another example of it lastly you asked why i focus on parental choice because i think it's one of the hardest arguments to argue against that if in fact your education that you're providing in the traditional public schools is so great that of course parents would choose it but if they if it isn't parents should have the right to make that choice for their kids and and it should be any parent gets the right to make gets the right to make that choice i do think jordan that our our history has shown that competition does almost always bring improvement and also exposes weakness and that could be another way to get at the teach your certification issue when because remember these charter schools private schools parochial schools often can operate under different rules they don't have unions in the main that they have to deal with and can hire some different folks and i think that that can help by showing how successful they are to break the the hammerlock that you very rightly pointed out at the top of this conversation on teacher certification in our public schools right so it allows for more experimentation with regards to the provision of education corre highlights weaknesses and and allows for for the poorer players to to be to be deselected by the market right so the experimentation issue there seems key as well it doesn't hurt as well i suppose to also devolve back to parents the responsibility to pay some attention to exactly how their children are being educated what do you think strategically what do you think strategically might be done apart from focusing on parental choice amongst the republicans or more classically liberal or conservatively oriented people to push back against the the the the the monopoly that's enjoyed by the teachers unions and the teacher certification process what did you learn what did you learn strategically from the battle you engaged in in new jersey well with the successes that we had jordan the way we got them was by pointing out common sensical problems with the way the system operates so for instance i did over a 100 town hall meetings on this issue across our state on the issues of of pension and health benefits when i became governor a typical teacher who would retire at 25 years of service with a a large pension 70% of salary of their highest salary they would have paid they would have used all the money they paid into the system after two and a half years of retirement and teachers never paid a nickel towards their health benefits in our state while they were working and in retirement the taxpayers paid all of it so i used to go to town hall meetings and say how many of you would like that deal how many of you have that deal and nobody would raise their hand and i said well you're paying for that when people came to recognize that they were paying for that type of extravagant retirement and health benefit system the teachers union approval in our state because we pulled it went from when i started these meetings in the mid 70s down to the mid-30s and people saw the union as selfish and self-consumed and abusive of the taxpayers what that did jordan was it opened up the conversation on everything else because once you show that the representatives of these teachers were selfish and self-consumed and not focused on quality that was problem one problem two was i went in order to try to break this monopoly i went to some of the worst school districts in our state and pointed out two significant facts beside the underperformance of the students the first was that they turned out to be the most expensive school districts so for instance in asbury park new jersey we were paying $444,000 a pupil to get awful performance in in the city of newark we had $36,000 per pupil for awful performance in the city of campton $38,000 per pupil they could have gone to any private school in america at that time at for that number or less and gotten a significantly better education secondly we then talked about the way the teachers union protects the worst of their members so for instance in newark we had over a hundred teachers who literally reported every day to what they called the rubber room where they were not permitted to teach anymore but the teachers union prevented them from being fired so the school district made the decision jordan if you can believe it that it would be better off for the kids to pay these teachers to do nothing than to have them in a classroom yeah yeah yeah when you pointed these things out to folks it opened up the entire conversation so for instance i was able to negotiate with randy wearden believe it or not merit pay for teachers in newark that for the first time we would actually reward the teachers who were showing greater results with greater pay and take away this kind of monopolistic view that every teacher is the same and every teacher should be paid the same based purely upon experience rather than on performance that would have never happened jordan if i hadn't brought their poll numbers down to the mid-30s and they were really worried that the legislature that they had bought might be willing to sell them down the river so you know these are the things that we need to do on a national level and by the way the good thing about republican governors in some of these states has been that they have expanded choice significantly they need to take the next steps and with a federal government that could condition educational funding on taking those new steps which is what i would do as president you could encourage even more people i think to be able to do some of these reforms that have shown to be effective all right so well let's turn let's turn to i guess what strikes me as the second most crucial element on your list of of policy folky and that would be foreign policy especially in relationship to what's happening in in ukraine and with russia and so that's obviously a terrible conundrum and a terribly dangerous situation and so the first question i guess i would have for you on with regard to that issue is how do you think we got ourselves into this mess i mean we had a chance in the 1990s i believe to have pulled russia firmly into the sphere of the west and we seem to have bungled out somewhat irredeemably and now we have this terrible war in ukraine that seems to be settling down for the long hall as far as i can tell with the additional danger of emboldening china and so and i don't see i haven't heard from anybody i've interviewed or really anybody i've talked to anything that constitutes a reasonable vision for for victory or peace so two questions you know how in the world did we manage to get into something this idiotic and number two given that we are here and we could have the best possible of all outcomes whatever that would be what would those outcomes look like and how how would you work towards them okay so how did we get here i believe it was a series of mistakes and mis evaluations starting with the the the clinton administration and every president since then has been guilty of this so i think bill clinton did not focus as he should have i mean george bush 41 gave him the opportunity you just spoke about by the berlin wall coming down because of the efforts i believe of reagan and bush 41 the ending of the soviet union and the setting up of at least what was a nominally democratic uh russian federation under boris yelson to try to bring them into the league of of of fair and and just nations i don't think bill clinton nearly spent the time focused on that that he should have and because of that because of his distracted focus on foreign policy and other places i think he missed an opportunity with russia then i think bush 43 misevaluated vladimir putin i think you might remember him saying you know i looked into his eyes and saw his soul well he obviously didn't or the solely thought he saw wasn't there vladimir putin from the beginning in my view was a a a former kgb operative who was a zaris soviet type of leader who was intent on and he said that the breakup of the soviet union was the greatest tragedy historic tragedy of his lifetime so how do you expect jordan that you're going to willingly have a guy like that give up his expansionist aspirations and so under george w bush he was allowed to go back into geor georgia no ramifications under barack obama he was allowed to seize crimea and other parts of ukraine no ramifications under donald trump he continued to mass troops on the border of ukraine and donald trump did not supply as barack obama did not ukraine with the type of weapons that could deter russia from wanting to invade and ultimately joe biden given how badly he botched the withdrawal from afghanistan sent a signal to putin that that he was not up to fighting this fight and putin made his move to do what he'd always wanted to do was bring ukraine back into the russian federation and so the way we got into this mess was a series of inattentiveness misevaluation and weakness that was read by putin as permission because when we didn't fight him on georgia and we didn't fight him on crimea you could say it's reasonable for to conclude that we might not fight him on taking all of ukraine we hadn't made ukraine a part of nato so he had every reason to believe that we wouldn't fight back on this that's how i think we wound up here i think because of the chinese involvement in this remember before putin went to war before he made the decision to go to war president g came to moscow met with putin and said publicly there are no limits to the french friendship between china and russia well putin took that to mean exactly what it meant which was that china would financially support russia to go in and take ukraine and so we are now seeing a proxy war the the appropriate conclusion of the war is to have ukraine have the ability to drive russia out of in my view the newest parts of what they've taken of ukraine and then to negotiate the borders and to thereafter once the war is ended to admit ukraine to nato so that russia would now know that there was a price to pay for their invasion and their barbarism of their invasion and that price is that now finland is a member of nato on their border you've got and if you add ukraine this is a much worse result than russia could have ever have expected on their border but they brought it on themselves and i will tell you also that having just gotten back from ukraine 10 days ago i could tell you that the barbarism that's gone on there by the russian army is unspeakable the murder of civilians and burying them in shallow graves the gouging out of eyes while people are alive cutting off of ears and in my view jordan worse than anything thing 20,000 children ukrainian children have been kidnapped by the russian army and and sent to russia to be reprogrammed to work against ukraine i met some of these mothers who have had their children taken away from them they don't know whether their children are dead or alive whether they're being cared for or abused and whether they'll ever see them again these are the type of things that america cannot permit an authoritarian regime to do to a free country and to do so with impunity and we need to send a message the west as a whole needs to send a message with american leadership that that's not permissible because if we don't putin will not stop there remember the russians have always wanted to have poland because poland was the way that they were invaded in both world wars and they have wanted that level of buffer and i so i don't believe if we permit this that he'll stop at ukraine that he'll continue to try to assemble as best he can the old soviet union so the concerns for me in that regard are twofold and you outlined a bit of what might constitute a vision for victory first issue is after world war i germany was severely punished for its expansionist proclivities and that resulted in the treaty of versailles and that was designed to permanently weaken germany and that turned out to be that vindictive treaty turned out to be a very very very bad idea so attempting to permanently weaken a powerful industrial economy we have some historical precedent for assuming that that might breed exactly the opposite result so i've talked to hawks on the american side who think that the investment of tens of billions of dollars so far into ukraine if the consequence of that was the weakening of russia's military might then that was a small price to pay but the treaty of versailles issue lurks in my mind as a counter example now we might hope for regime change in the in in russia as a consequence of the difficulties of this war but again if you look at russia historically it's by no means obvious that putin is the worst leader that the that russia has ever had and plus it's also strikes me as risky to destabilize the conventional forces of an extremely powerfully armed nuclear enemy given that once the normal courses of warfare are exhausted the conventional forces the nuclear option is the only one left and so it seems to me that we may be tempting russia in that direction and then finally it's not obvious to me at all that the russians will give up these newer territories you're speaking of the dawn bass i believe and the and the territories on the eastern side now i don't know ever when i'm reading reliable information from that area of the world but my understanding is there is some degree of support among the local population especially the russian speakers for the russian what incursion into those territories and so and i'm not trying to justify that that's that's not my point i'm trying to lay out the complexities my sense is that russia regards these as rightful territories of of their of their state and that they'll be very very loath to give up any territory it's hard for me to imagine that putin could do that as well without having to declare something like defeat which is very unlikely it's very unlikely thing for him to do given all the options he has in front of him so why do you think it's realistic to assume that with sufficient pressure the russians will give up those eastern territories dabass and to what degree are you concerned that pushing in that direction will tilt the russians towards well one option is obviously the use of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield and so i see way more ways of this getting out of hand than i see ways of it proceeding towards something approximating a reasonable conclusion so well i'll leave you with that mess of questions to to jle as you say a lot to unpack there so let me start i believe where you started which is i am not advocating for a treaty of versailles with russia and i'm not advocating for intentional destabilization of of russia or demilitarization which is an absolutely unrealistic goal which is what happened to the germans in the near- term after the treaty of versailles so i'm not advocating for that at all and i do think that there are real concerns about advocating for regime change because in russia the devil you know may be better than the devil you don't and and that and we've seen that through history so i'm not advocating for either one of those things and i want to be clear that i'm not saying that victory would look like regime change in russia i am concerned about them as a nuclear power being destabilized uh and so i'm not advocating for those things what i am saying though is that we have not yet tested fully how much military pressure can be put on putin to get him to concede some of those areas on the eastern side in the donbas we have not armed them enough let me give you an example when i was in in in ukraine 10 days ago president sesy told me that on the average day in august russia is is shooting 56,000 artillery shells into ukraine ukraine is responding with 6,000 now almost an 11 to1 problem is not giving ukraine what they need to be able to prosecute the war in the most effective way they can and so i think joe biden has given them enough just enough not to lose l but not enough to win and so part of what i think we need to do here is to give the ukrainians the ability to prosecute the war in the way they see fit and then see how russia reacts it may be once we've armed ukraine sufficiently for them to meet all of their strategic goals militarily that russia still will not concede some of those areas is well then that's when you sit down and have a conversation with your ally about what's the best deal we can make here to bring this to a conclusion but you can't convince them the ukrainians it's in their interest to do that when you haven't given them the ability as they see it and i think just given the numbers they're right to be able to prosecute the war in as aggressive a way as it's being prosecuted against them and so if we're in we need to go all in from a hardware perspective the other reason to do that of course jordan is the message it sends to china visa taiwan and other areas in asia that they need to see that we are willing to stand up and allow an ally to have what they need to have to aggressively prosecute their own defense and china's watching very closely on this front and we need to send that message both as a country and as an alliance very clearly to them and by the way i believe if we had done that early on in russia we wouldn't be in this circumstance with ukraine and we should take that as a lesson for china and taiwan and other areas in asia so i think i think that tries to answer specifically a number of the things that you laid out in in your questions are you looking for an all-in-one e-commerce platform that can help you

especially pertaining to ukraine so the cynical part of me thinks in relation to the dangers of the military industrial complex that eisenhower warned us about back in the 1960s that the war of attrition the endless war of attrition in afghanistan came to a halt under biden and that put the military contractor types in a difficult position because the endless market for their wares had now dried up well now we've got a situation where we have a war in ukraine that's settling down to be a very very long and drawn out battle and you said yourself that biden has sent just enough enough to the ukrainians not to lose but not enough to win that certainly makes the possibility of a long drawn out and hyper expensive war paramount so one of the things i'm wondering about is do you think that the president with his relatively short-term in power and the multitude of his potential responsibilities and division of attention as was the case with clinton do you actually think that the president can step into a situation like this a new president with enough power and credibility to stand up against the continually active implicit forces agitating for expensive war yeah i think you not only can you but you must now look the part of the reason this is going to be a a longer war is because because obama trump and biden have all failed to arm the ukrainians quickly i mean think about this jordan they're now talking about f-16 training and saying it's going to take until next summer to train ukrainian pilots to fly f-16 this is absurd and it's the result of wanting to drag it out so i think your suspicions in that regard could be alleviated if we had acted more quickly and i still think we can act quickly now the russians are still on their heels here you have to believe that putin believed that he he'd be flying the russian flag over keev by this point he's not anywhere close to that and so we still have an opportunity by aggressively arming them to shorten this conflict if we continue to do what we're doing you know what pasted is prologue and if we continue to act the way we're acting now and the war is not coming to an end but is at a stalemate well then you either have to you know act differently or you're going to continue to have stalemate so you either have to withdraw completely and allow the russians to completely take over ukraine which is unacceptable to me or you have to ramp up the hardware you give so that you can try to bring it to a to a speedier conclusion now if you try that and it doesn't work then negotiation is going to be our only way of ending this and we'll have a significant say in that matter given that we have treated our allies fairly and appropriately in giving them a chance to win the war and saying to them we gave you a chance with you know much of what you've asked for and you haven't been able to get it done so we need to now step in and help to negotiate a conclusion to this but until we do that we are absolutely consigning ourselves to a stalemated situation here so that's why i would be more aggressive if you acquired the presidency what priority would addressing this conflict become and then also given your strategy of sending additional military aid to ukraine how do you protect yourself and your country against the possibility of getting their sleeve caught in the terrible machine and being dragged in you know completely because there's obviously well you can see the complexity there so you know how much of this how much would this be a priority for your administration and and what do you do to stop the us and the west as a whole the rest of the world from getting dragged into what could be a catastrophic conflict let me go in reverse on your questions the first is my view the way to avoid getting dragged in is twofold one to make very clear that there is not a circumstance under which i would send american soldiers or nato soldiers to ukraine but secondly to arm them sufficiently so that it would not be necessary it is in action it is timidity that gets that sleeve caught into the machine of war and gets you dragged in not the aggression of saying we're going to give you ukraine every every resource you need from a hardware perspective to prosecute the war you think can be winnable short of forces now on the flip side of that you know as in terms of priorities it would be a top three priority from a foreign policy perspective you know the first priority is our relationship with china now obviously that's interwoven with ukraine but we have many other issues that we need to deal with with china in terms of intellectual property in terms of our relationship with taiwan in terms of our our need to make sure that the chinese are not sewing discontent around the world climate issues with china there's a lot of issues that we have with china that we have to deal with that would be a top three priority secondly i would also be looking to shore up our other alliances around the world as one of the parts of dealing with our chinese relationship we should have a better relationship with india and we should be working on that we should make sure inside our own hemisphere that we are dealing with some of the challenges that go on that don't only affect us internationally but domestically we live in the best neighborhood in the world jordan with mexico and canada on our borders but we need to strengthen that both economically and geopolitically to make sure that we deal with some of the issues that we have inside our own hemisphere so it would be a top three priority along with strengthening alliances and dealing very directly with china on the issues that are very very important to us and to the chinese going forward you know they're the second largest economy in the world we're we've become very interwoven and we need to acknowledge that fact and work in our own national interests to make sure that the terms of that relationship are ones that give us the opportunity to be as successful as we can be so let's turn we we are somewhat tight for time here so let's turn our attention i'd like to talk to you about law and order and about dialogue between republicans and democrats maybe we'll leave that aside for a moment though and and concentrate more on the republican side of the race for the moment so as far as i can tell the front runners are tr trump obviously and then desantis ramaswami haley you and tim scott you guys look like you're all possible genuine contenders maybe somebody else will pop up as we move forward the polls i looked at indicate that trump's running at about 48 to 50% desan is 12 to 16 ramaswami he varies a lot say between 6 and 12 you pence and scott somewhere between three and seven and nikki haley at about 2 to four now there are a lot of var there's a lot of variability in the polls and i don't know how accurate those figures are but you can kind of identify maybe who who are who's going to be part of the actual slate now you you were quite close with trump you you helped organize his campaigns you headed his you headed the contingent that established his presidency to begin with my understanding is that you became particularly skeptical of trump as a consequence of his failure to fully accept the results of the of the 2020 election so let's delve into the trump issue a little bit i think that's the right place to go next and then talk about the other republican contenders then i'd like to shift our attention if we can to the biden scandal and the biden presidency in general it'd be a shame not to hit that so maybe we could take about seven minutes to address the trump issue i i want to ask this question you know trump has been pushing this notion that the election was stolen and when i talk to my democrat informants they tell me that the evidence for that from a legal perspective is nil and it's very difficult for me to evaluate that but then i look at it from a broader perspective and i think this is where trump is a genius and he's put his finger on something which is that there were a lot of terrible shenanigans on the democrat side of the universe during the last election and i think the worst of those was the squelching of the hunter biden laptops story that was really to call that appalling is to barely say anything at all because that laptop's quite the damn mess and god only knows what the bidens have been up to and and that story was squelched very conveniently in relationship to timing of the election which was a very tight election so trump might be wrong that the election was stolen in a legal sense but that doesn't mean he's wrong about it being stolen in a moral sense and so well so that's complic ated and and you worked very closely with trump and so i'd be more than happy to hear whatever you have to say on in relationship to those questions well look i was saying at the time that the hunter biden laptop should have been a story but you know what jordan there are un unfair things perpetuated by the media against republican candidates all the time and we do have a media bias in our country there is a liberal media bias there's no question about that and the problem though is when you're a republican you got to be tough enough to deal with it and not be a whining child and my problem with donald trump is now all of a sudden the problem is well because they suppressed the hunter biden laptop i lost how about the fact that you that you monumentally botched certain elements of our response to coid how about the fact that your conduct while you were in office absolutely poison the well with millions of suburban women in this country who had voted for him in 2016 and found him to be an absolutely unacceptable alternative in 2020 i mean you know much of what we're talking about here was self-inflicted and having been as close to him as i've been over all these years i could tell you that there were many of us who were telling him that while he was in the midst of doing it but he doesn't listen jordan he doesn't take advice well he is incredibly self-consumed and stubborn and you know much of what happened to him in 2020 could have been avoided if he had listen to lots of good advice which was available to him and was being given to him and he refused to accept it and he has morphed this into if his argument was the campaign was unfair that's an argument that i think a lot of us could buy into but he doesn't say that i mean if you look at a recent interview he had on fox news with brett bear and brett asked him about those suburban women that he lost in 2020 and if he were the nominee how would he get him back in 2024 his response was i didn't lose in 2020 so i don't know what you're talking about so so what do you think he did to lose those women his conduct jordan his abrasiveness his his failures on the coid front and his failures to keep his promises look this is a guy who said he was going to repeal and replace obamacare he had a republican congress he didn't get it done this is a guy who said he was going to balance the budget in four years as preposterous as that promise was he still did much worse he added $6 trillion to the national debt in four years the worst fiscal record in four years any president in american history he said he was going to build a wall across the entire border of mexico and the united states and that mexico was going to pay for it and instead he built 52 miles of new wall in four years and we haven't gotten our first peso for mexico he said he was going to drain the swamp jordan and instead all he did was rearrange the swamp and make room for his own family jared kushner and his daughter aaka 6 months after he leaves the white house gets $2 billion from the saudis after he made jared a central part of negotiations in the middle east when he had two very capable secretaries of state in rex tillerson and mike pompeo why was he doing that it's all a part of the grift the griff that allows him to spend $40 million of his own money that he raised from middleclass donors who thought they were donating to him to help him get reelected president on legal fees as a billionaire he's not spending his own money he's spending $100 donor's money so i think all of those things became apparent during his time and a lot of suburban women just said sorry we gave you the benefit of the doubt in 2016 because we didn't like hillary clinton and we thought you might actually drain the swamp and do the things you said but you didn't do them and in the process of not doing them you also offended us in the way you conducted yourself as president on a personal level and so they left and i don't think any of that will change jordan in 2024 if he's the nominee because all he's doing is talking about the past you don't hear him talking about the future all he's doing is still he's still litigating the 2020 race he does that in 2024 which is what he's been doing so far joe biden will get reelected and that will be a calamity for this country to have a an incapable 82-year-old president going to 86 with a completely incompetent vice president okay so so let's turn i'd like to dwell on trump a bit more especially in relation to the abraham accords but i i think instead we'll turn our attention to biden and so thec ramaswami tweeted out a few days ago something i thought was extremely ominous which was his suspicions that the question of whether or not we're tangled up in the ukraine war as a consequence of the biden family's financial dealings has now been laid on the table and as far as i can tell there's been a pretty stunning series of revelations emerging out of the w out of the investigation into the biden family that they have taken substantial amounts of money in a multitude of under the protection of a multitude of different corporate entities from foreign actors in ukraine and elsewhere something approximating $20 million is the story at the moment and this is it's so shocking to me to see this unfold that it's simpler for me to believe that this is mostly mud throwing and mck ring on the republican side now i don't believe that it is but i can certainly understand how it would be reassuring for people to believe that this is all smoke and no fire now if biden himself has being tangled up in the biden family business bus dealings which seems to me highly probable given that i can't understand what other value hunter biden himself would bring to the table then we have a scandal of a proportion in the white house that should make what's happening to trump look like a sideshow and yet that isn't happening and so how are you reading these revelations about the biden family financial dealings with foreign particularly with foreign actors and what do you think it entails both both of these families need to go jordan both the trump family and the biden family who have placed themselves and their own personal and pecuniary interests ahead of the interest of the country you know look $2 billion to jared kushner for what exactly his extraordinary investment acumen you know you can ask the same questions about hunter biden what value is he bringing to the table except for his relationship to his father now i do think the v stuff about that's why we're involved in ukraine is laughable we were involved in ukraine well before joe biden never got to the white house donald trump was sending weapons to the ukrainians i don't think anybody thinks that that was based upon some pecuniary interest donald trump had and our european allies are involved in this as well so i i think this is v just being him and throwing that out there the same way he threw out that you know he doesn't think we know everything about 9/11 and and the government hasn't told us everything and then he had a backtrack significantly off of that post that he put up with one of the longest posts i've ever seen trying to explain away an irresponsible comment let's get to the real point here both the trump family and the biden family have put their own pecuniary interests of their own families ahead of the interest of this country and for b hunter biden have access to to getting his father while he was vice president of the united states on the phone with these business folks that's what he was selling it wasn't the illusion of access as some of the democrats say it was access he got them on the phone to talk to these clients and as a result these clients paid him significant amounts of money now whether the the president now president biden got some of that money or not i think we should continue to investigate and find out but my point to you is that when you've got don trump donald trump jr's fiance getting paid $60,000 in campaign money to give a three-minute speech on january 6th when you have campaign money donated by regular americans paying $108,000 for melania trump's stylist when you've got them paying $250,000 to to refurbish his plane there is examples of grift in both of these families that are breathtaking and every bit of it should be investigated that's why i was calling for a special counsel quite some time ago to investigate the entire biden issue i'm very disappointed that they appointed the guy who was obviously either completely incompetent or in the tank on the hunter biden plea so badly that a judge rejected the plea but we should be investigating the biden situation just as aggressively as we're investigating the trump situation and i i'm tired of than whataboutism it doesn't make trump's stuff not troubling his stuff is just as troubling as biden stuff they both need to be looked at and my view is that both of these families are past their cell by date for leadership in this country and we need to move on from both trump and biden and by the way 75% of the american people agree with that they don't want a trump biden race in november 24 so the biden stuff is serious and and it needs to be examined in every way including whether the president while he was vice president or during the period he was a private citizen was profiting from what hunter biden was up to i know that when you were governor i' i've been thinking here while you're talking about you know why you might be credible on the anti-am dynasty side of things let's say and you know i don't know any details about your own family and about whether or not you might be someone less amenable to that kind of pressure but i do know that you ran what appeared to be a pretty effective anti-corruption campaign when you were attorney in new jersey and so maybe you could maybe you could tell people a little bit about that and then if you have anything to say in closing to sum everything up that we've been talking about and to you know what put in a final word to the people who are watching and listening we're going to switch over to the daily wire side for another half an hour for everyone watching and listening just so you know talk about some of of of of mr christie's autobiographical history get to know him a little bit better but we're going to close this one up relatively quickly so what did you do on the anti-corruption front in new jersey what did that teach you about conducting such investigations and what do you and then what do you have to say in conclusion well thanks for bringing that up i look i'm the only person who's going to be standing on that stage who's had any experience dealing with law and order and dealing with the issue in particular political corruption it was a huge problem in new jersey when i became us attorney there in 2002 and i dedicated a significant amount of resources to it and what were the results we brought 130 in 7 years 130 prosecutions for political corruption against both republicans and democrats and the results jordan we were 130 and0 we did not lose one case not one case was dismissed and the reason for that goes to my overall philosophy on this you approach these problems without fear favor or partisanship you can't fear how big the person is that's being examined you can't favor someone because they powerful or rich and you cannot ever allow partisanship get into the middle of it corruption is corruption no matter who is performing it i remember the first case i did involved the front runner for united states senate on the republican side in new jersey in 2002 and a republican official called a friend of mine when i brought the case and said what the hell is he's doing i thought he was one of us and my old law partner said to him you don't understand chris he's not one of us he's going to do what he thinks is right and and i think what it taught me was that the only way to make law and order order efforts in this regard seemed fair and just is for them to be fair and just and completely without fear favor or partisanship so if i became president jordan i'm going to appoint an attorney general with two instructions one pursue every matter that's appropriate to pursue without fear fa favor of partisanship and two don't come and ask me anything about any criminal investigation that you're doing the president has no business being involved in it and when i was governor by the way even though i had lots of opinions about what my attorneys general were doing or not doing they'll all tell you publicly that i never once picked up the phone nor did anyone on my behalf call and ask them anything or urge them to do or not do anything in a criminal investigation that's the only way the public can have faith in it in the end i think what we need as a president is someone who actually knows how to get things done who actually has a record of being able to work with both sides and accomplish things who is unafraid to use the bully pulpit in a way that is appropriate to move opinion both of the people that you represent and of their representatives to try to get things done and someone who believes that it's harder to hate up close and that what we all need to do is to work together to try to get things accomplished in this country our country was set up jordan constitutionally as you know to be an argument that's fine as long as the argument leads to a result right now we're living in a world of small arguments about things that are just meant to inflame and divide my presidency is going to be about big things of consequence to make our country better 50 years from now not five minutes from now in the next news cycle well sir that seems like a good place to close i'm going to flip to the dailywire plus side of the interview now for everyone watching and listening so you can join us on the dailywire plus platform if you would thank you very much for agreeing to talk to me today if you're inclined you know a few months down the road four months 5 months 6 months down the road when you're more in the midst of the presidential campaign and there'll be all sorts of new things to discuss i'd be more more than happy to talk to you again we can see how this goes and and how people respond to it but that offer is open i'm very curious this is going to be a remarkably dramatic and interesting presidential election i think we haven't seen the likes of this in our lifetimes you and i were about the same age and so it's going to be something to see it unfold thank you very much for talking to me today and for sharing your thoughts with my viewers and my my listeners and thanks to all of you who are in fact watching and listening your attention is much appreciated thanks to the daily wire folks for making this possible as they always do and for making it work out so professionally and easily and on to the daily wire plus side very nice to talk to you sir thank you looking forward to it [music] jordan
