let me return to hollywood if if you don't mind it seemed to me that hollywood took a walloping blow with covid and then the strike and like one of the things i've noticed about myself is i used to go to movies all the time i to theaters i love going to movies and i've gone to very few movies since co it's kind of like i don't know if i got out of the habit it's something like that partly i used to know where to get rel able reviews for upcoming movies like i was in the stream i knew what was coming out of hollywood i made plans to go see the movies that all disappeared and now i don't know how to get back to that but i think and you're wondering is it because of my age must be yeah yeah well that could be too although see i don't know or is it just that way well i well i i also don't know that and and of course the media landscape is fragmented too and so it's hard to figure out what sources you can rely on inform the way they advertise movies nowhere near what it used to be used to be just like an ad in the newspaper yeah and and that was enough yeah and then it became like tv ads and audiences could smell a movie yeah right it was like so surprising it was just like i remember for me personally breaking away when that came out it was hard was no advertising or anything like that and were driving to the theater you know to go to you go for the you like the opening of it you on that friday yeah and there's a line around the box it's like people are in the movie well that's that's the thing is that these things are very fragile you know is that we never know what makes a whole enterprise work and if people are movie fans they're in the movie culture they track it and if you break that it's like that's gone yeah well yes okay so you you don't see roger eert on television anymore these there was the whole culture that went with it and everybody watched what the new movies coming up and like you know laying them out there what they're about and and all that and yeah you know and you knew months in advance really you know great debates on on what they were about and so so how do you what how do you view the current reality and the potential future of the film industry it's are there still stars it's that's the thing who was the last movie star well from what i've been able to understand the only star truly standing nard capriel or a cruz that's going too far back leonardo leo i mean last movie they're still out there they do occur yeah they're out there but they also my sense too is that and i don't really know what to make of this that they're are they the last of a dying breed well you know the new is like it's gone from it's gone to social media yeah that's where the new movie stars are i mean justin bieber the first star totally created on youtube yeah you know not the nowhere near the the traditional way yeah of doing it and that actors now are are the same way they have their their instagram page they you know self- advertising and but used to be back then movie stars like in the you know growing up and really until the 80s 90s true movie star you wouldn't do a talk show on tv you would avoid tv like the play jack nicholson you would never see him on a talk show he'd do one interview in a prestigious magazine whether it be time playboy right whatever it was that was that's part of that protection of exclusivity and you would you know some guy would spend a couple of days with him or something but you really wouldn't it was a mystery to him yeah yeah so that when you went to the theater really what makes a movie star as you go to the theater they are a mystery you don't know too much really about their life so you imprint your own life on them yeah yeah definitely that's that's what happens yeah you know you see them for something inside you yeah and that's what makes a movie star well you actually don't want to know much about the person life of an actor and now it's like like well it got to be that you just do everything yeah about everybody yeah and that brings them down to earth and that's not good if you're a star well it it doesn't create mystery yeah right put it that way i wonder too how much of it is the fact that like when you and i grew up being on television was like that was a remarkable and unlikely occurrence to be personally on television even to know someone who was on television the bandwidth was so narrow and then the movies were above that it was easier to be on tv than on the movies but now everyone is on tv all the time yeah right and so that that that's another borderline between the public and the actor that's disappeared it's like everybody is videoed from the time they're young but there's no going back and this way the world and and you know good things come out of it good things what do you see that's good coming out of it well for one thing there's this there's really a broad communication in the zy people have taken over their own stories yeah and like you could be like me and choose not to participate very much you know i i i mean i have an instagram page i have facebook page and i you know i kind but i you know i didn't grow up with it so it seems like a real chore to me yeah and right it's not your culture yeah and i like face tof face communication and and i like this this you know this is great because it's it's it's it's a real i i feel like i'm this that is one good thing about today as opposed to then is that you could do an interview like with a magazine and you know somebody was about to do a job on you because they kind of feel like they build you up you know you have this fall and then you have the comeback the thing but like with this it's unfettered yeah and i get to represent myself yeah yeah yeah well you youtube's great for that are great for that and they really reward unfettered communication like the people i've talk anybody i've talked to on my youtube channel who politics or is false they get slaughtered yeah like if they say it comes out very quickly you find out who people are you can't hide so much yeah well that's joel rogan told me he said you know you can tell if there's anything to anyone after about 20 minutes yeah because you can well people who are hollow they're exhausted especially in a podcast like rogan which is 3 hours long it's like there better be some depth to you to get through that conversation in an interesting manner for three bloody hours they're kind of like you know let's see what happens like 30 years from now but you know some of this stuff is going to come back to haunt people you know i mean some of the things that i did and thought or whatever you know back in my teens 20s man i'm so glad it's not on you that's for sure exactly the same way i can't imagine you know i remember most of my adolescence and my adolescent friends as really a nonstop parade of stupid decisions you should be able to make those stupid decisions in private right that's for sure man the last thing i would have wanted was video records of that right for it to be distributed around the school i can't of imagine like it was it was a a a a difficult enough enterprise trying to negotiate the weird social world of adolescence without having to be absolutely terrified that some godamn stupid thing you did was going to be permanently instantiated in the minds of everyone in your town god i i just can't imagine what that would be like terrible terrible yeah and you can't just move away from it because it's intern well that's right that's right it calls you well that's right well one of the wonderful things about human memory is that we forget yeah right the remembering that's not exactly miracle like things happened and so now you know it it's like well can you forget can you put it behind you well not if it's permanently recorded yeah yeah no that's just that's not good [music]
