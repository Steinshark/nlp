it's this disease that's taking over everybody and it's like i think the future belongs to people who are just gonna pay attention to the way the world actually manifests what actually is interesting what life is actually like and tell those stories and that's gonna win the day you're right you're so right that's what's going to win [applause] [music] [applause] [laughter] [music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [music] so hello everybody i am here with neil degrade people who watch my channel have seen him around he is the head of the band dirk robbins but he is much more than that we're here to talk about a new movie that he's putting together called the queen of the night very excited about it it's like a modern fairy tale and so i'm really looking forward to talking about that with him thank you for having me on always a pleasure you know people might notice right now that today's video is in black and white and that is by no accident or technical error we have as a band we've always done concept records but now we've decided to add a visual component a stronger visual component to what we're doing and we're making a silent film it felt like the perfect way to oh oh create a story a visual story that we could put our music to so it felt like a no-brainer we had the right story and and here we are it's called queen of the night yeah so tell us a little bit about the the mood of it because there's something it it has an old-timey sense to it you know it's a silent film it it's using it's using kind of these classic effects even that look kind of old-timey but there's something about it there's something about it that's very rich in terms of visuals that you were able to create very simply you know that this movie is not costing you a fortune either all of this is an interesting idea or solution for kind of modern movie making or making stories today oh yeah oh my gosh give me a lot to comment on right there let's talk about silent films quick quickly you know it's there's early era in films and silent films generally at first were just like they're trying to bring a play to life and things were shot like they were on a stage cameras wouldn't move actors were coming in and out of the frame off stage on stage and the props were generally like two-dimensional so i wanted to keep an aspect of that when i did it like but i also there's something very tiring about silent films if you try to pull one up on youtube that are like that it's like oh this is cute but gee an hour long of this you know is like okay if you don't have that attention anymore like when you just want to do a puppet show for you and it just doesn't end you're like there's gotta be you want me to watch you play a game you're making up on the fly so i didn't want to do that because i'm not a huge fan of a lot of silent films i've seen i really love the movie metropolis the cabin of dr caligari i love the old nose ferratu i'm a huge fan of those but the versions i've seen have been fully orchestrated i think imagine back in the day from what i've heard it would be quite an event to go see one of these films premiere or at a larger theater because there would be a full orchestra there doing it live and so if you'd like to see an orchestra normally great but if you want to see an orchestra with a story in a movie well now you're talking next level so i wanted to capture more of that i wanted to feel alive and exciting i didn't want to be fatiguing i did when you're talking about the old-timey effects like we'll show a clip in a minute but there is a little of that jitter and dust speckle and stuff that would appear in the film but we didn't we wanted to do enough so you got it but we didn't want to do so much that you were tired of seeing that so we've tried to ride that line of creating that nostalgia that sense of familiarity without the same sort of fatigue that accompanies that look and feel the film's done in an expressionistic style which was really popular in in that time is that people were not going for realism they were but they wanted to capture real emotion so there's a dreamlike quality to the film and it's imagery things are laid out where they feel three-dimensional but it also could be it also could be like a diorama the way things are someone might be pulling the clouds along in the background you know on a string and we've tried to do some where even when we're using computers to incorporate some of that human analog era error in the process so that's part of queen of the night and for people on who follow this channel i think that they're going to without explanation be able to start digging into some of the symbolic content yeah so the way you're releasing it is through episodes or you're putting out the different episodes i have the chance you know because of my special relationship with neil to kind of follow the the thing from the beginning and know the whole story and kind of get a sense of this really powerful modern fairy tale but for the first for the first episode we're gonna kind of be introduced to these main characters and also get a sense of what is the sim what is the symbolic structure it has to do with the moon the feminine the light the darkness and so maybe tell us a little bit about what it is that you're trying to explore in this story okay well one of the problems is when i talk about any of these things it the way we'll talk about it right now is not the way it comes to me yeah an image will come to me and then i'll start like almost question questioning it like why am i seeing this right now so pretty much every one of my stories i've done or concept record starts with a singular image and then i like i've become like an inquisitor of that image it's like why are you there why are you holding that why you why are you standing in the spot why are you crying why are you you know why are you on top of this building why are you on this mountain those type of things so and then i just slide things around and then suddenly things will fall into place very quickly and and before i really knew what i was doing with this when i go back and look at my older work it still feels like now that i understand like some of the symbolic content and story a little more explicitly it still was already fitting even though i didn't even know really what i was doing or what i was talking about i just had an intuition so what we're about to talk about here is not why the story was created in fact that's why we could share this with people i brought jonathan in pretty early on in 2021 when once i had the story and i wanted to tell it to you because i didn't want to think about some of those elements but i thought since you weren't a creator i would do that and that you would basically slap me back in line but that's not really what happened i think we had a really good collaboration on this is that i shared the story with you and it was like it was more of a yes and it was more yes we're like this is awesome hey what about this but like it's so much of it was so right the intuition was so right so you you added layers and you explained things to me i didn't even notice like because i didn't want to i didn't want to spoil it by explicitly adding analogous or allegory to the content or typology on purpose i didn't want to do it on purpose i think i absorbed the world through this typological lens and more of the symbolic lens and so things when i tell them back they come out that way so i feel like i don't have to try that and when i do now i'm starting to i guess impose a desire for the story on it you know so i don't want to do that so yeah we when i when i handed this over to you we talked about a number of things symbolism of the moon masculine and feminine symbolism and when we talk about masculine feminine symbolism we're not talking about modern stereotypes about differences between men and women we're talking about the way those things reveal themselves over time in mythology and in stories so i think that was that was fun to do i really loved your insight you pointed out so many things to me that never would have occurred to me in the story so i think that people who the people who watch this watch this who follow your channel are going to get an added layer that's just going to be implicit to the general public i generally don't like explaining things to people yeah in the past like because i mean once it's there i kind of understand why i wrote it you know with dead horse it dealt with the pandemic it dealt with this sort of totalizing system that was coming that they were going to kind of give in exchange for pleasure for in exchange for pleasure for this like control and manipulate yeah over you so and so you know by the time that thing was coming out we were about to hit the pandemic in 2020 so that's so amazing that i still can't get over that like that that the the the whole album was like a prophecy that just played itself out in front of us it's pretty amazing well i mean i don't think it might that is as that unique though i saw a lot of things like that like i kept things kept coming to my attention that had just happened in different shows that were buddy was sort of people with a certain type of intuition were already on to where things were heading yeah and it's just like you know if i picked up a you know a rock and threw it towards a window before that rock hit the window we would all kind of know it's about to hit the window yeah exactly because you can see the momentum the velocity and the trajectory so i think one of the best ways to talk about why i don't want to talk about things too much when it comes to specific story is an image i think i've shared this with you before but it is from peter pan and in the beginning of peter pan it's obviously like a meta fairy tale in the sense where it does a lot to explain itself to an audience like films generally wouldn't or fairy tale generally would even you have never never land yeah you have a lot of these more explicit structures overlaid on a fairy tale type story and one of those happens right in the very beginning because it seems like the author whether they did this intentionally or just by intuition understood what they were getting into with the story where peter pan appears in person without a shadow he's not he's not yet a part of this universe that wendy lives in and now her at this coming of age story she she needs to she needs to try on this childish idea she's about to leave behind she needs to experience like in his full totality like what she's when she leaves the nursery what she's really leaving behind and so it's her job to stitch the shadow onto peter pan's foot and that hurts like he doesn't like it right it's so there's this aspect of where i don't want to put too many stitches in peter pan's foot so people can kind of just absorb the story for themselves yeah to some degree so i hope that was but i think that the process that you're talking about like in terms of the way you wrote it you know this is actually the way that i'm telling people always because i have people writing me or ask me all the time you know i'm trying to write a story and try to put symbolism into it and they then they just they just they just hit a wall because they can't do it which is actually the they're which is inevitable because you can't think about symbolism and write symbolically at the same time those two are two different completely different ways of being you have to like you said i think the way you talk about it where you have an image and then you poke at the image and you turn around it and you you kind of nurture this intuition is a much better way to do it and then once you once you have something out there then you can combat with clippers and just kind of prune it a little bit or re-adjust things slightly so that they're more they're they're they're more coherent in terms of the structure but you don't want to do that at the outset yeah and again too like i'm trying to like so let's just say that something's supposed to be beautiful i'm not i never try to make it pretty i try to make it break my own heart and it's just it's a it's a very different reaction so like the idea of trying to make something coherent intentionally is that same thing you end up with you end up with pretty instead of heartbreaking and so i don't know if that's just kind of an adjacent analogy but so yeah i mean my encouragement for artists who you want to do that is you you ha it begins with having to absorb the world differently and we've been lied to about what i think in a lot of ways in our schooling and not that these things aren't important but sort of the scientific world this modern mindset of the things that really matter are things you can't touch taste and feel or you don't really experience firsthand i think one of the first videos i encounter with you is you talking with your brother mature about i don't even know how to say that in french people i can't pronounce it matthew that's okay okay so he you you guys were talking about water that when you drink water like like you well that might have been coffee you don't experience h2o you experience cold and wet and like you know we all we we have the problem with hgo none of us have that in common we don't know what that is or what it really looks like or how to experience it but and so that if we think of it as h2o we're at a distance from each other but if we think about it as something cold and refreshing now we're oh i know cold and refreshing you know cold and refreshing now we're more connected yeah so there's been this deep personification of the universe itself that has led people back to a point where they don't really know how to tell and embodied stories because the story because they think the real important facts are what we see at the bottom of a microscope or at the end of a telescope when none of those things can actually be experienced and i believe have led to sort of a modern insanity about things that are right in front of our face we can't see anymore we're colorblind too because we prioritize those things and we've intellectualized those things as the most important and so i think that that's something also that's there in the the queen of the night because the queen the first episode has to do with this encounter like a like an encounter an encounter between an encounter with something which is bigger than you like something that is just overwhelming let's say and it's not it's not in the it's not in the analytical mode right it's like you know imagine yeah like seeing a god or seeing this and it has to do with the fascination with the with the feminine and the whole story has to do with this feminine image which is related to light light and darkness to the moon to the veiling to the unveiling and so maybe tell us a little bit about like what it is about let's say feminine imagery which you feel needs to be explored or needs to be touched on or it needs to be yeah that we need to talk about the power of it and not just in the modern sense where it's like okay we're gonna make more roles for women okay it's like oh great cool there's so many cool things to talk about what are we going to talk about no we're going to give them swords and superpowers and they're going to punch things and and act like jerks like the men do except they'll be like heroes for acting like jerks i know that that's what i just said there is probably like what is he even talking about some people or they just you know the hair stood up on the end of their back and they started screaming but into their backs i don't know like a cat so but i think that really like i think that just this idea of supplanting what was in the past male with just embodied by female characters like that can happen in stories right obviously but it's not it's you're missing so many great opportunities and hopefully we've taken some of those opportunities here in this story to show the the power of femininity in you know a more coherent way within how the universe actually manifests itself let's do a clip i got a little short clip here i want to insert in the video of a scene where he first encounters this feminine spirit at a very low dark place for this little boy [music] so [music] me [applause] [music] [applause] [music] let's talk about the moon because that appears in the story this is one of these examples of things that we we can't see anymore or isn't obvious to people okay so the moon and the sun the sun is 400 times larger than the moon roughly okay but guess what else like that you know the sun is 400 times farther away than the moon which makes them appear roughly the same size in the sky they're like oh well that's pretty cool it's like well what are the chances of that right and these things are hard to calculate because we're opposing we've got a there's a lot of factors involved and it has to do with human perspective but it's a it's a really rare occurrence that if the world universe is populated by all types of people and different people on different planets this would ever occur on ours so when things start to become rare to a certain point you start to see intentionality in it so i see the intentionality all over the universe i see with the thing i'm about to describe we see i see everywhere so the moon and the sun appear roughly the same size of the sky so why was it why did ancient people like always refer to the moon in almost every situation as like a feminine spirit and the sun is a masculine spirit it's like well the moon happens to have a day phase and cycle and guess what like women have you know matured women have a like roughly 29 day cycle and there's no evolutionary correlation between those two things like there's been study after study the last one i could look up was they had checked with 7.5 million women to like report on their cycle and if it correlated with the moon and it will line up once in a while meaning that some people will you know have their cycle on a full moon or a new moon or whatnot but it's not they're not there's no scientific reason why these two things are the same now for someone like me who sees meaning in the universe i like okay this is a discussion of like cosmic feminine cosmic masculine and so to if you never thought about it before the fact that we have these two like equal sized things in the sky and one exhibits an explicit feminine pattern right and one that is i don't know that could could be revelatory to someone you know now like i talk to people all the time about these kind of things they're like oh my gosh i never realized that just like it's like this was obvious to everyone you know prior to our modern way of thinking so and you can under if you when you understand also that that the moon waxes and wanes and that it moves from light to darkness and from darkness to light then you can also understand so much of the some of the mystery of feminine symbolism in relationship to the to those things that are hidden and revealed you can imagine even you know the idea of seduction as this showing and hiding you know this revealing but not too much you know you don't want to you want to keep a mystery in this in this relationship and so you know this idea of the of the mystery is is very much related to feminine symbolism and always has been yeah and you talk about this all the time i haven't seen all your videos but i've seen quite a few and you're talking about this idea of unity and multiplicity and and during the day when there there's a unity above and then there's multiplicity below because this light allows us to name and identify things so that you you know you don't walk around in daylight tripping and stumbling and falling into holes generally because these things are made explicit and the night the opposite manifestation happens there's multiplicity above and then there's this unity but the unity's within darkness below where the ground becomes one thing all this multiplicity becomes one thing and all this thing that was one opaque sky becomes multiplicity at night there's a real i guess you know it might be the wrong analogy but a yin yang kind of relationship yeah of course these two things and so i think that's so cool and there's there's a beautiful story that we experience every day in that and it's actually a way to govern between order and chaos that appears in stories if you can look at those two patterns correctly so you're talking about there you also talked about explicit and implicit because one of the things that happens you know so let's say someone reads the bible and they hear the word light and they think of light as good and darkness is evil and it's used that way but it's also not used that way right so there are there are things that are kept secret that are hidden from you that are true there are there are analogies like hiding under the shadow of of god's wing like the shadow being the thing that's needed so i talked about this i talked about this in dead horse a little bit there's a song called kings and queens and it's talking about this mothering structure of the city [music] drifted away and the city could not be saved [music] [applause] [music] as each selfish thing fought [music] in their [music] and i was always confused when i was a kid i would hear these old movies and they refer to someone who is very beautiful is fair and i'm like what does fair mean and it was like it dawned on me and i wrote it into the bridge of that song and it's talking about the city and though the line was in blinding light she stands opaque her silhouette a welcome break for tired eyes a resting place and you know if you're crossing the desert and you're burning in the sun and you see you see the outline of a city right it's like oh my gosh this is that's that's my salvation yeah from the sun from the sun from the sun right it's like you're like oh the sun's a good thing it's like it's not always a great thing i mean you can you can in life you can die by water you can that you need to live you can die by sunlight which you need for everything to live so the world's a complicated place and you know things aren't as polemic as people make them out to be and really fairy tales are awesome with that having these sort of ambiguous structures that depending on how you approach them manifest as good or evil yeah i think that's that's a really great thing in storytelling that's kind of missed and i love those stories and i think we've got a little of that in queen of the night here yeah definitely we i mean i think that in in the story i mean i we don't want to reveal the the plot or anything but there really is this kind of encounter this seductive encounter or this fascination which you know the you can say something like the masculine tries to control or tries to possess you know and then ultimately it's like no sorry man it's not as easy as you think you know yeah right well in two so like i mean there's a lot of things that we we might push back against the life like someone like people accuse me of mansplaining and i'm like you actually have a point like when you're saying that like you know i don't mean in a like way that someone really doesn't know how to shut you down so they make some sort of impotent claim like okay boomer or you know thanks for mansplaining that to me you know i'm not talking about in that sense but the idea that like that negative symbolic masculine is this idea to over define over explain pull too far out you know show something you know you know even like even the world of science you know there's a great essay by c.s lewis called the abolition of man which everyone who watches this channel should read yeah it's amazing but he talks about that you know science today would do something you know to a person that they wouldn't have considered 100 years earlier doing to a turnip there's this over masculinization of everything and wanting to pull apart and aim for power yeah so i have a question what so with all these movies because this is kind of a change for for you in a way i mean because you were mostly doing music for the for the large part of your career you wrote a book was it last year you were a fairy tale there yeah that's a little experiment i did it's called the three golden robes and a story like i mean you've known me long enough jonathan know like a story pops in my head every day and i was like let me just let me do the practice of kind of putting this into a visualization so there's an artist named chad nuss who's done some work he's doing concept art on queen of the night he's fantastic he has his own comic called the silence comics and he he illustrated it for me and chad's art is amazing so like he made it worth buying you can find that at dirtportrobbins.com i think i have a link to that somewhere if you want to check it out or look at the art so what are you so what are you what's happening like where where are you guys so all right so here's the thing so i do music the fun thing about music is it's it manifests itself in in a type of opposite from the way life comes at us normally so when we go out into the world we see things before we see patterns right the patterns take i guess a type of spiritual discernment in the sense that they're they're not something that manifests in a moment it manifests over time and so we have to see the pattern so life we see things first we see patterns second music is pattern first and it implies the things so beethoven's six symphony he was trying to musically describe this you know a pastoral setting in the countryside or you know the movies fantasia really have a great explanation of of this relationship between the visual and music but that gives you an example of sort of like the different the different worlds and so i i wanted to bring the story and farther i thought we had a good story to do it visually and you mentioned that we we have some constraints on that story and how we're telling it visually because it's a silent film and those constraints are really helpful to me as a new director and someone who wanted to really bring a fantastical image images to life with rockets and zeppelins and moon space travel and you know not a 50 million dollar budget yeah yeah so so yeah like putting those constraints on it allowed us to really not have to compromise anything and tell me and have a window in which we could tell that story where you didn't feel like things were missing hopefully hopefully boast so yeah that's what we're doing so it's gonna be interesting for people who follow us in the past because like our last record was a little bit more modern than the raven locks the record we had done before that it had some more synth elements and even like robotic voices and still with a blend of classical and i think even classic rock in there but this one we're going farther back in time we're pulling from the romantic period we're also you know as we go all farther along in the story as things modernize you'll start to throw in some ragtime and elements like that but at first it starts out you're going to have if you're waiting for it like a you know a slapping pop or rock number you're not going to get one right away in the story so episode one the music's kind of somber and it deals with you know some more symbolic content [music] my [music] oh [music] me three [music] it's a risk i mean but i don't know i kind of work outcome independent i just do what i think is what i really want to do and then people like it so how do you want is this something that the storytelling part like is it something because that you know we need good storytellers so is this something that you are interested in continuing to do like are you are you oh absolutely i want to do it everywhere i mean i want to collaborate with other artists too because i have more stories than i can put out and i really love and i would love to find some people who can visualize those you know i just told you about one right before we started our call and i feel like that's a great story man i would love to see that happen it would be wonderful so i'm watching eric weinstein on joe rogan's podcast i went back and watched this and he's they're talking about how like oh the world's been stripped of this sort of mythological content and story spirited content and religious content and stuff and he's like now it's time to fill it with what's really interesting and rogan's like well what's really interesting eric weinstein what does the world need to be focused on and he's like the octonians i can't do an eric weinstein impression and i think it would be insulting if i tried so i'm gonna just talk about it so the octonians if you're not familiar or if you haven't seen the episode do you know what they are jonathan i have no idea what that is there's this theoretical number set right and he starts to go off about this theoretical number set and i was like eric weinstein have you not met a normal person do you know do you ever have you ever fallen in love or what like i'd what are you doing you ever have a really good meal like have you ever had a funny thing happen to you that you retold later it's like this is not where people are at so this is part of the insanity though of the modern world it's had this dull dulling effect on storytelling you know well so many stories like what's really happening is like though the zombie invasion is just it's really a biological element and here's the here's scientifically why there's a zombie in page it's like no that's not why we're telling zombie stories because because you know it's we're telling zombie stories because you know everybody's a zombie that's why we're telling zombies like people just zombing around and you know not even looking at up at their kids when they come in the room everyone that's where we that's where we're afraid of zombies because you know the conservatives think that there's too many liberals in the world and they're all coming to get them and they're going to make them think their way and they're going to take over their mind and then the liberals think there's too many conservatives in the world and they're coming forward and they're going to take over their mind they're going to force them to you know into the hands maiden tale so that's what's that's why we tell zombie stories we're not telling we're not having a discussion about biology and so i that's for sure like what you're saying is is great because one of the things i thought from the right from the beginning is like this whole idw thing i was like this is not this is gonna fail it's gonna fail because they don't understand how the world actually changes it's like i'm sorry to tell you guys artists change the world not not like computer programmers and not scientists like in terms of changes in the sense of what happens in the world like you can make a technology but the dream of the world comes from the prophets and the artists and even in the scientific revolution you can see that that cyrano de bergerac's you know voyage to the moon precedes any scientific desire to go to the moon right the the storytellers were the ones you know the the the all the imagery that happened in the 17th century a lot of it was storytelling it wasn't and so we need to the the kind of idw type that wants to kind of help restore something without without art they're not gonna do anything they're just gonna fizzle people are alone and like everybody has the same things going on they're waking up at 3am in the morning and they are just miserable and they they look to film and they look to story and it's arguing about politics i mean i i i followed russell brand years ago because he had someone interesting on to me and i pull up his channel now and all he's doing is is covering american politics i'm like this british comedian it's like it's this disease that's taking over everybody and it's like i think the future belongs to people who are just going to pay attention to the way the world actually manifests what actually is interesting what life is actually like and tell those stories and that's going to win the day you're right you're so right that's what's going to win there's no there's no way around it because at some point this kind of political type storytelling is going to become so crippling you know i mean it might get worse for a while but you know in the end the good stories win it's just inevitable because they're better they're just have they just have more of reality in them and so right so i think that what you're doing with queen of the night do you know what you've been doing with drupal robbins you know is is great i mean it's right in line i mean i'm happy that we're kind of collaborating on on a lot of these things because it's i think it's an exciting time to be honest i even though it's kind of like the worst time in a very dark time at this all at once that's an exciting time because you know these little lights i think can flicker in the in the madness because they'll appear as what they are you know i get a little lost for words sometimes because i don't know how to describe what i think is really beautiful in a way that people can hear it anymore and so i kind of don't most of they just make beautiful things i just that's all i know that's all i can do is try to make beautiful things and they're not political and they don't hold like i mean what you're talking about you're saying hey like it's nice to have someone or to have people out there who are actually trying just to tell stories because i'm not i don't have an explicit like proselytizing purpose in what i'm doing at all i just i just take what comes to me and put it out there and i think that's that's the only way that me as a person can make the anything better my life better my family's life better because we're we get so focused on trying to change the world it's like that's just like that's too much for anyone that's not something there's something like really exciting also about this time which is that there's something also i this is how i feel like you tell me if you're right but there's something really exciting about feeling like you're in on a secret this is how i feel sometimes because like let's say i think that that your album dead horse is just amazing like it's just a it's just a it's just a great album without any qualifier and but it's still kind of not it's not like the most you're not like the most famous band in the world you know it's not like everybody knows about dirt paul robbins but that's there's something about that which is exciting because there's this thing burgeoning there's this light kind of appearing and a few people are able to perceive it and you know like there's no doubt about it you know that this is moving towards the future and a lot of the stuff you hear on the radio the stuff you stream on netflix you can feel like this is just dying like it's just this decrepit thing that is kind of decomposing and it's like okay so i have i can perceive this light which is growing not everybody can see it yet but it's but it actually makes it somewhat exciting to feel like you're in on something well i know i also have like weak selfish reasons why i like to stay a little under the radar too it's because i like anonymity a little bit i mean here i am in your channel and i'm wearing this you know animal print shirt this zebra print thing but man like though it's it's it's a world of sound bites i wrote a song about this on dead horse called sky writer because the world's turned into a place where everything's everyone's a sky writer anything i say there's going to be something i didn't say that can be held against me like there's always this something in the negative space of what i've just said where someone can make me saying something i'm not and and the world's awful with that and so like there's a part of me that's kind of like yeah i'd be totally happy to just have enough of an income to keep making art and then people find it when i'm dead and so they can't you know so they can't ruin my life like that's a little weak and selfish of me sometimes not very courageous but i have like the the modern world has made me like i there's no nothing in me left that would want to do this for celebrity like there's it's not there it's like that's that's hard that's like my biggest fear is to be a celebrity i guess in any capacity so i also revel in the sort of anonymity of what we do that there are people that it seems to impact and really enjoy it and i'm like happy like my gosh keep it there just enough income for i can keep making more for you but no actually we do need people i don't want to we do need people to share the video when it comes out there there's a stronger part of me that's like who cares okay so they'll tear you apart you're just gonna have to go let's feed yourself to the wolves if you're going to you're going to want to manifest your full potential so that's kind of what i end up acting on i have all these subtle fears but at the end of the day we really need people to share this and watch this and if you love it like you know let your friends in on it like that's that's where that's our entire marketing plan basically outside of like coming on your channel coming onto your channel and talking like a derek fiedler who did a really great review of your brother's book the language of creation and he get a really great response to matthew mcconaughey and joe rogan about the burning bush on symbolism of that he's gonna he's gonna be doing breakdowns of the episode for people in the symbolic world who want to hear that kind of thing so we can link to him but yeah i'm not doing much to promote it right now so and that's part of the reason we didn't take it straight to streaming services because it's actually not that hard to get on streaming services but i think netflix has like 15 000 movies in their catalog so you can get into this catalog and make no money and pay money on the outside to advertise to get people to go watch it on their platform and i'm like that's a great starting point so right now we're kind of relying on everybody to be like to absorb this maybe we have a patreon channel like i mean patreon account if they want to give us some money there that's also helpful for the post production because otherwise i'm paying out of pocket so to get this done but yeah we're going to be releasing the episodes over the next few months one at a time the story evolves quickly by episode two it moves into what is the present day for the story because the prologue takes place ahead of that and things start to move really fast and the music gets faster cool so we're going to be releasing an episode maybe every six weeks and so we do need a little help financially getting that out there and done i think we're gonna do it it's just a matter of who's gonna be who's gonna help so it's gonna get done and then when it's done we're gonna release the the full film as one entire cohesive unit but it's also an album if it's yeah okay i keep forgetting to talk about the music because the music is old because the music is all original music that you're writing for the movie yeah yeah so i did with this video i'll take over the intro like i do last time on the channel with something i've done so that's the best score from the film and yeah we've got new music so there's going to be a single at least one single released song or two released with every episode oh wow okay so that's how it's going to do yeah that's great it'll be a full record when the movie comes out it'll be you know 60 minutes of music that's done so not a like more instrumental content than normal and i'm not sure how much of that i'll put on the final record depending on how strong it is or on its own without the visual so one of our things about scoring for people out there that do music and want to score because scoring is like a real like ooh like a real alluring business for people is that it's weird once you put music's not the same as when you're making music just to listen as music and music to accompany a film because the film does a lot of the work like if there are a lot of shows where i was like oh this is great and then i pull the stuff out like the mandalorians one of them like i love the original star wars scores and the and the mandalorians cool but then when i pull it out by itself and listen to it next to a john williams piece i'm like well dude not fair to the composer to compare to john williams but it's like it's like oh like this is not he actually there's not a ton happening it's just kind of textured and slightly small amounts of a lot of content so yeah that's an important thing for people who want to get into scoring or even if you're like someone who never pays attention to the score start paying attention to it and figure out what you like and what you don't like it's it's an interesting world but yeah it's it's some of the stuff has to it can't be your most like best thing to listen to by itself it's going to accompany the image and serve the image but you have you have some songs with with words and i think it's not just music yeah oh yeah yeah absolutely so we'll have a lyric video that comes out a few days so this video hopefully airs on the day of the episode in the episode comes out november 16th at 9 00 pm and it's the prologue to the bigger story so that's on our youtube channel which we're poor robins you can find us pretty easily and you know like and subscribe smash that like button so i'm just going to spend the rest of the talk here advertising my channel no i think it's great i think people have to i think people have to to check it out and you know you know leave comments of course and yeah i think just understand that this is really this is something that we're hoping to see flower you know both neil and i we've been talking in private for years by now you got to meet in person this year yeah that's right we actually did in florida it does exist everyone people are starting to wonder if you exist yeah we actually have legs you know like [laughter] but we're really hoping that that you know these little gestures we're posing is just also going to be impetus for other people people that are watching these people that are that are getting excited also about these this returning to kind of good stories and so so we're excited to see where it goes and we hope that that other artists other storytellers get involved and you know and i you know and if you're also if you're a professional artist and yeah a lot of people i've been in contact with risa if you're a professional artist if you're a musician if you're a a painter or an illustrator or a filmmaker you know reach out because we're we're kind of yeah we're building up to some interesting stuff and we're excited to have at least people have a buzz around around what's going on and and and who knows where this is going to lead who knows i think eventually there's going to be it just seems like it's heading that way there's going to be a collective of people that are doing quality and people that want to learn to do quality and work and and lead up to that also like here i'll hijack jonathan's channel for a second i really think he needs to do an online symbolic world conference with you know some of the characters from his avengers universe in there the other people he has on his channel if you think that's a good idea like someone comment that and like it and let him know that a symbolic world conference online would be a terrific idea and you would be glad to attend all right okay neil so all right so we're all helping each other all right everybody so so thanks for your attention you know check out the queen of the night and everything else dirt
