hi welcome to another video today i would like to talk about the municipalities online job fair next week and i did a video on this last week which was basically the employer tooling and all the things you normally don't get to see if you're not an employer or not get to see if you're not like have been a sponsor right now today it's about what to expect as an attendee so the event will be next week on tuesday on the european afternoon and on wednesday in the evening for europe so if you're from asia tuesday is probably a bit better for you and if you're from america depends on your time zone but if like from california you're probably the the evening on wednesday for europeans is also better for the for those folks in california or hawaii so if you're looking for a job join the job fair and as you see there's currently three companies sponsoring this lumix ibu traffic technologies and all plan and [music] i am happy to have them on board ivu and our plan also were on board as you can see here you can actually see their logos and some of their folks attending and this little image from the first one in this year in march the first job fair in 2021 and now they're back and at least from all kind i know that they have been hiring through the event and that they really like the event so as you see the event is on hobilo so let's go to hobilo this is the lounge where you simply can then hop from table to table and talk to the various employers as you see these are the sponsors and there's like a little welcome table where i sit and we'll talk to you and then below that is the interview tables and the companies taking the free option and if you are an employer you still can join as a sponsor okay and let me quickly show you the landing page this is the landing page currently when you enter the event and click through your profi profile page then the event will show you this and then you click on the launch and join us to talk and the event is meant to be three hours long but you don't have to be there to start as an attendee as a job search okay come by when you have time bring an hour or two to talk to all employers of course some people come all three hours that's fine but the event is not meant to be attended by attendees the whole time okay and there's no talk no starter to kick off the event this is an open event where people come hang out with employers talk to them there will be some people from hr there will be some technical folks some programming folks which probably some team leads which you know can answer technical questions about c plus plus which will probably have a conversation with you about cps plus and what they do with it and how they use cpus and if it's a mesh you can exchange your contacts with them but also if i jump back there was a link see you can share your cv or your resume via the upload form and this is still the employer view which you already saw in the last video it's a bit different this these are then selects and not check boxes for candidates and then they simply you know the the form then for candidates goes in the second form where you write your cover letter select the employers upload your cv or resume and hit send and then that is by the sponsors and this is the event page again i probably also will add an event link to this next week for now please register via meetup and anyways joining the meaning c plus plus online meetup group is a good idea because we have like generally often some meetups there last week we had for the last year i think it was last week we had an event with thinker and they spoke about platform development multi-platform development with c plus and one more thing over the cv sharing form already 15 people have submitted their cvs and this is the skills they had you can see here the skill set they shared and then the fields of work they can which they came from currently there's 15 submissions it's from nine countries and years of experience you see is again a while it makes 30 years of experience with cps plus i think this is a new oldest record and then folks which have one year or less and the rest is just a normal mix and so i am looking forward to have this event again at the third time this year companies have hired through this i at least know from two companies who have hired there's probably more and yeah that that's a great event i'm really happy to host this i hope to see many of you which are looking for a job next week and if you can't come to the event if you can't make it the cv up footload form lets you share your cv with employers that are you know sponsoring the event and with that i hope to see you next week or maybe another event of musicals online thank you very much for listening
