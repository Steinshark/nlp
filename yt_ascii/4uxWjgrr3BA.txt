ladies and gentlemen this is the story about how edward snowden got hired to do some press piece and instead ambushes the guy live for accusations that this guy thought he would get away with and we're gonna talk about everything but let's talk about ed first right the man myth the legend look he was born june 21 1983 famous and infamous for copying and leaking highly classified nsa docs you guys know the whole thing we found out thanks to snowden that the fbi is watching us right now through your webcam probably like his methods or not it's undeniable that he risked everything for the sake of the american people he was making bank now he's like in russia somewhere freezing or whatever so he risked it all for getting the truth out there because he's what we call an ideologue right someone who doesn't get motivated by traditional things like money or things like this instead he lives for like an ideal in this case the truth getting out there and those kinds of people by the way they're dangerous and admirable because they can't be bribed or bought which is why when a wealth guru invited snowden to shill some kind of wealth summit thing everyone was perplexed including snowden himself who accepted the invitation only to slam dunk the guy live in front of his entire audience let's watch this together okay this is amazing and so i have to ask it's very unusual that you booked me for this conference because you know as a whistleblower it's my obligation i think personally and professionally to ask is this you my guy just did it with the this you with an article accusing him of a ponzi scheme 4.4 million dollar ponzi scheme dude to understand how amazing this is to understand what led up to this look i gotta walk you guys back for who this organizer is right the organizer the guy on screen right here is sunil tulsiani of brampton ontario okay in 2008 and 2009 he sold unregistered bonds which reports say turned out to be part of a 4.4 million dollar ponzi scheme by the way stand it's gone that was sold to 80 investors who were part of his private investment club okay sunil was then banned from trading securities for life by the ontario securities commission and then later charged with breaking that ban in 2015 with unregistered trading now you might be thinking with all these allegations accusations bans that would be enough to prevent someone from advising other people about their wealth right breaking into this fake guru seminar circuit but of course you'd be wrong sunil has appeared with many of the biggest fake guru name right like greg cardone look at this dude grant is shilling this guy's event for him watch fifty dollars to how much fifty dollars to fifteen thousand dollars i would strongly advise you invest in the fifteen thousand dollar go sit with the players yes he goes don't spend a thousand on this guy fifteen thousand you can't do that okay buy a fifty dollar ticket upgrade on your weight make a commitment to being there make a commitment to say because guess what man if you can't do 15 grand you're not gonna buy any real estate in canada that's right yo dude if you can't spend 15k on a real estate court bro what are you doing what are you these guys are such clowns and look it wasn't just him it wasn't just grant cardone right he got in with kevin hart kevin harrington also of shark tank and co-hosted stages with all these guys and he did that as recently as march of 2020 my point is because in spite of promoting this 4.5 million dollar scheme or whatever to his private investment club this guy is still crushing it as you can see with the biggest names in this fake guru world right everybody's endorsing this guy and his immo is to throw big events with the biggest names in the world and nobody ever calls him out so like think about that understand that this guy lands snowden and he thinks it's gonna be just like all his other interviews that's the context of this so he hypes up the zoom event he hypes this up for his private investment club whatever thinking that snowden's gonna legitimize him he thought this guy wasn't gonna background check him but the only problem is it's edward snowden you dummy so this guy comes on the show does a five minutes google search and does what none of these people have had the balls to do to say to this guy which is this you this idea of whistleblowing it's really remarkable to me people go through the day and they become so familiar with this sense of wrongdoing with seeing things like i saw in the office and hoping somebody else would do something about it returning blind eye going it's not my problem these are not my people it doesn't impact me oh my gosh it's like he's talking to all these guys who refuse to call him out who all share stages with this guy never say anything they just never say anything what you got securities banned what i'm not gonna say anything's not my problem and so i have to ask it's very unusual that you booked me for this conference because you know as a whistleblower it's my obligation i think personally and professionally to ask is this you yes look at that silence yes because i think that it is yes and i think that the things that i've heard tonight make me very uncomfortable with this event i think that makes me very uncomfortable and everyone involved with this should really question is this the kind of association that they want to have are you going to be able to deliver on the promises that you're making them i sure hope to god that you will but my advice to everyone on this goal tonight everyone looking at this is look up what you're getting involved in if you spend money are you sure that you want to spend it or do you want to charge it back and i gotta think hard about if you want to continue this because for me ladies and gentlemen for tonight i don't thank you so much and good night [laughter] wow all he can say is wow this is the greatest clip of all time dude edward is a legend forever he's goad he's already goaded but he's goaded forever for this this is the face of a man who did not know he was about to be caught out on his own live stream let's let's take like few minutes break and i'll write i'll be right back this is totally unexpected i bet it is and i'm so sorry that this has happened i bet you are look if you guys notice private investment club that's by the way what's named in the 2008 2009 like you know whatever complaint whatever that is the charges he solicited his private investment club people for this scheme he's still running the same private investment club like that's just the crazy part about it is like why would you go back into this after you know what this guy has done so they shut this stream off right they take a break whatever now here's where i want to give you guys the follow-up this is why you come to coffeezilla for the extra context because this guy jack paulson on twitter followed this up and live tweeted the whole response so apparently they went on break a guy on a hot mic who didn't know it was on said wasted every day apparently he also ordered a medium iced coffee while they're on break okay so then they come back and sunil says that the problem is that somebody wrote a click bait article okay he says if i stole millions of dollars i would not be here don't be so super sure i was never charged criminally which that's amazing you know what the actual headline one of his headlines is sunil is charged quasi-criminally yeah guys hey he was never charged criminally he was charged quasi-criminally that has to be the slimiest way to get out of something you go hey i'm not a criminal according to the ontario securities commission i was only charged quasi criminally it's clickbait dude hey you know how the ontario securities commission is known to write clickbait guys and look at this point if snowden has told you guys hey don't get involved in this i wouldn't get involved if you get involved in this i'm sorry it's on you it's like if enron reopened their doors and you invested in them like we already have this thing with the private investment club we already have the reports on it it's done it's done he's still running it you guys are still investing in it don't do it i just oh man when i saw this i almost cried tears of joy man snowden is a legend for this forever and it takes guts to call it out man oh man this is so funny and listen it's to some of you who are going to say look can't a guy get a second chance i am about second chances just not about managing your money if a banker if anyone has ever been banned or had any financial misdoings never trust that person with your money look bernie madoff only ran a ponzi scheme once what about the second chances it's like no something's it that's it like if you trusted eye surgeon right to do eye surgery and they mess up on your eyes you don't give them a second chance to go back for the second you say no i think i'm good i'm gonna go to a new guy i've already been charged with sketchy stuff we're done we're finished so thanks to snoda for calling this out i just want to show you guys this that's basically it did you learn anything did you get a good laugh out of this thanks for watching i'll see you guys in the next one nothing but a trick trying to sell me on a dream but that was where you lost me wake up and smell the coffee
