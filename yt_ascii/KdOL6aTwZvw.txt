i already got a cease and desist letter last time so i might get sued for saying this but we have to talk about the fraud and lies that are catching up with safe moon and their ceo john caroni last time we uncovered millions of dollars of stolen company money but this time it gets even worse i'm being threatened for uncovering shell companies and worse so is john's mom so look guys we're on like part five of this safe moon expose so if you haven't watched the previous videos some of this might not make a ton of sense we're deep in the coffees a little lower here we're deep in the 10 million dollar studio so i've got a couple of options first you can go watch those videos and then jump to this time stamp for when we're gonna discuss the rest of it or i can give you a super quick recap the summary is that safe moon is a formerly billion dollar cryptocurrency which promised to take their investors safely to the moon in a move that surprised no one they then defrauded those investors by stealing unstealable funds turns out that the money that was supposed to be like locked up automatically wasn't locked up automatically and despite this somehow safe moon still maintains a pretty cult-like fan base called the safe moon army by promising pretty much everything from gambian wind farms to nanotechnology and delivering on absolutely none of it i mean to understand the absolute horror of being a safe moon investor just picture you know your dad right he promises you everything one christmas promises you the whole walmart catalog the little kid-sized jeep that actually drives all of it and then the time comes and you get nothing and he steals your grandma's card with a hundred dollars in it that's what it's like being invested in safe moon last year x except instead of just one dad there are several dads in the safe moon history which have promised things and like been stolen the money but these days there's really only one dad worth talking about who hasn't gone out for cigarettes yet okay maybe this dad analogy's gone a bit too far but the point is that man well who's actually not a dad incidentally is john caroni the ceo current ceo john was basically broke before safema now i don't mean that disparagingly i mean it has a matter of record he admits to living in a trailer on instagram saying that he was like living a van life or something now what's funny about this is his own brother responded to it that it wasn't so much van life as it was john mooching off his parents for free utilities i don't know what you want to call that or we calling this living at home with extra steps or van life it's up to you either way john hit it big when he got attached to safe moon he quickly became a multi-millionaire after he stole money which was supposed to be for investors which we all discovered accidentally because of a wiener dog nft that john posted to instagram to show up we here at coffee zilla call that wiener gate and unfortunately it's too hard to talk about here today you can go watch a video about that here but either way this proved that john had millions of dollars of crypto that he shouldn't right because the whole idea was we're locking the money away we're not going to touch it for like four years or something it turns out of course they did but it got me thinking once we found this i wanted to know where did this money go where is he putting all this crypto right he doesn't keep it all in crypto and that's what we're gonna find out today now one last piece of context that i do think is important most of the people who formerly worked with john caroni told me the same thing basically he's terrible to work with and quite ruthless as you'll see in these recordings there's like no substance of a human there anymore john's a monster and does not care about his employees whatsoever and this is going to sound really up and i apologize in advance the only time i like john is when he's depressed now again i i don't mean that to show him disparagingly i just think it's important context because the safe moon army still believes that john is basically their savior he's the good guy in their eyes and everyone else is bad because of john that really is their narrative but it's a narrative that starts falling apart when you realize the pattern of behavior with everyone you know it's like that one friend you have that always has problems with other people right they're always have drama with everyone and they blame it on everyone but themselves and at some point you always think like well maybe there's a common denominator here and that brings us all to today because today i'm here to share even more evidence that john crony might be stealing from safe moon holders some of this is brand new evidence some of it is old evidence that i uncovered that i've been unable to talk about because of lawsuit threats from john's lawyers because a couple of months ago i just discovered a multi-million dollar real estate portfolio that john crony was hiding in shell companies which again is pertinent because you know before safe moon he had no money and in safe when he wasn't supposed to have a way to get money so where did it come from so obviously you know what i think but the point is when i went to uncover this information john's lawyers they sent me a season assist said hey we're gonna sue you if you leaked this information and the thing is i had already done so much on them that i knew that somehow this information would come out like they're really bad at hiding things so i decided look i'm just gonna hang back i'm just gonna wait i know this is gonna leak eventually and turns out it was i was right it did just not in the way i expected because the leaker of the information wasn't some disgruntled employee it was john caroni accidentally leaking the information public when he sued his own mother yes you heard that right john caroni is suing his own mother for embezzlement if you don't believe me here's the lawsuit right here which i got by paying three dollars on pacer it's called journalism i mean i know you guys wonder you know if this is such a big deal why isn't it everywhere in the presses well i don't know maybe they don't have three dollars i don't know i i don't think the new york times has a pacer account right actually a serious story people did approach me about doing this as like a docu-series or something like that after we put out a report but when i'd fully explained it to him they'd be like yeah can we make this a bit simpler can we dumb it down i mean these people their audiences they think the blockchain is like a tetris mobile game you know they they're trying to erase the blockchain from this whole story and it's like not sure you can do that and still you know see the fraud but this part of the story i don't know how much i can make it simpler right this guy is literally suing his mom for embezzlement while himself being accused of embezzlement it's honestly insane it's to say that the story isn't everywhere right now but today we're gonna break it all down you know how did john coroni go from being living in a trailer at his mom's house to the lambo suing his mom for a house because that's happening too and at the end i'm also going to be telling you the details of why john croney threatened me to sue me you know innocent me i know it's hard to believe because honestly it's entirely possible that me and mrs caroni could be taking the stand together against josh you know it's it's about i know it sounds funny sounds crazy it's a possibility i could be setting up a gofundme be for me and her legal fees very soon it could be happening so thank you for pumping the stock thank you for supporting the channel you guys all make it all possible but without further ado let's get into this lawsuit all right so this is the lawsuit between john caroni and his mother through a company called ecg and look i know many of you you got the popcorn out you're ready for the family drama but let's start by talking about a few things right first of all i need to say i'm not airing out john caroni's family problems this is a public court case anyone has access to it like i said a few bucks so i cannot stress enough that john chose to air out all this information like he's the one they're the ones writing the documents with the lawyers or whatever they put it out publicly okay first secondly and this is also extremely important on the one hand i do find it funny that jon is suing his mother for embezzlement because you know he's also being accused of embezzlement and his plan i guess to fight that is like oh instead of addressing the accusations let's just accuse my mom of embezzlement you know that's a classic that's a classic excuse we'll see how that plays out for him right so yes i find all of that funny but that's not why we're doing it because it turns out this lawsuit is also incredibly helpful for unraveling the entire safe moon story there's a lot of lies in here that start falling apart when you see it because as you'll find out jennifer caroni john's mom absolutely torches him in this lawsuit i mean it might as well be addressed to coffeezilla the way some of this stuff is written i think she knew like some of it the way it was like put in the lawsuit i think it was her way of you know exposing him because i didn't think she needed to put it in and then i think it was like i brought you into this world i'm gonna take you out so as we go through this lawsuit though i'm gonna be bringing this all back to how this relates to safeman because again that's why we're talking about it that's the bigger picture here now the details of how this lawsuit came about as i said safe moon from the early days they promised a lot right gambian wind farms nanotechnology the list went on and on which all started when john starts talking about all these you know code name projects he starts talking about darkmoon area 32 operation phoenix operation phoenix is is a little bit of a journey but it's mainly a bunch of different complex things coming together to create an evolution but in reality this loss was that he wasn't pioneering much as much as he was piggybacking off of his parents achievements the following is from the sign declaration of jennifer caroni john's parents are apparently extremely involved in the gambia and have been for some time they quote began establishing valuable government and business relations which resulted in them having valuable relationships invitations approvals and licenses to do business in the gambia the point is they had connections and john wanted to use them so he decides okay he's now got a ton of cash through safe moon and he's going to invest in the family business so him and his mom create a company called ecg which is like i guess part of what they were doing there they also have other companies too it's called the emanations communications group which is a terrible name whatever we're calling it ecg the big point is this john is joining mom and getting 33.3 percent of profits for future sales of some antenna technology doesn't really matter but the point is john is getting that percentage because he's funding it with his quote personal wealth ladies and gentlemen it can't be expressed how big of a point this is is it like the smoking gun in the lawsuit because this document does not say john caroni manifested his desire to diversify his company's wealth of cryptocurrency it says his personal wealth his personal piggy bank and the reason this matters is because the amount of personal wealth he put into this company with five million dollars now i want you to ask yourselves pretend you're the jury for a second right we've seen evidence that john was living in a van before safeman suddenly he joined safe moon in march of 2021 and by june 2021 he's got five million dollars to invest of personal crypto wealth like as the jury tell me the conclusion where did he find that money did he find the bitcoin under his vans mattress or did he get the money from investors i really don't care how high you are on safe boom copium you cannot pretend that this could have come from like even just a salary right even if he was getting paid as the ceo of safeman what is he getting paid a million dollars a month look at the timeline march 2021 van life june 2021 5 million dollars personal wealth it doesn't take a scientist to figure out what's going on here it takes three dollars in a pacer account journalism what we find out next though is even more wild because the reason john accuses his mother of embezzling money is apparently because he thinks that she spent a bunch of the money from ecg which is their shared company she spent it in dividends on things like cash transfers fashion purchases guns and hair apparently 258 thousand dollars which is certainly a lot of money but coroni's moms argues that this is just her regular salary and was mischaracterized and honestly the reason the gun was even bought was because her son had attracted threats she says quote the firearms and munitions were personal expenditures deemed necessary in light of me and bradford's names being included in threats against john which obviously that's totally understandable and looks terrible for john like literally imagine leaking the fact that your parents fear for their safety because of your actions and then accusing them of embezzlement because of it now obviously it's pretty understandable why their relationship was starting to deteriorate at this point but it got worse when jon started claiming all their hard work so sort of as his own he started renaming their companies ecg and ecg operations and called them dark moon and area 32 to the safe moon army to make it look like he was doing a bunch of work his mom tried to tell him that this was extremely cringe but he didn't listen now the reason this is important again is because in context with safe moon john was making it sound like he's this innovator he he's this evolution guy he's leading the church but in reality he was just taking credit for other people's work and he would allegedly even leak proprietary information which they asked him not to leak and it just led to more of a riff between them now of course at this point the gambia was still a big part of safe moon's narrative and story so john couldn't let this weakening relationship last for very long so he decides to make a last-ditch effort to go to the gambia and repair relationships and you'd think at this point that jon would sort of humble himself and take the l but instead it turns out that allegedly he went behind his mom's back to the business partners in the gambia that the parents had spent years building up these relationships and tried to cut her out of her own deal allegedly he tried to bribe her friends and business partners with 350 000 contingent on them cutting her out which oh my gosh have you no shape this woman not only birthed you she brought you the whole deal and luckily for jennifer her business partners refused but john doubles down and says i'll give you 4.5 million dollars if you do it and also get rid of these pesky regulations around approving you know my plans etc to which her partners in the gambia were like no that's not how any of this works and john's reaction was apparently quote to improperly transport business assets and property to include personal property across international borders guys i will let your imagination run why with what these personal assets were or business assets i mean was it a car was it a plane was it secret documents i don't know the accusation is that he stole stuff though either way and honestly john caroney just kind of comes off like a bond super villain here he doesn't get his way so he just steals stuff and leaves across international borders and bear in mind this is coming from his own flesh and blood that is making these accusations his own mom now they called this whole event the march 2022 invitation in the lawsuit and incidentally this is also when john's own brother charles caroni decided he was going to leave safe moon at the time he said it was because he wanted to go back to college but looking back at the timeline it seems pretty clear and now that the gloves are off charles his brother is saying publicly quote sorry this was said before his suing my mother face so the whole family seems to have turned against john and at this point even his uncle is tweeting about the dark triad he's tweeting about coffee makers how much he loves this coffee machine in the same month that we were exposing john it's just all going pretty horribly for john but again i'm not saying this you know for the drama or whatever i'm saying this because this all relates to safe mode this is a company that people have put their trust in their money in and john's leading the ship because let's put these pieces together you know safe moon started with a bunch of founders they all left the company or got run out of the company by john crony then his family gets involved they all get run out of the company everyone hates jon because they seem to be getting screwed john's ending up rich the investors are ending up poor i mean this isn't too complicated to figure out unfortunately though i have to harp on this point because each time something like this happens some new revelation comes out about john crony something unbelievable each time the people in safe moon try to rationalize what he has done like right now i kid you not one of the top posts on their subreddit is justifying why john had to sue his mother not did sue his mother mother why he had to do it in this post the conclusion is sue is the only correct answer i mean at this point if you can rationalize this your ceo trying to ruin his mother's reputation accusing her of embezzlement all the while facing his own embezzlement charges you might you might be in a cult you know it's just it's gone too far of course though this isn't over because with safe moon it's never over there still is more evidence here because after torching the deal in gambia john does what he does best and he shifts the goal post because instead of saying you screwed up he releases a captain's log saying you know what the gambia ain't so hot after all quote while the gambia will always hold a high place in my heart and priorities the recent trip illuminated myriad other opportunities in other parts of africa which is certainly one way of saying you botched the deal now next i do want to cover my own involvement in this whole safe moon saga as i said i received a cease and desist letter from john coroni and i want to talk a bit about that the gist of it is that it relates to a certain shell company that john caroni created to hide a housing portfolio basically he's just hiding more of his money he called it the ronin real estate company and i the way i found it was through his lawyer curtis walthius a family lawyer now right about the time i found out that john had been buying houses with cash and a multi-million dollar real estate portfolio somehow he found out that i knew and you know he sent a letter basically saying that like we know that you know and if you say anything about this we're going to sue you because it would endanger john in some way which to be clear i would have never doxed personal information or you know any addresses or anything like that i just thought it was highly relevant to investors you know when they're suffering that their ceo their fearless leader is now living in a mansion i think that's relevant but at the same time i'd already revealed so much wrong doing the safe moon i didn't feel like it was worth the risk at this point and i just felt like it was best to just kind of step back and see how this whole thing would shake out because i kind of had a feeling that this stuff would leak because it's pretty hard to hide the fact if you're snatching up houses like the monopoly man and it turns out once again john leaked the information himself he put his secret little ronin real estate company in the lawsuit against his mom he blew his cover wide open why because he was complaining about the fact that he helped his parents with like a down payment and now sort of wants the down payment back from his parents because they put it in the wrong company's name and in a twist of irony he actually names the exact street where his parents house is located and sort of almost doxes them which is funny to me because you know he's threatening me how dare you i didn't even reveal anything he's like how dare you i'm going to send you cease and desist letters whatever meanwhile he's suing his parents and he puts their address in there while knowing that his parents are having to go out and buy guns because of you know all his shenanigans online how insane is that and by the way his parents have a whole explanation of why you know this house that john helped buy isn't in john's ronin real estate name that's what john wanted the reason is is because of the title company and the fact that apparently john's dad is like a retired peace officer and you know he could get the house houses addressed privatized because of that which would be great because their address wouldn't be listed publicly online that's what they wanted john of course goes up and blows this up by putting their street name in in the lawsuit but either way it's just kind of a mess now again how does this relate to safe moon though of course well it turns out while leaking his secret shell company john's mother also revealed the fact that john was using his personal wealth to buy these houses again this is a multi-million dollar real estate portfolio so where did he get all this money all this personal wealth she says in a sworn statement all this funding was understood to be john's own personal wealth guys it's unequivocal that means that all these houses that john has in his name is his personal houses so ladies and gentlemen once again we find that john's rich provably i mean his own mother saying it and his investors are poor that is the legacy of safe moon and yet unbelievably once again the investors still aren't getting it and you know honestly when i first exposed safe moon for millions stolen the the safe moon army told me you know that's old fun when i expose ben phillips for millions stolen from him they tell me oh that's the old team when i expose papa on a phone call they told me oh well he's just a bad apple when i started exposing john is when they freaked out and they go no no he's not he's not bad he's the good guy in this whole thing you know i expose 100 million dollars stolen they said ha you finally made a mistake only 6.3 million dollars was stolen which to be fair they were right it wasn't 100 million it was 6.3 million i'm just not sure that's the win that they think it is the fact that any money was stole is sort of the problem and my overall point is if you can believe that you know the old team was corrupt if you can believe that money has been stolen what is so difficult what is the logical leap that's so impossible about maybe the current ceo is bad too you know i just don't really understand it because people are fighting for this guy like they're john's mom meanwhile john's own mom is getting sued and she doesn't even like him you know like i don't get it i've never seen anything like this you know i'm not saying his parents are perfect right i have no idea i don't know them they could be involved in this whole thing i don't know i truly i'm not accusing them i i literally do not know but the point is is that like all the red flags point at one guy and everyone's like ignoring that it's all points at john caroni and at this point you know i'm not sure whether it matters if you guys believe me or not because i think in the end this man has proven that he will self-sabotage himself regardless of what what i do or say but i just want to expose this stuff before it all goes to zero you know because sure he leaked the million dollar house he leaked the wiener dog nft he leaked the five million he leaked his parents street address he will eventually leak it but the question is are you guys gonna wake up before or after this whole thing goes to zero right and i know some of you are gonna say oh look the people who are still invested they're never gonna listen at this point but i do think you're right that most won't listen but there are people on the margins that you can still help and those are the people that i'm talking to those are the people i'm trying to reach right now so if you've been on the fence about this stuff and you've never seen the whole picture of john caroni the ceo of safe moon now you have for those of you who are just here for the entertainment i hope you enjoy i love doing these deep dives and safe moon has been one of our longest running investigations one of the most painful ones too honestly because so frustrating trying to convince people to stop despite all the evidence but either way i can't help but do it i just love these deep dives and it's thanks to you that i get to do them so anyways pump the stock that's basically it and i will see you in the next one
