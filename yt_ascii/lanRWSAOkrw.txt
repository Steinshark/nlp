do not come at me saying prompt engineering isn't real i feel like this is something that we all kind of in the back of our heads are thinking is prompt engineering real regardless if you like the name or not i mean prompt engineering does engineering really need to be in there that's debatable we can argue that in the comments well not even argue but think about it deeply regardless though it is something we use every day and rather than just typing into different systems such as chat gpt gemini etc without any really thought or strategy as to how you are interacting with these different llms i'm going to share with you some methods that you can use prompt engineering to really ensure you are getting accurate results that you are looking for these are different methods that you can really utilize depending on what you are prompting the ai4 and then also to what you're hoping to get out of the output we'll cover all of that before we do though you know the drill hit that subscribe button for more tech future tech ai you get it everything tech and also to leave in the comments any other videos you want me to make that is how i make these videos that is why i make these videos is for you all right let's get into [music] it let's talk about the most common prompt engineering method and this is a method that you probably already are doing it's it's something that we just inherently start utilizing the different llm systems for which is called zero shot learning and this essentially is what it sounds like it's there's it's a shot in the darkk essentially you are prompting the ai with the task as descried scrip so a good example of how this actually can be effective and what it should be used for is if you are wanting to say translate a language so whatever you are inputting into the ai you are expecting a direct output so say for example you would like to translate a sentence from english to french this is a simple ask that you can prompt the ai with where it is translate the sentence from english to french for me done very simple but here's the thing this is where it gets a little bit tricky we take this zero shot prompting and really start a applying it to different methods or different types of prompts that it really isn't suitable for it's the easiest way to prompt and you know we humans get a little bit lazy so we often just try in our best words what we think sounds good to prompt the ai using zero prompt learning so now by the way you know how you are typically prompting in ai next upep is something called few shot learning we went from zero shot learning to few shot learning and few shot learning is different than zero shot learning in the sense that with this few shot learning you are including a few examples to the ai so it has a bit more context as to what you are looking to achieve now here's an example let's say you are writing a poem i don't know people do write poems still now don't they say you are writing a poem and you want some help from chat gpt or any ai system you type in the prompt write a poem for me here are some examples or parts of poem examples that you can refer to this will give the ai some understanding or context as to what your hoping to achieve with some examples but this method only works for certain use cases it's very specific if you are hoping to have an output that is relatively similar to the examples you are providing so you already know what you are looking to achieve so that's why it works really well all right the next one is one that i use often i just inherently end up navigating or gravitating towards which is prompt chaining so prompt chaining what it is is you start with one prompt get a result and then carry on the conversation hence the chain now why i like this this way so much this prompt method so much i think it comes from my software developer background where i would comment or i still do when i code comment out my code leave comments throughout my code share what aspects i'm building whether it be to remind myself or others depending on the situation so having that background i think really is why i always navigate towards prompt chaining and it also kind of is the way my brain works so it just needs to break down something a larger task anyways into smaller pieces so prompt chaining as to my point is really good for larger tasks and when i am building different things nowadays a lot in python i will use prompt chaining let's give an example say we are building i don't know what is a good example let's use code as an example now there's definitely better prompts than this for code but i'm just saying breaking down a big example say we are building a homepage a landing page so we start by prompting i would like to build a landing page in the programming languages you would like to build building it say javascript html css maybe a framework on there and then from there the large language model will respond probably with something like okay great what do you want to you know include in this landing page or asking for more information once it has more information we will really break down piece by piece or component by component as to what code you are looking for pause one sec here we had a little guest mak an appearance did you want to say hi he just walked into my room are you a software engineer is that why you came in now he's shy all right continue on prompt engineering so this is another great way prompt chaining to really break down larger tasks if you have either you're writing a really big script or essay or even email this might be a good way to go and similar for coding tasks now this last one i wanted to share with you i found super interesting so i was recently watching ibm's video on different prompt engineering methods which by the way is a great watch it really dives into different methods that i haven't heard about and honestly was one of the inspirations for this video cu i like that's brilliant you know we do use so many different methods for prompt engineering all right so in their video i can sum it up for you though one of the things one of the most interesting methods they talk about is a newer one which is called dsp or direct stimulus prompting so this is more of a strategy they go on to say so guiding ai responses in a more t targeted and specific direction so what you do when you are interacting with ai using dsp is you are essentially guiding the ai to the answer you were looking for and i know this kind of sounds like cheating at first like what do you mean guiding it then it's just going to tell me what i want to hear but let's go through an example unlike say just generic prompting when you're using dsp you are helping guide it to very specific topics or very specific areas so one application would be say creative writing say you would like to work with an ai to help you write a story or this creative writing piece what you can do is guide it in suggesting the tone the voice the the length of the piece of writing really guiding as to what this response will look like so when you really break it down that way you can understand that it's not cheating it's just really guiding the response to be exactly what you are looking for in the overall tone and overarching story in this case another really interesting use of dsp is when it comes to ethics in ai so you can actually guide or prompt when you are writing this prompt guide or prompt when you you get what i mean when you are working on a prompt you can guide the ai to really consider the ethical implications of its answer or what it is looking to solve you can include in your prompt to consider different moral ethics or considerations in how it responds which i think is super cool especially around the topic of ai and ethics which is huge all right that is some of the top different methods for prompt engineering and you can see there are so many and i guarantee if you go through all of these methods asking with hopes of the same outcome but the way you work these the way you use these different methods you're going to get such different results so it's really key to know these different methods and then be able to apply them into how you interact with these lolms because let's be real i don't know about you but i use i interact with ai every single day throughout the entire day i don't know am my alone how often do you interact with different specifically let's talk about chat bots how often do you interact with them all right i hope you found this video valuable and helpful leave in the comments other topics you want me to cover and i will see you all soon thanks everyone [music]
