so i've got three smartphones right here and we're gonna try and break them on one of them we're gonna keep it bare on another i'll be applying a tempered glass screen protector but on the third i'm gonna be using this this is d glass coat which is a liquid containing ultrafine mineral silica the idea is based on the fact that glass even the flat glass you see on your smartphone is actually a really uneven surface up close whereas normal protectors are too large to correctly protect the fine contours of the glass this thing claims that it can and to be honest i'm kind of skeptical about the whole thing but the company was very willing for me to try it and the only reviews i could find on amazon seemed pretty positive anyways only one way to find out so first things first let's apply the d plus coat onto one of the devices and the phones i'm going to be using here are all red meat goes partly so that i don't have to mortgage my house but also because it makes sense to test this on glass that isn't already reinforced the actual process is just a case of wiping a screen with the coat and then adding water which apparently catalyzes the reaction i then repeated this three times to add three layers as was recommended by the website and here we go all done and visually you can't see any difference between the untreated one on the left and the treated one on the right i'm gonna keep putting these two devices under more strain until at least one of them breaks and then i'm going to do the exact same test to the one with a tempered glass screen protector applied first up using a screwdriver and applying a pretty substantial amount of pressure starting off with the untreated one on the left you can't really see any kind of damage the original glass is already tough enough to resist this so it probably comes as no surprise that on the treated glass as well you can tell i've been scratching it so leveling this up this is the impact test using the same screwdriver but now working it into the display and window onto both and then check the results afterwards what is interesting is that the sound of the impact is a little different on the treated phone but again when it comes to assessing damage on both devices i couldn't find a mark so the untreated phone is putting up more of a fight than i expected and for the treated phone i still can't really tell if it's doing anything so the best way to find that out is to level this test up so you've changed that screwdriver for a hammer and we're walking it into each firms display one by one without any kind of interval we're going to switch that up to impact test three which is the exact same thing but the hammer swing distance has gone up two times so the impact is much greater and you can see on the left the actual screen has now become unresponsive doing the same on the treated phone on the right so far there doesn't seem to be any major damage the screen works as expected but we need to make sure so moving on to impact tests for the same as impact has three but flipping the hammer around so that we're hitting the displays with the sharp end and you can see straight away that on the untreated phone completely smashed there are cracks everywhere this is unsafe to use at this point so we can do the same on the treated phone and let's see so on this phone you can see the number of smaller hairline cracks is fewer but at the same time the main impact the main damage is still more or less the same so both of these phones are completely done at this point but impact test 5 is seeing how much further each phone fractures upon lightly tapping it with a hammer and in this scenario there is quite a big difference between how the treated phone and the untreated phone on the left reacts all right now time to try the third one we're gonna try the tempered glass screen protected phone so we're gonna quickly unbox it and apply the protector and you probably all know how to do this you put an alcohol wipe just to disinfect the screen and then you wipe it off make sure it's dry and stick the screen protector on top starting with one side at a time so compared to trying something like a liquid glass solution there is the clear disadvantage here that you can tell this thing is on as a slight bit of extra weight as well as the visual interruption on the front of your phone but for a lot of people for the peace of mind this could potentially offer that might be worth it so we're going to go through and perform all the same impact tests that we did on the other two phones the completely untreated one is what is wrong with the liquid glass protector on it and as we noticed with our treated wand one with the liquid glass on it even after dropping the hammer from a high distance the screen still works fine although you can't really see it because if it's terrible viewing angles and here's the big one using the back of the hammer and there is still a pretty major crack on there so we're gonna just continue to knock the display see how much we can break it and take a look at the final result okay so here we have it and on first impression you can tell it's already a little better than without using a protector at all the damage is severe but not as severe but the golden part of this is that at any time you can just take it off and apply another one and when you do take it off the remaining damage on the screen below is incredibly minimal there was only one mark i could see and part of it even rubbed straight off there's basically one scratch on the display one tiny minor hairline fracture that's really impressive and it leads to quite an obvious conclusion so the main takeaway here is that whilst it's perfectly possible that these liquid protectors do somewhat increase the endurance of your display if you really did want to see a tangible difference then tempered glass is the way to go thanks a lot for watching guys my name is erin this is mr. who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
