what entrepreneurship industry actors mainly do is to increase confidence maybe the way to say it is that it's building up confidence more than it's building up competence success in entrepreneurship is just incredibly unlikely it is rare right that is one thing that we know for like a real fact in social science it's really rare maybe we should start thinking about entrepreneurship as something we engage in through critical experiments where we try to disprove our idea right instead of saying let me take this idea and see if i can make it work you should do experiments and sort of prove out that the idea does not work and if it turns out the idea does not work you should get out of here ladies and gentlemen welcome to coffeezilla today we are talking to someone i've been kind of a fan of his work for a long time but finally i get to sit down and talk with him this is dr hartman of the copenhagen business school he is a an associate professor and he wrote a paper about the i'm going to totally mess this up the vablin vleblinien entrepreneur aka i just want to say because i want to call it this during this show the wantrepreneur sort of thing and it's towards an unentrepreneurial economy the entrepreneurship industry and the rise of the bleblinian entrepreneur can you summarize that idea for us real quick because i think it's a really interesting concept yeah so the thank you for the introduction stephen by the way absolutely thank you and thank you for the opportunity so so the blending entrepreneur is a or what's called the entrepreneur that's fine too is is our effort to sort of put a label on what i think a lot of people are are seeing right the fact that there is that there are people starting entrepreneurship not so much with the intention of actually becoming innovation-driven entrepreneurs but more actually to just sort of engage in the entrepreneurial lifestyle and to build up the kind of identity that comes with that so basically is entrepreneurship pursued for identity purposes not productive purposes you guys have all seen this at your s whether it's your university you've seen it at these you know some coffee shops it's it's a lot of times people are pursuing entrepreneurship just to sort of tell you that they're an entrepreneur kind of idea like the whole thing of like you know i'm a ceo well when's your company start well yesterday and you're like oh okay that's very interesting and part of your paper argues you're trying to if i understand it right you're trying to explain a set of sort of problems or or ideas in the field one of which is that okay we see that entrepreneurship leads to all sorts of good things in the economy but largely this is driven by a few companies and then you also see that oh well actually the there's the sort of the failing entrepreneurs or people who kind of have undersized results and there's people like amazon apple you know all these companies that are driving the majority of the u.s economy you're saying that it's actually becoming more prevalent to and you're getting more and more sort of failing entrepreneurs entering the ecosystem as proportional to their like successful counterparts and you're wondering why and you're sort of saying there's this industry around entrepreneurs is that basically the idea yes and that's and that's causing a particular kind of entrepreneurial firm to pop up and the kind of firm that is causing the pop-up is what we call the blinding entrepreneurs of entrepreneurs so so basically it's not our observation that the quality of entrepreneurship is falling that's from other work which is referenced in the paper but basically finding that like people tend to think that the us is incredibly entrepreneurial and that's actually not the case by international standards entrepreneurship is also becoming more rare in the us there are fewer and fewer entrepreneurial companies in the sense that there are fewer startups and the quality of those startups is declining right all bad things all bad things as you say it's true that there are like entrepreneurial companies play a potentially very big role in the economy right there's things that entrepreneurial entrepreneurial companies do that established companies don't do so economic dynamism is very much dependent on having well-functioning entrepreneurship right but that is that seems to be becoming more rare and there are all sorts of explanations that you could have for that you might say that for instance incumbent market power is increasing right so google facebook and amazon are basically buying up and closing down all the really potentially promising entrepreneurial companies before they become big right that's one vision of it the other is that there is that there's just fewer good ideas to go around right that the good ideas are getting harder to find and you could also say that entrepreneurship education maybe is getting worse right so entrepreneurs are more poorly prepared more poorly prepared for entrepreneurship you might say something about venture capital not working very well all of those arguments are valid and you know social sciences such that usually things are really complex and things interact and the thing that we're saying with that paper is that our ex our understanding of the decline in entrepreneurial quality has not taken into account that there has been this really rapidly growing and by now quite large entrepreneurship industry which are companies that target entrepreneurs as their consumers right and purportedly help entrepreneurs to identify and develop ideas into profitable profitable businesses let's maybe expand on the types of like sort of entrepreneur help that one might see in this industry right yes so you can there are different things right the you mentioned that people have seen this at their universities right many universities now have sort of these entrepreneurship hubs right that could be classed as a kind of entrepreneurship industry this is something which is marketing to entrepreneurs to try to help them there's lots of there's a lot of academic writing on this books by academics books by practitioners like experienced entrepreneurs who then give advice there's a lot of sort of you would call it back office support for entrepreneurs right we'll do your accounting we'll do your legal we'll do your admin there are lots of entrepreneurship conferences expos there's lots of online media like shark tank stuff like that like shark tank on television and then there's also like the dutch type of business magazine right wired fast company things like that and basically a heap of books that you can get off of amazon or anywhere else that will talk about oh yeah tell you about how to become a successful entrepreneur that's right so there's a whole sort of suite of this that all sorts of that all sort of pretend to help entrepreneurs right plus of course there are college courses incubators accelerators things associated with venture capital as well all sorts of things that are sort of trying to do this promoting entrepreneurs helping them identify opportunities and then and turning opportunities into valuable businesses right and this is why i wanted to talk to you because i read this paper and i said oh my gosh this intersects with a lot of what i talk about i mean obviously sometimes i'm talking about outright scams but a lot of times i'm talking about people who are sort of proposing that oh if you're wanting to go into facebook ads or you know making a little amazon store or do you know starting an idea come to us we're going to help you if you just pay some nominal fee and they make their living by basically taking these fees so they're basically piggybacking on the entrepreneurship industry and saying like we are helping you guys become better which is a fascinating and take and there could be a role for that if they are indeed making entrepreneurs better but it seems like there's this we actually see entrepreneurship quality as you say declining and so yeah so yeah go ahead yeah so i mean i think it's like in a gold rush right it's always good to sell shovels and you need somebody to sell shovels yeah right you do for sure otherwise there will be no digging the thing about the entrepreneurship industry i mean there's we don't know a whole lot about this from research but what we do know suggests that what entrepreneurship industry actors mainly do is to increase confidence they increase people's confidence in their ability to put entrepreneurs so they enter right we can see that if you consume more goods from the entrepreneurship industry you tend to become an entrepreneur at higher rates right but the performance of those ventures that consume the most goods from the entrepreneurship industry tends to be lower wow that is really interesting so you're getting people who sort of you're encouraging people to join and that's successful they're successful at that but it's maybe not so successful or it's demonstrably not as successful at getting them to succeed and in fact maybe it's encouraging people to go into the entrepreneurship industry who maybe should not maybe should not be going into it who at least or maybe the way to say it is that it's building up confidence more than it's building up competence that's a great way to say that that might be a way to say it right and one thing you talk talk about is like also entrepreneurs part of this new thing is it's not entrepreneurship necessarily as you know a job as much as it is an identity and the way you get that identity is by buying stuff instead of doing like it used to maybe you would think that you'd become an entrepreneurship by doing but actually there's some people are trying to become entrepreneurs almost by buying i think that's the right so a couple of things going on i think the the fact that we have have this celebration of entrepreneurs right i mean that i think that's uncontroversial that entrepreneurship is one of the most celebrated things you can probably do right and entrepreneurs are some of the most celebrated actors in the economy that makes it possible to benefit from entrepreneurship simply by being an entrepreneur like with like having a company sort of get you into into good company so to speak so that it's it's infinitely better to tell your parents that you are working on your startup than it is to have work as a barista which might actually pay you more because the entrepreneurship thing could actually pay you nothing right and so that's one thing the other thing is that because there is an entrepreneurship industry that provides goods and services it becomes possible to consume those goods and services to do things that are similar to what you might call real entrepreneurs right i said scare quotes right yeah you can consume your way into an entrepreneurial identity because we have somehow separated the being an entrepreneur from the success of the endeavor right right and that makes a lot of sense actually like that's not unreasonable because right success in entrepreneurship is just incredibly unlikely it is rare right that is one thing that we know for like a real fact in social science it's really rare and so to say that you can only be an entrepreneur if you're successful would make no sense because then there'd be a huge category of people who would basically like lack a category so so that makes some sense but that at the same time becomes an excuse for something which is more insidious and that is that you can basically be in this consumption practice and that can make you an entrepreneur and that is useless to the economy i mean there's nothing useful going on there other than you're just spending money on things that aren't necessarily making you do anything right because you're just consu it's just a consumption at that point yeah yeah the short answer is that it's totally unproductive right i mean the the term the blending entrepreneurship some people might have had econ classes where they've where they've heard about the veteran goods which is basically the technical jargon for luxury goods things that get more desirable the more expensive they get so oysters champagne cars racehorses stuff like that right yeah so there's a way in which because people don't use it for the right nobody really likes oysters right but people like the social signaling that eating expensive oysters can give them so the fact that this thing is expensive is part of the value right the functional value is unimportant and that's some of the idea it's a social signaling that that is valuable to people it's not the it's not the value that the company produces and that's so interesting because a lot of what i see there are valuations for certain courses masterminds you know these coaching calls that their their their cost seems to have nothing to do with any kind of objective objective metric it's like oh how much is your mastermind i'd believe them just as much if they said 2500 as 2500 000. sorry not 2500 250 000. because of the fact and i've heard both by the way from different people i was on a clubhouse room last night where this hypnotist was telling us that he charges 300 000 for coaching and it was just it's just ridiculous you're just thinking who would buy this but what you're saying is that there's a whole type of person who like they sort of see oh the more it costs the more i can signal that i'm the type of person who can afford these kind of things therefore i must sort of be a big deal in a way that you'd buy a super expensive rolex even if you don't really like watches because it's more about signaling that you sort of have the thing right yes yeah that's where the value comes from right and what we're saying is that there are people who become entrepreneurs who might have a sense that they are not going to be who have a sense that they might not be particularly likely to create enormous value but who will still benefit from being just in the category i mean most people know that one does not just start a biotech company right but one can be an entrepreneur you just need basically a pitch deck and you can kind of say that you're starting a biotech company right we saw that with theranose we saw somebody just start a biotech company and we saw you know the the hype bubble form around it where people just go oh well this must be the next big thing because they're excited meanwhile all the scientists are saying there's no way there's just no way and everybody else in silicon valley is like elizabeth holmes you're doing such a good job and i and that's we're sort of parodying the idea but it is true that there is sort of a an encouragement at all costs positivity of at all costs of this kind of field and like you said rightfully so sometimes because there's so much failure that's faced that's sort of is maybe the initial impetus but at the end of your paper you say there might be a good reason to discourage people out of entrepreneurship what did you mean by that okay so some of the uncertainty that surrounds entrepreneurship you can't get around right it was not obvious that there was a business to be built on renting out spare rooms in your house right and yet airbnb became a thing right there there was uncertainty that you couldn't sort of reduce without trying so what i would suggest is that we start right a lot of the hoo-ha celebration of entrepreneurship that you also mentioned sort of says just go and try it right so i think as especially as entrepreneurship educators we should maybe say you know you really need to know that there's a downside to this you really need to know that success is very unlikely so we should so in that that alone should sort of make you say maybe you shouldn't do it once though i mean but still people will have ideas that it's hard to gauge whether they are valuable or not and it's hard to gauge whether people will be capable or incapable of executing them right right there are situations where you won't know and so i think the approach there is to say okay maybe it's worth trying but then set up and this is not my idea this is from a team out of bocconi university in in milan we're saying maybe we should start thinking about entrepreneurship is something we engage in through critical experiments where we try to disprove our idea right instead of saying let me take this idea and see if i can make it work right you should do experiments and sort of prove out that the idea does not work and if it turns out the idea does not work you should get out of it so sort of flipping the burden of evidence around instead of saying let me prove that this is great right assume that the idea is not good work as hard as you can to make it good and then do an experiment to test out whether you should just abandon and here's why that's really important because one of the things that is the real challenge of entrepreneurship is that part of what's lionized is going through the valley of death of like this idea is not working right the problem with that is you have no idea of whether that valley of death has any kind of meaningful issue for your for your company so you have people who are sort of persisting in their failure and going oh this is what an entrepreneur goes goes through when maybe they should persist but more than likely in a lot of these cases they should exit once they've like kind of gotten their minimal viable product they realize there's no audience for this no no consumers get out so i do appreciate you really saying that and because we want to give people who are hungry for you know they're thinking about becoming an entrepreneur or whatever the best tools for doing that in a way that's meaningful what i always tell people is you should know the statistics it shouldn't discourage you from doing it but you need to know what the real odds are now you let's talk about the cost of entrepreneurship real quick yeah i think this is actually underappreciated the fact that that there are so many costs to entrepreneurship so just sort of the baseline one right i hear a lot of students saying it'll be great for my cv to be an entrepreneur and i and actually the evidence is quite the opposite it's actually not easier to get a job when you have entrepreneurial experience it's the opposite it's harder right and there are lots of reasons for that that have to do with organizations often wanting people to be specialized right and i would say also if i was an organization i probably wouldn't want somebody who was a specialist in failing and very comfortable with failing i want people who didn't take huge risk right that's one part the other part is that people who become entrepreneurs actually have lower lifetime earnings than than people who who have like steady wage employment you are blowing my audience's mind right now by the way yeah okay so this is underappreciated fact and the same actually goes for working in a startup working in a startup does not lead to higher lifetime earnings and stephen i mean we can put the links to the to the data for this in the show notes please let's do that because that's actually that's actually a real thing right your earnings are generally lower whether you are an entrepreneur or whether you whether you just work in a startup because the big because by the way i want to be clear the big idea is in a lot of these cases is hey the man the nine to five's holding you down you need to escape the rat race by becoming an entrepreneur you need to escape that live the lifestyle you are meant for with yachts champagne and lamborghinis by going to become an entrepreneurship and you know what's going to help you my whether it be a course or whatever form of entrepreneur help the entrepreneur help and they get people in the people aren't successful and either they quit and they go back to their job just sort of works for the where or they just like persist and they keep beating their head against the same wall and maybe go buy a bunch of other products so i do think this is so important for people to hear yeah i mean it's one of these things right we know that not to be like super technical but the distribution of entrepreneurial outcomes is such that the average doesn't actually tell you anything because all the gains from or not all the gains but most of the gains are concentrated in a very few super winners right and lots of people who are just getting zero right the economics of this are a little bit like professional sports or music right there are some people who take down take home all the earnings and lots of people who don't right so average is not particularly informative yeah if you take the average between myself and jeff bezos we both have an income of you know a billion dollar net worth that means nothing for me right and that's that's your point very true okay so there are more costs that i think are worth mentioning go ahead right it was the bad news that's the bad news before you do good yeah also it seemed it seems to be the case that entrepreneurs take more anti-depressants and psychoactive drugs right not in the illicit sense but in the i understand clinical like yeah yeah because because entrepreneurship is incredibly stressful right if you were prone to depression anxiety things like that it gets worse and if you weren't prone there's a good chance that it can push you over the edge often the uncertainty and insecurity that comes with being an entrepreneur if you're not particularly successful and the anxiety that comes with it if you are right because you have employees who you're responsible to it actually takes quite a strong toll on people's private lives as well so divorce rates are higher for instance and sort of probably just like relational strain all around right and you can see how this can be sort of compounded when when we're dealing with not just failed innovation-driven entrepreneurship but this sort of entrepreneur thing right because there's some sort of right you can imagine how your partner who might be supportive of you trying something and being very sincere about it might you know might support you as you're trying to build something additional not fail just not succeeding but if your partner is seeing through this right and seeing that this is just identity work you can imagine how that strain gets stronger and you can imagine how once you start reflecting once you've had a straight streak of failure and you see yourself as an entrepreneur the psychological trauma can be sort of quite a lot stronger and actually some of the depressing but interesting commentary on the paper after it came out has been from people saying like i wasn't i was a blind entrepreneur and it hurt me right so some pretty heart-wrenching essays that i've been reading on that guys in the comments please put if you were a entrepreneur say ah raise your hand say i was a entrepreneur we want to know so go ahead so basically those are sort of the big things right we'll we'll be testing this out of course more empirically over the coming years but the facts of of the matter are that entrepreneurship is a it's not a great profession right it's it is sort of like trying to become a rock star nba player right it's very unlikely to succeed lots of downside risk yeah and most people ignore the downside risk because there's this incredible lionization of the entrepreneurship life right you've got just the constant bombardment of successful people and you almost never hear from the people who don't succeed because they are by definition sort of excluded out from the success magazine and so you think to yourself well wow look it looks pretty great looks pretty awesome to be an entrepreneur and i really appreciate you saying that also people should go look up i mean a lot of entrepreneurs even people that everyone thinks of as like the most inspirational like people think like elon musk the goat you know all that kind of stuff he's the guy who's saying hey unless you like chewing glass maybe don't be an entrepreneur i mean like i think he said something like to that effect like it's really really really tough and he's right about that and even then right i mean even if you look at really successful companies it becomes quite obvious that the fact that they were successful of course it has something to do with them having some talent of course but they also got lucky right if you look into the story of twitch for instance pretty obvious that i mean it was not like twitch was meant to be a great success from day one yeah it started as justin.tv right yes i'm interviewing i'm interviewing that the the founder soon oh great fabulous do you have anything to say no i mean it's just like i mean they were obviously able to recognize an opportunity when it came yeah but they recognized a lot of opportunities that weren't really good opportunities and i think you know not like they did great right but they were lucky also to in some respects i think probably he will be the first to say that i mean enormously because you had to sort of be the guy catching the wave of live streaming sort of and there's no way he probably fully understood what that meant or could have foreseen some you know amazon buyout in his future but yeah i think so that's a really great point is that of course luck is involved and a huge hugely involved let's talk about like one final thing honestly i love this i love it okay so one final thing right is that people think that young people are good entrepreneurs actually and that's blatantly not true actually i just want to sort of insert that because now we were talking about twitch and you were mentioning some like elon musk and these all were successful when they were young right and a lot of the the cast of characters are the same right mark zuckerberg was very young dropped out of school actually there's really good evidence to suggest that the most successful founders are in their 40s you're right 45 seems to be the good age to do it and that makes a lot of sense right it does basically the because that's the point where you actually have some experience right you actually know what it's like to work in a company you might have managerial experience you might know an industry that you're entering there's sort of this hype around young people being successful and that sometimes you'll hear people saying oh you don't need industry experience to succeed in an industry it's actually an asset to not know anything but it's actually good evidence also on this that if you enter an industry with no experience as an entrepreneur your chances of succeeding are very low yeah of course right of course of course right of course and the way to think about it probably is that the people who become successful when they're really young would probably also have been successful when they were older right so the fact that they become successful at young age is because they're just incredibly talented and lucky right they would have been successful at other points in time too most of us need some time to get going to know what we're doing right i think that's so unbelievably important to mention is that first of all it makes so much sense i'm glad you're just giving us the data on you know success success and entrepreneurship because i think there is a huge misunderstanding and i've had this in my mind i don't think i formally held it but it's sort of mythologized in our culture to where a lot of people feel this way even if they don't consciously hold this that yeah young people are entrepreneurs that's what you do like if you want to be an entrepreneur you start young right you get the you get the failures out of the way i've definitely probably internalized that and there is an idea too that you don't need domain expertise this is a big idea that you can just sort of be elizabeth holmes and you can just walk into blood technology and you can just innovate because that's what silicon valley does explain to us why we need domain expertise i mean i get that it's a bit obvious but maybe we should just you should just explain well i mean again it depends on the industry right but i mean very often being able to even understand the technology in a given field right will will be very important understanding the business models that underpin a given field is going to be very important very often being able to understand the right people to hire will often be very important and be able to engage in the networks and in the industry culture will often be very important as well right i mean you're trying to compete for the same customers right so having industry experience will often let you understand the customers that you're going to be dealing with right or very often we find that people right they've worked in a given industry construction for instance and then they develop an innovation that they're going to sell to construction companies right because doing their work they identify a problem and they come up with a solution for it that they then sell to their own company and and companies like it right so industry experience is going to let you know what are actually the problems in an industry and all of that is going to be generated and it's going to help you not just get good ideas it's also going to help you sort bad ideas from good ideas so finding out what are the low value things is things that are never going to fly so what you're telling people is it can help to get that industry experience first because you're now making money instead of just like floating and probably losing money you can do that you can gain industry experience you can identify a need you can gain that domain expertise you identify need once you have that domain expertise and then you launch a company later in your life when you're actually more likely to succeed due to your now you have experience plus at that point you will maybe be in a different place financially yes which can also be very important like one of the things that i find really depressing is that venture capital will often say that before you ask for venture capital you should do a friends and family round right which basically means you should ask your parents for money or your friends right it's a very nice way of saying when when when you're young you're going to be asking your parents for money right and sometimes parents will do that right but often like if you're not coming out of very wealthy family they will be giving you their life earnings right for your idea and you can easily imagine how that really is going to strain relationships if you don't succeed right there's a real social downside to that and the fact is if you wait until later chances are that you will have friends who friends who actually have money right and who understand the industry and can help you not just with money but also with other things it also pains me when people like borrow against their house or something like that right to persist in adventure it's very painful right as sort of a precautionary principle i would if you know that entrepreneurship is really risky right you should think about it like buying lottery tickets you should only bet with house money so to speak you should only pay with money that you can avoid to that you can that you don't mind losing yeah and you should definitely set hard stops for yourself this is digging yeah yeah you can keep digging and keep squeezing out more right and and but if you know that entrepreneur entrepreneurial success is really unlikely you wouldn't do that you'd be if you knew that success was rare you would treat it and if you knew that it was like essentially buying a lottery ticket right you would treat it differently than if you thought that success was just around the corner and so that's one of the things that i would sort of push people for right know that it's not very likely to succeed and treat it as such let's talk about entrepreneurship advice there's this huge entrepreneurship entrepreneur industry which is just like constantly bombarding people with entrepreneurship advice the blueprint to success as it were that's this words i hear a lot i'm sure that's not an academic term the blueprint for success but it does happen all the time now one thing that drives me crazy to no end is that a lot of these things can be true but sort of not helpful or like sometimes true but not always true how do you under very specific circumstances right how do you see entrepreneurship advice helping and hurting people with regards to this sort of entrepreneur identity that people are cultivating okay so in a couple of different ways right i think it's worth just sort of underscoring that point right that a lot of the advice you get seems really sensible sometimes counterintuitive but sensible sometimes right let's give some of that advice yeah so for instance you should really get comfortable with failure right that's like very generic right yeah something surrounding like the minimal viable product for instance right you should this idea that you should just like try to get something together put it in front of customers accept that it's not very good and try to learn from the experience right other advice like just pitch pitch pitch right just don't take no for an answer try your idea with many many investors if they don't give you money keep going now all those things i think can seem reasonable right and it seems to be the case that successful you can find successful companies that have done that right you can also find lots of successful companies that didn't do that you can find successful companies that did do it but that wasn't the reason that they succeeded you can find lots of unsuccessful companies that did it right that did something similar so if you take something like the minimal bible product right there's a way in which telling people just like try to get some together put it in front of customers if they don't like it right i mean i think it's the reid hoffman of linkedin has this idea that if you're not ashamed of the first version of your product you're doing it wrong i think it's important to keep in mind that failure is never good sometimes you need to build up a certain tolerance for failure to take risk right but failure is never good it's it's we should say just to be clear it's not good in of itself i mean i think a lot of times it's lionized because the examples people are using are successes that are failures that led to future successes but people can conflate that with like oh it means that when i'm failing this is like a sign of my success and i'm doing something right right that's one thing the other thing is like the pitch to investors right and keep pitching if they don't accept your idea right well you know there's a way to think about getting rejected by investors which is that maybe your idea is just bad right maybe maybe that is experience and good judgment telling you that this is not the way to go right and maybe persisting right there are companies that persist and succeed but there are also lots of companies that persist and don't succeed i think that's sort of important to keep in mind that you sometimes you need to take no for an answer because it's because that is information that you're doing something wrong i think generally like the whole normalization of failure it's actually part of why you can keep people in ventures that are not doing well right saying that failure is part of the recipe and they just need to wait that success is around the corner i think that is it's a really counterintuitive way for most people to think and it's good that it's counterintuitive you should be more sort of concise about what you mean when you say that failure is good yeah i think the the tricky thing is is that for some people that really is how they succeed is they just keep failing and they get they sort of accumulate experience through failure and i think that's the that's the kind of meaning behind when people say this but what you're saying is yes but there are a lot of people who take that advice which might be good in a corner case or in a case of you know this person over here for reed hoffman it might be good with his minimum viable embarrassing product but it could be really bad for a lot of other entrepreneurs and you should be smart about taking that advice or sort of like holding it very loosely that type of advice yes you should definitely you should definitely think about how how far am i willing to go and i think you should commit to that for the fact this is the amount of time that i will spend trying to get this to work because people are going to have different circumstances that allow them to take more or less risk and it's easy to sort of get pulled in this is what economists sometimes call the sunk cost fallacy right or if i spent a year on it i might as well spend another month right and i think that's definitely worth considering and i mean some of the advice is much more technically we call it contingent than than it's given credit for right might work but it might also just not work at all and and being smart about when that advice is going to apply is very difficult and i think and and the basic problem is this i think people pursue right people go to ask for advice because they don't know what to do right so they have a very dif so if you knew how to gauge the value of the advice you wouldn't be asking the advice very often so by definition when you get the advice you are sort of hard to know it's very hard to know if it's good advice when you get it because if you knew whether it was good advice you wouldn't need good advice that's hilarious so i think it's very worthwhile to sort of trying to separate yourself right the basic thing that you should probably do i think is to say how much time and how much money am i willing to invest in this correct and commit to that right and say it might be that success is just around the corner but i don't know if i can wait that long right that's one thing and then the other thing is to definitely do some work to separate oneself from the hype to say okay it i don't care if it worked for facebook or linkedin or whatever what are the chances that this might work for me and then treat your ideas something that you're trying to prove out that it won't work so that you can get out right prove out that this is too good of an opportunity to to not abandon right right i think that's the way you think about it and don't be afraid to pick up some industry experience before you jump into your you know your big idea i know every idea seems like it's pressing and it has to be done right now but i think you made a really compelling argument to maybe hold off a bit get some get some real world experience before you go launch your entrepreneurship career and i mean like not every idea is worth dropping out of school for right and there's a big difference between dropping out of school because you think it's too easy right if you're mark zuckerberg and leaving harvard because you think it's too easy that's very different from dropping out of pretty much any other school because it's not quite relevant yeah that's very different and that's a very different sort of information you're getting about your potential and to be very clear no no absolutely and to be super clear you can look at the outcomes of people with degrees and especially like iv educated degrees and you can look at the difference between that and people who have dropped out on the list of billionaires mo 30 like 30 millionaires and up it is just overwhelmingly dominated by people who have you know sunk a bunch of time into their education regardless of whether you think education's overpriced or not yes it probably is but it's also underutilized i think if you sort of have the willingness and the drive to become an entrepreneur and to work as hard as some people are for that i think there's a way to get much more out of college than most people do but that's a separate discussion but sure i think that's interesting underutilized prop probably you mean in the sense of how you're using the resource right how are you using the access to people who know something how you're using the access to networks how you're using the access to information i mean because there's no shortage of people going to college and you know but and just kind of benefiting as much as they could yes yes not bringing as much attention you know what i think there needs to be a paper about the veblenia veblenian college student because there's certainly like an identity class of like oh i'm just you know going to school that's a separate discussion for a separate time but but absolutely yeah yeah so one of the things you shot an email about is alternative strategies for people you talked about joshua gans we talked about that yet at mit we have it joshua ganz is at toronto and and has done some interesting work with with scott stern at mit and they basically have a whole series of papers about you can actually get the book for free it's online if you search for entrepreneurial strategy you will be taken to the website and you get the book for free it's it's a really good book highly recommended one of the reasons i mentioned that in our pre pre-discussion was that you know people sometimes have the impression that disruption is the way to be an entrepreneur right disruption is one of these things right you should really go after challenging industries upsetting the incumbents things like that i recommend that book because it's so helpful for thinking about different strategies and often less risky strategies to pursue with ideas right there are going to be cases where disruption is probably the right path for an entrepreneur to take but there are often alternative strategies that are worth considering and testing out that will like disruption is probably like the most risky thing you could do right right you're trying to change you're trying to fundamentally change an industry unseat incumbents and like established firms like trying to take down blockbuster ford whichever like name your industry incumbent right and very often that is going to be a an incredibly risky strategy for all kinds of obvious reasons their work is interesting i think because it can probably help people think about the value of doing some things that are less risky but nonetheless that are going to be lucrative and interesting for many people especially if you have industry experience they're going to there are ways to think about any given idea in more or less risky ways do you think there's a the reason that we only think largely of you know i guess being an entrepreneur in terms of disruption because of the fact that all of the cases that a lot of people immediately think of when they think of like entrepreneur they think of recent examples where you had this emerging technology that really changed everything and it made disruption very easily possible for you know some industries and so you had these like monsters come out like facebook tesla all these companies which it's like so we always think of those because those are the most you know the biggest examples but maybe the most common example the examples that actually are bearing out for a lot of people are not the disruptive cases and that's maybe what you're saying exactly the thing like lots of people will or lots of entrepreneurial companies will be faced with the choice of whether to do something that is disruptive and high risk or maybe something that is not quite as disruptive more oriented towards what their book calls value chain strategies we're basically trying to help other companies do well and succeed right that often is something that works best if you actually have industry experience as we talked about before because you know the organization's in an industry and you can say what are the pain points and how can i sort of try to solve those in an interesting way so i'd highly recommend that for most people sort of just broaden if you want to be an entrepreneur if you if that is for you right and if you're comfortable with all the risk and all the downsides that we've talked about right i definitely encourage people to read that as sort of a way to broaden their imagination about how you can be an entrepreneur because there are many many more ways to do it and the silicon valley model is just one and it's not going to be the right one for lots of people it's definitely a very risky one i think that's so important and one thing i want to remind the audience of is that neither myself nor dr hartman are against entrepreneurs no no quite the contrary this is about getting people to have better outcomes by thinking more critically about being an entrepreneur what that means because what your your paper kind of compellingly crafts a narrative for is that there's sort of a there's an entrepreneur ideology that sort of a lot of people just sort of buy into just like the disruptive idea that everyone just sort of thinks oh that's the way you start a company and of course it's just one of the many ways you could start a company there are a lot of useful ways to thinking about entrepreneurship that if you're going into it it is important to know you have to not just think you know only positive thoughts all the time you have to know the risks part of being a successful entrepreneur is understanding and hedging against risk it is so under valued sorry i don't just got a little that is excellent summary i think the and i think that's definitely very important right to really appreciate is this for me right like we we talked about this that there is being an entrepreneur has something of trying to be a professional athlete about it right right if so that for most people should be a red flag saying no i'm not going to do that if you are called to do it right then you should definitely know the ins and outs of it you should think about the different ways that you can approach this you should know about the kind of things that are really risky and the kinds of things that will get you injured and the things that will push you out of the game right yeah and that will lead you to costs that you don't want to bear i think that's really important because as you say entrepreneurship is super important but well-functioning entrepreneurship is even more important like the economy does not work without entrepreneurship we tried economies without entrepreneurship it was called the soviet union and it wasn't great right so we need entrepreneurship a lot but we also need it to work well and we need people to not be misled about what it is and the kinds of risks that are involved for sure and the realities of how to do better at entrepreneurship i mean i think the funny thing is is you're presenting us with sort of like hard data on what so many other people are promising to make you a better entrepreneur and you're telling us what entrepreneurship success looks like in the data and i think that's so important for people who are you know in the audience who are interested in that to really take to heart so i will link we will talk about a lot of the papers and the sources you cited for statistics related to success you know when you're young or when you're old we'll talk about you know education we'll have the educational strategy book linked in the show notes and also of course i will be linking the paper which i found i was such a i have cited that paper a bunch of times sort of informally on the channel and i knew i always wanted to do an interview about it because it's it holds a near and dear place to my heart but let's be clear this is a this is a theory right like this is part of academia is that you are proposing a theory to fit data that you know is happening which is like declining entrepreneur outcomes would you like to talk about that a bit a little bit like hedge a little bit what we're talking right so so i think people should read the paper actually because what we're doing is we're proposing a way that things might work right and there are different interpretations that one could make what we're suggesting is essentially a hypothesis right academic production is such that you often have what's called a conceptual paper which lays out an idea and then you have empirical studies that do that basically present data right and we're in the process of beginning those the data collection and but i'm producing different hypothesis hypothesis papers and this is one right the paper that you can find online now is not published yet so it hasn't been through peer review the peer-reviewed version will be out by summer it has been accepted for for a journal which is called this research in the sociology of organizations but that will come out and when you say a lot of when when you talk about hard data i should say this is not data that we have collected this is data from other studies just sort of to be clear yeah absolutely and the interpretation that we're offering is is also not a is not proven out by data and it's not a widely accepted view right i mean there's quite a lot of consensus that entrepreneurial quality is declining it's not a unanimously helped you but it's pretty close so that is a that is sort of a real thing the idea that the linking of the entrepreneurship ideology to the entrepreneurship industry to declining entrepreneurial quality is sort of that's that's theoretical right that's our idea and it's conjecture i think yeah yeah right so just to be clear oh no no i appreciate it i appreciate how careful you are and i think that's an important part of any kind of you know if if you're gonna be in academia that's that's part of your job right is to tell people like what's settled what's not and i appreciate you doing that dr hartman thank you so much for coming on the show i hope people got a lot of to use a loaded expression of value out of out of that i hope so too episode so i hope some more informed career choices will ensue for sure same here thank you so much thank you for the opportunity have a great day we'll see you next time i know what you need this ain't what it seems nothing but a trick trying to sell me on a dream but that was where you lost me wake up and smell the coffee
