pixel has always been a leader in smartphone innovation and we take it as a compliment when others in the industry follow our lead like the always-on display and at a glance introduced with pixel 2 and there's night sight which launched with pixel 3 and astrophotography and we introduced car crash detection three years ago pixel 7 pixel 7's pro's front camera uses our advanced machine learning models for face recognition to power face unlocked iphone 10 your iphone is locked until you look at it and it recognizes you we call this face id we're introducing cinematic blur to the pixel camera in iphone 13 brings a brand new feature cinematic mode starting at 2x super resume crops pixel 7 pro's main 50 megapixel camera using a high resolution mode to provide a 12.5 megapixel 12 megapixels of the new sensor to deliver a full resolution photo and 4k video with optical quality yeah i kind of just love how tech companies just throw subtle shots at each other on stage even though we all know at this point they're just copying each other in a giant circle till we have the same features across everything anyway today was google's event and we got our first look at impressions and our hands-on time with the google pixel 7 and pixel 7 pro and the pixel watch which is really interesting and we also got a preview of a really interesting look at the new pixel tablet so this video is everything you need to know about all that stuff so the phones there's a big phone and a small phone again the pixel 7 and the pixel 7 pro they very much look like the pixel 6 now that it's an established recognizable visor identity but this time the visor is metal instead of glass and i don't love it but i also don't hate it like i guess i was one of the few people that really got to liking the glass visor but i will say this time it is one continuous piece of metal all the way around with no seam and that is better than before and it just feels really well built but you can also see the pixel 7 visor is matte while the pixel 7 pro visor is glossy which i can already tell i'm gonna get this 7 pro covered in fingerprints also i'm just going to say i miss accented color power buttons just throwing that out there anyway no other real design surprises here but then on the inside there is an updated set of specs so there they are you can pause this if you need to but basically the bigger phone has a telephoto lens more ram and a bigger battery and a bigger higher res ltpo display that's the deal but here's something i noticed i wasn't really mentioned even out loud during the keynote which is the pixel 7 display is flat again and you can see the cut out at the top for the new ultra wide 11 megapixel selfie camera that they both share it's pretty sweet but the pixel 7 pro display curves over the edges a bit less than before it's just a subtle curve now i'm really happy to see that but then as i mentioned in the last video which was about the iphone 14 plus and benchmarks and how the big general benchmark improvements are probably going to be pretty slight i was more interested just to see features just new interesting features that they enable on these new phones right and we got some and they range from kind of cool seen that already all the way to possibly incredible so yeah i'm going to keep my eye out on the overall performance of this next generation tensor g2 chip efficiency smoothness all that but it also enables a few things a new cinematic video mode which basically appears to be doing the same thing apple's new cinematic mode does which is track subjects and artificially blur backgrounds it also enables transcribed audio messages right in the google messages app so if someone sends you a voice memo you don't have to find a place to listen to it you can just read it in text form and it makes night sight twice as fast it enables face unlock from just the new selfie camera and it should be able to do all this with 20 lower power consumption than the first tensor chip but the coolest feature to me easily is unblur is what it's called so so you have a picture that's slightly blurry you know maybe your hands were kind of shaky or it was slightly out of focus or you just had a slow shutter speed or something happened it's blurry it's soft normally you throw photo out but you don't have any other pictures of that moment and it was just too perfect and you kind of just want to save it or fix it so you can open that picture on the pixel 7 or 7 pro and you hit that button and the tensor chip goes to work and it basically fixes the picture it uses ai it recognizes subjects and sharpens things up and it does a really good job you can see a before and after here of some of the pre-loaded photos i was trying at the event and they are genuinely impressive and the cherry on top is so you have to have a pixel 7 or 7 pro to do this for now but you can do this with any picture in your entire google photos library any photo you've ever taken or even any photo you just save or have on your phone anything i can see people like remastering old polaroids or like 30 year old yearbook photos just whatever else is in your library that you want to save seems pretty cool i'm going to be testing it for the full review to see how well it actually works with non-presupplied photos but i was impressed but then really mostly other changes that were interesting about these phones came in a camera department on the pro phone so there's a new ultrawide with autofocus just on the pro phone that is 21 wider and should be able to take some pretty decent macro photos now with these focus pixels and there's a new 5x telephoto camera that's also huge 48 megapixels again and then they've worked a lot of software magic with making the in-between marks much more usable so for example the 2x button here will crop into the middle 12 megapixels of the main camera for a nice clean zoom sound familiar but then the 10x does the same thing so the 10x zoom is really just cropping into the middle 12 megapixels of the 5x telephoto camera so again hopefully a nice clean zoom and then a lot of super resume software magic and hopefully sharpening the photos of in between those numbers but there's also haptic stops in the camera ui to make it easy to hopefully hit those nice clean magic numbers and they also added a zoom preview thing for the furthest extremes of zoom like samsung did so now when you're taking those super creeper shots at like 30x it'll be nice and stable and easy to frame my biggest question is did they price these correctly because they went with the same prices as last year which is 5.99 for the small phone and 8.99 for the big one which okay it's the same i have a feeling 300 is going to feel like a big gap again like this is what we were saying last year for 300 extra dollars over the small phone you're getting bigger screen nicer battery and a telephoto camera and that's kind of it this year it feels like a tiny bit more it's screen battery and then like a whole pro camera system with a better ultrawide and a better telephoto with lots of zoom stuff but is that enough 300 i i don't know we'll see i just have a feeling that the the seven will feel like a good deal and then a 7 pro will feel like a tougher sell again but then we also finally got to see the google pixel watch this is the thing that's been kind of hyped a lot i got to spend a little less time with it but i'm very interested in reviewing this particular watch so this might be a hot take but i think they did a b-plus job on the design i think it's really nice the full circle is great it's just one size which is pretty small and very lightweight there's three colors black silver and gold and definitely doesn't look like a computer on your wrist like some others can it can be a super inconspicuous little puck of a smart watch there's just two buttons the crown which can also scroll and then a button right above it and the way the watch bands connect to the watch is pretty neat it's a little bit finicky to me at first but i suspect it just takes some getting used to and the result is just this super seamless look with no lugs where it looks like the band just kind of pops out the top and the bottom of this circle now here's why i say b plus and not a plus bezels and battery so they curve the glass right over all the edges and kept the ui mostly black which is really thoughtful because most of the time especially in lower lighting it looks like it's basically a seamless display on your wrist most of the backgrounds are black most of the ui elements look like they're designed around sort of fading in and not overlapping the edges too much and even when they do overlap they have this nice little gradient even the flashlight app has a fade all the way around so you don't really think too hard about the bezel it's smart but if you catch the light just right or maybe you're outside a lot then yeah you can see the bezel which is clearly not the smallest thing in the world okay fine but i'm actually a little bit more worried about battery life so they set on stage up to 24 hours of battery which you know knowing these companies is probably generous like that's probably maybe best case scenario without the always-on display maybe one workout and i mean this watch is truly tiny it's very compact and light like there's just no way you can have a huge battery in it but i think it's a good idea to subscribe to be among the first to see the full review when it goes live and i get a chance to really test it functionality wise though it is very much a fitbit smart watch like i think it might be more of a fitbit than a lot of people were expecting but you know smart watch wise it does all the normal stuff notifications custom watch faces google pay with wallet google maps directions google assistant to set timers play some music etc it's wear os but then it's fitbit for all the fitness stuff which there's plenty of so if you've used a fitbit you already know about the workouts and mindfulness content and health metrics and sleep tracking and a sleep score and it has some really high frequency heart rate monitoring one reading every single second but other than the specifically the heart rate monitoring stuff it uses the fitbit app for all that stuff so not google fit what happens to google fit unclear actually but the watch comes with six months of fitbit premium for free and that you just interact with all this data just like it's a fitbit so yeah it's a it's a fitbit smart watch or it's a smart watch with fitbit on top for all the fitness stuff so it's 349 for the wi-fi only and 400 for cellular so that means it's more expensive than the apple watch se it's more expensive than the samsung galaxy watch 5. interesting let me know which one of those smart watches you would consider for that money but lastly we did get a preview of the tablet another one but this time it did it was basically just one one really cool feature which is that it docks to a magnetic speaker dock and becomes basically a nest hub max and i think this is brilliant most tablets are just like around the house most of the time and google knows this so they just built the ultimate house tablet i guess i do think though that this is a bit of a clue that this isn't going to be a super high-end like ipad pro galaxy tab pro super crazy premium like tablet this is this is definitely not competing with those like this thing will have a 10 inch screen single camera white bezels it's like this thing's designed for the 80 of tablets that just sit around the house and don't do too much like not the top few percent that are doing peak performance and productivity and media stuff i'm guessing and this is pure speculation and you can quote this i'm going to guess that this will be a 4.99 tablet like that's how i see this and then you'll buy the doc extra but we'll come back to this clip and see if i was right but yeah stay tuned for the reviews happy techtober thanks for watching this one and i'll catch you guys later peace [music]
