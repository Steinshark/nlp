let me tell you something about me i love using smaller phones like the galaxy s 10 but you probably never actually caught me switching to one i really like being able to properly grip the device being able to access most of the screen with one finger and being able to put it in my pocket without feeling like i'm trying to lug a book around in there but there's one thing that stops me from doing this it's a fact that smaller phones have much smaller batteries and that kind of sucks but let me explain why it's a really fixable problem so let's take the galaxy s 10 as an example the battery inside takes up about 25% to the available space 1/4 but you can tell straight away looking inside this thing what the design philosophy was something has tried to build a smart phone that's as thin as possible whilst being good enough at everything you can see all the components here are jam-packed together and it's needed so that they can fit everything from the triple cameras to the headphone jack as well as all the rubber elements that give it water resistance on one hand this doesn't leave much room for the battery hence why we're left with a pretty mediocre three thousand four hundred million power cell but what it also means the flip side of this is that if they built a slightly thicker phone and used all of that extra space for battery the results would be incredible let me give you an example so what i'm drawing out right now is our visualization of a smart phone we're gonna split it into four quadrants or four equal parts and a quarter is going to be battery because like we said about 25% of the phone is battery no let's say we made that phone a thicker and all of the extra space we're adding on top of it is just going to be battery what you'd find is that because battery was only taking up one of the four quadrants in the phone originally but at the same time we'll be taking up all four quadrants of this extension we're adding for each part we're extending the phone we're raising the amount of battery by four times the normal amount and so if you increased the smartphone's thickness by just 10 percent you could increase battery capacity by 40 percent and by implication if you increased it by 20 percent your battery could be 80 percent larger so instead of trying to fit everything into a seven point eight millimeter body let's just say we give this phone another 15 percent of depth and we used all of it for battery we'd end up with advice that has eight point nine seven mmm of total thickness about 195 grams of mass but more importantly a 5,000 440 million power battery now i get it those dimensions may sound unwieldy but we've got a phone right here the nokia 2.2 this is 9.3 millimeters thick and it doesn't feel too chunky in terms of the weight you've got phones like the 1 + 7 pro this thing weighs 206 grams and even though this is a heavy phone it's bigger problem comes from its other dimensions not really its weight okay let me actually give you another example so this right here is the galaxy s 10 5g and if we added another millimeter on to the phone's width you could expect about 200 million powers of extra battery capacity but if we added the same amount if we added one millimeter on to the depth of the phone you could expect about 2,000 you see length and width are dimensions that are already being taken good advantage of but the depth of phones really isn't now i'm not sure i'd want a firm that's already this big to be thicker but i would definitely want to be able to use smaller screen phones without having to dismiss them because i know they won't last plus extra battery life is about much more than just not needing to charge your phone overnight the galaxy s 10 has this incredible feature in that it can reverse wireless charge other devices but the ironic part of that is that it doesn't have enough capacity in itself that you ever really have any spare jumping from three thousand four hundred million powers to five thousand four hundred and forty is enough to move your phone from being be reliant gadget to becoming the reliable gadget enough to change it from that device that you should probably also keep a powerbank width to the phone there is a power bank the one that you can comfortably use and use to keep your earphones charged and used as a hotspot for your laptop not to mention a larger battery means a small phone that you can keep for longer without it becoming unusable okay or to put this whole thing another way how many times you hear people complaining that their phone's battery dies too fast versus how many times you hear people complaining that they wish their phone was a millimeter slimmer now i say this but there's a distinct reason why companies don't just start making their phones like this and it has nothing to do with what's best for the consumer when an average techy person goes into a store to buy phone there's a few factors they consider the top priority is almost always price then software is android or is an iphone and then we have design and display battery capacity is notably absent and my best guess why would be because it's seen as too complicated a specification and that is just easier to tell people yeah it'll last all day and so battery is one of those things that flies under the radar because it's not usually an issue in the first couple of months with a phone but because batteries deteriorate over time it's almost always one of the biggest issues a couple of years in people often just attribute it to my phones getting old i should probably get an upgrade as opposed to this company should have put a battery and there is still workable a couple of years later and so this attitude plays to the advantage of smartphone makers and they've got no reason to change it let's take one plus one plus is generally really good at keeping even their older phones up to date the oneplus 3 from early 2016 is still getting their latest android pi update and so if i'm using one of those phones it's got decent hardware it's still getting the latest features i've got very little incentive to fork out seven hundred for their latest and greatest unless my battery starts failing which as things stand it will because it's coupling a small three thousand milliamp hour cell with a unibody design that makes it pretty tricky for an average consumer to replace the battery the phone is designed to fail as are 90% of smart phones out there also it's true that you can't just make a phone thicker and then create some squiggly battery that fills all the remaining gaps you would have to rethink the internal structure but if that's factored in when a phone is being planned then it's not really an issue on top of this extra space inside a phone isn't just about battery even if a company didn't want to squeeze a ton of extra juice in there they could add a headphone jack to a phone that doesn't already have one they could add a heatsink or just room around components for better airflow and temperatures or they could use the extra space to fit more powerful telephoto cameras as opposed to the standard to time zoom that you see on almost every flagship in fact even if they did nothing with that extra space a thicker device is less likely to bend or deform if you enjoyed this
