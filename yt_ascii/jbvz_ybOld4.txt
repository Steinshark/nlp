ladies and gentlemen the game of chess has absolutely exploded and there are many ways that you can enjoy it online you can play against bots you can play against people you can enjoy some youtube content instructional or goofy we can watch 400 elo chess we can watch the best players in the world play chess we can also watch the best bots in the world go head to head you see in the chess world there is something called t-sec i always forget what it stands for tcec and it's essentially the computer chess championship of the world and the two best computers in the world are stockfish and leela now in today's video i will share with you a game that they play they play a hundred games against each other in the recent edition of the finals if you want me to make a video covering all the best games of that match i will but in today's video i'm gonna show you the two best bots in the world playing probably the most insane opening that exists yes very good the london system you're so smart he's so clever no the best bots in the world playing the craziest opening to exist which is the king's gambit the king's gambit is absolutely nuts because you are giving away a pawn and you're opening up your king to a check i mean it literally is the most dangerous gambit there is no gambit that is more dangerous than this now you may ask yourself why are the best bots in the world playing this opening why are they not playing you know knight f3 knight c6 and the spanish well they do the thing is if you just let two thirty six hundred elo bots play they would draw every game and the chess world has not gotten to a point where we are succumbing to our ai overlords in fact in the chess world we mess around with the ai to make it play against each other in a way that we want and so what we do is we make them play openings against each other with white and black now we made them play a game of the king's gambit the best way to play against the king's gambit is to accept it because you have queen h4 check and now most people play the move knight f3 not here we made the bots play knight c3 which is a real opening and after queen h4 check white actually plays king e2 and then tries to play knight f3 and basically says yeah i mean i've put my king here but it's fine so in this game that's exactly what happened just in a different move order d5 black tries to win time here trying to make one of white's pieces capture to open up the lines knight takes queen h4 check king to e2 and now the bots are on their own this is a real opening we we made the bots play this position against each other and good lord it did not disappoint now of course you don't need to play like this and and this is being a bit laggy because this fi this game file is extremely populated with annotation so please excuse if if it's a little bit laggy on your screen knight c3 is not the move you have to play i mean if you're gonna play the kings game but i would recommend playing knight f3 but this is what we have bishop g4 check and now we have knight f3 and white is safe for now white is safe for you know for for the time being black plays knight c6 and you may be asking yourself isn't that just a fork and the answer is yes you see black could have played the move bishop d6 and defended against the fork but then white would have played d4 and then if black played something like knight c6 then white would have gotten a very very powerful center and black of course could have castle that it would have been very complicated and then you know what the top engine move here is it's king d3 which is some dang stuff the point is that the queen is hanging now that the pin is gone so the queen probably has to move and then the king would have walked to c2 and actually bishop d3 and white is completely safe that would have been fun but that didn't happen instead we have knight c6 and white is able to just win a rook in a pawn for absolutely nothing this is some wild stuff you leave two bots to figure out an argument some crazy stuff is happening now 94 check is possible but it's a bad move because the king runs out and as we just saw white wants to hide the king on c2 so what does black do black plays knight e5 knight e5 is completely ridiculous because what it does is it prevents the king from running away and threatens knight takes f3 you might say so what then g takes f3 well it's bad because actually this is possible and the point is that now the queen is able to drop back and you're gonna lose the queen and you might be leela chess zero you ain't winning this position so d4 is not possible the knight on e5 is actually threatening to take and take and then play queen h5 which means white has really only one move here and that's this white needs to offer a trade of queens if black takes white is completely winning but black is obviously not going to do that black is going to go knight takes f3 and now that hits the queen and it defends the queen and white has to take the queen why because i just showed you why bishop f3 but it's a slightly different thing there is no queen there but the king now is being deflected from the defense of the i mean this is some crazy stuff right knight f3 queen h4 knight h4 king e1 what the heck is going on white is up three points of material but according to the computer is losing although this computer is basically a weaker version of that computer so i don't know now why does up three points of material but it's kind of trapped in the corner so if you're up three points of material but your three points of material is trapped in the corner of the board are you really up three points of material i don't know i'm asking you also all of white's pieces are stuck in the back rank black here plays g5 which is the top engine move stockfish giving stockfish the blessing of playing the top engine move g5 has a couple of ideas number one it's trying to feed and kettle the bishop number two it's stabilizing the position here and taking space away from white so white cannot easily break out white in the white you can guess what white's best move here is by the way white has a bunch of pieces what is white's best move of course a4 what well it's gonna be really difficult for white to develop any pieces and if white moves anything things get weak so white is just gonna go try to rescue the knight and also white is going to try to develop from the side of the board somehow black now plays knight f6 which is a very natural move white plays e5 perhaps the two most logical moves of the entire game white did not play the move d3 because that would have blocked the bishop and then black would have walked over and taken the knight so instead white tries to play e5 in the interest of time black plays f3 [laughter] what why would you not move the knight knight e4 or maybe knight to d7 attacking the pawn time is of the essence and stockfish plays f3 completely disregarding the attack on the knight the point is that white probably has to take this excuse me excuse me white probably has to take this because this is impossible knight takes f3 is of work picking up the pawn and black is just in great shape and white cannot play the move g3 because then f2 with tempo knight e4 with tempo and also bishop c5 with tempo and yeah this is slaughter i mean this is just brutalization here knight g1 discover check all right i mean knight e4 bishop f2 is mate look at this look at this position white has every piece on a home square there is a random knight here being an imposter that knight is not a white knight that's a black knight and bishop f2 is mate this is brutal stuff so e takes f6 bit okay i'm pretty sure the move f3 was played in order to play f takes g2 and yet the computer is such a scumbag it plays bishop d6 do you know why it plays bishop d6 because in chess the two most important ways to evaluate who's better in a position are material and king safety and right now white's king ain't safe white's king ain't safe and none of these pieces are equipped to defend it bishop e2 i just take the rooks are trapped in the corner and the knight is not possible to move in the bishop can't move white cannot move any piece white is on the verge of losing if white plays g takes f3 in this position i play bishop f3 if you try to save the rook i play rookie 8 check i play bishop c5 at the very least i'm getting my rook back and your king is stuck in the net i'll probably mate you at some point in the future if not i'll take all your pieces so the only way to save the king the only way to save the king sometimes the king needs to stop being a beta and stand up for himself he's gotta run the kings just gotta go alright king to f2 black plays rookie eight cutting off the circulation the king's only move is now king to g1 but now pawn takes f3 why now because after bishop takes f3 i just showed you rook g1 is not possible but you're not gonna go rook g1 are you no you're gonna start fighting back sometimes the safety of your position necessitates some sacrifice bishop c4 the rook is gone the rook will perish but in the time that it takes black to take the rook you will get all your pieces out bishop takes h1 now pawn to d4 white has an active bishop white has a second active bishop white is about to have an active rook in just a couple of moves for the cost of the material that you were up you have given it back you haven't gotten a good roi but you you haven't lost that much money all right which nowadays is a big win because the economy was pretty crazy in 2021 black plays h6 defending against the movement of the bishop now white is unable to play bishop takes g5 because of pawn takes g5 so instead of that in this position leela chess plays bishop takes g5 anyway because screw your logic bishop takes g5 is just trying to get the rook to take this now black can take a black can try to escape but it ain't gonna work because i'll take the knight so we have this this white is still up two points of material if you count the pawns white has one two three four five six pawns black only has four in fact black is about to have three however the knight is still trapped on the edge of the board rook e4 bishop takes f7 rook takes d4 king to e3 now you might be asking isn't that a free pawn i might be answering yes it's an absolute free pawn however white's idea computers are so ridiculous in chess black plays this by the way why because the rook is better on its active position it's better for black to go after this pawn and keep the rook active because if you take this pawn immediately i seal you out you are now not getting back into this game king d3 and i'm gonna build a wall so your rook doesn't get in rook a5 is possible but i seal you out this is crazy rook a2 to try to break through i have rook d1 and i'm gonna set up an attack on your king with c5 it's crazy stuff so instead of that we have rook at four by the way white knight is still trapped on the edge of the board bishop d5 and now black is going for the night finally white pushes the pawn to f7 it's a score away from promotion the knight has been captured but a6 knocking on the door king to e2 king b8 pawn takes b7 and white has three pawns for the knight somehow after all of that white has gotten back the material black plays knight e7 trying to win the bishop and now we will have a ridiculous maneuvering peace end game of the bots now if you just look at this position it looks like black should just win i think most humans here would lose his white because black just has a knight boxes up at night bishop c5 rookie 4 knight f4 like as long as you don't accidentally blunder a promotion you'll be fine and probably you will win the h2 bond and then you'll promote your own pawn here all right the way that that leela defends this end game inviting knight takes bishop inviting rook and bishop versus rook understanding that black doesn't have enough pawns to win it because rook and bishop versus rook is a draw this is so fascinating bishop b3 back all right knight g6 whoops rook d4 black wins one of the pawns by the way like black just straight up wins one of the pawns and has an opportunity to win the second pawn but if you play knight takes h2 i have check if you go up i deflect your rook from the defense of the promotion and if you go back i go here and i promote so you're actually unable to win the pawn on h2 instead you have to dance around now we've traded off our kind of remaining pawns and this is unusable at bot level and these bots these bots shuffle and shuffle and shuffle let me drink some tea some coffee i got a little nitro cold brew and this goes on and on and on and and on and on and on and on and on and on that black makes a little bit of progress looking like a little bit of progress is definitely being made you're gonna push that a pawn a computer's like bugging out now yeah tldr this game took a very long time i'm gonna fast forward to move 158. and then i'm gonna fast forward to move'7. and this is what the position looked like it took them over a hundred moves to figure out this game but when the bots play the king's gambit i mean it it breaks like all of the laws of the universe in the chess world and the position that the bots obtained was just ridiculous i mean black just lost the rook fought back with night bishop and queen and what was this i mean hanging the knight hanging the knight to activate the bishop and the rook and white was almost lost white needed to sack the rook back for defensive measures then sacked the bishop and get here and slowly but surely just lost the knight in the corner but was able to pick up a few pawns for it and survive this end game so yeah king's gambit probably a little bit too dangerous at bot level they also played another king's gambit because i just said that they have to play one game with white and black that one was not as eventful but yeah let me know if you'd like me to cover the other games this is what happens when a 3600 elo bots play the most ridiculous opening known to humankind which is the king's gambit weird dank stuff happens i mean they start sacrificing all their pieces and it's craziness it's maybe i will pair stockfish and leela to play like 50 kings gambits against each other maybe that's how we'll farm some content out of them we'll see but let me know if you enjoyed and let me know if you want me to cover the match in its entirety get out of here
