[music] hey what is up guys umhd here and welcome back to another video in the tesla model s video series the one that's shot entirely on smartphones this one's being shot on cameras only from iphone 8 8 plus and iphone 10. it's all the same sensors on the back but the front facing camera stuff will be from iphone 10. i like the idea of including the front-facing camera in these more often because number one people like to see what the selfie camera looks like and number two so you can hear the audio quality that's something we also have to talk about in smartphone video cameras i might also do a video in this series with the google pixel 2 since i said that's a great smartphone camera but for now again all iphone here and this is about the tesla wrap so the most basic question that i had before i did this but that you may also have as well is why would you wrap a car in the first place why even do that that's a good question and there's a couple valid good answers to that question so the thing about living in the northeast of the united states is the roads are not that nice lots of lots of gravel potholes rock chips a lot of salt in the winter time so to protect their cars a lot of people put what's called a clear bra on the front of the car where most of the damage happens so it's like a hardened layer on the front of the car protects the paint underneath but looks like there's nothing there because it's clear a full body wrap on the other hand is more used for like restyling or completely changing changing the paint color you've seen what i've done with dbrand skins on phones it's like that but a much larger surface of the whole car so you can do that to change the color of the car but that will also still add a little bit of a layer of protection to the paint underneath you can take it off whenever you want but it was those two things that put me over the edge to deciding to get my car wrapped most people don't get it wrapped after 25 000 miles they usually do it like right when they get the car but yeah that's what we're doing so that takes us to new york when i'm on the rails i go to two i go to two i go to when i'm on a [music] i'm on that train i got my passengers going insane fire fire [music] [music] [music] but the [music] that's what it looks like when it's done i personally am really happy with it i'm glad i did it you call it a bit of a space gray that we ended up going with technically the color is 3m satin dark gray but with the black on the chrome parts it kind of has this sort of a sleek under the radar space gray look i think that's pretty sick there's only a couple specific things to keep in mind when wrapping this exact type of car number one is like i showed the door handles that is a specific part that you can wrap all the way down to the body which is really cool second is if you have autopilot version 2 hardware there's cameras right here don't put a wrap over that and there's also cameras up here i didn't wrap this part but don't wrap that either that will actually interfere with the autopilot hardware but i didn't do that anyway and another minor thing is this big chrome piece here if you wrap the entire thing then folding and unfolding the mirrors a lot might scrape the top so you can disable folding mirrors and settings i did that just to keep it pristine so either way that is it that is what a space gray tesla model s looks like i think apollo is kind of a perfect name for it now that we've seen the final result shout out to matt from phenomenal vinyl i'll link their stuff below they do great work and obviously it turned out awesome so if you're ever in new york and you're doing a car wrap check them out and shout out to tesla for making great cars also let me know what you guys think of the video quality this has been split between iphone 10 and iphone 8 plus but i'm gonna let you guys know in a little monika at the bottom of which stuff is shot with which phone it's all been at 4k 30 fps i think it looks pretty darn good either way talk to you guys the next one peace [music]
