all right so in the past summer i read some books and worked the examples about coroutines of course one of the books was written by you coroutine is another word i think that's the word so we will have a talk on cortines next week so but you've written extensively about colines too let me say a few words about coroutines it took me quite a time to get them in my head i need a few iterations at least starting in 20189 it's really really complicated but on the other side extremely powerful in general when i teach coroutines i show examples put our outut inside the exams to see the workflow of these cortines which function invokes which functions because underhood cortin consists of 23 function which you can partially which you must partially implement 23 and this the finest behavior of rectin but when you when you do it a few times play with it change it see what happens it you will get intuition what you can do and this is powerful for example i wrote once complicated or let's say advanced schedulers for cortine i achieved it but i did it in five steps and then i had it meaning even i which i'm not a total expert in co te i can achieve such tasks by yeah because it's doable but anyway you're right it's another world and it's a pity that we don't have a cortin the only thing we have in 23 is stood generator which is a kind on an infinite data stream so once more do it a few times dive each time a little bit deeper and study the examples and now and then it will make sense
