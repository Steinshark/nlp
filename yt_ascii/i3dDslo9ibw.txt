starting in 2011 intel and the rest of the leading edge semiconductor industry made a remarkable technical transition for the first time the industry began producing transistors in three dimensions largely referred to has the thin field effective transistor or finfet it was a move over 10 years in the making why was it necessary for this video let us look back at this historic industrial move but first the asianometry patreon early access members get to watch new videos and selected references for them before their release of the public it helps support the videos since views are so volatile and i appreciate every pledge thanks and on with the show for decades the semiconductor industry's building block was the metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor or mosfet this transistor is very common in digital circuits like inverters nand gates and sram cells it is made up of a gate sitting on top of a channel connecting a source and a drain the source and the drain are basically just regions of silicon doped with the atoms of other elements to donate or receive electrons the gate sits on top of the channel keep that in mind there's also a thin insulating layer between the two usually made from silicon oxide the gate does not cut through the channel itself with the exception of this gate and its insulating layer the whole thing is flat or planar this gate can be made to allow electrons to move along the channel from the source to the drain switch the gate off and the flow of electrons stops or at least it's supposed to when everything is going right for the first few decades of the semiconductor industry new process nodes delivered performance power and area gains simply by shrinking the transistor's physical dimensions and cramming more of them onto a chip this was called classical scaling the integrated circuits worked better because the electric signals had less distance to travel between each transistor and as laid out in 1974 by ibm researcher robert dennard a secondary but equally important benefit was that those smaller transistors also used less power moore's law pushed a semiconductor industry to reduce their transistor's linear dimensions in half every three years in the 1980s dimensions fell under one micron for the first time around that time people started to notice that their transistors started to act a bit funny as the transistors physical dimensions shrinks the source and the drain get closer and closer together the insulating layer between the gate and channel gets thinner 1.2 nanometers at one point or five atoms wide and the channel itself gets thinner as well with that the gates control over the current's flow from the source to the drain gets weaker and what basically then happens is that the current quote dives under the gate as it goes from the source to the drain like a rabbit burrowing into a farmer's vegetable patch current can now sneak from the source to the drain even if the gate is closed it can travel through the part of the channel furthest away from the gate or in some circumstances even through the silicon substrate itself this is called the short channel effect and by the mid-1990s the 350 nanometer process node it was becoming a serious industrial concern in addition to unpredictable behaviors there are serious issues with power consumption this leakage meant that these smaller transistors did not follow denard scaling the way things were going transistors would consume as much energy in their off state as they did during their onstay this came at a time when consumer electronics started to get more portable leading to higher demands on power efficiency researchers soon realized that they were fighting a losing battle the classical mosfet structure had a final endpoint a practical final size limit at about the 20 nanometer mark nobody saw a path to extend this final runway so in 1996 with the leading edge of 259 meters darpa became aware that the industry did not have a long-term plan beyond the year 2002 five years away they called for proposals of research on sub 25 nanometer devices titled the 25 nanometer switch darpa received 10 to 12 proposals from ibm at t and of course stanford however all of these were mere extensions of the original mosfet structure that was not what darpa wanted they wanted something both ambitious and feasible the winning selection came from a team at the university of california berkeley led by professor hutan ming professor who joined berkeley in 1976. early on he studied energy topics i hybrid cars but government funding on that soon dried up after the reagan administration came into power and he pivoted to semiconductor research in 1982 who took a sabbatical to work at national semiconductor there he had the chance to see the coming end of the planar transistor from the front lines after hearing about the darpa call for proposals from a fellow berkeley faculty member he gathered a crew and came up with the final submitted proposal over the span of a week the proposal titled novel fabrication device structures and the physics of 25 nanometer fets for terabit scale electronics brought up two ideas both of which focused on the idea of giving the gate better control over the channel itself the first is called fully depleted silicon on insulator or fdsoi if electrons are inappropriately traveling using the silicon substrate then we add a new layer of insulation on top of the silicon substrate to prevent that from happening fdsoi became moderately successful the industry has adopted it for specific uses like analog or power electronics the second idea which professor who sketched up during a long flight was the finfet as i mentioned earlier the focus is to allow the gate to have better control over the channel the traditional planar source drain and channel are flat the gate sits on top of it the finfet turns that planar source drain and channel onto its side causing it to rise up above the surrounding area and given it that 3d shark fin look for its name the gate is then wrapped around the top and sides of the channel rather than just sitting on top of it the finfet's primary benefit is that it allows the gate to wrap around the channel on three sides by contrast the gate on the old planar transistor covers the channel at just one side furthermore the finfet also has a smaller physical footprint which means we can continue stuffing more of them onto the same piece of real estate the idea is definitely not new two conceptually similar proposals were made before though none of those ideas were ever implemented or turned into a real invention the first came from d hisamoto a researcher at hitachi back in 1990 he proposed the idea of wrapping the gate around the channel and making a 3d transistor his paper called it a fully depleted lean channeled transistor or delta hisamoto in turn was inspired by a paper published by texas instruments back in the 1980s calling for a trench transistor the concept is useless without the execution and nobody knew if these transistors can scale to the 25 nanometer world or smaller thus with darpa's financial backing who and his team spent four years prototyping a working finfet device critically the team had the freedom to pursue this long-term goal but also with the ability to draw on resources in both the private and public sector this includes equipment and facilities at stanford and the lawrence berkeley national lab in 2001 the darpa project ran its course and whose team published the results people quickly realized that the finfet was a tremendously innovative technology but just as critically the finfet was not too disruptive the team made sure that traditional lithographic and etching tools can still be used to make it this way the semiconductor industry can get the better performance in power efficiency in wanted without needing to abandon billions of dollars of equipment and decades of experience even so the semiconductor industry is a conservative one they did not immediately adopt the finfet after its publication instead opting for short-term measures to stave off the mosfets last day for the 90 to 45 nanometer nodes in the early 2000s the industry employed strain or stress-based engineering this is where you add layers of quote-unquote strained silicon to the channel usually on top of a silicon germanium buffer layer strained meaning that the silicon's layers of crystal atoms are being stretched this helps the electrons travel faster as they cross the channel it was also not easy to do requiring engineers to grow these layers of strained silicon using epitaxy then at the 28 nanometer process node in 2009-2010 intel and its cohorts implemented a new type of gate into its transistors this was called a high k metal gate remember me earlier mentioning that there was an insulating layer of silicon dioxide between the gate and the channel with the high k metal gate we replace that layer of silicon dioxide with one made from a high k metal like hafnium oxide this high k high in relation to traditional silicon dioxide keeps the opposing charges apart from each other where they belong this concept was also not easy to pull off it led to the infamous gate first or gate blast dilemma that split the industry and caused a whole raft of semiconductor manufacturers to drop off the leading edge i talked about that in more detail in my video about umc unfortunately the benefit that high k metal gates gives us is one time only so for the next note after 28 nanometers the foundries needed a new rabbit to pull out of the hat it was time to go 3d for its next big node after 28 nanometers 22 nanometers intel chose to implement a 3d device which they called the tri-gate transistor the tri-gate is a descendant of the original finfet that original device had two gates on each of the two sidewalls around the fin referred to as a double gate finfet over time the industry found that these options won't yield they modified it to create what intel eventually shipped three gate layers on all of the finn's three exposed sides ergo the tri-gate adjective most people refer to them as finfets anyway as will i going from prototype to mass production is always challenging the finn's geometry with height etc as well as the spacing between the fins called the fin pitch play a big role in its overall performance these are extremely small at the 29 meter process note or smaller the fin is just 10 nanometers wide the fin pitch is about 60 nanometers millions of these nanoscale fins have to be fabricated with extremely little variation coming at the same time as a bunch of new multi-patterning techniques this was extremely difficult after intel all of the foundry's struggle with scaling their first finfet products with yield resulting in delays tsmc and samsung finally made the jump in 2013 with what they named their 16 and 14 nanometer processes global foundries joined with their own 14 nanometer process in 2014. they license their process from samsung finfet did well through the n7 and n5 generations but recently those two are losing their effectiveness foundries are doing all they can to squeeze more performance for instance making the fins increasingly taller but eventually a new set of architectures is required the industry has decided upon gate all around has that new architecture the finfet worked better because its gate covered more surface area on the channel for better control gate all around takes this idea further by completely surrounding the channel even from the bottom where it was not before completely wrapping the gate around the channel also means that we can stack multiple channels or nanowires on top of each other as they pass through the gate pretty nifty in june 2022 samsung started shipping its three nanometer process with the gate all around fed tsmc is sticking with finfets for their upcoming n3 process node but they will adopt gate all around for their next big node step and two which is under construction over in bausan these 3d transistors are technical marvel but they do not come cheap the added costs of the finfet's intricate construction means that 28 nanometers the last with planar gates is the point at which the cost per gate stops declining and starts rising again gate all around accelerates that trend even further how do you build out the gaps between the nanowires when you can only etch in a downwards direction the solution involves super lattices and a new methodology called atomic layer deposition i will save it for later these new structures make the leading edge even more economically infeasible for all but the biggest companies and perhaps not even them in a recent interview asml's cto says that he thinks we are reaching the end of lithography not because of technology but because of economic feasibility we can always come up with a next structure the next finfet the next gate all around the next euv but who or what next can be able to pay for it that's the biggest question of them all all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the channel sign up for the newsletter and i'll see you guys next time
