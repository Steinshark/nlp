hello everyone, in this first episode i'd like to introduce two important concepts in programming: variables and methods. in our code we need to be able to keep track
of changing information, and this is where variables come in. so, a variable is essentially a name to which
we assign some data. for example, we might assign the number 15 to the name 'playerhealth'
at the start of the code. at runtime, in other words while the game is actually being played,
if the player takes damage, we can update the value stored in the variable. an example of this would be the line: playerhealth = playerhealth - 5 which subtracts from the player's health,
by assigning the variable a new value equal to its old value-5. when we create a variable, we need to specify
what type of data it will be holding. the playerhealth variable, for instance, holds
a number, so we might specifiy it as an 'int' variable. this means that it will only every
be able to hold an integer, or whole number value. if we wanted it to be able to store
non-whole numbers, what we refer to as 'floating point numbers' (since the decimal point
can be placed anywhere), we would make it a 'float' variable instead. other examples of data types include 'bool'
for storing true/false values, such as playerisalive; and 'string' for storing text, such as
the player's name. as you can see, when we create a variable
we first specify its type, followed by a name of our own choosing. to assign a value to
it, we then add an equals sign, followed by the value. some data types require the values
to be written in a certain way, for example string values must be enclosed in quote marks,
and float values must end with the letter 'f'. finally a semicolon is added to indicate
the end of that line of code. you don't necessarilly need to memorise
all of this right away, the main take-away from this is simply that a variable is a name
to which we can assign data, and that this data can be accessed and modified at runtime
to reflect the changing state of the game. all right, let's talk about the next concept:
methods - also known as functions. methods are a little bit trickier to define in simple
terms, so i'm to explain them by way of an example. imagine we write a bit of code for creating
an explosion. so the instructions would be something like: play a sound effect, make
a flash of light, and apply 10 damage to all objects within 5 units of the blast. by the
way, anything that follows two forward slashes on the same line is a comment in c#, in other
words it does not affect the code, but acts rather as a note to oneself or to other programmers.
so i'm using them in this video to indicate lines which are not actual code. now our game might have various objects that
explode. cars, barrels, etc. we could copy-paste the explosion code for all these different
objects. however, if we then wanted to make a change to the instructions, for example
add smoke, we'd have to remember to go through all the copies and make the change there as
well. you can imagine this would get very tiresome, so as a rule, programmers tend to
severely dislike code repetition. what methods allow us to do is define a name
to which those instructions belong. so we could create a method called explode(), and
put the instructions inside of there. now we can replace all this duplicate code with
a single call to that method. let's extend this explosion example a bit.
currently we have hard-coded values for the damage amount and the explosion radius. but
what if we want an exploding car to be more powerful than an exploding barrel? instead
of saying 'apply 10 damage to objects within a 5 unit radius', we could say 'apply
damageamount damage to objects within blastradius of the blast'. we have replaced the hardcoded
values with variables. we now change what is called the method's 'signature' to
reflect this. so inside these parentheses following the method name, we define the two
variables that this method uses. notice, however, that we don't give the variables values.
whenever we call the method now, we can supply whatever values for those variables we want. here when the car calls the explode method, damageamount = 8 and blastradius = 12 whereas when the barrel calls it, damageamount = 5 and blastradius = 10 so we've seen that we can pass data into
a method, but we can also return data from a method if we want. say we want to be able to generate random
names for the different characters in our game, so we make a method called generaterandomname.
this starts off by creating an empty string variable (remember that's for storing text)
called randomname. then we randomly add some letters to this variable. now we have a random
name, but we're not done yet. whoever is calling this method will want to know what
the result is. so at the end of the method we add the keyword 'return', followed
by the variable our result is stored in - randomname. just like we have to specify the type of variable
we're creating, we have to specifiy the type of data that a method returns.
if it doesn't return any information, as was the case with out explode method, then we just have 'void' before its name. generaterandomname returns text, so we'd add 'string' before the method name. now, whenever a name is required, we can say
string name = generaterandomname(); what we're doing is setting name = to the value that
is returned from that method. so to recap, a method is a means of isolating
code that performs a specific task so that it can be called from multiple places. it
can optionally take in data to work with, and can either return void, that is nothing
at all, or it can return a piece of data. i hope you found this video helpful. in the
next episode we'll be talking about classes. until then, cheers.
