okay, we're doing the golden ratio and fibonacci numbers and i'm going to show you why lucas numbers are better than fibonacci numbers. so- (brady: haven't you already done that?) you know, it does sound familiar, doesn't it? because we did a video, couple years ago now, about lucas numbers. which - lucas numbers, instead of starting 1, 1 fibonacci they start 2, 1 and then they carry on from there. then you get 3, 4 - i'll just put a couple of them down here. so we've got a couple lucas numbers to get us going. okay, that's - and then the fibonacci numbers, which everyone already knows and loves: line 'em up here instead of going 1, 3 you can think of fibonacci are the 1, 1. and then you get 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on, 13. people love the fibonacci numbers 'cause there's just lots of cool things and they have the constant ratio that, as you, if you multiply one to get to the next one it's the golden ratio, is your multiplier as you go down. well, not, not exactly - but it tends to the golden ratio. and what i pointed out in our previous video is lucas numbers do that as well. so, again here the ratio from one to the next approaches the golden ratio. in fact any sequence where you start with two numbers and then add them to get the next one and repeat, always approaches the ratio of the golden ratio, and so- (brady: even the brady numbers?) even the brady numbers. so if you want to  - that was the origin of the brady numbers to prove that point, there's a video where i prove it algebraically, and we look at these and they're absolutely great. and the, kind of, the crux of my argument as to why lucas is better than fibonacci is, if all these fibonacci-esque sequences have that property, what happens if we start with the golden ratio as the ratio and then work out what sequence drops out? and so what i did was show that if you take the golden ratio and square it you get 2.618... which if you round it to the nearest whole number is 3. and i'm not going to do all of them again this time as, you can see what's going on here. if you cube it, you get 4.236... which you're round it to the nearest whole number is 4. you go that's, that's looking familiar. 5 it equals 11.090... which is, what's it going to be, it's 11, right? and so it turns out that the lucas numbers are just the golden ratio raised to a power and then rounded - i'm gonna use square brackets for rounding to the nearest whole value. and so the nth lucas number in this sequence is just the golden ratio to that power, rounded to the nearest whole number. and i'm like, boom. that's why lucas numbers are better because if you start with a golden ratio and raise it to powers, what drops out? the lucas numbers. someone on the internet had a different opinion. someone on reddit, with quite a new account, i think they've created it just to come and harass me with their proof, zeproxypylon. they came at me and said "no, matt if you raise the golden ratio to various powers you don't get the lucas numbers. in fact, you get a whole lot of fibonacci numbers". and so what they did was use the facts that famously the golden ratio minus one equals 1/1.618033. lovely, i mean, oh i'm a huge fan of that, right, this is the stuff i do get excited about. you can actually multiply everything here by the golden ratio and shuffle it around a little bit and you'll see that the golden ratio squared equals the golden ratio plus 1. which is also lovely as - i'm stating the same thing. very nice way, in fact if you then solve this, kind of, quadratic equation you can show that the golden ratio is the square root of 5 plus 1 on 2. and that's where the value comes from. but the interesting thing here is actually, i worked out the numerical value when i did the golden ratio squared, why don't i do it in terms of the golden ratio? you know, why not keep it as, you know, an exact number? because if you recall correctly brady you complained when i did this because i was rounding. you said it's not very precise, you know, it's a bit rough and ready. brady: "this doesn't seem very much like a lot of the other mathematics i see, it seems kind of a bit fuzzy and almost-y"
- and so, fair enough, you know now other people agree with you i'm gonna do it again and keep it in exact terms. so this is where it starts to get interesting golden ratio squared equals golden ratio plus 1. we know that, ok. golden ratio cubed equals - golden ratio cubed is the golden ratio squared 
times the golden ratio. we already know that that is the golden ratio plus 1(golden ratio). golden ratio squared plus the golden ratio, right, but that equals the golden ratio plus 1, and so actually that's two golden ratios plus 1, once i simplify that down. okay, okay, okay we go. two golden ratios plus 1. okay, golden ratio to the power of 4. well, that's that's the same one from last time. they've multiplied it by another golden ratio, two golden ratios squared plus the golden ratio but that is the golden ratio plus 1. so that's two golden ratios plus 2 plus that. three golden ratios plus 2, okay, okay. three ratios plus 2. now, i don't know if you can see what's happening here, but if carry this on, the next one you do the same thing. you multiply it, you simplify it down. five golden ratios plus 3. golden ratio to the power of 6 is 8 golden ratios plus 5. and sure enough, if you carry down this you get the fibonacci sequence here 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and you get it here offset: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and so on. and so the point that has been raised online is that actually if you do what i do, but you don't do this ridiculous rounding, you keep it in exact golden ratios and simplify it, you get two lots of the fibonacci sequence.
- (brady: burn matt parker!) yeah, well played, well played internet. i, i see the error of my ways, i'm big enough to admit when i'm wrong, it's become a theme it turns out. and you know what? i can't, i can't argue with that, right? so to celebrate the fact that someone has shown me that the fibonacci numbers are the best, by my own logic, let's do, you know, what we do to celebrate things in mathematics, we try to generalise them. so let's just generalise this up a little bit, right, and then we'll call it a day. if you look here to the power of 3 - because i said the nth of the lucas number is the golden ratio to that power. so the nth is that to the n, and that's why i'm calling this is the first one, that's the second position, third position, fourth, fifth, sixth and so on. and so here the fifth, let's take the fifth, for example, the fifth power of the golden ratio is the fifth fibonacci number, because five is the fifth fibonacci number, plus the one below it the fourth one. and i quite like that - five is the only fibonacci number which is equal to its position - unnecessary side fact. and so if i want to generalise this, what i've actually got here is the golden ratio to n equals that fibonacci number times the golden ratio plus the fibonacci number before it. so f n minus one, that's quite nice, so there are. so we do, we've generalised the pattern with a little- oh we can probably simplify that actually, because we've got a golden ratio here. and like we said the ratio is always golden ratio as you go up. so if n times the golden ratio is actually just the next fibonacci number. so actually that equals the fibonacci n plus one, plus f n minus 1. well, that's quite nice. so what i've been correctly schooled on is that the golden ratio to n is the fibonacci number after n, and the fibonacci before n summed together. that's, that is very, very pleasing. but actually we could probably add them together couldn't we? 'cause we can simplify this right? because it's always the fibonacci number ahead and the one behind summed together. so let's just very quickly i'm gonna list out the fibonacci numbers again: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. and then we'll add the, for every position before and after. so 1 and 3, if we add those together we get, sorry 1 and 2 - we get 3. if we add 1 to 3 we get 4, if we add 2 to 5 we get 7, 3 to 8 we get 11. 5 to 13 we get', and then we can carry on all the way up. so, if you do generalise this and simplify it down and then you add the offset fibonacci numbers you get this sequence here, which is of course the lucas nu- oh my goodness! where did that come from? so, there you are! so yes if you follow zeproxypylon's method you do get the fibonacci sequence popping out twice - you get two of them, one in each direction. but that's because if you sum the fibonacci numbers ahead with fibonacci numbers behind, you get the lucas numbers. and so it still is the lucas numbers! you've just split it into two fibonacci numbers, but that- and no rounding! that is the exact- okay, there was some rounding but i hid it. that is the exact lucas numbers coming out the other side. you look unconvinced brady. (brady: you know what i say?)
- yep
- (burn ze-pylon!)
- oh really?? yeah! about time! boom, there is it! we did it. 
- (brady: you burned him) i, you know, it was a solid maths burn, you know. i should give them directions to the nearest maths department - what? to be honest, they can probably come back with yet another argument for why is fibonacci, because it turns out the two sets of numbers are very closely linked. and the fact that you can sum pairs of one and you get the other one is, that is why i can flip backwards and forwards between these, almost at will. and the- where the rounding's gone. because you think, well hang on, i've just done what i did before but now the rounding's disappeared. all the rounding was hidden in this step here. that's where the rounding was, when i went from there to there. because it's not actually the golden ratio between consecutive terms, it approaches it. and so eventually it's that exactly but initially you've gotta round for that to happen, and that's why you're rounding over here, to get this. so that, that's where all the rounding has been swept under that one step there. and so you still get the numbers out. so i'm - thank you zeproxypylon for getting involved, and it was a very nice argument, you had been worried for a while. but i'm glad i could sit down and the fact i could generalise their argument to loop back to mine, that is immensely pleasing. (brady: what? you think this is over do you?) i think i'm - well, this round is over, you know, but you know i now, i throw the gauntlet down or out or across, i forget the relevant direction. and if the people of the internet, the netizens want to rise up and present yet another counter-argument i am ready. hi everyone, you might be unsurprised to know that matt has a bit more to say on the subject, in fact about eight minutes more. it turns into a bit of a philosophical discussion about the square root of five, and if you'd like to see that continuation i'm going to post it on our numberphile2 channel. but you don't have to wait for it to go public there, there are links to the video right now on the screen and in the video description. there's also more stuff in the description about matt's work and what he's up to these days. [outtakes] so let's just roll this up. people will sing odes and tell tales of the day i felled zeproxypylon and their attack on the king.
