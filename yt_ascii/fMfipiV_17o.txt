professional snake handler. you wanna go ahead and

steal the 10 grand, look! there, he's, look at him! congratulations! your
mom just won 10 grand. - let's go - this box has $15,000 in it and some giant cockroaches on top of it. karl, as much money as you

i'm going with this. - oh, gosh! - jeff, however much money
you grab out of this box in the next 60 seconds, you keep. okay, all right? that's like 500 bucks. i forgot to start the timer, so i'm just gonna count in
my head, i'd say 50 seconds. oh watch out for the cockroach! (jeff yells)
(boys laugh) yo! his hand just touched
my hand and it was sweaty. by the way, you got like 35 seconds left. - oh my god! - well i'm just gonna count down from ten. - oh no! - nine, eight, i'm a little bored, five, three, two, two. i'll give you an extra second
if you pet a cockroach. (suspenseful music) and one - boom! you won $9,340. congratulations! (all chuckling) this is a one pound dumbbell. can you curl it? (fake arm crunching sound) and chris, every time you curl
this i'll give you a dollar. - really? - no. but, every time noah,
come on in here, curls it i'll give him a dollar. a dollar. i'm just gonna throw it
on the floor. dollar. dollar. here try curling it faster. boom. boom. boom. boom. oh this is hard to keep up with. you can literally go as long as you want and make as much money as you want. - oh don't test me. i can be
here for days if you want. - [jimmy] oh really?
(boys laughing) all right, let's see it. - won't stop, can't stop. i was built for it. i'm
winning a million dollars. - tareq, if you let this tarantula crawl on you for 30 seconds i'll give your mom $10,000. and we even brought his
mom to cheer him on! - yeah, tareq, you can do it! - yeah, mom, thank you.
(chuckling nervously) - [chris] what's your safe word? - safe word is: get this spider off of me! - tareq, if it bites you
we'll double the money. does that make you feel better? - oh no! - i can say that cuz
it's not gonna bite him. all right, time started. - [tareq] stay calm, it won't move. (tareq's mom talking indistinctly) okay, all right. mom- (mom gasping)
- [chris] it can sense fear. - [jimmy] tareq, you're
a whole five seconds in. - [tareq] okay- - oh!
- just five more seconds. oh oh oh!
just five more seconds! - you're almost at 30 seconds. - [mom] go! go- - you're almost there, tareq!
- you're almost there. - you're literally almost there- - so close! - [mom] tareq! (indistinct)
- he's so close. (all laughing) - [jimmy] all right. (multiple people screaming and laughing) - yay, tareq!
(all clapping) (mom laughing excitedly) - yeah! i did that! - thank you, mr. beast, for letting the spider crawl on tareq. (tareq laughing) - if you could stand
right here. thank you. - okay? why am i standing right
here? why? (chuckling) hello? - karl, i have a random contestant here, and if you guess the code
to that safe in the room, she gets what's inside. - okay? - try to get in. stop laying on the floor! - you're so lazy! - chandler, can you do that thing? - [chandler] yeah, i got it. - [karl] i've-
(slams against wall) - oh and karl, one thing
i forgot to mention is every 10 seconds we're
putting a rat in the room. - stop! actually? - chandler! another one. it's been like five seconds
and i like to round up. - [karl] is there cheese on the safe? - there is, in fact, cheese on the safe. (karl banging on the safe) - [karl] oh my god! (suspenseful music) - i'll give you a hint. see that giant rat to your right? - [karl] yep. - [jimmy] uh, we put
the code underneath him. - no, you didn't... - you're right, we didn't, that was a lie. (karl and contestant laughing nervously) but the code does have something
to do with your birthday. - [chris] karl, oh! look at that rat- - [karl] holy shi- (all laughing) all around me! - what do you think the code is, karl? i wanna help you out. - you said it's my birthday. - well...what's taking you so long. - karl, go! i want you to go faster! go! - [karl] it was wrong! - how 'bout you try the
day after your birthday? maybe that'll work. - jimmy. (safe beeping) - oh! i meant the day
before your birthday. sorry. - [karl] oh my go-
- he got it! oh, mary! see what's inside! - is that- is that mine? - earlier today i broke
into chandler's house and stole his teddy bear. (karl laughing) - [chandler] that's mine. that's flash- - chandler's stuffed animal aside, there's $20,000 in that safe. and congratulations-
- shut up! shut up!
- [jimmy] you just got it! - yeah, let's go! - oh my god! thank you so much, karl. - of course! - we're now back at the snake set, but instead of a tub of snakes, we have a tub of pickles. (karl giggling) oh my gosh, it smells so bad. (chris smacking pickles) (jimmy punching pickles)
(fire exploding) (pickles squishing) oh stop stop! - why does this exist? - if you remember in this video chandler wouldn't eat a pickle for $5,000. he's terrified of pickles. chandler, come here. the pickles aren't gonna jump at you. which are you more afraid
of - pickles or snakes? - [chandler] pickles. - that is the dumbest
thing i've ever heard. (all laughing) - i was gonna offer your sister 10 grand for you to sit into it. but, if you do it in the next minute, i'll give your sister $20,000 if you sit in this tub of pickles. - okay, just think of like a mcdouble without pickles and no onions. - or just think it's 20 grand! - for someone who might lose 20 grand, you seem kinda chill. - i'm kinda used to it at this point. (all laughing) - all right, 20 seconds- - c'mon, chandler, you can do this. just think of all the times. - ahh! - [cassidy] you can do this, chandler- - [chris] chandler, i love you. (chandler screams)
- you can do it! you can do it! - [jimmy] 10 seconds! she pushed him in! - [chandler] ew! (boys laughing) (chandler squealing)
five! a little bit more...
- get me out! (everyone laughing) all right. we'll count it! we'll count it! (all laughing) - [cassidy] aww, chandler! (boys laughing) (chandler gagging) - [karl] cassidy, your brother ran away. - i knew if i didn't raise it to 20 grand, there was zero chance he would do it. - i was thinking the same thing. - finally! he pulled
through and won you $20,000. - i love you! (boys laughing) (exciting music) - noah! holy crap! how much has he done? - about 20,000. - what?!
- 20,000 curls. - i can help you out. but i'm gonna need to
grab some of that cash. i got an idea. i'll be back. - [jimmy] okay. all right. we'll check in with that later... nolan, do you remember when
karl beat you in coconut bowling and stole an island from you? (pins colliding) - [karl] booyah! - that island cost $800,000. karl, can you open my microwave? in this microwave is $8,000. one percent of the island. and if you can beat karl
in a push-up battle, i'll let you have one
percent of the island. - why is it in a microwave? (chuckles) - why are you not in a microwave? (microwave beeping) gentlemen, get in positions. on my count: one... do it.
- oh! before we do the seventh, nolan, think about the island he cost you. - you don't stand a chance! this is payback for bowling! - oh, also karl, if you win
i'll give you the eight grand. - [karl] oh, okay!
- [nolan] no! - seven... (intense music) all right, we're in the double digits. no- hey, hey, no savvy, no savvy- - [nolan] whoa! - that's not savvy-
- you're just gonna stand? - all right.
- what was he gonna do to me? - 16... (intense music) 17... - [karl] i can't. i can't. - oh! let's go! (karl groaning) you lose! - nolan, (indistinct) let
me just step over karl, sorry you didn't win this money... here you go! you can just take it home- - cool! - enjoy your microwave. this is our next contestant randy. basically, earlier
today, i put out a tweet and i asked a thousand people
to come to this auditorium- - oh- - and sit in the stands. so there's a thousand people
out there right now. okay? - okay. (jimmy laughing) - hey randy, if you read
this script in front of them, i'll give you $10,000 in cash. - okay, i'll do it. (both laughing) (intense music)
(audience chattering) thanks for coming out. i really need your undivided attention for the next... three minutes. i'm going to be talking about why youtube is better than everything. it has a dream and pewdiepie. jacksepticeye... (nervously chuckles) septiceye and many others. now stay with me! - it's pronounced pew-dee-pie. - i can't believe he's
actually doing this. the script we wrote is so stupid. - also, can i get a "hoya!"- - hoya! - hoya! thanks for coming out - [chris] you're welcome! - all right what'd you think of it? - it was fun. it was, it was, it was not
what i expected to read, but... (boys laughing) - and before i give you this $10,000, walk out here, i wanted to introduce
you to the actual crowd. (randy laughs) what you were speaking to was
actually a thousand mannequins and chris and karl. - hi! - hi! - and there's your $10,000 in cash. - i have no idea what to do... (randy crying) i'm giving all this money to my mom and part of it to mary beth. (randy chuckling) i told her i was gonna give her some. i just, thanks for the opportunity. i can't stop shaking. - [jimmy] now let's see where chris went with all that money from the gym. - all right, we're headed to best buy. i'm gonna get noah a theragun. it costs $400, which is a lot. but i think it's gonna
make him so much more money if he gets that arm worked
out, ya know what i'm saying? oh wait, that one's $600. i don't think we need the $600 one. i've returned. now let's watch this man get instantly thousands of more dollars. - that feels like another 20 grand to me. - you're just gonna stay
here and massage him? - frank! you know how you were a cameraman? - yeah. - you're now a massage man. - now we're gonna massage your arm, so you can curl more weights, so you can take more money. this is weird. next bit. one of these four paintings costs $10,000. see if you can guess which one. i'll give you three seconds. (light happy music) if you guessed this one, you're an idiot. it's not this one. this was painted by karl. - [karl] yo that's kind of dope. - this was painted by chris. (paintbrush slashing) this was painted by chandler. (paint farting) and this was a $10,000 painting we bought from a professional painter. ashley, there are four paintings here. this sounds weird, but one of
these paintings costs $10,000 and three of them cost nothing. and if you guess which one
is the $10,000 painting, i'll let you keep it. go ahead and start analyzing them. - [ashley] oh man...
- [chris] i know... it's very easy... - [karl] it's the one that has
the most artistic integrity. - i'm gonna go with this one. - [jimmy] this one? - [ashley] yeah-
- [jimmy] are you sure? you don't want to think about it anymore? - i'm going with my gut-
- okay- - i'm going with that one. - so you think this is
the $10,000 painting. - i think i do. - i hate to break the news to you but chris actually drew this. - i'm really good-
- [ashley] did you? - yeah!
- yeah. - [ashley] you did a good job!
- [chris] thank you! - [jimmy] chris!
(ashley laughing) you should be a professional artist. technically, ashley,
you just lost 10 grand. (sad music)
- all right. - i feel kinda bad so i'm gonna
let you pick one more time. last chance. if you get it this time,
i'll let you keep it. - okay, i think i'm
gonna go with that one. - [karl] this one? - [jimmy] wait, that one? (painting crashing) - 50-50 now. - [jimmy] all right, we're
giving you one more chance. (ashley laughing) which do you think this man didn't draw? - let's go with this one. - so you think this is
the $10,000 painting? - i think this is the $10,000 painting. (jimmy sighs) - this was also drawn by chandler. (ashley laughing)
this. right here. was the $10,000 painting. honestly, if it makes you feel better, you literally couldn't have picked worse. - yeah i did a really good job with that. - i'm really bad when people lose. can you just fist pump me? all right, i'm gonna head out. this is foy. - how y'all doing? - i have a rope here and i'm
gonna have you play tug-of-war. foy, of those three gentlemen right there, who would you like to play
in a game of tug-of-war for $10,000? - [foy] i'm thinking karl. - it's pronounced, it's chris. - so you wanna play karl in
tug-of-war for ten grand? - [foy] for ten grand, absolutely. - [jimmy] all right.
(boys laughing) three...two...one...go! (intense music) (jimmy laughing) you got $10,000, but before you celebrate, do you want to risk your
$10,000 and do double or nothing and throw another person over there? but if you lose, you lose it all. - double or nothing. - double or nothing?- - let's go for it. - all right well then pick. who do you want the second person to be? - [foy] i'm more for
chandler because i don't... the socks.
- what are those??? - three...two...one...go! (suspenseful music) (boys grunting) oh! whoa! - [chris] you gotta...you
gotta get chandler in! - [jimmy] yeah! (clapping) oh, congratulations! (foy cheering) now you have $20,000 in cash. and you know what i'm about to ask you. - all three? to be honest with you, it feels like i'm
bleeding inside my chest. (boys laughing) i'm done. - so you're gonna take the 20 grand? - i'm gonna take the 20. - okay-
- so what... you're saying is you're scared of me. - no, he's saying he's scared of chris. - yeah! (chris grunts) - please subscribe to mr. beast. had a good time. y'all can too. - noah, buddy. we're back! you seem to be curling pretty slow. (noah chuckles) - honestly man, i can't
feel my arm at this point. - [jimmy] oh really? dave, what's he at. - $32,000. - $32,000. - i know i said 100,000 million but let me tell you
something, i got humbled. (boys laughing) - the pink dumbbell of death
is finally getting to him. in this trash bag is $20,000. do you wanna risk your $30,000 to try and curl this 20 pound dumbbell? a if you do i'll give you an extra $20,000 and we call it a night. - i gotta risk it. - you're gonna-
- risk it for the biscuit! - play the intense music. 20 grand on the line. can he do it? (intense music) - [chris] i got the sack. - [jimmy] oh. it's going so slow... - [chris] you can do it. - [jimmy] come on. come on. - [chris] you can do it.
- [jimmy] a little bit more. come on! come on! - [chris] you can do it! - [jimmy] that looks like a curl to me- - [chris] i don't know what
makes it a curl or not. (chris and jimmy talking
over each other indistinctly) - [noah] please tell me that's one. - [chris and jimmy] you won $20,000! - [jimmy] on top of your 32 grand, you just won another 20 grand! noah, what's going through your mind? - honestly, it's surreal. it's hard to fathom
how much money this is. - this is regina. and do you
know why you're in this room? - no. (both laughing) - sorry for dragging
you in this weird room. if you don't mind- can you guys be normal for five seconds? - i haven't moved a muscle. - if you wouldn't mind, can
you put this blindfold on? - okay. - [jimmy] as you remember, there
was a balloon in this room. so i'm gonna put this nail
in your hand, right there. i'm gonna have the boys move the balloon to a random part of the room. inside this balloon is
keys to a brand new car. if you pop that balloon without
taking off your blindfold in the next 60 seconds,
you'll get to keep the car. i'm gonna start the timer now- - okay. - go for it. that's a wall. - [chris] cold! - [jimmy] that is a wall.
(regina chuckling) cold. - oh gosh.
