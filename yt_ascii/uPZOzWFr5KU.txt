this youtuber is getting sued because he called a crypto bro a dirtbag and said you shouldn't listen to his advice and apparently it was so hurtful so damaging that he's now being sued for 75 000 for defamation and emotional distress now i'm obviously covering this lawsuit because i get lawsuit threats a lot and i always want to know is it actual defamation or are you just trying to silence criticism that's what we're finding out today the lawsuit we're talking about is between atozi which is a commentary channel and bitboy a crypto channel now you might have heard a bit boy before because we've talked about him in a past video called how much does it cost to promote a crypto scam in it we talked about the problem of paid crypto reviews and showed how scammy projects can pay influencers to promote them sometimes secretly sometimes it's disclosed now it turns out a month before i made that video a commentary youtuber atozy made his own video this time called this youtuber scams his fans bitboy crypto which is incidentally the video which he's now being sued for now in this video admittingly a tosi was a little bit more colorful than i was and he calls bitboy a dirtbag influencer dirtbag influencer it has also been known for being a shady dirtbag bitboy and other dirtbag influencers dozie also says bitboy can't be trusted with financial advice he simply cannot be trusted with financial advice because you don't know if he's trying to enrich you or himself and to support this point he uses an example of bitboy promoting a crypto coin called pamp in a paid sponsorship i definitely don't want to miss this one i do fair reviews with my team and i won't promote something that we don't dig deep into and that's exactly what we did the way pamp is designed is great for staking if you missed out on tezos or chain link you don't want to miss pump by mean pamp i'm pumped up to talk about this one yikes he pitched it as if it was the next best thing but one look at the current price of pam and it's not hard to see why people are upset okay it basically went to zero and bit boy himself has deleted that video from his own channel along with many others in this cnbc article bit boy himself says he could make up to a hundred thousand dollars per month in promotions alone and if they fail he might delete the promotional video from his page so what exactly is so wrong with what a tosi said that would cause bit boy to enter quote bouts of depression and suffer from severe anxiety well this is where things get a little weird one of the core arguments of this lawsuit is that bitboy is this incredible source for crypto knowledge and advice this is why it's so bad that a toasie has damaged this reputation the lawsuit describes bitboy as an industry-leading source of reliable commentary which you know is a bit of an exaggeration and they say that quote can there be a more damaging assertion for someone like bitboy crypto who engages in the business of providing advice and commentary on cryptocurrency investments and this is where it gets confusing because bitboy himself says he doesn't give financial advice after all i'm not a financial advisor i can't give you financial advice courses financial advice not financial advice so then what advice are these lawyers talking about that bitboy's in the business of is it beard trimmings room decor it's not exactly clear but what is clear is that this lawsuit basically says atosi defamed bitboy by saying the public should not look to bitboy for any advice but we have bipboi himself saying the same thing so which is it seems like the lawyers are a bit confused but that kind of makes sense because occasionally bitboy himself seems to get confused because in that video i just showed you about pam token he actually seems to straddle the line between giving advice but also making sure that he can't be held responsible for giving advice boy you always say do your own research and don't trust anybody in crypto fair enough voices in my head fair enough but let this be an exception but of course do your own research on pimp so wait a second should we make an exception for you and trust your research or should we do our own research are you a crypto advisor or are you not well guys this is where i realized that cryptocurrency is so revolutionary so new that we need a new theory to describe it so i'm coining a new quantum theory term that i like to call schrodinger's advice here's how it works if a crypto influencer describes himself as unfit to give advice he's being responsible if you call him unfit to give advice you're being sued now in all seriousness i do kind of understand why bitboy probably feels upset he probably feels like he's cleaned up his act and that people are still associating him with a few bad calls in january of 2022 bitboy said he had a crisis of conscience and stopped doing paid promotions which you know that's great and i obviously applaud that but you need to understand you can't fix a bad reputation by suing your way out of it you just kind of have to do better and hopefully people will eventually notice but speaking of trying to sue your way out of it this all reminds me of another situation pip boy got himself into this time he tried to sue celsius after everyone lost money and he was gonna sue on behalf of everyone that is until he realized he couldn't because he had actually promoted celsius and profited from that promotion so he actually was a conflict of interest and couldn't sue so oops i mean was that financial advice should we have done our research on that it's not so clear so anyways that's it for now i just wanted to say that i don't agree with this lawsuit i think it's frivolous to try to get a tosi to shut up but either way don't forget the most important thing pamp the stock
