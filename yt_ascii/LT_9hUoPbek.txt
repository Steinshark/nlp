ladies and gentlemen hi i make chess youtube videos but many of you knew that already because you're returning viewers to my channel welcome back but some of you are watching for the first time welcome i usually sit right in this chair and some others in the past because i've lived in different locations and i talk about chess right here on this screen but sometimes i leave the house contrary to popular belief i do in fact have legs and feet you just really don't get to see them until today you see a couple of weeks ago there was twitchcon paris and i was in paris with my wife lucy but not for twitchcon and there was a chess meetup at the jardin de luxemburg which was probably terrible french and i snuck in to the chess meetup and challenged a couple of people and in today's video i'm going to show you a game that i played with the black pieces against none other than nemo who is a chess and other variety content streamer and in this video i did something really awesome i'm going to show you the footage first and then we're gonna analyze the game i sacrificed the rook in real life here we go i know the first move okay good luck it's gonna be e4 i i knew all right all right yeah your first one's gonna be c6 right it has to be vintage yeah this gives me are you are we live yeah twitch stream yeah it is shout out to chupac said it's been a couple of years since we lost oh i sprained my neck how does hikaru do that oh my god ow it's okay yeah this is my camera because he did this oh damn my mom's so chill okay so i'm guessing you know all the theory should do aggressive yeah i'm gonna say this on camera yeah paris is better than new york saying it right now you've enjoyed your trip here yes yeah it's been good i'm glad to hear that hello are you here for almost a week okay it was good we have fun we did all the tourist stuff and then we walked a lot yeah we we participated in the riots it was good people were so worried about that happening here you see any yeah so what i learned leading up to my trip to europe is that the internet is frank crazy like there's you can't google anything anymore because people are like don't go to paris you're gonna get pickpocketed don't go to rome you're gonna get big pocketed and i was carrying all my stuff like and i'm like what am i doing i'm from like new york the biggest city in the world or one of and i'm not worried about getting pickpocketed there so right but yeah doing tourist stuff is crazy so many lines and yeah it was fun to hear that shiny new foods that you really enjoyed no i mean not nothing new oh okay i had like some italian foods okay it's french food you also went asian food in france yeah you went to italy right like exactly and stuff okay not because of the white lotus have you seen the weight loss i have the one with oh my god what's her name she's hilarious they the rich heiress lady oh tanya tanya mcquad yes yeah she's hilarious yeah i'm not gonna spoil anything for the audience at home it's very funny i feel like my position got so passive for no reason at all i don't remember how pieces move when's the last time you played over the board blitz or chests in general i don't know that's a good question hold on i gotta calculate no i don't i'm just gonna move here that's a very safe move oh it's not it's very aggressive yeah but in terms of like calculation you didn't need to calculate oh yeah yeah like yeah exactly i mean with the way you're playing it's gearing up to be to look that way i'm gonna go here i wanted to find okay now you're fine no i'm just sacrificing i'm not calculating anything let's go for it all right i hope i get a brilliant move for that oh it's not you're threatening my pawns yeah someone run into a chess.com i hope someone has it open yeah before it can do whatever you want fine i'm going for it this game is either going to be brilliant or dog like it's just gonna every move is a mistake yeah i can't tell so far it's looking good though i'm waving at my pants you're a one fan yes yes i have one fan yeah having one fan is the most important part in life though that's it that's all you need one just one tell that to the streamers who have one viewer that sounds too harsh i mean that's so hard you think they want more viewers or less viewers i think they would want more viewers but i was i was referring to lucy lucy is yeah we were one true fan and that's what matters the most important thing yes okay so if i go here what happens maybe nothing like to you okay maybe i have some we gotta find out maybe i don't know nemo what am i famous for besides the channel and the good looks what am i famous for the vienna what am i famous for oh no oh no i'm getting them rocked i don't know if this works but but you did it you had to do it you gotta do it i really hope it works because then it will be then it will be good content no no then i'm gonna pass itself listen i got beef with everybody oh oh no no i'm that's there to say yes oh wait that doesn't work not only does that not work that's checkmate no all right good game i'm back home in new york i'm no longer in paris and i'm going to analyze the game where i sacrificed my rook irl and actually the person that yelled the rook in the background when i asked what am i famous for was my wife that was a very amazing moment where nemo had no idea what the heck i was talking about and then and then lucille that was quite hyped park got hype it was nice so nemo began the game with e4 and in the beginning of the video i actually told her i know what her first move is going to be because she doesn't play any other openings like she just refuses to move any other pawn on the first move i like my carl khan but i'll play a french i'll play a scandinavia and i'll play some e5 stuff i'll play the modern i really don't mind but in serious games and this is you know very serious game in the park in paris this is the opening that i know best and my rating is 3500 my elo because i'm very proud of myself and she played e5 which is the advanced variation i played c5 and my knowledge ended pretty early because she gave me this check which which is not a good move but it's not like a losing mistake it's just not a move that challenges the black position like e6 white's most challenging moves are bishop e3 for example defending the pawn and then i might play something like knight d7 and then she can play here which pins me so it's a different story but again like life goes on you know you you play chess now what what she did is she gave me a check straight away and white does not want to go here if black can commit the bishop that's just generally my experience like this just kind of helps black is it any like is it a fatal error not really so i just played bishop d7 could i have played knight c6 probably then she would have went here maybe and defended and then we would have had a game could i have gone here yeah but i was like i'll just go here now in this position i jokingly said that i was gonna recapture with the king for obvious reasons this is a very bad move you put your king directly in the line of fire you now cannot can no longer castle however in terms of taking back with queen and knight it's actually it's about the same actually in i would argue the night is better because you actually get a piece out that targets the center if you take with the queen you only have an attack on this and after this you have to continue to attack this somehow you could go here or here but then at some point you're gonna have to figure something out because if you keep killing time and you don't do this the right way suddenly it's not so simple like suddenly you the white's gonna hang on to everything and that's not really what you want in this type of structure so when she took on d7 my knowledge of the position kind of already was gone but i was like all right knight takes d7 we'll figure it out and for white it's important to preserve this pawn because if you preserve this pawn like let's just say b4 which by the way is just not even a good move because i can play a5 me taking here is very good for me because i will get i will get to these pawns i will play b6 a5 i will undermine them if you lose a center pawn like this it's not good the knight will keep going forward you'll never have any peace and that'll develop and i'll march forward so just for your understanding it's better for white to develop naturally and hang on to the center pawn and now i can take on c5 with either my knight or my bishop i here i follow the age-old chess advice of don't move the same piece multiple times in the opening can i go here yes but as you see from the evaluation it's not the best move because i've already developed my knight so by taking on c5 it's not like i'm gonna go here but i'm just getting a step closer to castling like i already moved the knight it it moved it's good it's got eyes on this it's doing a good job it's not on its traditional active square but i can always you know expand out maybe i'll draw arrows correctly and also controlling f6 is important because maybe i'll go here so she castled which is a natural move and i played 97 and already like again when you're playing chess in the park the board looks a little bit different it just does you might not understand that because you've never played chess in the park that's completely fine or you never play chess irl some of you mostly just you know just play online it's different you're like a little bit you're a little bit like uneasy right there's a lot of people around maybe there's not where you're gonna be because you're not gonna get stared at like a zoo animal like i do when i play justin park but that's completely fine but the board is just different and so at this point during the game i was thinking like did i play the opening correctly because i've never had a position like this she gave me this check and i thought all right well i i mean it seems like i'm doing things correctly i've got my knights here and she played c3 c3 is a a reasonable move but but i think she should focus on development i i don't actually understand the idea of c3 it's better than putting a knight on c3 because as you can see from the eval it actually goes down quite a bit the knight doesn't really have a role in the game like alco a6 and then i just can't participate at some point in the future the best move is going to be moving the night somewhere else like that's why okay she played c3 i thought she's trying to fight for this but i thought it made more sense for her to develop the bishop and then i you know that way so she could go out that way but she went here i can't control my opponent's moves only my own and now i castled could i play knight to g6 targeting the weak pawn yes but i'm a man of principle i haven't actually castled yet so i'm gonna go here and i thought well certainly she played c3 in order to play the move b4 but again she's not developing her pieces plus we're like bantering a little bit so you know she plays queen e2 not a mistake right eval is still minus 0.2 white can do many many things in this position she slid her queen out to apply more defense to this pawn take anything if necessary attack here maybe go out this way if it's possible and now it's kind of like it's a question of how does how does black play on from here and in any given chess position you want to think about checks captures attacks i'm always scanning these moves but none of them are working and i thought this is a target this is where the game should be played because i'm not gonna go here so i'm looking at potentially a pawn break in the future to open things up and i was thinking she wants this so i played queen c7 for multiple reasons number one eyes on this number two get out of any pins number three connect my rooks makes sense she goes knight bd2 so i've talked about this move already she wants to probably move her night out and then move her bishop and at this point i was like i think this is a good moment as ever i'm gonna play knight to g6 so i am just straight up threatening to take the pawn on e5 now she has multiple ways of defending that pawn she has rookie one which physically defends it and then she has a tactical way of defending the pawn by playing the move knight to b3 the knight hits the bishop so my two pieces both see the bishop and there which means they're overloaded so now if i take if we go down this line one piece stops looking at the bishop two pieces stop looking at the bishop and i lose that's bad i don't want to do that right so knight bd2 knight g6 she could play knight to b3 at which point i would have to acknowledge the threat but she plays rookie one which is a reasonable move defending the pawn and at this point i'm starting to think okay i think the configuration of her position is a little bit lazy like just kind of lackadaisical and i've got i'm not calling her lazy i don't know her character but i just thought this is kind of like easy moves i think there's something here and as always checks captures attacks but if you can't get a check capture attack successfully you think of a way to improve your position okay and you think of improving a piece or pawns or both and sometimes a pawn trade in a position exists so i'm always looking at this move f6 if takes this opens up but that opens up and i can play a move like rook f6 and suddenly i've got some very meaningful pressure and with just one pawn trade both of my rooks participate in the game now which is a big deal so first i played knight f4 the reason i played this move is i thought i'm attacking her queen she can only go back that way she could go here but then i just do this and she either does the same thing or completely leaves the game because now i can just walk right into the position so i was thinking i'm gonna play knight f4 and beginners play moves like knight f4 because they're like oh i'm attacking the queen it's a good move i played knight f4 because the the queen cannot actually touch any of the center so all of those squares are covered and the queen has to go backwards and got to be careful because i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna come into d3 too so by playing knight f4 i forced the queen back to f1 which is very ugly and now i play f6 and now i'm taking over the initiative in fact i've probably had the initiative for a couple of moves now this move attacks the pawn this move attacks the queen this move threatens to open up the position in a very very beneficial way for me if she takes i'm gonna take with the rook then i'm gonna double she could try to kick my night out but it's gonna get very very dicey very quickly for white because i've got a lot of tactics first of all i can just leave and you know that's a soft spot in white's position so again f6 very instructive move now here all hell breaks loose she plays g3 and in this position i had calculated something very interesting and i'm going to share it with you now because i want to show you what goes through my head the move g3 attacks my knight there's multiple ways to get rid of a threat as you saw you can acknowledge it you can create one of equal or exceeding danger danger levels i thought of this and this was a ridiculous move if queen takes i'm a genius right but what about king takes and i rejected this because i thought i have a check which is mate almost she blocks and i have nothing turns out after a move like this or this this is very scary for white and after this there's knight g4 check and i win the rook so i actually could have played my original crazy idea which was bishop takes f2 and i and i had seen this but i didn't i didn't see it cleanly and that's why i didn't play it because i just thought it didn't work but i was wrong could have played bishop takes f2 instead i sacrificed my knight i played pawn take c5 and i thought i'm getting a pawn when she takes my knight i'm gonna get a second pawn so i'm only down one point but i've also got this an open king to work with and a monster pawn cluster and as you're going to notice in this game it's very difficult for pieces to deal with pawn clusters especially if the pawns defend each other when they defend each other they create these menacing thorns and they're gonna just remove you from the defense and i'm again i'm still barreling down toward that area and when e4 happens my queen gets an open gate and then my knight gets access so my position has amazing coordination here she played queen h3 and at this point this is an attack on my pawn with a check of course i should play a move like this but i really didn't want to lose time i thought that if i allowed my opponent too much time suddenly there's tactics and i'm not even sure i'm better anymore so it was a very tense moment in this game and i was like do i acknowledge her threat like this or like this like dude do i acknowledge the threat on my pawn or do i just go for it and i thought if i go for it and i lose i'm gonna look stupid but if i go for it and i win i'm gonna look like a genius and so in this position i played e4 now as you can see from the computer the computer is not impressed because it's actually not about this the computer thinks this first is better hitting my rook forcing me to go here and then all of this and then you don't take the pawn but instead this and suddenly white is swarming and i'm in serious trouble so i have to play knight f6 she can give me a check and i could play king f8 maybe but this is a very scary position she can already sacrifice her bishop to try to checkmate me yeah e4 was a was a very poorly thought out decision i i it it was it was not intelligent of me to play e4 but i went for it and she went queen e6 and i went king h8 and now i i am threatening the knight i have pressure on f2 all of this good stuff knight takes e4 is still looking like a very very nice move but she goes here and at this moment i was like [music] checks captures attacks i don't have a check that's the only check i have it loses a rook i can take this and i can take this and you always need to look at pieces near the opponent's king that are only protected by the king i could go here could i double up and go here yes but i'm a deviant chess mind i'm always looking for the things i shouldn't do and i was like wait a minute i'm gonna go here she has no checks on me she's gonna get my rook and i'm gonna get in against the king and i realize that the king has to snuggle in the center with nowhere to go and i thought best case scenario i win worst case scenario i might have a perpetual check so i sacrificed the rook rook takes f2 and this move was the proud moment of the game this was a nice one she got the rooked irl now what's crazy is she doesn't have to take the engine gives knight f1 defending mate and opening the bishop and i just have to go here and i don't know accept the fact that i i'm not getting a rook sack this then there's this with the intention of getting queen g3 and white can actually hang on here by just taking and ignoring my rook just getting a position like this up a piece but under a big attack and apparently it's equal and like with best play something like this i can force a draw and if this i can take this and it's like total chaos but she took my rook she did take my rook and did go here and i thought best case scenario i win the game worst case scenario i draw right i'm gonna have a perpetual check i was already thinking queen g3 and stuff but i have to be very careful because if i do this the wrong way her king escapes if her king escapes she's up five points of material she's up a rook i have four extra pawns three extra pawns three extra pawns and she's a a rook and a piece so i'm down a lot of material here i play rook to f8 and again i'm down by five points of material but it's equal because even though i have mate threats she has rook f1 here and i just assume that after something like this i was gonna deliver a mate but white aka stockfish sacrifices the knight and after take back rook f6 i cannot take well no i can take it's not back rank made but then this and this is no longer made the king escapes like this so sorry i didn't see that in the game my bad but i thought this was a pretty good position and a very difficult one to play with low time and yeah i mean she had to find rook f1 which is not a super hard move to find but obviously this all looks very very dangerous and and the king it looks like you're getting mated at any given moment like for instance queen h6 king e2 queen h5 the king just goes to e1 and then runs out so instead of all of all that she went here which is stopping queen f2 mate but unfortunately enables this which is just checkmate in one move so she helped me out actually because the position here according to stockfish is equal i helped her out a little bit because i sacrificed my knight for no good reason and then a couple of moves later i sacrificed all of my king safety and my rook but i was going for the highlight reel and sometimes to go for the highlight reel you gotta put yourself in the line of fire and it worked maybe next time it won't but in this game it definitely did and it was a very instructive kind of attacking lesson with how to attack with five different pieces i felt like in this game rook takes f2 the soft spot near the king and we get the job done in this game shaky but we got the job done i had a lot of fun thanks for watching until this moment in the video if you did hope you enjoyed the analysis and the banter and the irl footage i i do go outside in fact i will probably go outside after i finish recording this video and so should you get out of here
