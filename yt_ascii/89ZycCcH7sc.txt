ladies and gentlemen welcome back to your favorite episode on the internet ladies and gentlemen welcome back to your favorite series on the internet guess the elope in this series i analyze my twitch subscriber games live on stream and i try to guess what their chest strength is this leads to a lot of comical but also absolutely fascinating battles that we get to watch dissect laugh and learn from but you already knew that and if you didn't then welcome to this series in this episode we have a spectacular game we have also one of the worst games i have probably ever seen in this entire series we have a cameo from my wife and dog we have a cameo from a piece of steak and an enchilada that i was eating and everything in between so the world chess championship just ended what better way to follow it up than an absolutely hilarious episode of the greatest series ever made maybe except the sopranos all right gotham subs got white we got pawn to d4 and a nice little queen's gambit shout out to 2021 changed a lot of people's lives including my own queen's gambit declined all right at least like 1200. unless black has my a6 oh terrible wow black plays the worst possible version by the way if you're gonna accept the queen's gambit folks except the queen's gambit either right now or after you've played e6 a6 one of the reasons i made a queen's gambit course for black with the move a6 is because after a6 you kind of have like a very very fast paced pawn to b5 okay do not block your own bishop and then decide to take it doesn't make any sense because now white can play e4 and you cannot play bishop g4 tremendous okay absolute ceiling of this game better be 1200 because if you play this and this and just completely neuter your own development this is very bad you should not be playing like this this is very bad and i mean i feel like right like bishop c4 what okay boss the whole like the entire okay like a thousand okay nobody at around 1100 and up should not be playing this i mean surely they know that bishop takes must be the best move right by the way now black can play b5 and black is completely fine take on c4 of course black is gonna okay gotta be like 900 oh bishop d2 how did you take at literally the worst moment i mean the the beyond beyond the worst moment queen a5 literally only seeing two things and you fork yourself i mean good lord oh my god okay good all good just keep attacking you gotta castle okay now it's time to play like a gm right okay black's queen is just on a on a on a jorge masvidal-esque life mission all right finding the meaning of life and i was gonna come back reinvigorate it all right now black blocks their own development oh my god now white can sack the knight and open up queen h5 check obviously that doesn't happen oh my god look at this i mean 60 okay the way you need to gauge if you're playing good or bad moves okay is think to all of the youtube videos that you have watched where i have covered grand master games if their position does not look anywhere even remotely similar you are playing bad chess stop playing the way you're playing immediately okay stop playing the way you are playing emit curry drop 50 points wow good thing that is completely meaningless to me because i don't participate in sports gambling chief what what and he goes back to home square 20 moves oh my god bishop c7 oh bishop takes knight is crazy no of course not that would have been okay so bishop c7 is winning because it's a discovered attack on the rook and it attacks the queen which is really really nasty oh i mean okay you're either playing against your friend and they're oh my god this game is absolute chaos what is going on you're either playing against your friend who is losing to you on purpose or okay not even queen takes bishop or i don't even know what i feel like white is going to get mated is that is that what's gonna happen oh right on cue tremendous i feel like white is gonna get mated of course and made on e7 right yep tremendous stuff wow okay so terrible queen's gambit took the pawn at literally the most inopportune moment black played absolutely no developing moves white basically got lucky and won the game i mean i'm gonna say between five and six hundred if you are even a single rating point above that this might this has to be a three minute game or a one minute game and if it's not and you're above that god help you really i mean that from the bottom of my heart truly god help you because i don't think i can i i think i i don't think i can help you if i'm being completely honest okay let's go find the game oh no oh surely not no no 800 27 but and he closed his account did he tilt after this oh come on oh poor guy oh poor guy you deleted the account after this game i you know honestly it's kind of like burying the evidence i don't blame you i mean really i mean frankly you should have deleted the account while the game was going on thanks for having a sense of humor though i feel like sense of humor is lost on i mean frankly like as the game is progressing maybe just delete it oh my goodness okay i listen i wish you all the best with your chess endeavors but i gotta tell you brother sister all right please minimize the chaos in your games okay please you play the queen's gambit you gotta go here and here up bishop c4 i click the wrong move right bishop c4 you gotta take this and then when your opponent makes a move the opponent makes a move you gotta go what do they want what do they want you didn't i gotta check the elo prediction no i don't honestly for that game i don't have to check anything i next game honestly i'm just making an excuse because i already clicked out of the game i clicked out of the game and i x that out because my com because if you open 10 analysis tabs on your computer it'll crash your computer my computer is on the verge of death all right so all right game number two of guess the wow that was just sickening stuff we have gotham sub we have random noob chess.com said you were 400 they were generous no no i said five six hundred so yeah yeah all right sicilian d3 that is not a move in fact black is better on move two that's actually kind of impressive being worse on move two sensational stuff really okay so for the for the second time in this episode we are blocking in our own pieces excellent move it's normally bad to move your queen out like this but it's only bad if a natural developing move attacks your queen and there is no natural developing move right okay white offers a queen trade black should not trade black should develop and try to improve their position great okay this is a mild improvement fantastic black is slightly better black is slightly better because i said so and you should listen to me yes yes i want food it's the first time and i guess the elo recording we're gonna have a big steak delivery enchilada at the start how are your parents they're good her parents are good you guys hear that i'm gonna mute it what that's all i took yeah i'm i'm doing a benji impression all right i'm gonna eat some big steak the one and only man's not hot so bishop d6 d4 knight g4 tremendous move oh boy all right things are about to get real weird so you can take this and it attacks that that's the best move what what why did okay black thought they were doing a desperado black thought i win a bishop so i'm gonna do this and i saw in a youtube video once in a in a gotham tick tock what a desperado is okay so so the guy was the guy was like you know so this person decided okay i'm gonna do a desperado because i'm gonna lose my bishop but then when the yeah that's not what what guys you got y'all got to stop believing your opponents okay i take it take the pawn nice bring the bishop out that's a great move i know you're not supposed to play f6 but that's a great move oh you're gonna hang the bishop oh we going in take the rook you gotta guard this or you gotta create counter play what are you gonna do oh a little passive a little passive but you know what they say little passive slightly massive nice bring the yeah ah why oh that was just oh no oh the knights are too much other knights are running loops oh the nights are too good guys you cannot trade rooks when it's the only piece you have that is not that's it it's over white is just gonna take all your pawns because this pawn calmly just yeah i mean it's over just okay all right see force font yep okay there's nothing there it's just take it yup oh my god yo oh my god it would he had to not do that he had to play like king f3 or king g1 because black cannot go here and black oh my god he had to stop the oh my god oh my god if you take its queen if you take a oh my god oh my god oh the technique oh no stalemate oh oh oh my god i thought it was stalemate oh my god i thought it was stalemate i thought it was stalemate wow luck or planned luck or planned was that was that a miracle yeah so the opening was weird and white played uber solid then this was just some some narcotics chess then it was good again and then it got yeah then black just made a blunder and then yeah white just couldn't find a way against it you know what i'm gonna say like yo i'm gonna say like 1300. i'm gonna say like 1200 1300. is that insane am i crazy am i am i completely insane is it 12 1300 no no i i i think this game is is actually a a a very weird opening turned into bro this is a game of two 1500s why did the last guy delete his account i mean here's two candidates oh my goodness i mean i thought i was being generous 1500 really like for real for real both players that's insane oh my gosh and then how much time did white have in this end game white had four minutes i mean the winning plan is just this like it's not complicated just so you guys understand the king has to stay next to the pawn three on one should never beat a king three on zero could beat a king that's that's wild wow that's intense that was not good that that was that that was that was not good i did not expect that i did not expect that that is what that was his name is steak oh i should have seen the chest.com guess yeah it's okay it does honestly honestly not worth it e4 all right 400 let's go check no no i i will i will check right now what what the chess.com thought white was 15 what oh no i gotta put this up on the screen are you kidding me chess.com what the heck you thought they were 1517 at chess.com you'll get out of here just shut up chess.com honestly trust.com honestly honestly can i be honest you're wrong this is trash this is a trash estimate you're wrong i don't know how many people were were yeah how many developers worked on this is trash this is true it's trash trash nope you could have worked on a six month trash i'm terrible i mean you gotta you gotta call like it is honestly chess.com gotta start calling it like it is bro like they played did it not play like 1700s get that out of here bro get that out of here okay i love this two pawns yes oh goodness oh sensational oh is he gonna blunder this that wait this is like wait oh wait it's a slight inaccuracy the bishop is supposed to be on c4 this is still winning for white yup this is still winning for you have to not play knight g5 though you have to play like rook g7 yeah i know guys you don't have to give me the thesis statement as to how did white just play like magnus carlson and then like the person that he's drinking alcohol with on the stream this is like if magnus played the first seven moves and then like went to piss and gave the game to his friend who he's drinking with that doesn't know how to play chess you've seen those magnus drunk streams right where he's just like crushing games it's like hey you play a move and then i'm gonna go and then the guy just hangs all his pieces oh my god he's not taking on he's not taking the rook is just hanging okay now it's defended all right now yeah just queen g7 and it's over yep why are you playing defense what are you afraid of you have like an overwhelming attack here stream is crashing again all right stream is crashing again tremendous oh we're back all right hey youtube if you see chat writing f a lot it's not because they have an obsession with the letter f means the stream crashed for some reason i don't know i don't know queen g2 i don't know why we're playing defense it's raining a lot in new york you know it rains and apparently like fiber optic cables that i pay a hundred dollars a month for for my internet yeah that's how much i pay yeah tax deductible though all right this is winning but white's not gonna play that yeah well now it's there oh mike he almost made it there he almost he almost made it whoa whoa is he gonna play bishop b5 oh my god always a champ queen e6 always a champ king b1 yeah yeah i i get it because he's trying to move the knight and now knight e4 oh boss man boss man danger levels danger levels knockout oh please for the love of god queen f7 is made bro how did you how did you how did you do this how did you how did you even you you gave your queen a boost and then you cut the it's still our queen of oh my god no no when you move a piece and you attack something you gotta think where it's gonna move and your rook no longer defends the bishop oh my god it's made it's made any any million a million ways it's made oh thank god thank god thank god i mean i'm sorry to bring god into it all right god does not want to be thanked for this game god wants to be left alone when it comes to guess the elo okay queen f6 is edgy right i mean i love this this is this is great c3d4 is really really excellent stuff really excellent yeah hanging this and then hanging that is wild though gotta be triple digit i mean if this is four digit i don't even know what to say i'm gonna say like like eight eight like eight fifty eight fifty i could see it being 850. there is absolutely no way this is four digits there is just no way i mean the queen is here to take this like i there's no way not in a million years is this four digits okay i've seen my i know my fair share against the elo this is not a four digit game all right 900 thankfully i was right four once okay 900. i said eight nine hundred they were 900. go through the whole game i just did i i don't if you don't have an ability to see or hear i'm very sorry about that but i i definitely went through the whole game i i said that all right now what does chess.com think frankly i don't even want to click on it game review all right you can send me your game review links let's see what chess.com thinks of this catastrophe 2 am not an excuse i play my best chess at two in the morning all right because it distracts me from the pain of oh my goodness this is tough no no oh my goodness the whole game was bad that game was pretty oh my god i okay you win you win guess the elo i've recorded like 70 episodes you win you win you win you win you win that's it you win congrats honestly this will go down you gotta you gotta mint this game as an nft you gotta you gotta put this game up on your living room if you're going on dates you gotta open with i made it to a gotham video and the title is literally named after me because i'm probably gonna name it unless another game is better i'm gonna name it 100 elo guess the elo or something like i don't know i'll think of it all right you won officially you are currently the the title holder in guess the elo i mean we've had some brilliances you take the cake this was sensational not a single move was good i feel like the only move that was good was was forced you had one good move you had one legal move and you played it that was great 150 i mean my god 150 is wild i love it great stuff thank you for sending it in that was tremendous and by the way if you get roasted on guess the elo that's literally what you signed up to do all right and i'm trying to be instructional as well a lot of one move mistakes completely disregarding you know i wasn't super instructional for this game but you know we still learning yeah yeah 150. 150. didn't i show you i definitely had it on the screen did i not i thought i did i thought i put it up on the screen i guess i guess you all missed it or i don't know maybe is is the chat lagging maybe maybe some it's lagging for some of you all right because the stream crashed a few times all right cairo nice exchange carol beautiful oh so far so good oh tremendous oh my god okay not necessary not necessary it's not necessary because you don't have any pressure here you only want to take the knight if you are going to land a blow after there is no blow after that could have been phrased better you should trade for the bishop if anything okay you take the knight if this move brings you something it doesn't all right it absolutely does not bring this is very well protected now you're fine oh you're playing like dingly ren oh love it oh get get in there yes oh look at white panicking oh look at you not oh oh rook g8 so that's what i like to see we got a good game for the first time good game the first good game of this whole episode we just saw a game that chess.com literally thought was 50 points higher than if your dog played on your account all right literally so this is the best game of the episode we just had a game chess.com just said was a 150 game all right so you know let's let's go rook g8 what the [ __ ] old point of castling is to touch the rooks together love it how are you gonna trade queens man how are you gonna trade queens man he traded queens that's crazy bro oh my god what are you magnus you trying to get an end game oh my god all right i hate this now oh now i like it again oh oh sector oh yeah that's kind of you could take it though don't be scared don't be scared homie king b8 rook d8 rook c8 sack the rook you feeling chad sacked the rook oh he's getting in oh rook f3 oh hung the bishop yo oh like 1400 and that is going to be my guess for this game 13.50 1400 between 1350 and 1400. it was not this one wow 1625. okay but it was a blitz game and what did chess.com think oh chess.com thought it was a 2300 game yeah 2300. wow that is sensational good game well done okay i i i i'll tell you why i thought like 1400 a few like i i thought you didn't quite under you played a little too solidly clearly your ambition here should be to attack i thought you played a bit too solidly i hope you're not insulted and i also thought like your opponent kind of you know gave it to you a bit but that was a very well played game i mean i can't be mad at that that we we always need one of those all right we always need one of those every guest that elo has a game someone's like yep i'm a huge chad i won that game that was me all right we'll end today's episode so the person that submitted this game was it this game or the last game of this whole thing i think i don't remember but somebody i mean it's gonna be very tough to oh gonna be very tough to top that other one okay e4 vienna ah yes the caro vienna not actually what it's called this is actually not in my course because it's a horrible move but a pretty good rule of thumb is the fact that if you if you can like a lot of people will play this if you can play the move d4 against something where your opponent cannot play knight c6 it's probably a good move so for example against bishop b4 on the second move in the e4 course the move is d4 because pawn takes queen takes it's this so that this now white is just doing very well okay so if they play c6 a good rule is to just do this and it's not the vienna but they don't have this move and if they go here d5 is a horrible weakness and they're much worse okay so this is very bad d4 is good but okay if you just play normal you'll be fine yeah why now f4 only makes sense when you can go e5 you cannot play e5 okay you're doing it your way fine this is a horrible move completely not addressing anything i would just take and i would take what what you love the recaps thank you so much i love that you love them thanks for tolerating the thumbnails oh it's game over just bishop f7 bishop b5 i mean something's winning e5 i i get it i get it oh that's a brutal defensive move oh that's even more oh oh oh yep oh queen g4 foreign oh my god walk of shame oh oh what the [ __ ] oh my god oh my god okay i thought that this episode already had a legendary game what the [ __ ] bro took his soul bro banned him on chess.com for all future ip logins okay just the opening on its own is like a telling sign because this is a terrible way to play against the vienna but so do we think this person is low rated but played the game with their life because f4 was bad and all this was terrible i mean i don't know what this was what do we think was this just the most legendary game like a 1200 ever played oh my god i have like no info at all oh that's insane that's like a hilarious puzzle oh my god all right i'm gonna say a thousand literally i'm gonna say a thousand not because white played like a thousand no but but would a thousand find this would a thousand play bishop b6 all right you know what i i you know what i'm gonna say i'm gonna say like sixteen hundred but white but black played so bad was this a high level game where one person played horribly or was it a low level i'm gonna say 16 1700. i i don't i mean i i don't there's no way someone that low rated played that kind of a sacrificial attack eleven eighty it was a daily game okay okay that makes a little more sense that's all right i mean that's nuts but stop sending daily games don't send me a daily game that was oh my god that was unbelievable yeah you get 24 hours to think of a move i mean it's gonna be a good move oh my god that was what a game that was good lord i mean he took his soul i've never seen something like that hi are you telling him here oh can can i can i trouble you or an iron soda i love you oh my god that was he's trying to leave he's shoving the door open oh my god
