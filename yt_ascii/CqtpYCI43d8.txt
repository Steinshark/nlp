here we go again here we go again do you know what i'm referring to buckle your seat belts or that's what i thought anyways when i saw these news headlines yes i am talking about devon and i'll be honest with you i woke up two mornings ago a nice sunny morning and i thought oh check my social so i go on my instagram and i have so many messages from you and it is it's hilarious because the messages were tiff is devon going to take our jobs devon have you seen devon what do you think of devon and i go who is devon what are you even talking about devon automatically i think of it as a human but boy was i wrong in this video we are going to dive into what exactly is devon ai capable of should you be concerned about your job what does this mean for the future we're going to dive into all those big questions but before we get into it make sure to hit that subscribe button for more tech tech news coding expl everything around tech all right let's get into it so let's start with the biggest question which is what exactly is devon ai and where did this come from let's take a step back devon ai is backed by some of the biggest names in tech or biggest funds in tech i should say peter theal you probably remember him as he's one of the co-founders with elon musk of paypal he has a massive founders fund and they are one of the investors in devon ai devon ai's parent company is called cognition and this is where it gets really interesting i think it's funny because all these news articles are saying how deon ai is going to take over software engineering jobs but it was created by software engineers so what is devon ai capable of well in the promo video here's what they said i think it started off really interesting by the way because in this video they start off introducing a software engineer as human software engineer now we need to differentiate between an ai software engineer and a human software engineer then they get into what exactly is devon ai capable of but here's why i think this is really interesting it is capable of of you can prompt something with it and it will then update what tasks it needs to do so for example devon uses machine learning to constantly learn and improve its performance so it is constantly learning so of course you can build with devon endtoend applications such as websites and even videos which is really cool deon will debug it has its own built-in browser and once it's finished a task if there is something else it needs to do it doesn't yes you heard that right it can fine-tune and train it own ai models all right this sounds like a lot i mean this this sounds a little intimidating i you know when i first saw this video of it i i'm not going to lie i kind of got a little worried weirded out it felt weird and it felt weird i was named devon not to mention also devon has applied for jobs on upwork and got them yes if you were hiring for a developer on upwork you might have been hiring devon also too devon is up for hire so you can get on a wait list to actually hire devon to help build build your applications for your company but here's why i think we don't need to freak out well yet anyways just like any new tool when it comes to market a lot of times there is sparkle if you will and by sparkle i mean marketing hey before we start really freaking out and before you go drop out of your cs degree let's take a step back and really think about this it sounds great in theory it sounds super cool but that's all it's just sounds we haven't seen what it's actually capable of yet and until we are able to interact with it and build with it let's not jump to conclusions i also think it's really important to note that remember when chat gpt came out there were so many headlines saying the similar or exact same thing that chat gbt is going to take over all software engineering jobs i'm sure we even spoke about it so before we really get caught up in this cycle or this hype cycle of a tool being released that helps developers let's take a step back and think of it at its core devon i do believe will start doing some parts of developer jobs in the sense of more of a smaller tasks will use it as a tool like we use other tools but will it replace software developers completely absolutely not that shouldn't even be part of this conversation the reality is if that point comes in time where ai is taking over many jobs there's going to be a lot of jobs taken over that are not just software developers and i'm not saying that's going to happen but let's take a step back and realize that this all of this tooling does not just affect software developers i saw a good comment actually it was from a product manager and they said on this comment in social media with deon an ai they go well if i'm the one who is you know planning the projects for the engineers and telling them what to do does this mean my job is gone too so it really will trickle down into how people are feeling within many roles i really think we need to start looking at devon and other ai coding tools exactly as what they are which is tools i mean think about when site builders came out such as wix or so many others now now we kind of just think yeah they're great for small things but if we want to build big enterprise applications or websites you need the good old-fashioned human it does feel a little bit weird especially when you see this chart here with how far devons coding ability is compared to chat pt clae and other llms it's pretty staggering and i do truly believe that tech is changing so quickly especially now with ai and we're going to have to become comfortable with evolving with it in order to grow and remain relevant and the best way to do that is educate yourself on these tools are coming out that will have a huge impact in the industry or on the industry as a whole how you can best use them what does this mean for you could you maybe learn more about the architecture side of software development how could you grow your career past you know simple programming there are so many different if you really start switching it into this is an opportunity for me to continue to learn and grow i think it can kind of be exciting listen don't get me wrong it can feel a little bit terrifying especially with all of these headlines we see around first ai software engineer going to take out software engineer it's like yeah it can feel a little overwhelming at times but that's why i wanted to make this video to educate you on what devon ai really is where its capabilities lie which as you've seen and we spoke about it can you know build endtoend websites and applications same with videos debug it has its own built-in browser so yes it's it's advanced let's let's not sugarcoat it but if you use it this advanced tool to your benefit as a developer or even if you're not developer but anyone in the industry i think you're going to see a lot of really incredible startups come out of this being someone who has an idea but maybe you aren't a developer now you can go and build that idea and how cool how powerful does that feel to make your ideas turn into a reality when you think of something you can now build it that's pretty empowering i really think we about to enter an area or a time where everyone is a prompt engineer and honestly everyone can do the very bare minimum of coding or i hope that's what we're entering into meaning it's so accessible the tools to do so are right there so we just need to take advantage of it and i think that's a very good spot to be in i'm really curious to hear your thoughts about devon does this make you feel uncomfortable has it gone too far or are you feeling excited about using this tool leave your candid thoughts down below i will make sure to respond to every single comment i love you all and on that note it is time for some late dinner [music] w
