hello everyone and welcome in this video we are going to be installing an edelbrock supercharger kit onto my 2016 mazda mx-5 now you may have noticed this is a healthy upgrade of an environment from what you're used to seeing on my channel this is in fact the brand new shop of none other than the mr. humble mechanic hey dude i'm so excited i'm excited as well so he's got a new shop a new lift and we're gonna get to work now you obviously already know that i bought a miata jason i also bought a miata charles also bottom me out and you know what by the end of this video you too might be convinced that you should buy on the audit well here's the thing when you're buying a car there's a lot of different websites out there that you can purchase from ebay motors cars commutation every not every video and there's a white board racing a backup white board bring a train where did you okay you already know where i'm heading with this today's sponsor auto tempest comm lets you search all the top listing sites in the us and canada all in one place so whether you're searching for a volkswagen golf r32 or a different volkswagen golf r32 or a volkswagen golf r or a volkswagen golf gti wait charles seriously is everything you own a golf no we got the miata well whatever it is you're searching for and wherever it's listed you can find it with auto tempest comm check it out with the link in the video description so this is an edelbrock supercharger kit i'm going to put a list on the screen of all the tools required and this isn't gonna really be a how-to video it's more gonna be an overview of the install it is 153 steps that'll rock provides you a beautiful binder with color pictures of all the steps i'll have a link to this if you're curious to check out actually step by step but there's 153 steps so we're just going to work through some do a recap of how it went talked about any significant challenges along the way highs and lows as charles describes i what if we're gonna have enough tools and how many parts store runs this one yeah hey how many twelve parts to run so maybe we can beat that maybe we had more jason isn't that a different shirt then you head on before charles if i'm gonna pretend to work on a car for a little while i'm definitely gonna wear a shirt that says mechanic my favorite part about that is i'm actually doing the same thing so this is gonna be hilarious so the very first thing we're gonna do before getting started with the install is to load the calibration file and flash the ecu so that that's already done once the install is complete you don't have to worry about any trouble with that happening so it's a very simple process but you do have to email edelbrock with your specific vehicle calibration id and then they'll send you back a calibration file to load onto it and then once that's all set you know you're good to go so once these supercharger install is complete then everything will run smoothly so this is the engine right is that right through this is in fact the engine okay sweet and so i thought we would give it one last shot of it before things started coming out here so some things are not going to be going back in like this fancy little skyactiv technology i'm sad about that plastic bracket i'm gonna keep this it's gonna be gone for good and then there's some induction noise that we've got going on here some tubing for that that's going to come out so a few things won't be seeing their way back in but it actually does use the factory air box first of all how cooler lives it's pretty much the best yes special just for you so first steps have been getting the battery out getting some fender covers out obviously taking the wheels off next up post we do it under here wow that's where all the the belly pain here in the in the center section next up we got to unplug the lighting in the bumper cover and bumper cover comes off then i think that's all we have left to do all right moving right along we are on step 44 right now so we took the front bumper off lowered things down got back inside the engine bay and took out the airbox upon which charles found the engine air filter mr. penske oh yes that's me so mr. frensky yeah is everything okay with mike well that kind of depends on what our next decisions are gonna be we were servicing your car doing your 8,000 point inspection and notice that your engine air filter who it is just slam clogged up full are there supposed to be sticks in your engine air filter you know depending on what kind of car some come with that but your car does not actually use sticks inside the air filter so this is a huge huge huge deal not only is it gonna cause like poor fuel economy yeah i can get really really bad on you it's probably cheap to replace though yeah yeah we yeah you know we can we can do a really good job for you today we can get it knocked out and you know 20 30 minutes for 99.95 $500 yeah i know i can't believe it's so affordable either you know sometimes that kind of stuff hurts the wallet a little bit so i'll see if i can find you a little bit of a coupon so is this something i could do myself well you know you might be able to if you understand the full workings of a combustion engine alone exactly that's how most people feel okay and the other thing is if this is done improperly or not replaced at all it can cause bad bad things to your car i know sir that you really love your car more importantly you care about your family yeah i guess we're gonna have to do it let me get this replaced for you i think you're gonna be really happy and most importantly your family's gonna be proud of you for making a right decision that's the thing that matters most absolutely we also installed our first part a tiny little plug for the bulkhead i don't think you can actually call them firewalls anymore okay i won't call it anything okay don't call it anything we removed a whole bunch of stuff one of those being the noise pipe that actually attaches right to the bulkhead and since we removed it plugged it back up and while charles was actually putting parts back in i was looking around the room trying to find some grease to put on my arms so that i looked like i was cool even your shirts do i know even put a little on my shirt to make it look like oh he's really in it yeah so up to this point even though we have installed our very first part it's primarily been removable we got the intake manifold off which is like a pretty big victory piece i feel yeah so there's four bolts on top which are pretty easy to access then there's this one bolt on the bottom which charles came up with nice little mechanism here we got the wobbler double extension and a wobbler at the end that's a pretty cool little tool right there and so we got this off but then there's a bunch of harnesses that are still connected to it to get it finally out and then once this is out there's quite a bit of space in there and now this piece is not gonna be going back in because our supercharger unit will replace all that stuff so in the instructions they actually have you reuse these little gaskets in here i went ahead and just bought some new ones that we didn't have to use these and interestingly looking at the valves there's quite a bit of carbon in there i you know for from my my barometer this is actually not that bad okay thirty or forty thousand miles whatever we got on the car but it's obviously more than you would want yeah well we looked at so we did the supercharger on - mm obviously and we looked at those valves which are port injected and they were quite clean how many miles were on this to that and the answer that was like a hundred five hundred ten thousand yeah so this has 33,000 or so any kind of the miles pretty intense little carbon action going on in there we're about a third of the way through jason what would you say the difficulty level of this job is so far so far it hasn't been bad it's been pretty straight forward and ups to edelbrock because these instructions i pray the pictures are good there's arrows so i think we left off with how the instructions were very clear and nothing was going wrong we said that and then immediately it became a bit more challenging so the hose routing is a bit unclear with what you're doing with the two supercharger runner for the intercooler on the engine side how those hoses route to the front is a little unclear so we're figuring that out and we're gonna skip ahead later and start routing up front so that we can make sure we have that hose routing well done before we put in the supercharger itself yeah there's a lot going on in that space including the steering linkage so we don't want to just throw it in there cover it up with the supercharger and then go oh crud it's rubbing the steering yep and so also getting that supercharger runner in was quite a tight fit to get access to the yes that actually hold it on there so that was another challenge and then of course i know everyone's gonna ask because the supercharger runner just went on and i just showed you how dirty those valves are jason why are you covering up those dirty valves and not cleaning them i don't have a good answer for you i think the the quick answer is i'm lazy and it works so i was asking charles oh about what you guys used to do the dealership because volkswagens often have this carbon deposit issue with direct injection engines yeah and there's a cool tool that i thought was neat if you want to describe yeah really the best way to take care of that carbon buildup once it's become a problem there's probably some maintenance things you could do along the way to prolong the life of that or prevent it for a longer period of time i should say but what we would do is we had an insert that went into the intake manifold runner shopback goes on the top and then a wand goes on the inside that wands connected to a media blasting machine and we would basically walnut blast it and you could go in in about 30 seconds per cylinder get them completely cleaned obviously with the intake valves closed is a vital part of that to the other method which does work okay and it's probably a pretty good diy solution is to use carburetor cleaner and like brushes a zip ties bound together works really really well too and you can get in there the problem that is you're huffing all these chemicals like it's right in your face so not my favorite method of doing it but it does work and i you know i think for this that there was carbon buildup this is always going to be a direct injection issue when it's only direct injection i think you're gonna be just fine just gonna be just fine i'm happy with that answer things are rolling right along we're on rollers - oh yeah we are the things that are rolling on and so mostly what we've been working on this morning has been intercooler related so the intercooler has gone on there's some shrouding that wraps around it then take off trimmed up the side get a little cutting over there you got a water pump some hosing some routing the reservoir reservoir goes in i must say the reservoir bracket has probably been the most satisfying installation up to this point yeah the reservoir bracket is you know it makes you excited and you and you kind of wish every other bracket was just as good and then the hose that's going to the pump also the way it fits in and it's preformed and it just has all the right bands and plenty of clearance everywhere it goes which is super exciting which is not the story for the two of top coming from the back of the intercooler the big challenge is the steering column so there's a little a little bolt in that steering column and as you rotate it around it wants to tap on those two coolant hoses which obviously you don't want to do that yeah the the space over there is considerably tighter and charles did a little convoluted oh yeah yeah i know i don't really actually love that convoluted tubing especially around coolant hoses it it never seems to fit quite right or look quite right to me but you know it's it's better than having no protection on those hoses there's various levels of protection available for any circumstance and it doesn't have to be so convoluted would you look at that we've got the supercharger in which wasn't super easy to do it's quite tight of a fit to get in there first time we tried and failed it's it's big it's heavy it's awkward and you really have to like position it correctly there's a lot going on behind it so we're hitting some there's two things you have to kind of keep in mind there's a bracket on the bottom that you don't want to knock and hit the wrong direction so you have to make sure this bracket is leaning forward and then also there's a crank breather hose that's plugged into this and it's long so that you can get it on before you dip it in there but then it's got all that extra hose that's getting caught as you're bringing it back so you got to make sure you can feed that breather hose as you drop it into place i don't want to say what i'm gonna say next but i'm gonna say it anyway so far i can tell you that's probably been the most challenging part of this this entire deal yeah getting the supercharger in yep so we still have our intercooler hoses kind of loose not perfectly positioned and so next we're gonna kind of focus on getting those in the right location so while charles is getting at those hoses situated and put into place i thought why not show you guys what's going on inside this supercharger and of what we doing a little work at the same time so we've got the this is actually the internals of the little root style supercharger that's going in this miata this is made by eaton it's very similar actually to the supercharger that goes in the shelby gt500 difference being this is significantly smaller and it's gonna make a little bit less power than a gt500 but overall it's pretty neat so these two rotors here root style supercharger and the tolerance between the rotors themselves as well as the rotors and the housing is about point zero zero one two point zero zero five inches so very tight tolerance to make sure you have a good seal for that airflow and basically how it works is you have some air coming in from this side right here these rotors will rotate like so and so right here is where it seals and you can see as this rotates that final little lobe right there closes off and forces the air below it regardless pretty neat to see the internals of this bad boy thank you to eaton for sending me this to show on video and is the install done are we done charles did was did i did i take long enough i guess i got to keep explaining this okay so really what's happening here hey guys back in for another with charles and jason how are we doing charles we're doing all right we yeah we're doing good we we got the charger in we got some some phantom belt action happening the charger is in it's a monumental thing as a monument is thing so one of the things was after that charger went in making sure that the hoses which as i was explaining how the supercharger worked charles was figuring out and there's plenty of space now as you can see between the steering column and those two hoses so we don't have to worry about those touching girls what were you doing in there also went ahead and added a little bit of isolation foam just to make sure like it's probably okay without just to make super sure that we don't have any hoes rubbage issues another interesting thing we got the idler in and the washer that comes with it to install it just fell right through it it seemed like it was size too small i'm not i'm not positive but i mean it just fell through it so yeah i'm wondering if it was maybe just the incorrect washer location because not only was the overall diameter too small the thickness was too small as well right luckily because i never throw anything away in my whole entire life i had a couple of extra washers that we went ahead and use so and then after that we had to bend the ac line charles how do you feel about bending ac i am zero percent a fan of bending ac lines you know i totally see though in this application the way it's set in the engine compartment makes a lot of sense and the alternatives are we completely reengineer the charger we include a new ac line which then means you have to evacuate and recharge your ac system which for the average di wire is not something they're gonna do not only that this is 1234 yf refrigerants so it's mad expensive that's what charles tells me yeah i mean the way that it is rounded in here all of the like the pulley connections are all very close to one another so it is compact and it looks smart once that ac line is bent out of the way but it's just a little nerve-wracking that you have to move something like that so next we're gonna get back under the car yeah we're gonna get more of this convolution going on on some of the hosts routing down there yep we got that we have our wiring for this is i think it's a throttle body connector extension extension and this is our wiring for that a coolant pump after that we have our intake system throttle body obviously has to go back on our intake system goes back in it retains the factory intake system just with an upgraded air filter also with the brake booster we have to extract a check valve out of the factory brake booster hose and install that in the new brake booster hose which looks pretty straightforward number three numero tres that is number three yep it is the morning of day number three so last night we pretty much finished getting the parts in the car yeah yesterday was a long day got the throttle body in air intake system in different throttle body boot which eliminates the fitting for the noise pipe yep some wiring routed it's a little bit of wiring routed doing a nice little cutout here for the battery that looks beautiful so the battery it's back in and then we bled the intercooler of air and that was like our first like not first but it was an issue there were plenty of issues it was an issue initially yeah well initially the pump wasn't coming on so some quick checks and ended up just turning it off and turning it back on again yeah unplug everything replug everything back in and now the pump works so that's great news had a little sploosh of coolant but that's okay yeah a little sploosh of coolant ok now you're not supposed to have air get fed through that pump but you know it happens and you just run it and over time you just bleed out those bubbles keep refilling it as you run it again and again and eventually you get all the air out yep we also modified the splash shield so that our coolant lines could run back up and through to to the reservoir which is pretty pretty straightforward and then also our steering column the hoses coming from this inner cooler the back of the intercooler had actually dropped down not really quite sure how but they drop down so reconnected those back up so that they are away from that steering column so you don't have to worry about those hoses and they're secure now it's also like a good example of like you need to go back and double-check even if you're a hundred percent sure just go back and put your eyeballs on it i think we had a near near near miss episode with the fuel line that neither one of us plug back in so thankfully we didn't cut the keyon before but yeah so when we were going to bleed the intercooler we had a we had an open fuel line ready to spray us yeah it's something right in the good thing we were all safety nothing hydrated stay hydrated can't happen on an electric car should about going to command if only it were a tesla alrighty every time if and there's a few things obviously we're gonna put back on but we're gonna start it up and see what happens and you know we want to be able to see any problems that might appear i got the juice ready if we need more juice charles got the juice ready for the intercooler let's do this cross your fingers all right charles is ready all clear i can tell it's early making way more power i can feel the power like emanating radiate yeah the car is back together is back together and now there's a supercharger in it oh it's not really with it beside it in it around it yeah all up in it so the last steps we have completed we got the wheels back on we got the fender liners back in we got the bumper back on all the bits and pieces le pan also charles you did a great job i think this is the best fitment my front bumper has ever had i would agree now that you have put your special touch on it it's very flush and it looks quite nice so i appreciate your assistance charles what i am curious about is your overall impressions putting this kit in what you thought in the process the kit itself yeah so overall a really solid kit i liked a lot about it i think the installation was pretty good pretty trouble-free the only real major issue we ran into and it wasn't even a major issue was that washer with the the pulley that i think could be problematic i think it's important to understand - like the instructions were really good - the hose routing that part i think could have had a little bit more clarity but these kits are generally not meant for like a basic diy er with a hundred tool you know a hundred piece tool kit yeah from the local hardware store they even call this out in their instructions like you should have a professional or someone with a lot of experience i don't know why you came to me for that but you did so it's awesome i sold you know out of ten i would say a solid nine that's drawing a little bit back from the the routing of the hoses i think could a little bit a little bit better and just bending cool just or the ac line yeah yes yes running the ac line right just i don't love it but we didn't have to drilling holes in the car or anything like that so one of the things i've been really by is how easy it is to find a car on auto temple know one of the things i've been really impressed by with this kit and part of why we did this here and not in my garage this time is we made zero parts tour trips that is weird but it feels awesome yeah that's like why didn't we have to go to the parts store yeah it is strange because we had to make probably a dozen for the s2000 mini which was because we're working in my garage we i feel like you have way more tools so there were often moments where you had a cool tool that was unique for the situation that we needed also you had a few spare parts like the pulley washer that wasn't correct you had extra 1 million zip ties a million zip ties i do have a couple zip ties in my garage i am an engineer after all you got to go to the basics when engineers are working on subtly break it down but overall impressed with the kit from that standpoint i also read through the instructions this time first rather than just hues starting huge so this is a much newer car than the s2000 so there were a lot of parts that i think on the s2000 we could have easily not replaced yes it just didn't make sense you know it's one of those while you're in there things break that's 2000 kit was a lot more it was injectors it was fuel system as well so from an ease of installation this i think was way easier yeah so after we had completed everything we went for a quick shakedown drive just to make sure give a last check over everything drive it around a little bit let things get up to temperature and hopefully it doesn't fall apart yeah pull it over where exactly that's important too to do that on such a major installation brought it back and got it back up in the air look for leaks make sure nothing that stuff was rubbing make sure all of our routing was was correct and yeah i think i think it's good i think it's ready to thrash yes so i am very excited about what is coming up next so i'm going to be doing before and after on the dyno i'm going to be doing acceleration runs and of course a proper test drive and how this thing behaves that it has a supercharger on it super excited about that that is all to come once again a big thank you to otto tempest for sponsoring the supercharger installation go find your miata or whatever car you want on auto tempest with the link in the video description in charles thank you so so much for your help i could not have done this without you i really appreciate it always always a good time and hey if you keep buying them we can keep supercharging them they just all have to be yellow they have to be yellow they have to be a roads through they have to be the exact same thing that sounds like pretty big victory if you guys have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave them below thanks for watching bye oh that was good we didn't even plan that wasn't even planned
