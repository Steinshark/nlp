ladies and gentlemen one of the most interesting elements of the game of chess is the fact that ai is better than any human will ever be ever i mean that's not an exaggeration ai has completely taken over in terms of being excellent to chess a human being can start at massive massive favorite in terms of odds and material computer will still wipe the floor with them and ai is really fascinating when they play against each other or when they are nerfed and they're different types of bot forms but in this video i'm going to give you a major piece of news among all the other amazing things that they've done over the last four or five years here in 2023 just developed a new chess bot a chess bot that is going to be the answer hopefully in the long run the stockfish stockfish is the king of chess engines the highest rated the winner of all the tournaments and this bot is called torch they called it torch and apparently it's already stronger than every other chessbot except stockfish and in this video i'm going to show you four games that it played against other really really really good chess bots including leela which is usually the one that's challenging stockfish you can read this article i'll put a link in the description it's a mix of people andrew grant who made the ethereal bot maybe not made but worked on an individual who worked on kivisto berserk dragon larry kaufman as a very very prominent grandmaster strong chess player and also a developer and yeah it's got a beautiful icon which kind of looks like the bishop on chess.com it was done with many open source tools i will leave all of this technical stuff to those of you interested and i'm just going to show you some of the games that this bot has played when it was known as a mystery bot it was playing games on chess.com as a mystery chess bot the games are fascinating so buckle up because these ai versus ai games are always super weird as always ai bots are programmed to play a pair of games against each other in a certain opening right so it allows them to be creative and come up with really interesting solutions because otherwise ai versus ai chess would be a draw they would play the metal line not to lose all the time the first game torch has the white pieces and plays the move d4 also one more thing i would like to say when i make these bot videos i try to break things down in a way that's accessible to the audience probably around 0.01 percent of you have a massive technical knowledge and understand how computers are programmed especially chess computers and you might sit there and cringe at some of the things i say please don't be offended like the stockfish developers or the developers of some of these pro like they obviously know the specifics a little bit deeper i'm trying to make this interesting and fascinating to people who don't know that stuff including myself so knight c3 g6 and bishop f4 so white is playing at joe bava london d4 knight at knight c3 and bishop f4 we know this bishop g7 and white plays queen d2 preparing for this very clearly indicating that this is going to happen and the bot with the black pieces excuse me there was no eval bar the bottom with the black pieces i love this it's torch versus ethereal and this is stockfish stockfish is watching two other boss play going yes yes they are fighting for my leftovers i don't know why stockfish is british c5 a declaration of hostility on this side of the board and obviously you know taking on c5 is a bit dangerous for black because black has to commit to this so black is just a pawn down but is trying to attack white in the center of the board stockfish on a little bit longer thought likes knight f6 it doesn't like the uber confrontational nature of this move because you actually invite the knight in like this knight to a6 castles e5 the knight goes to d6 but despite all of this the position remains relatively balanced and now torch plays bishop g5 actually there was a human game which went bishop g3 knight c5 in 2015 that's the incredible thing about chess there was a human game played at the world championship of blitz in berlin 2015. i didn't remember that off the top of my head i'm not a psychopath but it was played between sethuraman and romain edward two grand masters bishop g5 is an improvement black plays f6 attacking the bishop and now we don't have to wait very long torch unleashes all of its savagery in this position and plays the move e3 disconnecting the queen from the bishop so not only are you going to lose the bishop you you can't you don't even see the pawn anymore this is an incredible sacrifice and it's a massive justification of this move the bishop was sent out to die you may be wondering what's wrong with bishop h4 nothing just a matter of time this is coming this is gonna happen this is next this is next obviously i'm not saying the computer would lose its queen i'm just saying black wants to create an attack so white plays e3 completely seizing back control of the game very simply put if you take the bishop comes back and i have this i have this i have a cannon pointed at your king i'm just too fast here so you have to take on g5 it's a full piece a full piece has been given away but in that brief moment of thought torch is smart enough to realize it has incredible long-term prospects in the positions incredible move in chess the two most important things are material and king safety well look at the quality of the kings right and then after that it's a matter of peace activity and future prospects so these pieces have a lot of future prospects these pieces are a little bit stuck bit it trades its down material but it trades why does it trade that night is black's only active piece and black snide is targeting this so it just removes it there is something in chess called superseding concepts that's what i like to call it and the point is you don't want to trade if you're losing unless and that's what chess is it's unless unless trading lets you completely remove all of your opponent's active pieces black has no active pieces now and black's king is about to be opened up now black plays g4 simply to prevent the development of the knight and to open up this you know what's incredible white just plays king b1 why does in no rush sacked upon not in a rush to get it back why does a vc investor in series a okay white is going to get out 10 years from now and hope that the white's got a unicorn white's not looking for a for a for a bitcoin type of investment oh it's hot in the morning and now by the evening i you know i got three grand and that's it i'm out of there 97. and now white's like i gotta get these pieces into the game how do you get the rooks into the game without actually moving the rooks it's a riddle h3 black plays queen c7 white plays queen e2 hitting both pawns look at the subtle maneuvering black goes here white takes back i got news for you torches now no longer down any material and still has all of the benefits of the position here comes black rugby eight finding an attack rook to d3 the idea is rook f3 right black plays h5 but i thought the idea was well the idea my friends of rook to d3 was that after black plays queen a5 white would play this sacrificing the the rook but the attack on the king is decisive it's insanity what these computers do they are other worldly levels of good rook d3 was as much of an offensive move as it was a defensive move it wants to go to b3 but also it's happy to go to f3 and attack as well bishop takes g4 the rook is very useful the queen goes behind the rook white takes takes takes and plays rook g3 and now we see the rook in action and despite black being up a piece the entire game the piece just can't actually be utilized queen g5 and now e6 cutting the circulation of the black position if queen takes we seize the e file so there's this we seize the e-file anyway rook g4 putting the rook completely on pre that rook can be taken by a full battery but if you take it like this rookie 7 and i win so h3 takes takes and now a very cool common collected b3 style points on the other side of the board preventing any sort of attack and back rank checkmate rook f5 knight knight takes and now it's just a matter of cleaning up and this is a winning end game it's a winning end game because the queen and the rook are going to get to the king and also the c pawn is a passer and it takes a while these games obviously the engines slowly squeeze the life out of each other and also they don't they don't you know blunder like humans it takes a little while but slowly but surely black is going to lose all of their pawns and it turns into this end game of rook in a million pawns but the rook is decisive and even winning in style points at the end it sacrifices the rook to get king and five pawns and black is just stretched too thin white walks up to the king and there's just absolutely nothing to be done game goes on white wins what an incredible game punctuated by e3 and a little bit later the sacrifice of the rook for absolutely nothing what a win against ethereal now i got three more games for you that's the amazing part of this video i got three more games to show you all right here's another game this game torch played d4 and played the immediate bishop g5 like a like a like a pseudo trumpowski if you will e4 a little gambit and again a very typical position of these lines where you know you're creating attacking possibilities over here and now we have the first new move of the game white has a little bit of nagging pressure on the king side and and black can't castle so easily but black is doing okay f3 right trying to get rid of the pawn to get a little bit of development i've had positions like this actually in my life black cannot take on d5 black cannot take on d5 because this move would force a block and then you would win here also bishop c4 like it's just it's all very very vicious so bishop e2 bishop g4 so far nothing special bishop takes f3 and in this position white can obviously take back with either piece but torch plays d6 bishop takes knight and this lunatic plays d6 and the idea is very very simple first of all i have no idea why you wouldn't go here apparently queen d6 and black and castle so to prevent black from castling white shreds open the position now if you take i don't actually go here i do this and i attack your queen two different ways so you would have to play this and then i would go here and now your king is suffocating your king is just stuck in the center for the rest of the game insane insanity so black decides to save the bishop now black is up a piece again d e here pawn to g3 do you know what the idea of ponto g3 is the computer finds the absolutely ridiculous idea of knight to d7 shook to f1 pawn to g3 prevents the queen from getting in on this diagonal and enables a calm reroute of the bishop while the black king is choking on a fishbone and is stuck in the center of the board this is madness bishop f1 with the rook staring down the bishop is rerouting the queen is knocking on the door the black king has to pay the rent they have i mean but he's stuck he can't do anything rook to g8 bishop to h3 white has achieved an absolutely perfect position so now dragon starts firing back with b5 and now rook f1 shifts the focus offering up the pawn to be taken but this move would obliterate because after this there's rook f6 knight f6 and queen g5 and you cannot defend the knight you could do this you're gonna lose your queen so rook f1 black plays queen e5 and the attack just continues bishop takes knight white does not repeat moves takes rook f1 rook e1 ig4 counter attack queen just slides back to h3 the knight infiltrates blocking the rook's attack and now the queen is hanging but queen g7 excuse me queen h7 thus settles the pressure paid off and torch with its absolutely lunatic sacrifice just marching forward leaving the bishop completely uncapturable transforms this position into a winning end game and this is straightforward you infiltrate you pressure you kick the bishop out you don't repeat the moves get in with the rooks and as long as you transform correctly you're going to win it puts its pieces on all the right squares many dark squares configurations rook a5 and now it's just a matter of winning all the pawns it wins one of them it marches forward it wins another one it's not really interested in going for b6 because the king is hunted the pawns are promoting and it wins the game by checkmate after 73 moves it is a brutal brutal machine this torchbot and it had another game versus dragon dragon tried to play the french defense the french is almost refuted at engine level like computers slaughter each other in the french this is called the mccutchen variation i've played the mccutchen variation myself with black against humans and i've had good success you each pin each other so there's e5 okay this the bishop goes back to c1 anticipating knight e4 capture here and then the bishop coming to this diagonal so this knight e2 defense a3 and now torch plays a gambit the idea of this gambit is to deflect the central pawn to take the knight that is the major idea black plays h5 so black doesn't do that queen h3 and that's a new move queen f3 has been played in the past queen h3 has not been played g4 queen goes back to the center and we have a lot of pawns that are facing each other dragon takes on c3 takes like this the bishop is still hanging but black plays this very creative queen c7 and we have the following position all torch has in this position is a central pawn advantage it is doing a very nice job controlling the center it's got opportunities to play knight b5 as long as it doesn't lose its queen it can attack with any of these pawns and it's going to choose a way to castle it has a nice central bind so how is one bot going to destroy another bot from a position of a mild advantage a6 h3 we've been here before activating the rook without actually moving the rook pawn takes rook takes knight c6 long castles it's getting all the pieces into the game and when it is ready it is going to demolish bishop to d7 black would like to castle how do you prevent your opponent from castling by not letting them castle and the incredible thing about this position is e5 just can't be taken because after take take the bishop is pinning the knight to the rook so knight f3 and if you play f6 which looks like you make it out unscathed you don't i'm gonna win h5 i'm gonna play a four you're gonna be a clean pawn down and i'm gonna have a g pawn not any good queen g5 bishop takes d4 a massive exchange and bishop to a4 as dragon threatens to checkmate torch now torch is rated like 3 600 so torch saw that by some sort of miracle and not only did torch see that computers play such ridiculously anti-human anti-positional anti-logic moves in this position with every major piece that black has active not that one black is staring at c2 right so white needs to focus on this side of the board and try not to get checkmated alright maybe queen d2 to play defense no torch plays c4 i mean it's staring into the barrel of the gun and shoves its forehead into it like in the movies you know i i mean really really wicked stuff and all it wants is i mean it wants black to take you know why not because it's gonna take back because it wants to go here wants to move the bishop and black block their own attack that's the idea it's not that we want to trade and then i'm going to be attacking your queen no no the computer wants to go here because now that black's pawn is just stuck now white is the one calling the shots so black does not take black goes here looking for a queen trade just goes king b1 you know why because if it takes on before i'm not going to take and let the queen in i'm gonna take you could go here to try to get the queen in d6 queen goes here look still looking to go over here and take the bishop so dc4 bishop goes back to e2 as we discussed pawn takes rook f3 threatening a checkmate king a1 completely safe looks like black is a menacing attack but black is too slow now i take you go here and in this position white plays the top computer move king a2 defending its pawn from the rook and defending against any check in the future on the dark squares queen h4 and now white's queen begins look at this queen h8 queen h1 like a pendulum queen h8 forcing the queen back queen h1 if the queen were to come back to c5 and repeat moves the computer would rotate this way so instead bishop takes f3 taking the rook she takes queen b1 queen h8 queen h1 queen b1 are you kidding me bishop d3 queen it went there there there and there and now apparently white is winning because the black i mean this is this is wicked stuff pawn takes on f6 and white slowly bothers the black king into the center of the board and gets into what is once again a winning end game queen to be won preventing rook c2 check if you play queen takes f3 i get rook g7 and i have a checkmate so instead for the third game in a row the game ends via end game up multiple pawns just a matter of time until we hunt down black we force some sort of exchange queen b5 rook b7 or we just win all of black's pieces it takes 72 moves and this time torch wins again torch found we nature queen h1 sacrificed its rook rotated the queen the other way and just launched an attack from there but if you thought this was impressive it won another game it defeated leela leela is no joke leela is very clearly the number two engine in the world i mean komodo is up there but i told you the french defense is very difficult for bots it's very very tough to play the french was a bot when you're when you're 3600 in this game black plays an advanced french bishop d3 and black plays like this trying to take a bunch of space bishop here and essentially what leela does is it tries to close down the position doesn't allow white to break down the structure so white takes on passion and plays knight e5 oops evaluation the idea being that if you take the knight has nowhere comfortable to go if you play there it's queen h5 if you play here it's just a matter of time i can also take try to win this pawn back with something like queen g4 so instead of that black castles all a computer needs is the slightest of advantages the slightest of imbalances and right now white has that with good control in the center and the bishop staring in this direction knight t2 knight f3 knight g4 an interesting move removing the knight from the center but removing the knight from the defense of the king black plays knight e4 trying to block white plays queen beat look at this look at these sickening stuff trying to just obliterate black on that diagonal now if black plays bishop g6 which looks very natural white would immediately go back if black tries to do this white is going to take white is going to replace the knight with the knight white is going to force the queen back and then white is going to play g4 and then after this white is going to take and then after takes what is going to take and then after taste what is going to take and then there's going to be this and this so at the end of all that despite pushing pawns in front of its king torch would be up a pawn with massive weaknesses and a very very dominant position so queen b1 black decides you can take my knight take take take nope because after this it's a repetition of moves the white queen is trapped it doesn't want to draw so it plays a3 preventing b4 now black could of course play a5 king h8 now you take what is the difference is knight g5 i am not looking to take this could that have happened last move could you have played take take a knight g5 potentially but there was clearly something that white did not like so it played a3 allowed the king to go there so it could get stuck on the h7 square and now it played knight to g5 take take and now the queen goes back to its home square now one thing about this position opposite side color opposite color bishops benefit the attacking side because the bishop cannot defend against the attacking bishop these pawns are very ugly they're doubled isolated pawns and white could potentially try to eat them up so let's see what it does h5 knight to e3 black plays king h7 creating a light squared blockade and now tries to get rid of the pawn take take but here comes white and here comes white on d6 wins a pawn but black activates the knight and oh my goodness wow leela fighting back getting the knights of the d3 score very annoying position how's george going to get out of this because the knight is too strong it's too strong to be to to be dealt with so easily yeah bishop h4 you just gotta wait gotta be patient rook d6 looking for an opportunity black trades off white's only active rook white is losing its advantage rotating the knight to the center rook c5 queen d5 queen d7 not easy to convert but now bishop g3 you know what the idea is this stopping the movement of black's pawns now queen e2 now rook d1 and now f3 in this position torch found that it could reroute its knight to d4 put its king on a dark square play here put his bishop on a dark square play here play queen e2 rook d1 and f3 this is the only possible way forward for it to win the game pawn takes knight takes knight is going here that is why we played h for a long time ago i told you opposite side opposite obstacle bishops benefit the attacking side look at the attacking side look at the queen e3 a lot of progress infiltrating queen a7 rook a8 and that is apparently the losing move queen d5 had to be a little bit more stubborn if you try to go here queen e7 excuse me queen e7 is the move played in the game rookie eight queen is booted right well for like the third or fourth time in this video torch does not remove its queen from activity and instead torch sacrifices oh my goodness it's forcing a full capture but the knight gallops in do you know why this knight got to e6 it's because a little while ago white played this move h4 came up with this plan to transfer the night white saw something like this happening when white played knight to c2 whites move on move 34 contributes to the move on move 53 because the knight rerouted rerouted to f3 used the h pawn anchored to g5 and went to e6 and you get a sacrifice with a threat of checkmate black has to lose the queen because otherwise it's check king h7 knight g5 here here here and mate so black has to lose the queen and now the queen is going to brutalize everybody you play b4 because you want to create a pass pawn you want to create a pass pawn you're looking to create a pawn and balance on that side of the board that's the way you're going to win your king is safe you got to push your pawns you're not worried about your king too much knight t3 not repeating the pawn is going to be the deciding factor there it goes there it goes it's made it all the way to a7 this is a massive problem and queen f5 sacrifices the queen to make a new one but black is still creating some practical chances but queen b7 threatens mate forces the rook the queen still doesn't allow the pawn to push queen h2 the game is over now you're gonna hunt the black pieces queen f6 that's it queen g3 mate so many incredible sacrifices ridiculous queen pendulum that you saw in the third game a tactical and positional awareness and a very strong sense a lot of these games were played at different time controls which is why i kind of gave the caveat in the intro that the people who are watching this who are actual computer developers probably have their complaints and gripes but shaz.com is behind us and chess.com is is they're big they can definitely fund a research and development for this and who knows we might be looking at a potential challenger to stockfish one day say hello to torch everybody now get out of here
