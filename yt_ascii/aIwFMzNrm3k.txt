i really appreciate andrew kelly i'm very curious what they have to say here because it looks like we got loris and kelly writing on this one so bounties damage open source projects if i'm not mistaken there was just a 5 000 bounty for something to do with zig and wasm all right so here we go wasmore just offered a 5 000 reward for the first developer to add support for was and wazex in the zig ecosystem okay so i assume this is what's spawning this article which is very very interesting because i in some sense even without reading andrew kelly's comments and all that i can see the benefit the benefits being you get people who can get excited who are motivated to contribute who can come in and actually be able to not only get paid for what they do right because that's a big complaint about open source is that you don't get paid for this kind of work and so this is like one opportunity to bring in value so that someone could actually say they can you know make more money or live off of open support so that's nice right that's a that's a nice nice moment and so i can totally buy that one i think the downside without even reading this yet is that you also get a bunch of people who don't necessarily care about the ecosystem or the project really have any of it best in mind so you maybe you get a ton of lower quality contributions trying to rush in to get the money and it becomes like a race probably causes a bunch of drama probably causes a whole bunch of issues that's kind of like how i see probably where this is going to go i don't know it's a curious thing so let's find out all right please don't use bounties to incentivize zig development okay this blog post got inspired by the github issue a few days ago right here okay here's some reasons why we believe bounties are poor form of sponsorship when it comes to software development bounties foster competition at the expense of cooperation that's a very that's an extremely fair take that's an extremely fair take right there which is that you don't like if there's one five thousand dollar bounty and you and somebody you don't know are both pretty close to getting something done you won't collaborate to get the best solution you would fight against each other trying to be the first person and hide your solution whatever it is i think that's an extremely extremely fair take right there but but one thing it does do which isn't quite here which is in if you're not fully involved on the project on the getting paid side you pretty much are guaranteed a life of never getting anything in that kind of sense so maybe there's that i think tj would probably have a pretty interesting take on this tj do you want to come jump on all right so hey tj you're our core maintainer of neovim you've worked in open source quite a bit you've done a lot of stuff with source graph i assume there's some open source stuff with that you've even been paid sponsored for a full month of open source work so you do have at least some good idea of what's going on here yeah i'm sorry i do have to admit i pre-watched this article already i've already read it so okay well you've processed your thoughts that could be good you could help guide me if i'm not going to cancel imagine putting a video out where you've already processed the thoughts [laughter] anyways what were you wondering it's a mistake i you know what i'll see you again it's a mistake wait dang it wrong one it's a mistake tj's our streamer i know i kicked myself out this is my stream now all right people are saying tj your voice is a little bit lower i made a little bit louder okay so maybe they're maybe they're just saying my voice is lower oh yeah i didn't even think about that that's a good call all right so let's go with point one bounties foster competition at the expense of cooperation how do you feel about this i think that i'm just going to give you my quick one which is that there's a certain price level i think that exists that perhaps that can happen at but i can also see that there's some nice level of smaller many small bounties in which could still foster communication and collaboration as opposed to competition if you're earning fifty dollars a bug and there's hundreds of bugs and you're just like hey what do you think about you know like to me that just seems like a more collaborative way whereas one big one is you know it's kind of all in on this one thing and so you're kind of meant to keep your cards close to your chest what do you think i would say it depends who's hosting the bounty one of the things is like if an extra so you have a project like zig right there's a lot of design space to like solve the problems right it's not just like oh i have this typescript library and it doesn't run on windows or something like that right okay okay that's a clear like the clear solution is it should act just the same on both systems right yeah like for zig the way that you would solve like wazex is not like a clear one two three steps right so if you have someone outside of the zig community or like the zig leadership team posting a bounty it makes that person like not want like they're not going to want to cooperate with zig right because they're like well i want to be the one that gets the bounty and all the stuff right like a sufficient enough bounty to actually make someone want to do it probably like makes them not want to collaborate with other people like in in these kinds of spaces i agree with you that like suppose you have a project where you have a lot of these little bugs and your primary sort of like blocker is literally time right yeah and you for some reason have you know like twenty thousand dollars or something that like oh someone sent us this to like do bounties and you're the one as the project maintainer like posting that these can get money for fixing that feels a lot different than like an external thing is like exerting their force on the project yeah they're kind of steering the focus of zig by putting in my i can see i that's a that's about that's a very valid take because maybe zig has a different direction it's currently focused on and now you're kind of diverting resources people are abandoning their current work or things maybe aren't happening the way you want them to happen yeah that's that's that's totally fair take like from an outsider's perspective looking into zig like andrew kelly seems to have a very like firm handle on what he wants to do and sort of like ordering of those things and i think like most people just have no experience and or like i don't know like political capital or i don't know what you would want to say like credibility i guess of being able to prove that they can also do that right you know yeah that's fair that's fair like i don't just trust a random person to guide zig compared to andrew kelly he's been doing it for many years and actually built quite a successful piece of software so yes it does yeah when you think about how successful zig is i think you have to give a lot of credit right yeah to andrew kelly and so sort of like other people putting this external pressure having people fight instead of like working together because it is really complicated like for five grand or whatever right if someone like helps you should you send them a couple hundred dollars of that bounty right like you know what i'm saying it's a very classic it's a it's a very classic problem here right it's almost like it's almost the prisoner conundrum kind of going on except for there's a bounty right how much information do you wish to get about because it could cause issues it's very interesting okay don't don't by the way tj do not get distracted by any cars arguments or anything like that i want to stay focused chad's just saying i haven't mentioned oh camel by the way by the way you like okay we're right yeah i do it's very fun i see bounties are utterly simplistic way of dealing with business management side of creating software instead of scouting for suitable candidates you are letting battle royale dynamics pick a winner for you at the expense of everybody who's going to lose the competition so again i i personally would say that this makes more sense in these one-time really large items but if you had again 200 bugs 50 each i don't think that i i think this this is a maybe a different kind of thing and probably what you're saying if you had the if you had zig foundation do it versus wasimer guy do it right so and and also like it it doesn't necessarily get you the best person to solve it it gets you the person that can solve it the fastest like that's so that's that's this idea of the suitable candidate right where like maybe it would actually be better to wait three more months and someone gets unblocked from this and now they get to work on that right so it's fair that's a really fair take because there's a lot of problems down the road that may crop up due to a certain implementation over another one yes this is software right so you would prefer to find like the best person and then the best solution instead of like whatever one's fastest i think we can all sort of agree like if we just did like our day job for this and your manager was just like hey anybody who finishes this first that they get paid and nobody else does you be like i don't know that that's really gonna you know foster the best situation for us to solve technical problems all of a sudden i hate my co-workers yes all right let's see instead of creating a clear contract where you take some risk you implicitly put the entirety of the risk on the contestants okay partial solutions don't get any payout yeah that's where the collaboration probably would you do that instead of allocating time and resources to proper dude before we go yeah we'll go on the next one that's also saying like suppose you find out that it doesn't work then the company gets off scot-free and that person just wasted like three weeks or something yep right yes that's true and someone else can take their partial solution and get the payout without any requirements or or any linking to prior credit effectively yeah but also like so suppose you get 80 of the way and it like kind of does what they want like maybe it would be enough to get the bounty or whatever but andrew kelly you know doesn't want to put it in zig you're going to be like really upset right so you're gonna be like pushing super super hard to get that put in right so this is where like you're feeling all the risk as the as the solver right that like oh i just spent 80 hours on this and i'm gonna get zero dollars yes because i didn't accept the thing and you're just like right you know depending on the bounty or whatever it is right but so so there's some like oh that's that you know and to be clear like i don't think andrew is saying you know bounty should be illegal he's asking them not to do it for sick they think zig's not well suited for this problem you know what i mean like yeah the reasons why they think it's going to lead to perverse outcomes yeah no that that's also fair and he might even do bounties himself for zig but like you said it's it's a difference of who's controlling the bounties and the narrative really of zig yeah instead of allocating time and resources to proper due diligence you instead penalize any form of thoughtfulness in favor of reckless action absolutely yeah right a solution that just needs to pass the test suite right instead of planning for the full cycle of software which includes maintenance you end up with quickly a bit rotting artifact that is of no practical use to anybody nice maybe that it's a little harsh on that one because it sounds like there would be practical use if it fits some sort of thing but right you don't have the maintainer you don't have the person that's continuing to make it work and then it does fall behind and does become bit rot that eventually is useless because it's so far out of date instead of spreading unease to all people involved it would be prefer it would be preferable you instead learned how to do business properly oh my god i did i forgot that this line was in yeah i mean that's an intense one i i don't necessarily disagree with it because i you know i i don't think the intentions of wasmer was bad and i think it was something that probably made people excited and he thought he's probably doing something good right just charitable reading the situation is we have some money we're a startup we really want this here let's just help make people excited about it but reality doesn't look that way and so now it's just it probably is poor business as well and so now no one's happy with the outcome of this on projects less radical than zig i'm not sure what radical means other than like radical in this situation totally around it's totally rads bro you might also put pressure on development team to accept the winning submission which given above or given the above will probably not be the most well thought out and maintainable solution saying yeah they're basically saying hey zig's not gonna just accept something because of this but because we actually know what we want but less people like there's that's not true of every project right like if you get a well thought out pr from like some some amount of well thought out right that passes tests and has all this stuff and it just shows up on your doorstep that's like it's going to be very hard to say no this is like a super common problem in oss is the like maintainer doesn't have a vision of what the project should be and so they accept when other people do stuff instead of being like honestly like very pedantic even about really small stuff on neovim we like we have literally a list you can read it in the help of help dev dash naming of how to name every kind of function or different things in the api and like what verbs you're allowed to use and what names you're allowed to do right and i've actually said i don't like them but i understand them like i've said that more than once that i'm not a huge fan of some of those things because i like the more namespace approach but at the end of the day it actually makes sense like it actually helps me reason about it in a more complete way and i discover new methods because i generally get the idea of how you've chosen these names right and so sometimes you know like in this case come on the oven core by the way i meant telescope by the way okay yeah just sometimes from an outside perspective those things like aren't clear you know you could easily imagine creating some bounty that's gonna like go against something that you have as the vision and that's going to create a lot of problems especially if they're from this it sounds like there was no sort of like ahead of time chatting with zig people about doing this right yeah and i think that could have been you know if that would have been done a you would have known not to do it or b you could have done it but with a more thought through process maybe several milestones could have been made 500 for the person that you know spikes this out and gives a clear you know you know and then made a bunch of little ones you know along the way some i don't know there could have been an alternative that would have been more healthy all right right while we do understand that continued exposure to venture capital might have caused some to build an appreciation for endless rat racing we currently request that you keep unwarranted hustling away from the zig community we are not only building free open source software but most importantly we're building software you can love and this can be only done by employing well-designed business management processes that one i'm not as like i'm not i don't think that's the only way that you can possibly make software that people can love i think lots of people like lots of different pieces of software like a lot of people even like you know google docs right yeah like yeah i find it really nice yeah it's like actually pretty good like for what it is you know and like hopefully it's still here in six months you never know yeah not with google but but i get what you're saying but so you you know like i enjoy using that when i have to i guess compared to other solutions you know and so i think i just it's a little stronger stance than i would take i'm willing to say that it's possible to make software that people can love without it being open and free and without well-designed business management but there's this thing that's cropping up and i i saw it with the node versus bun drama as well which is one of the arguments is this open process for change and it's free and open source and that's why it's good and it's just like that's not a good definition of why something is good or bad like a lot of people are excited about bun because it solves a bunch of problems and it's also venture capital backed that could be a good thing like it can just simply be a good thing to have venture capital but i do agree that it does cost point fast that's the point about actually oh sorry go ahead i was gonna say the i do understand this with the endless rat racing where maybe the wasmer person is under pressure to release something that involves you know wasm in relation to their new standard wazex or whatever it was called in which is causing him to put pressure on this which is causing this rat race which is causing all these problems and so i i get the critique so what were we saying about dax i do love dax in this base to take this dax's point about you know like jared actually can keep pushing through in on bun because he doesn't have to worry about where he's going to get his paycheck for tomorrow right yeah at some point they're gonna have to make money and that does change maybe how you're gonna do some things but also it's possible that bun would have never come into existence without the vc right so there is some some difficulty there in the in that yeah yeah all right we do believe all right so a word about bug bounties we do believe bug bounting is like the one offered by tiger beetle can be a virtuous way of sponsoring development since they are focused on a discovery aspect of software defects defects yes it is possible for different people to independently discover the same bug but that's an unlucky coincidence not a structural aspect of a resulting system i honestly yeah so i i checked this one out and this is more like tiger beetle was looking i think for people to try and like okay find a way to break this thing oh okay so this was like more like you break it we give you something yeah that's my so i don't 100 understand everything about it but that's my understanding of what this is which is definitely very different you know the push it can result in the same thing though yes but the like the difference i think is that when you find you find an error that error like actually exists right yes but when you're putting something and you're pushing some design constraint or direction change onto a project it doesn't have to be that way correct right so those are sort of i think there's a very big difference about trying to exert direction of a project via bug bounties versus like making sure that you know your project actually is able to do what it says and paying and like compensating people for that work right yeah bug bounties do seem like a pretty reasonable way to like make that happen the thing is i know don't like the term virtuous in this because it it's a different application it makes software more resilient as opposed to adding new features which could be unresilient but it causes the exact same thing right you have unlucky coincidence of finding bugs you're less likely to work for somebody else when as those bug bounties get larger right there's a lot of that you get all the same effects just not some of the same yeah right some of the same problems listed above do seem like they would apply to bug bounties yeah so i don't feel like it's it's somehow more virtuous i think that it's just simply better for software it's probably a better way of putting it it's better for the direction of software because you can find critical bugs that you would not have found otherwise because it's just simply a time in timeout problem like you just have to look meticulously until define the other the other thing too is like if you think about incentives of the system right you're if you find a critical bug in a system you are incentivized to take advantage of that right like that's the incentive yeah obviously like hopefully you have this is foreign but like if you found one you're incentivized not to so they're trying to create like a different incentive to change it so that you reveal that thing and then users aren't hurt right so that's like that seems like an objective like when that's good i also don't necessarily love virtuous but that's like i get what they're trying to say about they're trying to say like it's it's a good way of doing it i guess maybe they really mean something in particular by using virtuous i don't know yep let's see oh click that if you're interested in investing in the zig ecosystem we're happy to chat with you and give you all the necessary insight both when it comes to the project's roadmap in terms of public publicizing the opportunity within the community to help you find a suitable candidate we do expect that you treat your collaborators with respect they deserve for more info talk to loris which by the way i believe he streams zig pretty regularly right i think it does yeah yeah yeah yeah kristoff would be his name on twitch that's true which always throws me off it does throw me off because every time i read this i do that i have a tran i have a map in my head built there's three there's three three like just levels of checking it's like reading very deeply nested java classes it's like reading wheel of time and trying to remember what this character did because there is only 2800 yeah shooting the person's name trying to connect that to some character that doesn't match at all from the books if you're trying to figure out how does this make sense you're like ah it's a gleaman introduced late in the show probably tom marilyn from the beginning of the show you know you're never gonna meet him again though good luck see ya anyways all right that was great yeah i really like this my only overall thing and i've seen this a lot lately is this continuous like bashing on vc and the virtuousness of foss i i don't think they're separate but overall i think this is a really good kind of reminder that working with people creating software is a much better way than we'll give them the benefit of the doubt just being too excited and not thinking through your actions and what the consequences could do yeah i mean i think like it's pretty easy to think that doing a bug bounce or doing like a bounty for a feature is really nice because you're trying to pay people to do the work instead of just like taking advantage of them yeah right i like i think that that even if it even if that's not how i would do it right like i i can see why people would think that that's good so if you compare it to like how we do it for neovim is that basically the only way that you can get paid for working on neovim is if you're a long time contributor and then you have a chance to work on neovim full-time for at least a month so like and we don't we don't necessarily we generally have some idea of like what you're gonna try and accomplish over that month right you know like i've done it twice one for rewriting a bunch of the diagnostics and like lsp stuff inside of neovim so that we could have sort of this way that people could like configure because before the our like first version you had to basically do a ton of copying pasting to get anything working right yeah and then the second one was when i did like an exploratory project to see if we could transpile vim9 scripts i remember that when you streamed a lot of that one yeah that was super cool it was a super light project yeah and i mean that was pretty much because no one wanted to do that and it was going to take a ton of time and i was like well i'll do it i have like some time i can take off for a month but i wouldn't i just wouldn't have done it if i wasn't getting paid at all right because i was like i have other stuff that would be more fun than like learning vim9 script like you know i'm a top expert he's a nine script but that's i mean that's the thing is that even people go oh well building a compiler and getting paid for that that had to be super cool it's like it is cool to an afternoon extent and maybe two afternoon extends but when you're in the thick of it and you're having like a singular token issue that's leading to all these offsets and building out all these tests it becomes very unfun fast so that's awesome right so anyway and like i wouldn't have taken full time to do it right like i took time off and did a bunch of stuff so i could do it so i i really like that kind of model where it's possible right where because then you're basically like getting a chance to reward contributors we've had people be able to work on neovim full-time that like would not be able to afford working on neovim otherwise like they they're not like independently wealthy in such a way that they could take time off or whatever right and we're able to like pay them to do that right which is awesome to get to do and there's been contributors that have gotten to do that because of that right but we've basically like there was some bounty work and some stuff at the beginning of neovim but we've long since like stopped that i think basically for very similar reasons to those listed in zig and i think sponsoring like people's work it is much more like effective way to drive something forward in a sustainable way than trying to like put a bunch of random carrots attached to different issues especially without conversations with the people actually managing the vision and direction of the the project yeah i think that's fair i like that take i think that's pretty good parasocial fix says how do you find those people you know when it comes to a lot of these open source larger projects people just naturally gravitate towards it that are interested i mean i don't think neovim is out there advertising they need devs there's probably plenty of people that are attempting to make some sort of small change that there's a lot of guidance for and those who just you know find it a labor of love continue on and then they get the opportunity to have something nice like you picked it because you enjoyed the project and then you eventually got paid for it and probably you'll never get paid enough for the time you spent on it but yes you still got something outrageous very bad you're you're it's not good it's not something you'd write home about but it's pretty cool so you know you got to be happy about that yeah i think the other thing about like a style like what neil them has is it it's very easy to not let money like affect regular contributions and stuff like that like the distinction is very very clear and obvious right where you basically say hey like you've earned a lot of credibility in this community and you have some big project that you want to do we can sponsor that work for a set amount of time that's like very clear and it doesn't make it sort of this weird thing where now all of a sudden you feel like you should be getting money all of the time right which that that's really that's really complicates how a project works yeah no i i agree with all that okay i think i i think we all agree with this hey tj you stream right i do when are you gonna release a youtube video when are you gonna release a youtube video holy cow good question i think i'm gonna i think i'm gonna record my talk that i did at jane street pretty soon and we'll i'll upload that okay i think that'd be a lot of i think that'd be a lot of fun can i live read about the video then by the way yeah you can react it'll be kind of long it'll well it'll be too long for you to yeah yeah maybe i can make a youtube short that you can react to i like it i like it all right hey take care tj i appreciate that yep see you chat have a good day everybody bye i like that one i actually like that a lot hey the name is oss is pretty dang complicated you know you know like you can't people want to be paid for their time but it's hard to pay people for the time and then you have to go through a series of hoops and difficult things to make people get paid for the time and it's really just non-trivial it's the difficulty of trying to run any single company but it's mostly free again
