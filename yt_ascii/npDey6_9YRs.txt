i wouldn't get that item. i didn't know i wouldn't

my arms started to hurt. - $5,312. i can't pay you this month. - sorry buddy, i got
you a controller though. - yeah, i can't eat a controller, chris. - i appreciate you buying

- [cameraman] bubble gum? - that would be extremely smart. - [cameraman] all right,
you can't put it down now. that was a dumb idea. you don't even have... you
don't have hands anymore. don't drop it, chandler. chandler, this was a waste. - all right boys, here
we go, the holy grail. - [cameraman] chandler,
you're getting pretty high up. chris spent five grand,
you've spent like $40. - i wanna put that underneath everything. - there's literally no way. - [cameraman] oh, i
thought that was chandler. that was chris. chandler, the trade off. - you can't suck that hard. you do suck, but not that hard. - [mr. beast] all right
chandler, i feel bad. go to electronics to get one
expensive thing, come on. - it's getting kinda heavy. - yeah, let's do that. (chandler shouts) - i just touched you. why did you react that way? - [mr. beast] chill,
you're making a scene. - [chris] chandler, you lost. - [cameraman] it's literally glued on. - i was just trying to help
you get the harry potter- - you scared me. - how did i scare you? - 'cause you tickled my neck. i won't be able to eat for a week. he said he didn't have
money to pay me to eat. - i got an imac. - i got sweaty hands. okay, somebody... - [chris] no, we're just gonna watch. - sadly, you fumbled the bag. next store. pick your store. i think one of them's a tractor store. - gamestop, whoa! - [mr. beast] okay.

forgot to have you roll the die. guys, she forgot to roll
the die, what do we do? - the sun's 93 million miles away. - how are we gonna resurrect her? - [mr. beast] i forgot,
you guys are not helpful. can you roll this? - [woman] absolutely. three minutes?
- [mr. beast] three minutes. okay, starting now, three minutes. - can i get a ps3, a
nintendo and a switch? give me that egg. - [staff] you want an egg?

recording in the store? - she has a minute and a half left. you leave, we're not allowed
to record in here, go. - [chris] that's a gamecube controller. - [woman] let's get another one. - all right, she has a full load. we couldn't record. - [cameraman] look at that. - that's it. - she maximized the square footage. - so you might be wondering,
where did this all come from? - gamestop. - no, actually it came from
shopmrbeast, go buy right now. it's redemption time. chandler gets target. roll the die. safe item. now this one has a little twist because target always kicks us out. so if we get kicked out
chandler, you get nothing. if you drop anything or get
kicked out, you get nothing. also you get a safe item. if we get kicked out, you
still get your safe item. (clock ticks) - [staff] hey guys,
you have get permission from target to video in here. - that was record timing,
that was like 10 seconds. - [chandler] it's like
he knew we were coming. - chandler, we got kicked
out so you don't get anything but you still get one safe item. so we'll go to shoe carnival,
grab your safe item. you never grabbed your safe item. - i never even got in the store. come on, let's go. - [mr. beast] chandler's
try not to get kicked out. - oh no, no. they're coming, they're coming. they're coming, they're
coming, they're coming. - [mr. beast] i think we've been spotted. - [cameraman] oh god,
we have been spotted. he's right behind you. - dude, they're closing in on- - [man] mission failed, we'll get 'em next time.
(emotional music begins) - wait, you're not kicking us out? - no, heck no!
- [mr. beast] oh, thank god. we were hiding from you guys. - don't hide, go have fun. i'll see you later. - unlike target, these guys aren't anti... - mr. beast.
- [cameraman] anti-money. - anti-fun, anti-sales, anti-revenue. - hey, do you shop at target? well, you should stop. - [cameraman] you didn't say that. - i didn't.
- these are my opinions. - [cameraman] these are his opinions. - oh, hold on a second. drain this shot. - [cameraman] yo, he drained it! - [man] kobe!
- let's go. i'm gonna give these away. - [cameraman] ooh, okay. some fire in that box. - [mr. beast] we're here at best buy again and this time, it's the cameramen. - oof. - they've been holding the
cameras the entire video so it is your turn. zip tie their hands together. - don't make it too tight
'cause i'll get claustrophobic and drop everything, everything. - [mr. beast] you heard
the man, make it too tight. - please don't make it tight. - all right, stop being
a cameraman and go shop. - all right, let's do it.
- let's go. - if you drop any... oh, oh. - we're not on the same page. all right, you ready?
- this way. - one, two, three. do you wanna do a tv?

you sure you want a $300 tv? - so the nice tvs, you gotta call for. - tv! - [mr. beast] this is $600,
it's a hundred dollars off. i'd go for that one.
- [tariq] all right. if this touches the floor, this is over. - if this touches the floor, you're doomed to being cameramen forever. - is my hand on your hand? - your hand's on my hand.
- wow, we're holding each others hands. (laughs) oh, camera bag because
my camera fell in poop. all right, hey louis, i
think we're doing great. - we are. can we set it down? - no, no, no. - [mr. beast] do it and
you won't get anything. tariq, how mad would you
be if he set that down? - i will cry real tears. real tears. - [louis] i'm actually losing
circulation to my hand. - are you really? me too. (laughs) be careful. louis, i love you, louis
please, i love you. let's go to the register now. - [louis] the counter's right there, the counter's right there. - [tariq] the counter.

we gotta go through the line. yes!
- [louis] we did it! - oh my god. yo, this is the hardest
challenge ever, dude. please save us, dude. this was the most painful part. good job, man. - chris spent more money by himself than both of you combined. - i've had a lot of experience
spending your money. - i'll get to chris's level one day. thank you to all the
fans that buy the merch. without you guys, i wouldn't get a tv or a ps4 or any of that nice stuff. so thank you guys, appreciate it. subscribe. - shopmrbeast. - and now bed, bath and beyond. get behind each other.
(upbeat music begins) - ooh, i feel your cheeks on my cheeks. - thanks. - this one's different. for this one, chris and chandler... will be duct taped together. - careful. - they work as a unit. if chandler drops anything,
both of them get nothing. - chandler, i wanna get some
bed, some bath and some beyond. hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. i got on flip flops, i
can't walk backwards. hermit crab. - oh god, don't do that, don't drop him. (chris screams) let chris be the front walker. - i got flip flops on. - (growls) i hate walking backwards. - chandler, i have to pee. - i'm gonna punch you. take a break.
- wait no, we gotta get... - [cameraman] right in
the middle of the road? - just take a break in
the middle of the road. - all right, stop moving. my stomach's making me throw up. - [mr. beast] you guys haven't
even gotten inside yet. - but really though, can i go pee? - let me drop something real quick and then you can go pee. no. - [cameraman] let him pee, let him pee. - no, the gucci flops! no! - none of this is appealing to me. - [chris] i've always wanted an irobot. - no dude, it'll map your house out. - [chris] i always wanted a robot. - the government owns that. - chandler, don't let the
government take him over. - no, i always wanted a robot.
