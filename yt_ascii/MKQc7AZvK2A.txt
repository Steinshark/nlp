and then as soon as we sing that we read genesis 1 1-13 in the so so it's the service of the church this is not just me and jonathan saying this it's the service of the church that's putting this in front of you and saying guys we're doing eden again but it's going to be great this time this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] hello everybody i am back with richard roland and a lot of people were really fascinated by our last video on groundhog day and how it was related to the feast of the presentation of the lord and so richard had the great idea to maybe look actually at the four major winter feasts of the church how they are related to light and how they are in a way a kind of fulfillment of the the jewish feast of hanukkah and so richard go ahead start us off and i'll follow yeah so something i was telling you before right before we hit record right is that the the feast of the presentation of the lord or the meeting of the lord of the temple or the purification of the blessed virgin mary aka groundhog day right these are all names that have been used for this this particular observance that it's really the book end right of of the of the kind of the whole winter cycle of the church and this is something that gets lost nowadays i think sometimes because in western liturgics there has been kind of this division of like sacred time and ordinary time or like the paschal cycle and then secular time you know something like that right so so it's like all the really important events are like bunched up between christmas and posca or christmas and pentecost and then there's like this big swath of the year that just doesn't have a whole lot of big stuff going on liturgically but actually this is not the case in the medieval church sir it's still not the case in eastern orthodoxy today in eastern orthodoxy of course as you know we have the 12 great feasts and the 12 great feasts are kind of spaced all throughout the year and together they they sort of bring us into and help us participate in the life of christ and of his mother and the whole story of redemption so i wanted to actually start though by reading a little something from the venerable bead and the reason bead was a very important anglo-saxon monk and scholar at the time that he was living in the 8th century he was probably the most well-educated person in europe and which is funny because he's sort of like off here on the on the fringe yeah he's often you know on the side there yeah but he writes pretty extensively about the whole the symbolism and the connection between the you could you could say like the the astronomical cycle of the year right and then the or the solar cycle of the year and then the the christian year and the relationship between these two things which beads sees as not arbitrary so this is what he says he says it is fitting that just as the sun at that point in time first assumed power over the day so he's talking about the vernal equinox or the feast of the annunciation which actually is tomorrow from when we are recording this we're recording this on the 24th of march right first assume power of the day and then the moon and stars power of the night so now to kano to connote the joy of our redemption the day should first equal night in length and then the full moon should suffuse the night with light so this is talking about like the possible full moon and the past and the you know ecclesial equinox and all this very complicated calculus for calculating the date of easter the date of pasca be saying you know so at the beginning of time you've got the sun to rule the day and the moon to rule the night and now because this is the enunciation right or you know this is the beginning of when the light comes into the world there's there's once again like a perfect balance between light and darkness in the full moon and yeah the full moon in the sun yeah so it says this is for the sake of a certain symbolism because this created sun which lights up all the stars signifies the true and eternal light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world while the moon and stars which shine not with their own light as they say but with an adventitious light borrowed from the sun so by the way even even back then people knew that the moon reflected the light yeah yeah suggests the body of the church as a whole and each individual saint right so this really beautiful symbolism of the moon and stars and of course we all know that stars and planets are angels right so you know he's beat is just like by now we all know it's like you can say that without controversy anymore i know i know it's great it's amazing great yeah these cape these capable of being illumined but not of illuminating know how to accept the gift of heavenly grace but not how to give it and in the celebration of the supreme solemnity it was necessary that christ precede the church which cannot shine save through him observing the possible seasons this is what he says observing the possible season is not meaningless for it is fitting that through it the world's salvation both be symbolized and come to pass right so so what what he's literally saying is the correlation between the vernal equinox right the beginning of spring and pasca you know annunciation pasca that whole you know church that he's saying that relationship is not arbitrary it's it's it's fitting it's this is a really important word in latin right this this idea of something is fitting it's proper it's seemly it's the way that things should be and so this is the thing you have to sort of say you know people people kind of get hung up sometimes on as we all know we all know people who get hung up on this you know oh well maybe maybe christmas is just like a thinly veiled version of some pagan winter festival right that was about the dying sun coming back to life on all these different things and but the the thing to understand is that it is that there's no canadian geometry jonathan pedro do you know this do you know this phrase the same oh i've never heard that before okay so it's oh you mean that it's a universal truth like yeah it's right right it's something that is gonna happen you're gonna have a feast at the solstice because it has nothing to do with imitating eats or whatever it's just naturally it's the only pushes itself on us that this is an important moment in in our story right and it's it's one of those ways like you can understand it it's just like the ripple effects throughout time of christ's incarnation and his birth right i think one of the most potent arguments for christ being actually born in december and i'm sure somebody out there will come after me about this but whatever is is just the fact that everyone knows something important happens right right around december 25th everyone knows that everyone in every culture knows that right so i say all that to say why is this part of universal history right universal history isn't just here's a narrative that goes from point a to point b and then we try to like write ourselves or fit ourselves into the narrative but actually it's a means of you could say it's like a more ancient more old world more medieval understanding of time in which we're actually participating in the story of salvation in the life of christ and of his mother but we're participating through the natural world right and so and so that allows this understanding of time not to just be something that we larp not to just be something that like oh today is march the 24th i guess since we don't know when jesus was born i'm going to celebrate christmas today like there are technically people who will argue that you can do that but practically speaking nobody does and it's because we all know things don't really work that way yeah yeah and there's and i think that it really is once you start to understand symbolism and how you know the world and reveals itself in meaning that it's necessarily so you can't avoid meaning you can't for example the idea that let's say the equinox or that the solstices don't have meaning is so completely insane you actually have more light in the world like the fact that that doesn't have meaning you can go outside at seven and like here let's say i can go outside at seven i can still do some work there's still a sense you know there's you can feel it in your skin that like the world is coming alive so it's so it's so deeply intuitive the idea that that doesn't have meaning and that the world of meaning wouldn't participate in that experience is misunderstanding how misunderstanding how meaning works and misunderstanding how we experience the world so yeah so what i wanted to do in today's video is actually to shed a little light as it were a little yeah on on on the on the winter festivals of the church right because we typically think of christmas and i think part of the reason so many people i mean i had so many people come up and talk to me or just reach out to me randomly from all over the internet about the groundhog day video because it sort of blew their mind that there was this connection between this weird little relic of like american culture and then and then you know an actual feast of the church but what i want to do is kind of expand on that a little bit and show how groundhog day is actually there are these what we could say four winter festivals of light in the ancient church and the way that these four winter festivals of light actually sort of come together and expand on this idea or sort of sort of show the show the christological reality behind the idea of hanukkah right and so actually putting this material together started with a question that somebody asked actually two people in one week asked me this question and then the following somebody else asked me that questions like three times in two weeks somebody said well why don't christians celebrate hanukkah shouldn't we just celebrate hanukkah and if we've got jewish listeners out there out there who do celebrate hanukkah great i mean you know i'm not i'm i have no beef with hanukkah right but but i do believe obviously that that christianity is true and that orthodoxy is is is true and that all of the sort of the themes that we find in the celebration of hanukkah right this theme of the restoration of light and then this theme of the restoration of the temple we actually fight all of these things being fulfilled not just in one feast but in four feasts so it's like so my answer to that is sort of like i'll do you one better let's celebrate hanukkah four times four times so yeah but it's important to understand that as christians we understand that all of the old testament and all of the old feasts all of the laws culminate into christ and so it's not that they stop existing it's that they find a type of fulfillment which actually sometimes transforms them sometimes flips them does all these things with these with these rules with these stories but they because they are but they are fulfilled in christ and so the the literary the christian liturgical year is actually coherent with the ancient jewish liturgical year it's just that it is re-seen a recast in the story of the incarnation and we see this in the words of christ himself because of course quite famously in the gospel according to saint john christ celebrates hanukkah in the gospel according to saint john is called the feast of the rededication right but that's what it is he said he goes to the temple and he goes to celebrate this feast and it's in the context of that feast that he very famously says i am the light of the world right right so he's going to this festival of light and he's saying actually i'm the light right and and so what's he doing he's filling that feast with himself and the whole experience of the church since that moment that eventually develops into these winter festivals of light is you could say it's an extended attempt to expose it that to understand what does it mean for christ to be the light of the world and so many people will know but i think it's probably a good idea nonetheless to just tell people what hanukkah is like what the origin is and what the the basic premise of the feast is so hanukkah is a jewish feast it's not one that was actually commanded by the mosaic law but it was instituted later following the victory of the maccabean heroes against the armies of antiochus iv epiphanies and so the maccabean heroes reconsecrated the second temple in jerusalem which had been looted and desecrated and they did this in an eight day very important number there in an eight day ceremony which culminated in the resumption of the daily sacrifices which had ceased at that point for a period of about three and a half years and as an actual feast celebrated by the jewish people hanukkah is first mentioned in the first century right around the time of christ so it actually seems that when christ went to celebrate it it was probably maybe a somewhat new liturgical celebration yeah and the original story of hanukkah you know we've we've all kind of probably heard the story i think they even tell it on like an episode of friends or something back in the day right it's like it's like a major part of you know pop culture living in america you probably sort of know there's the story about they didn't have enough oil but then the oil burned for eight days that's a that's a fairly late medieval version of the story of hanukkah which which is sort of the thing that people remember now but the original you know if you go back and look at writings from around the time of christ and up to about the sixth fifth or sixth century what you actually find is that the the story of hanukkah the celebration has to do not with the restoration of the menorah light in the holy place but actually with the the restoration of the sacrificial fires which they're always supposed to keep lit and then we're un where we're we're not lit three and a half years and then sort of the this flame is miraculously revived from the ashes okay which is very important to understanding because the theme of hanukkah is really about the you could say the restoration of the temple right it's the reconsecration of this space where god can be properly worshipped yeah and obviously this is a very biblical idea it is dare i say a very orthodox idea the restoration of a of an earthly temple is an idea that no orthodox christian or and and hopefully no christian of any sort should despise right you know if if the turks gave us back hagia sophia tomorrow right i would be on an airplane right you know to you know to be there participated in its reconciliation right exactly you know so so this is not a bad theme however it is more perfectly fulfilled and the restoration of what i would say is the temple of the cosmos right which is which is kind of the theme so that's what these four winter feasts do they take this restoration of the temple and they turn it into a restoration not just up one earthly building in jerusalem but actually the restoration of the temple with man at its center as the image and as the as the high priest so that's why we can understand the relationship both with the solstice which is the let's say the re-lighting of the sacred fire in the sky you know where the light is going down down down and then it's re-lit we can also understand the incarnation as the moment where the new temple is re-dedicated where in the darkness of the cave this temple appears almost it's the secret part of it that appears and is going to start to reveal itself as the story kind of continues yeah so if you're familiar with the feast of the church you'll know that actually you can already see the theme of the temple emerging just in the names of the two of the feasts that bookend this for the cycle of four winter feasts so the four winter feasts are the entrance of the theotokos into the temple which in the western liturgical tradition is also called the presentation of mary yeah and then so that's one sort of bookend and then as you move into these four feasts they they form a sort of chiastic structure so you have mary presented at the temple and then you have the nativity and then you have theophany or epiphany and then you have the presentation of the lord at the temple right the meaning of the lord of the temple the presentation of jesus cannamus purification of the blessed virgin mary whatever you want to call it and so this begins with uh so these two these two feasts on the book end you know they're very similar in their focus and even in liturgically they're the way that they're observed is very similar and and of course the gospel reading for the meaning of the lord at the temple ends with saint simmy and the god receiver for telling the sufferings of the mother of god at the foot of the cross so you can even see how this whole set of feasts is bookended by the mother of god she becomes you could say the container for the mystery just in this very much the same way she actually bookends the entire christian year in the east which begins with her nativity in september and then ends with her door mission in august so and just as an aside in the western liturgical tradition the subsequent feasts of the nativity of mary the holy name of mary which is a western feast and then the presentation of mary exactly parallel christmas the feast of the holy name of jesus which is the western version of the circumcision and then the presentation of our lords so i'm just saying all that say there are various angles that we could study these feasts from for my purposes i'm going to just talk about the tradition of the eastern orthodox church because it's what i know and have experienced but i do want to go on record as saying in the western liturgical tradition that these winter feasts are also present and they also manifest in some really beautiful and interesting structures so to talk real quick about the entrance of the theotokos into the temple this feast begins the very first hymn for the feast says today let us the faithful dance for joy singing to the lord with psalms and hymns venerating his hallowed tabernacle the living ark that contained the word who cannot be contained for she a young child in the flesh is offered in wondrous fashion to the lord and with rejoicing zacharias the great high priest receives her as the dwelling place of god so this is the major theme of the feast which is introduced right at the very beginning of vespers and that is the coming of the new and living ark into the temple of god now it should be noted and people who have watched the universal history series will know that the ark has been missing from the temple for quite some time there are different culprits who might be responsible for this come on richard we know where the ark is i know where they are you're right you're right for several hundred years now there's been no arc in the jerusalem temple and this is something to which both scripture so this is in the book is mentioned the fact that the ark is absent is mentioned in second maccabees which if you're an orthodox christian or a roman catholic so the majority of the christian world that's in your bible and then also there are also eyewitness accounts like those of pompey the great that talk about you know walking into the whole most holy place and there's nothing there's nothing there right we know from archaeology and history that there were many arcs in the ancient world and i think they actually talked about this a little bit on a recent episode of lord of spirits but to understand what an arc is it's essentially a ritual test chest which functions both as a reliquary so it holds items that are sacred to the cult of the god and then also a ritual seat of the god himself right and these chests were usually carried on poles they're usually overlaid with gold and crucially they usually have a lid that bears the image of the deity so a good example of this if you look up the you can just google like the the anubis chest this is from the the the tomb of king tut and the valley of the kings and if you look up a picture of this chest it looks very similar to the ark of the covenant in fact it even has cherubim you know with the wings on it but in this case they're on the side not not the top but it has the cherubim right and then on the very top obviously an important difference is it has an idol of the god anubis on top right so when god commands moses to make an ark and shows him the pattern for doing this you know to to you know great exact detail and measurements he's not asking moses to make something he's never seen before what's unique about the ark are his contents which prefigure christ and his mother and you can you know consult you know almost any church father writing about this subject you know we'll we'll talk about this and then it's lit and of course the important thing about a slit is that the lid bears not a depiction of the god of israel for at this point israel was not allowed or able to depict their god but rather bears two guarding cherubim right and the cherubim are sort of the throne they carry or guard the throne of the deity so the message of moses's ark was clear this box is the throne of the god of israel whom the hebrews cannot depict and what we see in the old testament is that where the ark goes so goes the presence of god and actually for the feast of the of the of the presentation of the theotokos of the temple all of the old testament readings are focused on the ark and they're focused on what happens when the ark goes somewhere and exodus chapter four uh third kingdom seven and eight and the third reading from ezekiel 43 and 44 obviously very famously solidifies this relationship between mary and the temple where we see the theotokos as being the new temple as being the eastern gate through which only the messiah can pass and by the way this is a really ancient patristic understanding of this passage that's the most important aspect of her is that to understand that she is the arc in the context of the incarnation but then she also represents not just that she physically is the ark but that also we as the church will become the arc that we as individuals will become something akin to the ark and she is the the let's say the place where all that comes together into one person who became the vehicle for the incarnation right and so of course every time that the ark is brought into the well when it was brought into the tabernacle in exodus and then when it was brought into the temple in uh second kings or first kings in each of those cases the what happens the holy spirit right the glory of god fills the temple right it's like nobody can even begin there because it's too much right and this never happened in the second temple the glory of god had never filled it in which in the way that it filled the tabernacle of meeting or the temple of solomon but the tradition of the church is that the when mary entered the temple as a young girl that the holy spirit filled her as the new ark in a tangible way and i'll just say here as an aside people will say things like oh well that could never have happened because they would never have allowed a woman into the temple building listen no one is saying this is an ordinary circumstance that's such a silly argument to me it's like it's like here's a miraculous thing well miracles don't happen so that you know it's okay whatever but but the tradition of the church is that when she entered the holy spirit filled her as the new ark and this way for the first time in a tangible way the holy spirit actually entered the holy of holies the place where the ark was supposed to be kept and this is why it is really significant in our tradition to emphasize the fact that that she was brought into the holy of holies something that was missing from the second temple even after it was reconsecrated was this presence of god with the ark and now that's been restored so again if our whole theme is the restoration of the temple as a place where god can dwell that's the theme of this first feast yeah and i would say it's like to say to people like protestants that are watching this who struggle with the fact of this like they struggle with the idea or whatever i mean fine you'll get there in time but in the meantime notice the important analogies and the important typology that is being brought about which is absolutely and and completely true and it is necessary for us to understand the significance of the incarnation and what it means for us even as a church yeah so mary becomes a literal arc right she and when she does this she's she fulfills the you know the prophecy of of david in psalm 44 or psalm 43. you know when it says that virgins shall be brought to the king after her her companion shall be brought unto thee with gladness and rejoicing they shall be brought and they shall be brought into the temple of the king so this is in the psalms david prophesies that there's going to be this woman who's going to be a queen of israel and she's going to be brought into the temple this does not happen anywhere in the old testament yeah and for no one before her was this ever true but the tradition of the church does record that mary was accompanied by young women of her people going before her with candles so there's like another kind of connection to candlemas and that she's brought into the temple of the king right and elsewhere we see her in the hymns of this feast referred to as an acceptable sacrifice that she was brought into the holy of police because she was a sacrifice acceptable to god so the idea is that she becomes a literal arc her womb carries not merely relics but god himself and on a very literal level her lap becomes a throne on which christ sits yeah and that's in terms of iconography it's really people need to understand the basic image one of the basic images of christianity is called the throne of wisdom and you see the mother of god sitting as she's sitting on a throne but she herself becomes a throne and christ is sitting on her lap centrally usually with his head on her heart and so she becomes the ark that surrounds him and then he is the glory sitting on the ark yeah yeah so this kind of sets up this whole theme with the restoration of the temples and the orthodox church we celebrate this feast in november just a little bit into the advent faster the nativity fast for us and this is the first of the really the four great winter celebrations now the next one is obviously nativity or christmas which most of us think we probably know a lot about because christmas is one of the few surviving things in fact oh here it is hold on this is a great book by eamon duffy it's called the stripping of the altars if you want to know what was christianity like in england before the reformation and why was it awesome this is a great this is a great book but one of the things he talks about in here is that uh christmas is kind of the only survival in many cases of of a lot of the old church year even even easter especially growing up evangelical right we never we sort of never really knew what to do around easter in fact i remember one one year something had come up and and we didn't have the easter you know the easter thing like the cantata or the play or whatever ready in time so we just decided we'll just celebrate easter a month later like nobody really knows when it happened so let's just celebrate him up later you know it's it's not great but but somehow christmas christmas has has held on a lot longer for many of us and but there are some themes that have to do with the restoration of the temple and this theme of the sort of the revival of light or the preservation of the light in the darkness and the connection of all those things which which are maybe not obvious to us now so the troparia of the four feast so like the day before christmas christmas eve we sang mary once with aged joseph went to be taxed in bethlehem for they were of the lineage of david and she bore in her womb the fruit that had not been sown which is a great that's a great line the time of the birth of the birth was at hand and there was no room in the end but the caved the cave proved a fair place for the queen christ is born that he may raise up the image that before was fallen and the two things i want to focus on here are first of all the idea of the cave right and i know that you've done some great videos of this on your channel but but it's very important that it happened in a cave which is not said anywhere in scripture yeah and yet of course pretty much everyone today if you ask them they'd say oh well of course you know they didn't have enough wood to build a stable or something like that you know like like the economics of the situation are the most important reason that it have it happened in a cave right but usually like even movies and things like that will show as being in a cave and i think it's because we do know deep down that this is a very important symbolism of the cave right the cave is the womb the cave is the grave and the grave as a womb right which is what it is for christ and the connection of all those things but the other thing to mention here is this idea that christ is born that he may raise up again the image that before was fallen we get the we get an extended gloss on this with another troparia that says made ready o bethlehem for eden hath been opened to all prepare o ephrathah for the tree of life hath blossomed forth in the cave from the virgin for who womb did appear as a spiritual paradise in which is planted the divine plant whereof eating we shall live and not die as adam verily christ shall be born raising the image that fell of old so both of these hymns take us all the way back to the beginning they take us back to genesis back to eden and we can think about the fact that in genesis after our first parents are cast out of the garden there's a cherub who's set to guard the entrance to paradise with a flaming sword and this is way worse than just being banned from like a nice place like you know like like just be sorry you can't come back to colorado springs yeah yeah in the ancient near east this word paradise means a walled garden if you listen to the lord of spirits you'll know quite well that that the whole idea is that god lives in a garden at the top of a mountain everyone in the ancient world near east knew this believed this and and actually on the orthodox arts journal andrew gould has a great series of articles they're from a few years back but i really recommend people go and read them where he gets really really specific into the relationship between ancient paradise gardens and then the layout of our orthodox churches today which are sort of reminded intended to remind us that when we stand together in church we're actually participating in heavenly worship we're in paradise and so in the ancient world at the conclusion of the construction of a temple they would place the the god in the center of the temple and in ancient egypt they did this through something called the this ritual was performed by these group of priests who were called the sem priests they were these leopard-skinned robes i don't know why that's the detail that stuck out in my mind and they would perform a ceremony called the opening of the mouth by the way they also did this when they would mummify someone so you know the idea of of like the dead person becoming like a you know like an image or like an idol and this basically is the idea is to imbue the statue of the god with the spirit of the god or the person it depicts and therefore allowing them to act as surrogates for the person who commissioned the image and what numerous biblical scholars obviously if you're watching symbolic world you probably are familiar with father stephen de young he's got a great article on this called man is the image of god in reverse that you can go and read about i'm not going to read everything from that but the whole idea here is that is this idea of god creating a temple for himself in the cosmos that's what eden is supposed to be that's what paradise is supposed to be and then you have man at the center of eden at the center of paradise we're told that he placed man in the midst of the garden is supposed to be there as the image and then also as the high priest so he performs this priestly function of naming the animals right this is really essential to understanding like why are we here on this planet like this you know it's really cosmic essential stuff and then of course what happens is that the image falls over the image becomes sullied right and so man can no longer take that place of priest in creation and actually what we find is any time we attempt to do i shouldn't say any time but most of the time when we attempt to like take dominion what it actually looks like is is you know disaster like we kill things we we oppress things we destroy our environment we do all these things because we're just you know the image is fallen you know we are supposed to take dominion but not in that way right and so you can see the process of pagan temple dedication reversed in genesis right and that's a foreshadowing of the incarnation and so you've got eden as a temple the temple is you know moses tabernacle and solomon's temple they're supposed to be icons of eden and so what we find in the mystical truth of the feast of christmas is that the cave which is probably not a very glamorous place becomes the container for the mother of god who is herself the new spiritual paradise in other words she's the new eden thereby opening eden to all so in this new eden there's a new divine plant there's a new tree of life which is somehow the cross but is also christ and it's the exact opposite of the fruit that brings death to adam so in the new tabernacle of creation we see christ raising up the image of god raising up human nature and making it possible for there to be true worship and communion again why because there's a new fruit to eat and there's a new priest to give you that fruit yeah and you can see it for people who are interested if you look at an icon of the last judgment for example you will see that on the right side of christ at the bottom of the icon there is an image of paradise and in the inn you see usually at the door saint peter sometimes in saint paul coming to the door of paradise and the cherub is there the chair is going to let them in and then in paradise is usually an image of the virgin sitting on a throne it's not just because she's in paradise but it's because she is paradise you know she is the the place where the garden was restored and you know the tree of life was restored in the person of christ and in the cross so you know it's it's it's important to understand that in for ancient thinking these things really coalesce yeah and that there is absolutely no problem in seeing all of these things coming together like in the hymn that richard richard recited and something i'm really keen to try to to communicate here it is it's hard to think about exactly how to say this but there is you could say that that there there are two extremes that you want to avoid and one would be just like getting the super cosmic vision of everything that's so large it stops being specific right and so i know there are you know some people out there who'd be like oh these are great ideas and other religions have them too and things like so it must all be true right or or or just sort of you know that that that attitude of well this here's an idea that's so high you know that it has in other words like it's all it's all heaven and no earth it's all spirit and nobody that it doesn't actually matter when we celebrate christmas or it doesn't actually matter what we celebrate easter right or or the worst version of that would be because i know that this happened i don't actually need to celebrate anything at all because in my head like i already know what happened right the other thing that we want to avoid is being so particular in our celebration of these things that we can't see their cosmic significance and the way that they actually fill our lives now this is the important thing about we're talking about like a medieval view of time or history and this is which is kind of what this universal history thing has evolved into is we've had these discussions and as i'm you know sort of mulling over this book idea in my mind and things like this is they weren't satisfied to say oh well now that i've become a christian i guess there is this noah guy right what they're doing is they're looking at that table of nations yeah genesis and they're saying well where do we fit in where where where do our people come into the story right and so here in this feast of christmas right you see the theme of hanukkah which originally has this very specific historical context and it's made universal that christ in his miraculous incarnation and birth accomplishes the perfect union of heaven and earth he restores human nature to its rightful place made in the image of god or as the image of god and in the process he doesn't restore just a temple at jerusalem but he restores the temple of the cosmos the temple of creation yeah which is eden which is paramount yeah paradise is the cosmic temple it's important to understand that the jerusalem temple or the tabernacle were surrogates for eden for the garden if you don't understand that you won't understand the structure of eden you won't understand the structure of the garden why there's a cherub where there's all these things that are basically just representations of the garden of eden right so we need to be able to understand that in christ these symbolisms will start will be you'll see in the hymns like they they cross over and they join together and there's references to all the different levels as this is happening so that was exactly what i wanted to mention next is that if you look at the hymns for the feast they just pull all of these different levels of understanding together just in such a beautiful here's the thing about byzantine homography i'm not going to say it's as catchy as like western hymns or like you know praise choruses or whatever kids kids are doing these days you know your your christian raps and your whatever you know it might not be as catchy as all that however i don't understand youth culture however it's so beautiful it's so precise and it's so so like poetically rich which is why i think it's sort of like it transcends whatever the whatever's in vogue at the moment right it transcends that and will continue to endure beyond that you know what even when all of your raps are are you know in the dustbin of history you know so so there's this so there's this this hymn at the vespers for the feast of the nativity which is the middle wall of the partition has been destroyed it's talking about the veil being opened the flaming sword turns back the cherubim withdraw from the tree of life and i partake of the delight of paradise from which i was cast out through disobedience and then as soon as we sing that we read genesis 1 1-13 in the so so it's the service of the church this is not just me and jonathan saying this it's the service of the church that's putting this in front of you and saying guys we're doing eden again but it's going to be great this time right yeah and it's and it is a cosmic restoration and also a reawakening of the significance of man you know in in christ and so it all the the different the personal level you know the social and the cosmic level come together and so and it's what's great about already with the two feats that you can see as you can see there's a there's a logic of of i've mentioned this before where before light comes darkness you could say or before the answer of heaven comes the tohu bohu becomes this emptiness and void which is in a way a calling it's like asking to be filled it's a it's a question that is looking to be answered so you can see in the setup of the feast where you know the darkness comes before the dawn right this darkest moment appears as the space so we have to we have to prepare the space and then once the space is prepared that's when the glory of god then descends on the ark which has been prepared for it to come and so you have the presentation of the virgin and then you have nativity and the the logic of it makes complete sense yeah and so that's a great way to think about this because you sort of have the let's say the going in which is what these first two fees are if it's a chiastic structure you have the going in and then you have the coming out right with these next two feasts so the the going in is like the the holy space is being prepared and then the next two are the revelation of the light exactly yeah so you've got theophany which is the next one we'll talk about obviously there's a lot going on in theophany the very first thing that we hear about theophany in the church year practically speaking is is this this theme of warfare right make radio river jordan for behold christ our god draws near to be baptized by john that he may crush with his divinity the invisible heads of the dragons in thy waters which is a cool best i mean it's the best thing and this is but i mean this is the thing and of course this is this is this reference back to psalm 73 in the septuagint this you know these dragons in the waters these demonic powers the exorcism of the cosmos right also one of the main major themes of the baptismal service and you know because yahweh the god of israel is the one who breaks the heads of the dragons in the waters right which is what the psalmist says yeah and of course we showed that on the icon of the feast you can you can find lots of stuff out there about this now which is a great thing you you this father stephen young has some stuff i'm sure you've done some videos yeah i've talked about that yeah so but the other thing that's going on there right is the theme of illumination or the revelation of light right yeah we have to understand it as because we often tend to think of the baptism as the going down in the water right which actually corresponds to the first part of these two pizzas it's like this is the going down but now what we're talking about mostly in theophany is the coming out of the water where christ is coming out of the cave and yeah you have to understand the bottom the bottom of the water is as equivalent to the cave itself so christ comes out of the waters and then the holy spirit comes down and it's a it's a recreation of heaven and earth like everything gets revealed in terms of what in terms of the new structure you could say so this is what this is what is how this is in terms of light this is what is most important that's why some of the images might confuse people sometimes with theophany because you have all these images of baptism but then you have all these images of light but it makes sense if you understand it as christ has gone down in the waters is now coming up and you hear the voice of god revealing the logos to the world and that light and the revelation of the logos is what is going on yeah it i mean that's that's the whole reason that in the christian tradition baptism is referred to as illumination right so i mean the baptismal service is fresh on my mind i love going to baptisms like if you get to go i mean we have a lot of we're going through sort of a baby boom at my parish right now so we go to lots of baptisms and that's great and of course we just had one in our family for my daughter and but the baptismal service i mean it's great because like every time you go to a baptism it's like a refresher course on your own baptism right and and yeah that's the whole theme throughout baptism is is this theme of illumination right the word neophyte originally meant and really still means somebody who's been recently illumined right and so and to to kind of your point about about needing to understand this because it does have the going in portion and the coming out is that every one four of these feasts if you were to look at them closely you would see that they actually they're it's a fractal it's actually true for all all the great feasts of the church every great feast of the church so annunciation is coming up tomorrow if you look closely at annunciation you'll see in it every other feast right is is in there pasca is in there christmas is in there right the the passion is in there right it's all in enunciation and that's true obviously everything's sort of gathered up into posca so they're all sort of like fractals of each other and and yeah so so baptism the big focus right of theophany other than spiritual warfare the big focus is is of illumination right so we have christ being himself the bestower of light jesus needs not to be baptized but in the flesh he descends into the streams of the jordan wishing to give light to those in darkness let us go eagerly in faith to meet him so the idea is he's bringing the light kind of down to us right cena from the syrian has this wonderful idea of sort of christ going down and leaving the garment of light at the bottom of the waters right so that when we are baptized we kind of go down in and bring it up and get it on right i love that so much so now the the connection to the our master theme right which is the restoration of the temple this might not seem like immediately clear but we need to remember that both the original occasion of hanukkah as well as its more common name in the ancient world was the festival of lights and the occasion of this feast this is referred to in john chapter 10 of as the feast of the dedication was to celebrate this dedication of the jerusalem temple following this military victory and by the time of christ it's already known as the festival of lights and this is again tied to originally to the miraculous rewriting of the altar fires that later story of the oil that lasts for eight days it's like a later kind of accretion but you can understand why it still symbolically participates in that basic it's very similar it's just yeah it's slightly different but basically yes when i say stupid modern academic things like that's a later accretion like i'm not i'm not actually saying i'm not actually saying like it's a it's not amazing you're still you still think it's impossible yeah i mean it's you can admit that maybe it's a later legend yeah but it perfectly participates in the overall symbolism you know so i'm you know i'm fine with it yeah not that anyone cares but i'm fine with it but it's it's in the context right of the celebration in john chapter 10 that of course christ declares i am the light of the world right and so what christ is doing is he's offering himself as the exegesis of this essentially old testament feast and also perfectly clarifying its deep connection to theophany so on theophany the church commemorates and participates in christ conquest of the demonic powers which have enslaved mankind and infested the cosmos and then the result of that is the light which as saint john says enlightens every man that comes into the world so in theophany we see the cosmos once again becomes capable of being offered up to god in this act of thanksgiving with man as the as the priest of creation and the image of god which is restored right so that brings us to the meeting of lord of the temple which we talked about quite a bit last time and i just want to maybe spend a little bit of time because i don't actually i should have gone back and listened to the video again because i don't remember how much we said about this last time did we talk about the the eucharistic focus of the video in the video the eucharistic focus of that feast well we're gonna talk about it i think so i don't know okay yeah i don't think we got to it because we were trying to talk about groundhog groundhog day right so the the hymnography and the iconography of the orthodox church for this feast focuses particularly on the handoff of the christ child from the theotokos to saint symbian and when he does this we're sort of deliberately reminded of another time a prophet of god met yahweh the god of israel in the temple so in isaiah chapter 6 which we read at the vespers of this feast we have the story of isaiah if you don't know it this is isaiah the prophet he comes to the temple and he has this mystical vision of god seated in glory in the temple it says in a year that king uzziah died i saw the lord sitting on a throne high and lifted up and the train of his robe filled the temple above it's to the seraphim each one had six wings with two he covered his face and with two he covered his feet and with two he flew and one cried to another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door were shaken by the voice of him who cried out and the house was filled with smoke and so i said isaiah said woe is me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king of the lord of hosts then one of the seraphim flew to me having in his hand a live coal which he had taken from the tongs with tongs from the altar and he touched my mouth with it and said behold this has touched your lips your iniquity is taken away and your sin is purged and i read the whole thing a because it's probably my favorite thing in the bible i mean you you get a different answer from me maybe depending on what we're talking about on what i'm talking about but but i really love this passage even as a young boy i loved reading this passage and uh just as like a well okay so here's a personal anecdote i probably shouldn't share on the internet okay but when i would read the story as a young boy i'd always think i would like to be one of those seraphim that's what i want to be i want to just always be there right at the throne of god always close to god just like that's what i wanted and then when i was received into the orthodox church i was received with the name seraphim and so that's always been uh so there's something really special about this passage to me definitely so the the christian tradition the entire church has has understood this passage along with very similar passages in the apocalypse of saint john as being the paradigm of heavenly worship right so in the story of the feast we see that the story of isaiah is sort of put through the paradox machine that is the incarnation right and so isaiah goes to the temple to meet with god but now god is coming to the temple to meet with his prophet yeah who's been waiting there for him and the the church in our hymnography we sort of tease out the eucharistic implications of this feast so in iconography we depict simeon in the attitude of someone about to receive communion he's got he's got his hands sort of yeah he's covered his hands yeah and and of course the when the priest or the bishop when they take communion at the altar they repeat basically the prayer the the words of the seraph they say you know see this is touch your lips your iniquity's taken away your sin is purged and in some medieval western churches in spain especially in the apps of the church which means in the in the holy place the holy of holies you would often have an image of isaiah with the angel and holding the tongs to his mouth in the in the space where where the the mysteries were were celebrated so yeah you can see that the people that the relationship with communion was strong for all over the place yeah and so one of my favorite examples of this is in the canon of the feast and actually in general the the the canons of the great feast there are so many of them for instance tomorrow's is the canon for the feast of the annunciation which i'll actually be reading in church tonight at at the cathedral which i'm very excited about because the candidate of the annunciation is an extended conversation between gabriel and mary that's the whole canon you know and she's like well you know last time an archangel came to a woman and promised her something it didn't go so well so like i'm trying to be a little careful here and and so he's like reassuring her you know and it's just so i mean it's so beautiful i think that if you wanted to let's say like increase your devotion or really sort of get to know the mother of god like that's that's an important service to be there for but in this canon in the ninth odi mountains there's this extended conversation between jesus and simeon and anna and the mother of god and jesus says it is not the old man who holds me but i uphold him for he begs me to let him depart and then simeon says to the theotokos o mystical tongs so now she's the tongs right right how dost thou bear the coal how doest thou feed him who gives food to all and so so again you know the and then and then we we you know in the same candidate says simeon the priest and of course the priest is somebody who would normally serve communion right the simi and the priest received the lord of all come down from heaven right so there's just all these beautiful paradoxes going on here so in isaiah's vision he comes to the temple and comes face to face with lord of hosts the king and he's overwhelmed by his own sinfulness with his own deadness of spirit so a live coal something alive something on fire is brought to him from off the altar to cleanse his lips and to make him pure simeon on the other hand wastes the temple and the lord of hosts thy salvation the light to be revealed to the nations and the glory of thy people israel comes to him he's born like the live coals uh like a life coal on that on the tongs that are the theotokos and then simeon's response is now i can die like isn't that yeah so and of course obviously in our preparation for communion in the orthodox church we pray not to be consumed by fire right that is the body and blood of christ but to receive christ into ourselves to worship him and this is the final for us as christians this is a final consummation st maximus the confessor says that those who partake of communion in a worthy manner are rendered similar to the one who is good as the cause of everything that is good and they are lacking in nothing so that even they are able to be called gods by adoption according to grace because the whole of god fills them with himself and leaves nothing in them empty from his presence so this is kind of my long answer to should christians celebrate hanukkah and my answer is something like no we should celebrate it four times yeah right and but it's beautiful because if you look at the structure there are so many things going on yeah you know when you think of if you if you think of the first set up that we talked about where you have the where you have the setup of the dark space or the the holy of holies the altar is set up in this darkness and this question then down comes the glory of god hidden at the outset on the ark of the covenant and then there's you can imagine almost really like the priest comes out with the with the communion chalice out of the holy place and then reveals the light everybody sees now you know here's the christ coming out of the water and you know the the the voice of god telling everybody this is this is it like this is my son and then it ends with the temple itself or the big temple acknowledging saying yes like we recognize this we recognize that this is what's happened so it's almost like the reaction of of ana and the priest is saying amen like this is true this is happening so you have the you have the the revelation of the divine logos and then the reception from the church and so it really is a beautiful cosmic image of light and even just like i like how light works you know you the light comes down reveals something and then you recognize it and you you see what it is you see what it is in in its form so it's it's all the way down in the microcosm to our small experience of you know you're standing in darkness you turn on the light you see something and you recognize it this is there in the very structure of these four feasts and i mean that at that moment when the chalice is brought out what do we say you know god is the lord and has revealed himself to us blessed is he who comes the name of the lord and actually there's some arguments for why that could be better translated the lord is god in other words the lord kirios which is the greek form of yahweh yahweh is god right the god of israel that's god and now he's revealed himself to us right and that's what these four feasts are really about it's about this revelation so you've got the entrance of the theotol goes into the temple where the ark of god returns the temple and it foreshadows and sets the stage for the restoration of the worship of the one true god right and then the nativity we see the cave becomes eden the cosmic temple and the image of man is raised up and renewed and then theophany we've got the dragons of the water being crushed and christ the light illumines the cosmos with the light of his triumph and then this culminates in the meeting of the lord in the temple when it becomes possible for us to not only meet god but to receive him of course that ends with the foreshadowing of the passion right the sword will pierce your heart also and so we see the whole purpose of the old testament scriptures and prophecies fulfilled which foreshadowed his coming so so yeah that's kind of i think the winter feast of the church are really beautiful and it makes christmas longer you know which what what more could you ask for than that right yeah so this is great i mean i think it's it's also i think a lot of these these little these interpretations we're giving is to give people a taste of what's there because there's so much there that you can't exhaust in these talks and so it's i think it's up to all of us to to go back into our our traditions and and and see the the beauty and the the coherence that's there and these in these feasts and in the text themselves so and something that if people want to take the universal history connection a little bit farther kind of with all of this in mind something that's really good to do is to go back and look at the tradition that you're in and see how was this celebrated i mean for instance again in this book which i'll just recommend one more time the stripping of the altars there's a great section early on in the book it's in the very first chapter looking at two things in specific in in england before the reformation candlemas the celebration of candlemas which obviously we spent a lot of time talking about so if you want to see how was this celebrated in merry old england you know and then also holy week passion week which was can i just say pretty awesome in england before the reformation it was also a lot more if you've if you've ever been to orthodox holy week and then you read his description of what was english holy week like before the reformation they're so similar that if you were comfortable like if you were already like sort of used to one you would be very comfortable in the other one there are some interesting local differences but they're very very similar so our the you know the celebration of holy week in the west has been over the decades even recently has been extremely truncated but it used to be a lot longer and a lot more similar to what we still do in the east so maybe go back and look at those things and it's like sort of digging up these pearls of a beauty from your own tradition that that you know maybe you've lost touch with so yeah so everybody this is you know what there's so many of these that we will do we're going to continue on and and as len continues so i wish you a fruitful lent and and we i don't know i think did we i don't know if we're going to see each other before before pasca we'll see no no thanks for your attention richard thank you again for your scholarship and your passion and we'll talk again very soon thanks jonathan this episode is part of a series of discussions i've had with richard roland on universal history you can find a list of all these episodes on my youtube channel where you can find them also in my podcast stream from the symbolic world on your different podcast platforms make sure to check out richard's second podcast which he hosts in collaboration with father andrew damick called amman sewell which looks at the relationship between tolkien and orthodoxy this podcast has also inspired me some ideas for creating some images whether it be the king under the mountain whether it be the grail or beautiful ethiopian traditions i've created some products which you can find on my store the symbolicworld.store and there will probably be more of those to come very soon so stay tuned this conversation is ongoing and there is still very much to explore in the universal history
