- the last one of them to stop pedaling will compete for $1 million. we've done three videos, last to fall, last to stop
swinging, last to leave toilet, and this is the fourth,
last to stop biking. the winner of this challenge will compete against
the other three winners for $1 million. this is chandler's team. - this is cody. this is mark. - he's your coach, he's
incentivized to take care of you, do whatever you need. and over here is the orange team. - this is ryan, and this is jeremy. this is the winning team. - we have a device here that can see how many rotations
you're doing per minute. and as long as you're doing
20 rotations per minute, we count that as still biking. if one of your contestants
wins the million dollars, you get 10% of it. same with you, which is a hundred grand. as of right now, neither
of you have a contestant in the million dollar final. - i'm going to win. (crunching) (gasping) - i heard your hand
crack or was that mine? - no, it was yours. - okay. (laughing) - jake, get out of here, you
already have two winners. - oh, we're talking about winning? - this is the winner of
last to leave toilet. who are these two people, jake? - akira and omar. - as of right now, akira, omar and jorge, they're going to put their
hand on a million dollars and the last one of them to
take it off, gets to keep it. we need one more person to put their hand on the million dollars, and that will be determined today. - dude, it sucks that you're going to do all this cycling if you win and then you're going
to get beat by jorge. look at those chiseled abs. - [cody] you mean cody. look at these chiseled abs. (laughing) - [instructor] now find
that beat, there it is. oh yeah, that's good. - hey chandler, here's a sharp object. - thank you. - you want a banana? - yes, please. - hold this. our first challenge is fruit ninja. you're going to toss the fruit, if he slices it in half, i do nothing. but if he misses, i up your
resistance for 10 minutes. (sword swooshing) - oh. - that was terrifying,
but he cut it in half. so your resistance stays the same. (sword swooshing) - [jimmy] oh my god! what? - yo. that is beautiful. - congratulations, sir. your resistance stays the same. let me take this. here's a banana. here's a banana. go ahead and throw your banana. (sword swooshing) - it happened. it happened - [jimmy] literally, no one is arguing. yes, you cut it. (sword swooshing) - oh! (sad music) - it's only 10 minutes, so it's fine. so we're just going to do two clicks. nothing crazy. timer starts, 10 minutes.
we're starting off easy. can you even feel a difference? - i can't. - it's only 10% harder.
it's nothing crazy. - next challenge, it won't happen again. - the elongated cutting object has decided your fate. - [instructor] you got to get up and boogie with this honey. - [tareq] it's been over an hour, how you feeling so far? - it's only been an hour? god. i feel all right. need more bananas. - [tareq] you got so much banana's. - it's what's keeping me alive. - butt is still numb. i feel like i've been here
for about three hours. - [tareq] three hours? - but i'm still kicking through. - lost feeling in my
butt about 20 minutes ago but i'm still going on. - still good. still going strong. - how many miles have you gone? - seventeen. - what? mine's at seven? (laughing) i think this is miles. i have no idea. i can't read an exercise bike. - [tareq] is this your

first time on a bike. - what? - yeah, dude (upbeat music) - sir. would you like

(laughing) (upbeat music) - [tareq] these bananas. - [mark] i was hungry. what's up? it's been six hours. i
can go another hundred. need more bananas. - [tareq] why are you standing up already? - my butt hurts. - [tareq] okay, that's fair. - why don't you slow it down? - because it's harder to go slower. - 35. you're in at 44. why
are you going so fast? - you think i'm going fast? you should see next to me. - dude, you're coasting at 70. why? - i can't slow down. - theoretically, you should
burn out twice as fast, i don't know if that's true. - i'm not hurting. - okay. (upbeat music) this next challenge is really going to make the coaches have to work. whoever jumps over more balls, your people will get a
pillow under their butts. the losing team will have to hold a baby. i don't know why i pointed you guys, like you're already about to lose. we're starting off with one ball. (upbeat music) (dinging) now it's two balls. (upbeat music) (dinging) now there is three. (dinging) he cleared it by like that much. (dinging) (cheering) all right. four balls. (yelping) (dinging) (upbeat music) - thanks buddy. (dinging) (upbeat music) (cheering) - he cleared four balls. we're coming up on the five ball trifecta, how do you feel? - i feel like chandler's
going to get this. - are you saying marcus is short? - yes, he is fairly shorter than chandler. - what does that mean? have at it, sir. - chandler, chandler! (buzzer buzzing) (crowd shouting) he's out. (upbeat music) five balls is one too
many balls for chandler. (clapping) (booing) (dinging) (cheering) (upbeat music) since your coach could not
complete the five balls of doom, you must hold this baby. for three minutes, you have
to hold it right there. same with you, sir. hold this baby. your coach worked hard
to get you these pillows. how does this feel? - oh, that feels amazing. - i just feel disappointed. - [tareq] but now you're a father. how do you feel about that? - highly weird. - [tareq] how about you, how are you going to pay child support? - i'm not paying anything. (laughing) (upbeat music) - anything they need, you
have to bike to go get. - oh, taco bell's really far away. i'm going to have to bike like 30 minutes. - i'll see you in an hour. - thanks. (laughing) got it. i'm going to go now and ride a bike in the dark,
in the cold, on the highway. - jimmy johns is like
right down the street, that's a sub place, is that okay? sub? - sure. - sure? - [chandler] i don't want to do this. - [tareq] you know you can
wait until you get outside to get on the bike. (bell ringing) - [taco bell employee] (indistinct) - that's it. no lettuce. - hey! - let's go back, i guess.

(laughing) yes. - cody, your legs all right? - no. (laughing) i was just waiting for
something to be offered. (laughing) it was awesome. - thanks for coming man. - yeah, dude. it was great. - [chandler] glad you had fun. i'm going to need you to win this for me. - i got you. - all right. - i got you.

leave with five bands dog. congratulations, man. - thank you. - there's only two contestants left now and i think we should celebrate by moving the resistance up a little bit. we're just going to go click, click. yeah, right about there. is there a big difference now? - no, not at all. - that's a front. i know he's lying. - [mark] no, i'm dead serious. - i know you feel a difference. - would you get a trash though? too many powerades. - [tareq] yeah, that says 103. you've biked 103 miles today. 149 miles. - i say we present the final offer. $10,000 to the next person who gets out. do you not want 10 grand? that's a lot of money. - he wants more than that. - even if you guys won today, you're not guaranteed a million dollars. you're going up against freak of natures, you could just lose in the next round. you're going up against this dude. look at his ab. if neither of you want it, we're going to have to
keep upping the resistance. - i'll just go. (gasping) - no! - yeah, i got- - no! - yeah. - no! (cheering) - [marcus] what, no! no! - yo, get off this bike
young man, we got the win. - ah, i can't walk. let's go. - oh, no! - marcus. oh no. - get away from me man. it was a long, long, long ride. but you got 10,000. - [mark] he gots more than 10,000, if i win, i want to give him 50,000. (gasping) - [jimmy] wait. - seriously. - [jimmy] if you win the million dollars, you want to give him 50 grand? - yes. i want to give him 50 grand. - aw. - i really appreciate that. - this means you- - me and my cousin. - will now, in a few days, put your hand on a million dollars. and if you're the last one
