so i want to talk about anti-learning now when it's so bad it's good again something's so bad it's good i like it yeah so you'll have to you'll have to indulge me for a few minutes to get around to this but you'll like it in the end so it's something we've come across when we were doing a data mining problem to do with colon cancer in a machine learning video i already mentioned briefly about we're working with clinicians and we want to solve this problem where patients are roughly in four groups one group they're quite healthy they haven't really got serious cancer one group the cancer is very serious and then there's this big group in the middle where we're trying to say how serious is it and then the question becomes should i get radiotherapy you should take chemotherapy and if you overdo the therapy you cause more problems than good and it's really quite important to split them but it's very difficult to split the middle group so we were given this data set of about 500 patients and for quite some time we were working on this data set and we were working hard and you know you know maybe we make mistakes sometimes we're good researchers and and it seemed a good date i said 500 data 500 people is quite a good quality quality of data but we couldn't learn the difference between the categories in the middle it really was difficult for us to do that and we tried all sorts of methods we started with supervised methods because they're better usually and they didn't really work very well and then we went to some unsupervised methods and that didn't really make any sense in the data either and we could do the easy the hard groups we could do but we couldn't do the middle group and we tried for about two years i'm not joking i was really thinking i was just tearing hair out is the data just rubbish or what's going on we couldn't understand it and then it's one of those things that happens in universities one summer i somehow agreed to supervise this medical student on a master's project i don't know why i agreed to this and he came across sometimes tower office to have a chat and and he was just he was just doodling some pictures and he was also peripherally working on the same data not exactly but he was doing something related to this data and he was drawing these pictures i'll just draw a few of these pictures just to illustrate my point here so a lot of the data comes kind of in ordinal values like one two three four the raw data obviously looks very messy but then the medics have done something to it and they just said one two three four like levels so he was drawing some of this data and let's say this could be a particular value of an immune component in your body and like one of them you might be drawing like this and we're like yeah well okay that's that's what i expect you know it's one two three four and the higher number means you've got more of x whatever x is immunoglobulin x fine okay makes sense understand okay and then he was doodling some more pictures and he was doodling pictures like this and it's basically one two three four okay slightly less obvious but i mean i still understand okay okay so he was kind of saying yeah what this means is you have four means you have less of x okay and i don't know why they do it this way right medics are obviously logical you know fine higher numbers less of it i can kind of buy that should start zero should we yeah that's but let's not go there you know i probably don't get that okay but then and this is where it got really really interesting he was doodling some more pictures he was doing one like this and i was like what's this one two three four and it like goes up and down and he was like yeah because when you have a lot of this eggs or a little of this eggs then you're really quite ill and it's when you have the middle amount of x then then you're healthy this is a good level of x great so it's a good good x versus not so good x and high low is not so good and then obviously the last one he was drawing was it looked a bit like this where suddenly it was like well you know when you have a medium amount of feet that's when there's something wrong with you you either have not a lot of it or you have a lot of it then you're healthy oh this this medicine is complicated isn't it so we're suddenly starting to realize we've got this this data 500 patients and for each patient we had about two or three hundred of these observations and it wasn't salted like i imagined where one is small and four is large but well sometimes one was small sometimes four was large sometimes one was large and four was small i can cope with that but then sometimes it was also like the middle ones were good or the middle ones were bad or it was like all over the place completely messy that shouldn't be a problem for the computer you would think we can obviously learn all these things but the complication then came there is 200 of them and they all work together so what he was basically saying was well and this one is low and this one is high that's good oh when this one is medium and this one is low that's bad so so different numbers and different combinations meant different things and when he was talking about this i suddenly clicked something now let's switch topics for a moment something you might have heard in another video about the exclusive or problem xor so what's the xor problem go on i'm testing you now okay if if the inputs differ then you you get a one and if they're the same then you get a zero that's right exactly so we have two inputs keep it really simple two binary input zero zero one zero one and basically if they're the same that's not good we don't want that but if they're different yeah you get your reward and this is a classic computer science problem of course can be programmed in many ways and it turns out this is also a classic computer science problem that's really difficult for computers to learn and i'll just give you a simple simple illustration why that is so just draw that again but we just drawn just slightly differently so we have our two variables zero one zero one so we were saying if they're the same value then they're not good so this would be one one or this would be zero zero and this would be the two good values so it would kind of look like this now basically and i'm simplifying a little bit now but basically all this machine learning is actually learning a function that can separate the data into two groups or more than two groups but let's say two groups for now and a function at the end of the day again keeping it simple means you can draw a line through this that separates the two groups now gone then draw me a line through this that separates the ticks from the x's let's have a look okay i think the lines it's going to be a wavy line isn't it you can't draw a straight line that separates those there is no straight line you can draw history you would have to be like this or something yeah basically it's not a line anymore is it it's not a curve of some sort yeah absolutely this is it so there is obviously a way we can separate it with something complicated but there's no simple way of separating them anymore and that's exactly what the computer finds when it's trying to learn this and that's just for one zero one thing now imagine and this goes back to our patients now you've got 200 of them and they'll go between one and four not just zero and one and some combinations are good some combinations are bad and sometimes it goes up and sometimes it goes down you have a 200 dimensional mess like this basically and it's just impossible to learn a function anymore that kind of separates the things now once we realized this we had those sort of brilliant ideas like okay so it's really easy to get this problem wrong because obviously i can i can i can learn the line and it gives me the wrong answer that's easy so how about this then i just learned the wrong answer and i know now it's wrong because it's the xor problem and then after i've learned the wrong answer which is easy to learn and then just reverse it and we called it anti-learning so we tried this in our big data set and it worked surprisingly well i mean before we were getting basically answers which are 45 percent correct and you only have two two choices so it was basically worse than random and navigating answers you're seventy eighty percent correct so it definitely helped so so bad it was good and all because of the excel problem so what have i done i've done a sorting of the data and the approach i've done is something based on similarity measures these unsupervised methods they always use a similarity image in this case i've done kind of by color what i need to exclude and i'm excluding what i know about how to drive and eating and drinking what i have for lunch and all my memories about the last you know 34 years of my life everything might look like
