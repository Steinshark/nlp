i don't know that window and yeah hey so this event tonight is also which of course to promote the conference and there's a talk submission actually the new deadline i haven't announced that yet is june 26th on some parts on the website it will still be june'th which is a great idea to have your talk submitted until then then you're ahead of the deadline and so just you know the setting of this year's conference is very similar to last year we would have on-site attendees to also give the you know they will have access to the online part there's a main track which is streamed online or their on-site tracks which probably also get streamed and we have a pre-recorded online track and also regarding on on submissions you know we're talking about giving talks preparing talks submitting talks it's always a good idea to submit early so that you still can make changes too and think about your submission and you know not push it out to the last minute and tonight we're doing lightning talks about speaking that's the whole concept and yeah those three speakers is actually now two speakers because we had david sanker planned to join us but he has a fever today and so unfortunately we are not gonna hear from david so it's then that we you know have two speakers and more on the program in a minute the panelists after the learning talks and then if you're in below you can join us in the launch after this so this is tonight's program and myself are here in the left stream as you can see and pre-recorded the videos are ready to play are the talks from last year from tino early and chandra karth which you know is some they have covered things which are important to speaking online and still like valid so why not play this again for this event and with that already let's get started finish has prepared a lightning talk and thank you let me it happened now seems to have trouble yeah i am again in the studio okay phil let's get started i'll add your we're ready let's get started excellent thanks jens i might be a bit of a stretch to call this a lightning talk i think i'm going to eat into david's time as well so we'll see how this goes and this is none of this is going to be specific to c plus plus of course this is just about speaking in general so from nervous wreck to pro speaker in five easy steps we would like lists don't we and even if you don't consider yourself a like a nervous speaker there's always room for improvement there's always things we can learn most of the things that i'm going to talk about i'm still working on and i've counted them up recently i think i've done about 170 talks now i'm still learning i'm still improving so these are just some of the things that i've i've come across along the way that have helped so these are the the five easy steps we're gonna break these down now so we've got preparation breathing posture contact with the audience and the free ps we'll find out what they are so let's start with preparation seems to be a good at least to start so obviously this is what's going to happen before you you give a talk and the better your preparation of course the the better you're going to be able to get up and give a good talk and be confident in doing that now i put this quote up i'm sure you're familiar with this quote no plan survives first contact with the enemy and i put this up for two reasons the first one is no matter how much preparation that we we do if we've not really done much public speaking before when you first got up and actually start trying to deliver your material we're going to find that feels very different to how you imagined so be prepared for that don't assume that just you know you practicing at home and then going up in front of people it's going to work the same way if you're prepared for that that's going to get you a long way and we're going to have some tips to try to to work through that to accelerate you to be more confident but bear that in mind now the other reason i put this up is well who actually originally said this so apparently it's been attributed to a helmet from malt key from'71 except actually he he didn't quite say this it seems to have been combination of these two recollections from 1961 no plan survives contact with the enemy or from 1969 no plan survives the first contact of war put those two together actually die for these things to what helmut said either what he did say was this no plan of operations extends with any certainty beyond the first encounter with the main enemy forces and then all the others are just derivations of that at the point of going through all this is to say we can't over prepare it's very easy to go down rabbit holes and pick on things that aren't actually that important and i spent a lot of time researching those and that's fine it can actually add a bit of color to the talk like i'm doing right now the trouble is you're likely to end up running out of time for your main preparation and then getting to your talk on the day feeling you're not quite prepared because you spent the whole your time going down these rabbit holes i've been guilty of this over and over again so i know what i'm talking about so do try to avoid that do try to time box what's your you're going to be talking about so you do need to know your subject well that the core subject you should be very familiar with do extra research if you need to about that beyond what you're going to be talking about because you're going to get questions as well things are going to knock you off so make sure you know that core subject well don't spend too many too much time going down those extra rabbit holes another say time box your your research so that you still have time to actually put together the the talk itself now there's different ways that you can organize all of this i often will make an outline or i'll just put some rough slides in and i'll tend to use comic sans so i know that these are not the final slides otherwise i can be tempted to sometimes just let those through and there's other ways to to do that the point is to try to be deliberate in the way you organize your material and get it into its final form this is not going to be a talk about that so i'm not going to go into mod depth just have a plan even if it doesn't survive contact with the enemy what i do want to talk more about is rehearsing your material do try to make time for at least a few full run-throughs of your talk even if it's a long talk make sure you have at least one time you go into amp that can be really important but most of your rehearsal and practice beforehand should be not the full run through but actually around specific parts so the main thing here is to really select a few key parts of your material that you really want to make sure you're very clear on this part know what they are up front spend extra time practicing rehearsing those and and these key points are going to come up in a few other times in this material so how do i emphasize that make sure you know what your key points are have three four maybe five of them at most and everything else is just supporting those if you've got too many key points and you don't have any key points so that's the main things you can do in your preparation to make sure that when it comes to actually giving the talk you're going to feel prepared and that's half the battle so that's preparation now let's talk about breathing so you might think if i'm going to talk about breathing i'd put up a picture of some lungs but actually this is the autonomic nervous system and if you've heard anything about the autonomic nervous system you probably know that we tend to break it down into two parts there's actually three but we don't tend to talk about the other one so there's the sympathetic nervous system which is responsible for our fight or flight response we'll talk about that in a moment but i'm sure you're familiar with that and then the parasympics so again the parasympathetic nervous system is more to do with what we might call rest and digest or i think it's more useful to think of it as just the like calming down recovery those sorts of things that you can do when you're not in that fight or flight mode the both of these systems are active at all times but they generally are going to be in a sort of a nice balance where neither one is is dominant and they just come to play when needed and evolutionarily speaking when you enter a new situation unfamiliar situation that's perceived threats all around that's going to trigger your your fight or flight response to the sympathetic nervous system and in an evolutionary setting that's exactly the right strategy when you're standing in front of a room of people looking at you expecting you to speak to them having that same response is not quite so useful because what's going to happen is when that sympathetic nervous system is triggered your heart rate is going to go up speakers are going to become harder because your esophagus contracts actually makes it harder to speak you'll start sweating and your breathing is going to speed up you're going to be gasping in short short gasps of air none of that is particularly conducive to feeling calm and relaxed in a public speaking setting and this is usually what puts people off having that response and thinking no i can't do public speaking but that's also in the word autonomic nervous system well it means automatic which suggests that this is something that we can't control you know we are at the mercy of our sympathetic nervous system but that's not actually true we can control it we can control it with our with our inner thoughts once we're practiced on it but we can also control it physically through our breathing so venture that our breathing speeds up when we take short gasps but if we take control of that and we have a long slow controlled breaths that we actually start to take control of our sympathetic nervous system and it deregulates it back down so that the the parasympa nervous system can start to perhaps dominate again so you've probably heard about this breathing pattern that the long slow controlled breaths you you breathe out you hold on the exhale for a few seconds long breath back in hold on the inhale again don't underestimate how powerful this can be this directly controls the autonomic nervous system and gives you back that control that you will feel that you're lacking when you're up there you know in a public speaking situation to make best use of this you're going to need to practice this regularly ideally daily but if you can't do it daily then just at least doing this from time to time gets you into the habits of being able to take this control and then do it just before your talk particularly if you're out there on the stage just about to speak that's the perfect time to take that back that control get control of yourself get control of your breathing and be ready to give you a talk maybe even during your talk you can find opportunities to do this if you have a pause maybe you're doing a demo or some other time you're not actively speaking took the opportunity to take a long breath again get that control back make it a reflex so anytime you feel like you're losing control you now know how to gain that control back there's obviously a lot more that we said here i could do a whole hour or more talk on this but only got a few minutes i'm going to move on so the next item which is posture it's actually closely related because there's a there's a an evolutionary aspect to this that when we feel vulnerable we tend to sort of close up so our shoulders will roll forward we may tend to lean forward and on all of our body language is all sort of closed off because we're trying to protect ourselves and again that's not very useful when we're trying to be open and engaging with our audience and speaking in a relaxed way so very similar to the to the breathing and again similar to the breathing we can take conscious action in the other direction so if that shoulders are rolling forward well and pull our shoulders back but not to make them tight and tense so we need to get the shoulders relaxed just just pull back and one way can you can do this is actually if you sort of hold your hands open forwards then naturally the shoulders will go back but still be relaxed and that will actually help you to feel more open more open to the audience more relaxed and more confident and you'll project confidence as well but there's another part too to posture which can be really important as well and that's the head neck alignment so your head is actually very heavy it's what's one of the heaviest parts of the body and if you are starting to to roll forward a bit your head's going to come forward and it's going to start it's gonna you're gonna end up with some sort of cycle where you're going more and more forwards and you're going to feel like you're not in control again for the for the head and neck to be aligned the head should be above the shoulders above the hips above the knees and above the feet all those things should be in line and that sounds like a lot to keep in mind but fortunately our bodies actually work such that all of it happens automatically if we just do one thing and that's just to allow our head to to float forwards and up which sounds silly but try it and you'll find that everything else if you can relax your shoulders as well just sort of naturally falls into line and you instantly feel more confident more open and more in control and that's the sexual part of what's called the alexander technique which has been known for over 100 years now there's a really powerful technique for all sorts of performers singers and actors and anyone that has a has to have a stage presence but they'll study the alexander technic and there's a lot more to it there's another rabbit hole you can go down if you'd like but just remember that your head flow float forwards and up and that's really going to help you to open up and also give that opportunity to do that breathing as well so that's posture i need to move on with contact with the audience so that's our next point now most of this section is going to be about in person speaking for online speaking like i'm doing now i found one of the best tips to to get a connection with your audience is to have some way that they can interact with you so whether it's through some sort of a chat system a q a polls anything like that now we're not doing it here because this is technically a lightning talk but normally i would have something early on do it as early as possible where you're going to give me some sort of feedback something to let me know that you're actually out there and you're listening because when you're speaking into the void like i'm doing right now it could be really hard to while you're thinking about giving your talk also you're also thinking it's actually anybody listening is there anybody out there is this working as soon as you get that first bit of feedback it's not just that you know that people are there but you feel it as well and that helps you to relax so that's the one tip i'll give for online speaking but for in person speaking when you're faced with a sea of faces maybe it's a small group it can look like a sea of faces especially if you're you're new to public speaking don't think of the audience as a big faceless mob instead think of them as a collection of individuals and look at them as individuals look around the room at individual faces and as you're speaking actually direct your sentences a sentence or two at a time to just one person at a time try to go around the whole room and you will find that there are people with different levels of engagement especially if it's in a larger room there's always going to be somebody who looks a bit zoned out with people on their phones or their laptops but they may all have good reasons for doing so don't assume that you're just being boring just ignore those people find the friendly faces there's always going to be someone that's smiling nodding along just actively engaged there's going to be a few of those find those people and concentrate more on those say sentences to those but do look all around the room especially a larger room it can be very tempting to just to focus on a corner of the room and to the conclude the rest but you're not going to feel connected with the audience unless you're speaking to the whole room and doing so is also going to make you feel more in control as well so look around the room find the friendly places talk to those individuals and don't think of them as a a massive a mob that's out to get you so that's connecting with the audience one more section to get through i think we're already over time so let's see how how far we can go before he ends pause me off the free ps i think this is perhaps say the biggest practical point for actually performing the talk itself so if you've heard of the free ps before you'll know they are pitch power and pace and in particular being able to vary these things so some of us are naturally expressive speakers but even if we are when we get up on stage that might change because it's a different environment again it's a different skill set and it's something that we need to consciously learn about and practice and get get your own feedback but you can do it you can improve and you can master this skill public speaking if you consider the free piece so stage actors know that speaking is a performance and if you've ever seen a stage actor you know that they actually exaggerate things like pitch power and pace because if they don't then it just doesn't come across in a public speaking setting the one way that you can tune into this is to record yourself and for a lot of people particularly those new to public speaking that's the last thing they want to do i hear people all the time say i never listen to recordings myself i hate it but the thing is if you record yourself and then think oh what did i do wrong and then try it again record yourself again keep iterating until you do actually start to see some improvement that feeling well never completely goes away i'll be honest but it does get a lot easier and and you will find that you can tolerate listening to yourself and you'll always learn something there's always something you can improve on and it's better for you to catch that yourself and any treat on it so let's have a look at the three piece start with pitch i tried to be fairly brief on these i've actually got a lot of points so the pitch especially varying this may seem the most unnatural if you are new to public speaking again recording yourself is one of the best ways to both capture what you're currently doing and see how you can improve on it but varying this a lot can seem very unnatural to us especially to begin with so concentrate on using it for a particular meaning for example like using higher pitches to convey excitement or if you want to get more serious then you can take a lower tone the important thing is to keep it varied obviously don't we don't want to be monotonous and just speaking on the same tone but we also don't want to repeat the same pattern over and over again which we can often fall into if we're not paying particular attention to this so variety is the key here and practice is what will let us be able to do that so power this one is a little bit different we might have to be a little bit more careful about this by default we want to aim for mostly a consistent level of sort of volume and power to our voice because that's going to be comfortable to our listeners so it's usually going to be a little bit above our everyday speaking level i like to think of my you know public speaking voice as being different to my everyday voice it's a little bit above but not too much that it's going to be uncomfortable and we need to allow some headroom so that where i need to be we can add a bit of extra pump punched for emphasis now a bit of headroom for that quieter levels though they're a bit rarer but you can use them if you want to add a bit of mystery in you know maybe you want to share a secret with your audience be careful you want to make sure they can hear you but again having a range of power built into your your material can make it more interesting and it can make you feel more in control so lastly let's look at pace now one of the things i struggle with the most always guilty of undoing it right now speaking too fast and there could be many reasons for this in my case it's often because i've just got too much material to go through and so i'll naturally speak fast and the worst part is when i don't have too much material i've deliberately made less material so i don't have to speak so fast i forget and i fall back on the habit and i speak too fast anyway and just finish early so i'm still working on that you may also be speaking too fast if you're feeling a bit nervous there could be other reasons as well again it's something to be conscious of trying to take back that control but again varying the pace can be really important so if there's something you want to emphasize you can really slow down for that emphasis and if you have been speaking at a faster pace slowing down draws attention to what you're saying and again not only does your audience pick up on that but you personally start to feel like yeah i'm in control of this situation and i'm deliberately slowing down here and if you just got some filling material that's just bridging from one section to another it's okay to to speed through that a bit faster because if somebody doesn't quite follow you that's okay and that can also then give that contrast for when you do need to slow down but perhaps the most important part of varying your pace is the pause the pause can add real dramatic effect it can really emphasize a point you want to drill home but i can also give you a chance to think about what you want to say next or make it seem like you know you're really sort of drawing attention to this particular phrase so i'm going to emphasize the word pause again as well also a time that you can take that breath that you needed you can re-center yourself remind yourself of all those other things that you know perhaps but it's easy to forget them in the moment take the opportunity of a pause to breathe look at your posture think about the free peas and so on look around the room but also for the audience if you're hurtling along at a fast pace the audience is not going to be able to absorb anything everything you say you need those pauses to absorb and reflect on your material and to know which points they need to pay particular attention to so don't skip the pauses they're actually easy to do and one of the most effective tools you have varying your pace making your speaking more interesting and adding that dramatic effect so that's the three please don't forget the freebies pitch power and pace and varying them and also good preparation paying attention to your breathing your posture and maintaining contact with the audience if you keep these things in mind you should become a pro speaker in no time at all thank you very much thank you phil that was awesome there's one important thing for pauses which sneakers should do it's a very effective and it's also very good for you as a speaker you should drink yes always like a glass of water next to you on stage for that purpose that you drink because you really spend so much water without ever ever noticing it but this is like really like you know when you take a break that's a good opportunity also like like having title slides this is really great like chapters and then every chapter has a title and you take a break you take a drink the audience is getting ready thinking about that what i could examples anyways that was a really nice talk and i'm looking forward to the panel now i quickly go back to my slides thank you phil so next is the talk bite you know earthquake which is that's something let's see welcome everyone when you talk about giving conference talks to other people most people say that they don't have anything to talk about and i said the same in the past as well and now i have given several talks already i still consider myself a beginner speaker but i realized that i do people say that they don't have anything to talk about and i said the same in the past as well and now i so first i still consider myself talking about it will benefit others the same applies to any project like private projects you're working on or open source projects like anything you're working on or using or think about which questions problems or challenges have you or someone in your team encountered there's a high probability that many people have the same questions are and are in need of getting them answered so why not turn those discussions and solutions into conference talks so next maybe ask yourself what do you want to learn more about have you ever read an article or watched a conference talk but you wanted to learn more about the subject giving a talk is the perfect opportunity for you to get the topic to get to know the topic in depth you will always learn a lot in the process of writing a talk way more than just using some library fusion or maybe you learned about some interesting concept or a language feature and you want to figure out how you can use it in your code i always love to learn about real life examples of the new features so that's why i personally also like to give talks that are more practice oriented but don't think you need to be cutting edge to be giving a talk the basics are very underrepresented at conferences and most people don't use the new standards right away anyways so consider talking about the basics and as i said not everyone has this knowledge and many people will benefit from it and tell us what excites you do you like the theory over examples then do a talk about theory do you like examples and live coding more than theory then do that do you want the discussion rather than a one-hour monologue that's also fine a talk you're excited about will always be better than a talk that you don't care about and there is an audience for every style of talk also you can play around with those elements and find out what presentation style you prefer it doesn't have to be perfect in the beginning in fact you shouldn't strive for perfection at all just give it your best and everything will be fine and this i think is very important talk about your ideas i can't tell you how often i had an idea and i talked myself out of it it's only once i started talking about my ideas that i got some great feedback and encouragement others might also have a different viewpoint you can include in your talk or they might know if there's already something similar out there so talk about your ideas and gather some feedback and don't chalk yourself out of it and lastly relax speaking might look intimidating and speakers might look like they know everything but they are just normal people like you and me speaking is a skill and you learn and improve by doing it so here's a summary of everything i just said i hope you find something useful in it and you can take a screenshot here at this point if you want to so just to summarize what are you working on which libraries are you using or writing which open source project are you using or working on which questions problems what challenges have you or someone in your team encountered consider talking about the basics don't assume everyone knows what you know talk about the things that you are excited about take the time to find your presentation style talk about your ideas and get some feedback and in the end relax and have fun so all i can say is you can do it try it out you might like it and i'm looking forward to see a lot of new speakers thank you yeah thank you tina yes also here thank you tina so i already mentioned david schanker wanted to give to i wanted to contribute to list and i unfortunately he got sick maybe he already i don't know it's like did he prepare spies so i hope to see us contribution to this event next year maybe but it's david we i hope that you're gonna be soon fit again and so we were continue with oh that's myself i also prepared to talk let me not wait that's actually in my starts so yeah let's go so i wanted to quickly you know cover a bit about speaking online and motivate you to give talks online first talk was already a very good introduction into into giving talks and a lot of that is true for giving talks online except that you're basically if you give talks online you have to be comfortable with keeping your own pace and just not necessarily have always the feedback from the audience because you only have one monitor for example me so but i want to point out that speaking online for you as someone who wants to start speaking as a huge opportunity if you want to get started in preparing talks giving talks you know give tutorial talks like for users just stuff which is easy to prepare to give which is interesting for many programmers which you don't want to get used to or talked about something and you can present your ideas to an online audience very easy nowadays and let me quickly point out that music plus online this year has an online track again this pre-recorded tops mostly this is a default we would like to pre-record most of the tokens when not like all of them and i actually am able to you know i have the tooling for that as it is you know using here for string this also can record talks so we will be doing that in this setting this is a lot easier to organize and at the day when you speak you will not have any internet or tech problems and also of course for me as an organizer this is just a lot better to know that something in the cloud triggers the video feedback and then it plays and it's a lot less stressful for both sides so that's why we went for online content to say if you are able to pre-record we would prefer that it's not always possible sometimes speakers don't have time for that and they then have to give their talk stuff that is also looking so you know from last year also want to point out like if you're already a new into video recording and making videos and you want to make a fun video for the conference which is your talk presents on some topic that's also an option and i know that unfortunately david sancko we don't have here but david sancho actually did that once it was an awesome talk and i know we have some youtubers so if you have a youtube channel or you want to start one that that be option to to you know have your video as a talk at meeting c plus plus and also listen of course this then that i want to you know reach out with that to all the people which so far couldn't give a talk at media c plus plus because they're not able to come to me c plus plus because we're in berlin and maybe you have visa issues maybe you have just travel issues that you you don't like to fly especially not long distance or maybe you have a family and you can't just you know fly away for a weekend maybe your current boss doesn't like the idea and wouldn't let you go you don't want to take like your holidays off that's fine many of us has a bit of a different opinion on that when do you just you know tell them that you know there's a start for your employer that can give a lot more support to your talkers or maybe you're able to talk about something what you did at work some companies are not very happy about that idea and other companies are like totally happy to let you share what they did or what you did at your work what your team did and and make that part of your talk content-wise new material is great but old ideas are also worth thinking about you know they can have their merit and maybe you already have slides right you maybe you already you know do presentations at work and you have slides about c plus plus 11 or 14 or 17 or 20 and you just you know have a basis and can that just turn that into a talk add a bit of styles and a bit of material screenshot here some statistics here some poll there and you have a talk the other thing i want to stress is like maybe you've already have given the talk right for the online track we're looking for speakers so maybe you could give it again online and maybe that that is you know for you to the way to become a speaker at maybe c plus pluses here and i want to point out that of course you know if you don't have that or to talk lying around we're always looking for new speakers you're welcome to join us either if you're able to come to berlin and speak on site and adjust your breathing and stage as phil just mentioned or you're able to pre-record a talk on your own always media c plus plus also maybe your company has like i know that some speakers have pre-recorded the talks with their company equipment so maybe your company has a studio or something like that can be used for that and and that way also you can add to the knowledge base of c plus i want to point out that you don't need to be an expert necessarily to start speaking if you are an expert or consider yourself an expert that is also a good way to start speaking or continue speaking but you don't need to be if you just give an introductory talk into presenting that's how we do game deaf at our company or that's how we use cute boost there's so many frameworks used in c plus plus fully and all the others come to mind introduction talks and how to get started with that how to build it how to you know use it some examples it's really low hanging fruit which usually is not picked up by a lot of speakers if you want to start speaking that's a good way to start i want to point out if you're speaking and submit talks submitting multiple talk ideas is great especially if you like submit to the topics that have competition there's a lot of rangers talks this year two years ago when tina will play which was a start speaking she sent me to the rangers talk and that was a great introduction into rangers and that was a great idea back then this year i already see that we have a lot of talks on ranges and probably more coming because of every speaker submitting sees this last year co routines was a really popular topic where we had five to six submissions and two or three people speaking on the conference about it and yeah be aware that you know potentially if a committee member or paper authors or just general other speakers are still have submitted or maybe submitting on the same topic that is currently popular or is like a top feature of c plus 20 or 23 it's still fine to submit to that but think about having like you know a second horse on the race which made it interesting easy to do talk on an overview on how to get started with cute boost or any other library and c plus plus or maybe it's good some other connected technologies tools these talks are very very valuable for the audience and they are usually not that often submitted so that's kind of an venue an avenue field where new speakers also can fill in the holes which we have currently and the speaking landscape where people submit things and talks to especially like things in game dev we have very very few submissions in game dev at all i want to mention embed it i want to mention finance anything work related science scientific computing there's a lot of great topics out there where you can give talks on which are not necessarily always covered in our submissions so if you're the one person to submit the talk for that you're probably having a good horse in that race and a quick word on the top lengths on-site talks should be 60 minutes with 5 to 15 minutes on questions online talks have the same lengths on the schedule it can be a lot less i've seen people give online talks in 30 minutes probably could have been an hour if they had the pacing under control but i also have seen that a lot of people went over time online so if you're speaking online don't be don't be focused on the time don't be worried about that i've seen people go over time i've seen people to be faster and it never mattered to the talk okay one thing if you're like really short if you're if you're pacing is out of control i had that issue once i couldn't control myself because i was on stage speaking and finished my talk 20 25 minutes too early and in that case i pulled a rabbit out of my head i just was like no no we have the questions that i know have left a little bit more time for questions so that we can debate about this topic and you know the audience felt engaged with that and we had an audience and happy and engaged discussion and question around so that worked out so you know it's a trick maybe to have up your sleeve if you're agree like you know happen to have a talk finished early then you can always engage with the audience and the last thing of course is always to submit your talk with that lets me have involves talk play my talk is i think maybe the next step after you pick the topic and this is something that i learned from my experience which is not very broad but still i have some of it so i think it's very important to be able to distilling your message in in the talk so let me let me explain so let's say i want to explain to you about a vector and please excuse my very simple example so this card is actually coming from a website explaining about stood vector but as you can see this code is not fitting for the slide you can't give a talk about vector fill in the slide like that so for example the creation of the vector we could basically use initialization list the part of printing you could use a print function and have a comment explain your intention here for the pushback you can do the same notice the commenting again and for the pop-up back etc etc so what i'm trying to say in short is that visualization is very important when you try to express an idea on a presentation another example let's say i want to explain the vector more deeply i could use images i could also show just with a simple image what happens when i add an element so please excuse my very very simple and not not well designed photos but i hope you get the idea here so i want to talk about data visualization generally in a world people don't have a lot of of time to capture a lot of complex ideas and but when they do come to your talk that means that they're actually very anxious to learn so i think giving them good explanation visual visualized explanations would be very helpful and help them get more connected with their ideas they're trying to express so here on the right you can see it's a meta picture it's a picture talks about a good visualization and this is actually coming from a very cool book called information is beautiful so there's two of them as far as i know and i would highly recommend them i'm not connected to the author in any way but those are really awesome books one is called information is beautiful the second is knowledge is beautiful and in general they talk about how do you express information in a visual way so i think what i'm trying to say is create an experience for your audience also communicate with them and most important care about your audience you want to have them enjoy your talk so to summarize i would say that creating a good talk will include having a good structure usually visualization and minimization in your talk get some perspectives have other people that known that know this topic see your talk give you feedback and even just you know have have more broad perspective of the topics that you have decide what are the takeaways that you want your audience to take from your talk and of course what tina have said and i think is very important present your own views the talk would not be great unless you put what you feel that is important and what you want to express and also just make sure you bring all the equipment you need this is very important because it's never fun to find out too late but to summarize a good talk is about what you bring thank you and of course i just want to say if you want to reach out i i will be happy to help with talks and presentations thank you thank you that was very good very nice gender characters next let's quickly let him come around good code samples and slides and we saw a live demo of how to actually build those slides now it's time to have a live demo about live demos i like i like meta and so i figured this would be a fun way to do this so here we're gonna we're gonna kind of go through and do a little bit of a live demo so what are we actually talking about what are live bin was even good for doing so the first thing that i think about with the live demo is it's really good for zooming in on some topic right this isn't this is a way to engage the audience right something you can show practical real tools that you want people to use it's really great for showing very specific code or specific details of something that's fairly complex it's good at focusing on how much more than why that means that there's also something that live demos are not really good at and this is kind of zooming out right you don't want to try and step back or really get to the bigger picture with the live demo kind of it doesn't make sense it doesn't engage the audience very well it's hard to get people to focus on what or or especially why you're saying something when you're doing a live demo they're reading the demo right and so if you want to kind of you know highlight your perspective or focus on an interpretation a lifetime mode doesn't tend to be the best thing so also let's look at how we actually want to do a live demo first thing you have to do is you have to plan every single step this is this is hard to do but it's really really really important right how do you actually get into the live demo how do you move from one step to the next step how does everything work while you're doing this you want a good plan from the beginning another thing to think about is how do you wrap up the live demo and go back to your slides this is super super important if you know you have a live demo that you're mixing into the rest of the talk and and if you i'm curious everybody should think about how many pages of notes they think i prepared in order to be able to do you know a seven minute lightning talk on this i think i think this can be kind of interesting to see and we'll actually look at the notes i have later if you have your plan what are the kind of key components of making your live demo a success first thing to think about is you've got to work within the projector and the audience view you you can't you can't be trying to to make the projector of the audience look at at your live demo the way you would while you're working at a desk with a big monitor you have to go the other direction right put yourself into the shoes of having a low resolution terrible projector with bad lighting right and so i've zoomed all the way in and this is actually the view that i'm looking at right i'm looking at the same thing you're seeing here and it's important that you kind of learn how to work in that environment and feel comfortable working that environment you also have to learn the tools you're going to be presenting you're going to know them really really well much better than you need to actually just use them day to day you got to know how to make them work for the demo if you're going to use visual studio code or an ide you need to be able to just jump right into it pull things up move around right if you want to show a preview you have to know where it's going to come up when it doesn't fit easily on the screen you got to know how to fix that how to rearrange everything so that you get the view that you want to show the audience right i'm a big fan of virtual desktops for live demo it lets you kind of move between different tools in a way that's pretty smooth you always have the same layout the exact thing you're expecting each time you look at it you want to find this tooling workflow that's going to be effective when you're demoing it live next you have to make this feel real to the audience right you don't want to do something that's just going to oversimplify it right it's tempting to oversimplify you know in in slide code you don't have to make it compiled but when you're actually doing a live demo you need stuff to compile you needed to work with the real tools and that's really hard and so you know actually use stuff here and so i'm actually using i have my my editor set up it does automatic formatting of my markdown here you want to try and make it real so that people actually see how things work the next thing is you do want to make this live in the moment so you you'll see me make mistakes here right that's fine it's good to actually have some mistakes that you have to correct live right and then people can kind of see that now this is this is actually real it's actually happening a lot and it keeps them engaged other thing is to never ever stop talking and this is i think the hardest thing about a live demo it's especially hard when you're gonna actually talk about something that you're not currently typing and when you're trying to do this it's very hard to keep keep it in your head what you're trying to say and what you're trying to type and you'll notice the technique i'm using here which is on alternating and so i'll type a word and i'll say a word and i'll type a word and i'll say a word it's really hard for your brain to handle text in two different streams and so have a plan for how to do that and how to make it through it this is also one of the weird times when things like and hesitations that's actually fine when you're live demoing because what you want to do is keep the audience engaged while you have time to make it through your live demo next make it fast and comfortable one thing you'll notice is that i move fast in a live demo i move really really fast and that's because people can easily get get bogged down in the live demo and so you've got to rush just a little bit but of course you can't go too fast or it'll lose people it's a hard balance to strike and so i i don't i don't have a perfect advice here but it's something you've just got to do all right next up okay i said i said to plan scratch all of that it's not actually about planning it's it's about practice i mean you need you need some plans or you know without a plan you can do a great live demo with a minimal plan but you have to practice right you have to make it comfortable and fast and you don't move this like a lot of people have talked to me after a live demo and they're like how do you type that fast by typing the same thing over and over and over again i don't normally type this fast but you gotta practice it until you're comfortable and you're fast and you can keep the audience moving and you have to practice things going wrong and so you don't get locked into this rigid script so let things go wrong mess up intentionally accidents happen that's fine you want to kind of get that full experience when you're practicing all right the last thing is you've got to cheat sometimes you're going to be doing like i forgot what i'm supposed to type that's fine just have something prepared ahead of time right just pull out a prepared selection of things really fast this is not a big deal right people actually are fine with it they know things are going to go wrong the key for you as the presenter is just roll with it right have those candidates catch back up you can even use a pre-filled framework kind of like what i'm using here to move yourself through each step of what you want to present this could go wrong last but not least you should really be honest and provide your sorts this is actually one of my my big mistakes that i've made in a lot of tonks is that i don't always kind of upload the source provide people access to it this hurts two things both the credibility it's really hard for people to believe live demo if they can't reproduce it but it also earns accessibility like it's it's nice that i have a decent contrast and a big font but even better is to actually have a git repository that people can go and check out and correct whatever they've misread i understand like uploading could be hard this is actually my problem is that you know if you work for a company you have to like sort out licenses or something but i really encourage everyone try to do this i'm actually going to try and get this uploaded on my github page just so that i actually have done this yet but i couldn't get it ready before before the talk but try and actually provide a link to things it's so helpful if you're doing a live demo to then kind of show all of the inputs so that people can see them as it was that i do want to just show you what kind of notes went into the planning for this right and so these are all of the notes that i was taking to myself in my initial run through trying to plan out every step of what i want to do okay hundreds of lines of notes went into a seven eight minute talk and so with that i've done a live demo and and i hope this helps you all do your next lifetime demo because i think it's a really fun way to engage audiences thank you chandler that was awesome [music] we are back with another program so we now have the last talk which is one thing we actually didn't cover last year what i wanted to cover this year so let's go thanks chandler that was actually an awesome demo last year but i also want to quickly say something about you know how do you submit the talk for the new speakers also just have for the folks in hubido there's some ports which you can take so i just launched two new polls and so how do you submit a talk to midi c plus there's two urls one is to submit the talk itself and the conference url this before this is started and similar for other conferences right now cpp con also has their call for talks and other conferences are going to happen over summer and then they're going to have that similar process for them and it's not like that we have like a standard here it's like oh everyone is doing it slightly different they're going to have that next year and so this is of course a bit opinionated of a lot of things i say so take this as a grain of sort okay first yeah create an account that's most most of the submission systems todays are account based of course subscribe to menu etc and to the weekly block role where i share all the block links with you every week and then you'll need to submit your talk and the first thing you will do is to fill out your speaker bio quickly want to go through for some of those things we actually have now a review group so if you want to help review talks or just see what other people write in their talk descriptions join the group and in this box as your speaker bio which of course is the most important part and want to point out if you want to add a link that's this simple a lot of people seem still not to know that and the picture of you when you submit a talk is optional when your talk is selected for the conference of course it's not as optional anymore and now you're ready to submit your talk so let's break this up this form as you just saw let's go for the truck title first keep your talk title short there's some people there's like really like to have talk titles which are like you know container comma and a complete different sentence after it it's too long i don't include subtitles i think it's like for for technical reasons it's probably in our world better to avoid certain characters and titles like you know especially commas semicolons and other stuff if you don't absolutely have to have that and in your talk description not in the topic button network title don't do that reasons are like html entity conversion etc etc okay exceptions like yeah c plus is fine and if you have to have it in your talks header that's fine just i want to take a note good titles are engaging so how to and and so on using c plus plus 20 23 17 11 14 26 for what you do memes can work introduction overviews and tutorials can just you know say what they are introduction into writing applications with lip and gui or lip boost cute etc i also want to point out that well-known speakers get a various talk title that are sometimes questionable or maybe not as good for you as a new speaker because a lot of people who will judge the talk by the new title by the pilot title if they don't know the speaker already and sometimes speakers just get away with a bad title or it was a catchy title because they're already well known and they already you know get the get the points for having done lots of good talks and being a good speaker so if you're new to speaking pay attention to your dog title and just because you know the big and your your speaker idle the speakers which you salvaged your favorite as you think are really good they might not be the best orientation for you and regarding to to for the title talk description is yeah what you're talking about you should add here more than a paragraph also it's not a blog post so don't put too much into it again there's a possibility to actually put a really physical html link into here and be aware that if you're copy pasting this from some other source you're copy pasting artifacts from like word documents etc into this that is why i highlighted here this symbol which is the html code which is which is control will generate and there you will be able to see like if you have any inline css or other things and other shenanigans in there and also this is the way to put your code into pre snippets okay into pre-tax that's the way how to present code on my platform and when i was too the outliners how to how do you envision your talk i often put site talk titles in here another skillet too what people should know about you or this token specific which isn't on the talk description maybe also stuff you don't want to put in the talk description because it's important for the talk but for for people reviewing your the free text form you can put in whatever you want to put in there but it's visible to the reviewers and voters on my platform the attendees never gonna see it when they're not participating in the voting and if they participated in the voting they're not going to kind of remember it ideas etc is just an open field now what i'll find out is a lot of people seem to fill out this and and you then should revisit after filling out the outline your talk description because the most popular feedback i have given to speakers last year was your outline contains the second or third paragraph of your talk description just in bullet points you know that's just that's something like which you put in your in your outline which is great that you mentioned that but that should also be in your talk description that's the the best thing we learned last year through the review system that a lot of speakers should review their talk description after doing the outline the audience is something we cover to to have that who should come to your talk orientation or combinations make sense give people an orientation of the level of your talk that's that's what this is about there's four more options which i quickly want to cover as a conference organizer it's important to me that we have some talks which are like new or not has been at every conference already so if your talk is like new and you prepared for the conference if you don't submit it to another conference in front of me in c plus plus and you really like saying well this is the one talk i have and this is i i want to go to berlin and speak at medium c plus plus and present this talk as new that's what this is about and it's also important for as an organizer to me to know this is also going to be displayed in the voting as files i know and it will give you maybe a little bit of an edge if you're like preparing a new talk and i already mentioned the the review system we have in place so if you want to have your review and like feedback on your talk then check this supports up to two speakers so if you have a second speaker check this box and it triggers the second speaker bio form in the next form and you will be able to enter the name email and the bio and yeah so we have an online only track which is pre-recorded as i already mentioned prior that's what this box is for to tell us this and as i said it's if if you want a comfortable then you don't have to do that but there is no on-site only box because that would be too much everyone may speak online i understand that some some speakers don't want to speak online but if your talk doesn't get accepted and we still have open slots in the online track some people might want to go for it on the other hand there are speakers which are not able to come to building legendary mentioned prior to and they may you know want to indicate that this talk is for the online audience and that they will prepare it or do the pre-recordings and in that case that gives a huge edge for your talk and also helps us to select the talks for the online presence of the conference and last but not least of course submit your talk and quickly mentioning again that of course there's a login you're able to edit it and let's also like one thing which i find that is important because you submit your talk on the next day you will find something or you will have a shower thoughts and in the next week to something to add something to change and we are able to give you feedback and you you'll be able to edit the talk and the way we do that so that's good the next steps from our site then is once a call for talks has ended which is 26th of june one week you about one week you'll be able to edit your submission then the voting is where you know the token for this process is visible to most voting folks foremost speakers and some other folks in my team since other speaker and photo that we have you know balance set in the voting and then the selection is guided by the track for the voting results last year was specialized at 10 years in hybrid we're hybrid this year again but we have more tracks on site actually this years conference is pretty much modeled after last year's conference because it was quite a good success and what we kept for this year and so this is not as special but we'll just started you know kind of not as limited in the space due to the pandemic anymore so if you want to come to berlin you're welcome and i'm looking really forward to see many of you there i know that thanks for listening submit your talk until june 26th on the website on some pages it still still says june'th deadline i haven't announced that officially that this is now moved to june 26th due to my holiday being longer yeah so that's something which i will change but it's on on the submission form it's already changed which is an important part if you have any questions if you're watching this on youtube in the comments and otherwise in the chat we will be doing the the panel now so thanks everyone for speaking either today or last year and the panel will start soon let me quickly go in the studio and see see everyone is here then let me bring invite online and let's see what is okay i think we're ready for the panel you would have to unmute yourself can you hear me hello yeah so we're gonna get ready for the panel if you need to get something to drink or need a small break that will be fine but otherwise we're live right now just letting you know and with that we need questions for the panels so there's a q a tab in hubido if you have any questions put that in the q a tab that's the best way for me to find it of course there's also the chat you can put that in the chat and if you're on linkedin on the chat if you have any questions about technical speaking giving talks if also conferences we have like i think three conference organizers also here by coincidence today so we'll be taking questions on on conferences maybe later a little bit but first we want to focus on the technical speaking aspect which is today about and as not everyone probably knows everyone here very assistive panel read stuff the panel was an introduction round so as our new guest maybe in bell can you get started with an introduction sure i'll be happy to so my name is imba levi i'm the envy chair for the israeli national body in the standardization i'm working 21. but you've mentioned my relation to conferences and trophies are israeli conferences happening next week and i'm really looking forward to it and excited and of course you know stressed and and busy with everything that needs to be you know making sure everything is perfect and we're really excited as well because we have approximately half of our speakers are people you know international speakers and we have brna starstruck the creator of c plus coming over even keynote so of course it's going to be our largest conference yet yeah i think conferences are a great opportunity to meet you know the international community and that's actually i mean how i started my first exposure to international c plus plus world was by giving a talk in our local conference which was organized by adian michael which i still owe them a lot for that and and i think it's amazing and and the the path i did since and how i got involved in a lot of things that that i care a lot about so i just want to tell people if you're unsure that you want to take this step i i think you really should and i really think it opens a lot of doors and a lot of opportunities that's my experience at least good luck with the conference in battle thank you so you want me to go next games okay so hello again everyone i'm phil nash do you may remember me from the from the talk area but i'm also a developer advocate at sonar which means i get to do this sort of thing a lot which is one of the reasons that i've racked up over 170 talks now i also run a conference c plus plus on c which is actually going to be in about three weeks so that's coming up soon as well that's all going pretty well as well it's nice to see all the conferences actually coming out of the the pandemic times now not quite back to where they were but we're getting closer so that's nice to see yeah i've also got my fingers in lots of other buys co-host of cpp cast now and also around the c plus plus london so if you're in the london area you can come to our meetup oh and i i used to be the well i'm still on the original author of catch now catch two i haven't really been an active maintainer for a few years now but you may know me for that as well so yeah the chance you may have come across me before yes and i also may i mute me to introduce myself hey i'm your host i'm jan speller i i started more than 11 years ago meeting c plus plus also i've been running a user group for some time that's this user group here now but also the user group industry it off and generally work a little bit in the last years as a conference organizer community manager etc so let's see if we have any questions also yeah so see underneath and yes there seems to be the normal quietness at the beginning of the panel so what questions did i had prepared let's maybe talk about what talks are missing from your conference what talks would you like to see i think by conference we probably lacking some of the the beginner material we've got a little bit but not enough it's nice to see that cpp con about the the back to basics track key is now that seems to be going well always really popular with the the attendees but we don't get enough submissions for those tracks so i think we need to do a bit more as organizers to get that that sort of content in your muted games yes as i mentioned already i think that gamedev is like one of those areas which is underrepresented at our conferences where we definitely could see that you know we have submissions on it would be nice and that it is something which was meeting embedded joining my conference now as a track will probably be a bit more prevalent at my conference and as i said yeah beginner talks tutorial talks talks which are not as high level people often like to talk about the things they work on and so naturally if you're working on something interesting that is always a good talk and especially if it's like in a field it last year meeting c plus was a very popular talk about from the finance sector i actually not yet the most viewed talk about is on the way to to become the most viewed talk providers in the years at my channel already has wrecked up i think over 100 000 views pretty good so there's a lot of things like if you look at the programs from the last years of you like yeah as it's been covered with this if you ever thought about that and of course yeah i want to hear invite thought on this sure so i i would be really happy to see more tooling talks in our conference we actually have one that i'm really looking forward to anastasia from japan's is going to give a standard c plus plus toolset talk which i'm really really looking forward to see but i think that the debugging sanitizers you know and and and even like even a nice talk about compilers and you know how do you recognize how do you you know maybe for beginners how do you feel more comfortable with compilers errors which is something that i find you know challenging for beginners i think those things are are really important we don't have any talks about gaming that's also unfortunate because it's also very fascinating territory so maybe next year we'll get two more and and as you've mentioned the beginner's track is also something that i mean we were always happy to get talks aimed for beginners but i really think that at that stage that we only have four tracks this year which is relatively large for our conference maybe next year would actually split it into a different track and i agree that the cpp con you know having back to basic i think it's it's a really important part of a conference [music] but yeah there's there's a lot of topics i'm very interested at so we'll see we'll see what happens so which are common mistakes that should be avoided during a talk i think there's two mistakes where one leads to the other and i mentioned it in my talk actually which is trying to put too much material in for the time allowed and then speaking too fast because they've got so much material to cover at least that's a common mistake for me you technically took my yeah i was gonna say that i mean yeah for extra emphasis i had too much material in my talk today that happens i i think like i had my machine reboot on stage before the talk just because i connected to the to the projector so everything will be fine until you actually connect your machine to the technical things to give you a talk so be prepared to have like an earlier version or the current version if you can of your talk on a stick to be able to you know switch laptops think a really big mistake as a speaker is to be late to like show up on time because if you're on time you're already late if especially if you're giving a talk on site online we're trying to get around this problem this pre-recording so your talk will be online on time but if if you're on site it's really really important that you have time to to pre-check some sometimes you can do that like the day before but mostly if you've done it before if you have experience with presenting on various projectors with your machine you're presenting from it's mostly enough to like be like 15 minutes 10 minutes already there to be wired up and to connect your laptop and project your slides and send to be ready for that 101 repeat the point you made about having your talk saved somewhere else as well whether it's on a usb stick or i always keep all of my talks in dropbox so make sure you've got all my talks going back to 2004 in there it's only a couple of times i've had to fall back to that ironically the first time i was actually giving a talk at displaylink to the company that actually makes the display connector technology couldn't connect my laptop to their screens so i had to fall back to my dropbox copy and use somebody else's machine but i had that option so yeah so definitely something to do and now you have a great story well exactly yes yeah that's probably a good idea to to have your talk also on the internet and this you know where we're living in let me see if there's a new question yes i need to copy this over and click add manner and then click show also like if linkedin wants to answer wants to have an answer to a question etc you can post questions to the chat and i'll be able to also put them in here so this is a question like about format we're looking for the standard format is a talk with slides versus unfortunate sometimes but i find this is a good question like are you only looking for talks or so like learning sessions which include coding exercises you know yeah some sometimes you have laptops other stuff but yep so would something like that be welcome let's discuss this so i can i can say for our conference for example we have our conference is technically on june 6 and 7th but we have a pre-conference workshop day on the 5th on which this is you know a workshop in a small class we you know attendees coming with their laptop and actually doing the the the exercise coding etc we also have [music] more of a open and this actually caused some money like significant amount of money because the instructors are are actually giving this workshop and there are professional that this is their living living hood we also have post-conference workshops which are more open and they're designed to introduce the topic not necessarily go that deep into into it but still introduce a topic to people that are new to it for example a gpus and also we have a workshop about intel technology i think this is really great to be part of a conference i think i mean personally i love i love those you know i love to try things by myself it may be like for you know a whole full of people of 200 people or or 150 people it may be a bit harder because it's enough that just one or few people are you know missed the link that you just posted or whatever and and it's kind of harder to do this but i think that most cases the most conferences should at least have some kind of ability to to allow also workshops and me personally i'd be happy to get you know we'll be happy to get more workshops for our conference so if you're interested in that it doesn't have to be like a full day workshop it's usually the the the the framing but you could also do like a one hour two hour workshop and that could be awesome as well yeah we have a similar arrangement with c plus plus on the scene pre-conference workshops which are typically all day during the pandemic we did experiment with a half day workshops during the main program as well that actually worked out really well although we're experimenting with a few things at once and overall it wasn't a massive success but everybody there really enjoyed it i wanted to do that again now we're back in person but because the numbers aren't quite high enough we've actually gone down to three tracks instead of the four that we had before i feel like we might be displacing too much of the the normal content that way but once we get a little bit bigger again i want to give that another try you could also do workshop style presentation in a normal 60 or 90 minute slot if you're if you're very focused i think one of the problems starts to be expectations if people are not expecting to sort of go in and bring their own laptops and actually do something then you know and everyone not everyone's going to be along with you there may be a lot of extra disruption there's people getting set up which takes time as well so i think you need to have that format established and people know what they're they're expecting beforehand so definitely not out of the question i think it's something to to experiment with but there are some things to take into consideration before doing so shall we say there's space for that and there's space for submissions which are on orthodox sandwich and don't you know fit the usual topless states setting we have had workshops that being c plus plus i don't have them this year i think because my experience with workshops has not been that great from the audience take up that is not like an automatically given that there is a lot of audience coming to the workshop and also i find it sometimes hard to to get the right workshops and to to get the feeding like which workshop is actually being taken on by the audience that's why i as you know you need to rent the room you need to rent the technical things for it there's a customers you need to recover as a conference organization and the overhead ads to to having these people in the workshop so for medium c plus plus i have found that it's sometimes hard to do that and that didn't opt to have that this year and maybe have that again they have some some ideas there but generally on this question i think like yes this would be great to have something like a coding dojo okay so you want to moderate the coding dojo if you want to give anything in an interactive format where you actually you know make it clear from the beginning that you know the audience will interact with you and that you had to do like a coding quiz or something like that this can be fun and people are open to that to join you in the session at a conference so yes there's space for that and you can definitely submit something like that and just very unusual to have such a submission and you'll probably will then have at least a conversations so it was a conference organization to get a feel like are you able to host this session and how do we want to make this part of the program because maybe we just put in a normal stock maybe put it in the evening program there's other options one thing we're doing this year mu c plus plus is we were having the launch back and so we're going to put a track in the launch where people just meet up parallel to the normal talks and have like a user group meeting user group organizers we're going to have a meeting on probably on boost or cute depending on who's on the conference who can you know share that then so people just meet up and discuss their their issues and their experiences with the library was a standard it was a committee probably have some committee members so maybe have you know i meet the committee session in the launch it's also very possible and i'm very popular and at least the launch session let's see there's new questions i think you actually segued nicely into oliver's question in a way talking about other alternate formats that could very well be let's see we are always talking about the workshops why don't we modernize a little bit and have also a hackathon to attract the younger generation which is hopping unrest python but thank you again those alternate formats whether it's a more hackathon like or more workshop like if it's a an established part of the program there's a definite space to like a track or or a day dedicated to that then when people know that they're going for that i think that can work really well i think my my concern is when you have it just as like one or two like spread its sessions it's stuck adhesive enough and people are not going to have the right expectations going in so yeah you need enough submissions to to make that work and maybe you know planning ahead of time to say this is so be interesting to to know how many people really want that sort of content in in our communities maybe we just need to step up to it yes so i'll definitely it's actually upgraded you're going to be very supportive of that i love hackathons it's it's kind of and it's kind of a hobby so yeah are a bit different in the sense that i mean at least the formats that i'm familiar with is that people are expected to stay awake through the night and you know and sometimes people are not like that's not what they're looking for in a conference but i think we could definitely do this and you know for some smaller group or whoever is interested of course and i think it could be really really great so i'm actually i'm actually really i actually really like this idea remember we'll try it next year especially thinking about it c plus plus now they do the the library in a week thing which sort of like a background hackathon in a way it's not quite the same thing but a similar similar idea group of people get together and work on other projects by the end of the week they're going to show off what they've come up with we actually had library and language in a week this year so we also yeah so people were also working on on language feature but yeah i agree it's a it's a great part of cbp now in my mind so yeah it's a hackathon which has right now happening or which not not right now happened angle which is planned i think for july from cpp india which has been announced so they have a website about that and organizing that i think like yeah it's a nice format to have if i find someone to to organize this right you want to run a hackathon be our guest on the other hand conferences always have a lot of the problem to to know as their audience wanting to have that or not we do this with the launcher we can host things which is very popular but like creating new space for things like that needs like folks which check on the organizing the hackathon from cpp india is sponsored by undo and that's probably also an opportunity for sponsors to step up and organize something add something to the conference which we sometimes have had that some sponsors like run a coding a contest or something so generally other formats and new formats are very welcome to the conference world it's just often a lack of submissions or people wanting to do the putting in the work which is the other part of organizing you know that you have people that get to be the ones which organizes this and some conferences have that there's like an acc or the c plus quiz which is one person organizing this and we probably also write administic professors we had a similar class request which probably will return this year in the evening so sometimes we have that hackathons is now obviously being maybe starting and maybe we get some people together to organize a hackathon for the conference next week for inval that's gonna be a close call yeah we do have we do have a quiz so we at least have that yeah diego is gonna it's gonna do a quiz in our lightning talk meetup but yeah i agree and i just wanted to say and it also relates to the previous question i think that the sessions that involve audience participation is usually it turns out to be the best ones so i definitely want to see more of those and hackathon or an interactive wardrobe are both great examples for that okay so one question i probably want to cover in this like what kind of technologies do you prefer or have seen for giving and preparing talks like tools like i know like various formats access powerpoint etc can we like quickly discuss this point like what do you use to prepare your talks what what have you seen from other folks speaking personally i tend to use keynote on my mac for the actual presenting mostly because i know it inside out and i can make it do pretty much everything i want i would like to actually move to something maybe more browser-based because there's a lot of things i'd like to do that would be easier that way but none of the existing tools that i've seen actually do things the way i would like so i keep thinking about writing my own because that's what we do i haven't got around to it yet so i keep going back to keynote which is fine preparing the talks like they usually just outline stuff in apple notes but any any good note taking tool would be fine for that i've done my maps in the past as well but i found that there's not a big difference between my maps and outlines for for talks but you can you can write more sort of long form notes in a notes app doesn't doesn't suit my maps quite so well my first ever talk i did at the accu conference in 2004 the whole talk was a mind map just sort of zoomed around that actually was quite effective and i've sometimes tried to reproduce that in a slide format but never quite achieved the same thing yeah so my first presentation was in pretty so i was very excited and then one was you know looking for something unique but i have to say that since then i've just fell back to carpoint i i just i think that in a sense like i have i'm i tend to put a lot of effort on how things looks and i i sometimes even too much like i i'm a bit obsessed with you know things that have been in the right place and all of that so sometimes just doing the simple thing would be easier for me because otherwise i'll find you know waste all my time in the fitting colors and and caring about the sizes of things but yeah i know that people really like as you've mentioned the web-based um things that based on javascript i know one person who writes javascript programs from hannah for her presentations and he chose because they're amazing literally amazing yeah but you can do really neat things with powerpoint as well i really like very rasmine's presentations this is doing like transforming friends like changing code using some powerpoint features that i've that i haven't had a chance to to check and i think the most important thing is that you know feel comfortable with the flow of your presentation but it's also great to explore new tools so those are the ones that i know yeah i i studied us openoffice that's on the one on the one hand i i like that it limits me so that i can focus on on the actual content and on the other hand as phil said and yeah javascript or like the css and html based slides systems are quite nice where i've been looking at and the other problem is as a conference organizer you have at something like your new talk it's like also all the talks or presentations you always like you know try to maintain for the conference like the welcome message or for the user group the welcome message so changing over that would be a lot of work but maybe it's worth it to you know just have css available to you css transitions and do a lot of things in css would be cool to see if that works out there was a question but let me copy that and we can put that in the banner which is actually a good question on how much time does it take to prepare a talk i can give an answer to this a precise answer actually it's exactly how much time you have if you have six months it takes six months if you have an l it takes an hour maybe now is a bit of a push but an hour is just enough for him yeah i agree it's i have i find myself fixing both large and small things at the last minute as well sometimes it's just like you constantly it's it's like you're think when you prepare a talk you're constantly iterating over the topic you want to talk about and it's not even technically necessarily but also how do you want to present it how do you want to pass your you know emphasize your points and things like that and and and it tends to take to take over your time so yeah i think yeah it depends on how much time you wanna take up with that and often you know have in mind that stuff you're speaking on already has taken up time right you learned that maybe or maybe you use your motivation is to to work on the talk because you want to learn something right you want to learn about that feature and then that is a different approach and it depends on on how much time you want to spend on it i usually take some time per like every week i have like an afternoon where i work on the talk or i'm supposed to work on the talk and then what what has helped me a lot in the past is that i'm a bit earlier at the conference because of jet lake when i go to into the conferences in the us or because of travel opportunities and then when i'm in the hotel i often use that time to finish the talk and that's also very common that people you know work on their talks during flights or in the hotel or in talks where you know they let's also often why speakers are not able to really provide the slides in front of the conference because they're still looking on the slides and then just when your talk starts to finish your assessments often that's very common that's why it's worth to be scheduled at the end of the conference because then you're going to miss the whole conference because you're going to be in your hotel room for being a slides that's a pro hour too they found it actually yeah but i will mention that for newspicker if you're a new speaker i think that around three months at least from you know the time of the conference start working on gathering the ideas is is the minimum because you don't want to like you could technically prefer a talk in a month but me personally at least from my experience especially as a new speaker you want to iterate over it as much as possible and and make sure you feel comfortable with the presentation so i think i've you know suggest to try to aim for having three months or so in advance since you submit the abstract or they start working on your talk there's a really good chance you're going to get accepted so and if not you can always give it in the next conference so yeah i really i really think that's like optimal minimum time for new speakers and you should try to factor in being able to deliver the talk ahead of the conference to in a small group of colleagues or even family friends or at a meetup to have a good opportunity to give a drive under the talk before the final version and you'll get some feedback and the talk will be better because of it but also because it forces you with that deadline to say right it's got to be complete end-to-end why this this date then going back it's just polishing after that whereas otherwise you tend to polish it before it's finished and that also helps you practicing your talk right yes i have i have been rewriting talks because i was like yeah this is this interesting set of slides but you know when i give the presentation it doesn't line up it's not what i want to do all right so i i i i give the talk i practice the talk and i like this slide when i wrote those slides it was logical to put it here now when i give the talk when i'm in the floor i i kind of find this difficult so that i have to move it somewhere else i have to refresh that so i think that's that's the other point it's like part of preparing your talk is also practicing your talk and like envisioning what's the topics you want to say and that's why i think it's important to kind of you know have an outline of your talk to like have actually start titles like you know and what what you want to do in that hour and i think we are a little bit on the end with questions so it was almost two hours online i think that's also long enough so i am quite happy with tonight so if you have to have any questions maybe post them here but maybe also fill or in the have a question in their mind which they'd like to ask us or the audience and they don't you know find the things they want to say question for the audience if you're if you thought about doing a talk but you've never done it yeah what's holding you back the perhaps we could help with or maybe not interested to know either way and we have to wait for the the streaming delay for them to actually hear this yeah maybe you get a reaction in chat okay so someone says thank you do you have a question in mind for us or the audience or something to think about yeah i mean again phil stole my thunder but but i will i will say that [music] i think that it's more of a comment i think that giving lightning talks is also a great way to start because you get used to standing in front of audience so maybe my my question would be if you are too intimidated by given a full-length talk what would hold you back from giving a lightning talk which is and i'm not necessarily saying this is easier you have to take this under consideration when you prefer lighting talk shorter talk can be even harder sometimes in the sense of you need to manage your time but it may be less intimidating so yeah so i'll continue phil's question with same thing but for lightning docks in our conference and this is exactly targeting newspickers so so i'd be happy to so i started off on this i went for lightning talks i i find the lightning talks are a bit of a paradox for for new speakers i think they're easier to get into because you've only got five minutes to fill for experienced speakers they're harder because how can i compress all this material into five minutes but just the way it is so yeah renault in the chat says mostly constrained time so lightning talks might be a good yeah good way to to go there so i i know that i've heard all kinds of opinions on lightning talks i've heard that they're incredibly hard and they're the most advanced thing you can do and on the other hand if you think about the work you have to put in your slides it can be so much less like i've seen people use batting talks with one two three starts and yeah they were good and the other thing is like when you want to start speaking or want to you know start like presenting things if the user group is near to you actually we had a user group at at least one user group organizer in the audience today and we have i think three on stagecare also which are connected to user groups user groups also always look for material they sometimes for lightning talks in front of their program and that is also where we you know can host a cotton by lightning talks and yeah what do we talk about just in a second yeah quizzes and our content you can hold some music too so let me click this see if we have any more questions but i think we are getting to our time limits yes i think roberto just had a suggestion yeah so right right let's just put that in here that i can put that on screen for technical purposes so could be like preparing a job interview could be that a good talk and i think yes it could be yeah we sometimes forget about the non-technical talks that are still going to be interesting to the particular audience so job interviews it's a great one for people that are new to the to the community that's exactly the sort of thing they need to hear but we've got to talk c plus plus on c on on burnout as well that's another thing that can be very relevant to a lot of us yeah and yes you did your thoughts on this yeah so i mean everything that is related to the development world can be a great lightning talk i think in our pre conference we had a meet up to prepare people for giving lightning talks in the sense of like encouraging them and giving them some tips and things like that and i think that there was a topic of how do you educate your your team or your group with something new like how do you propagate the the knowledge how do you you know make a larger contribution in your in your in your company everything that is relay related to this world i think is very interesting and the special thing about it is that by bringing your experience to stage you you're making your talks unique because this is your experience so i mean no one else have the same you know background as you and i think that just by bringing your your personal experience is is making your talk unique and worth worth watching so so yeah and to get back to the question on job interviews i think there's multiple language you can cover here either your experience as an interviewee or like what tools and what other things do as a company use i have and i do complete talks on hiring i do them on linkedin to you know make a little bit of advertisement for my job fair so i've started presenting data which we have through running the job fair and to do it by angles on that so yes that'd be a great topic and other non-technical topics can be welcome at conferences as phil mentioned talk on burnout is something which i saw that's on your schedule it's kind of interesting that you hosted on your your technical conference and in that case just be prepared that some people will give you negative comments but i don't think i can drop interviews you would get that but like you know a complete non -related talk to c plus plus conferences i've seen all kinds of comments even like for keynotes like whoa this wasn't like related to to to c plus plus enough or wasn't wasn't what i expected and that's it if you give a keynote or just a general talk some of the feedback will be used for some of the feedback will be just thanks for giving the talk and some of the feedback will be just people sitting in the wrong room he always have a choice yeah and with that i think we're gonna bring us to an end i want to thank phil for preparing the token for actually you know caring for this and preparing lots of materials and covering an interesting topic which we didn't have yet covered so we will be able to cover that for the coming weeks and months and yes yeah it helps and thank you for coming for the panel and also for having getting this kicked off last year and well so we're happy to get new talks and new speakers always and thanks everyone who asked questions and contributed in the chat it's a great crowd thank you for the questions and thank you for coming thank you jens for organizing this is great topic and i'm always happy to i think it's really important that you keep doing this thank you that's maybe i want to that's i wanna probably and at the end now you know it's been a bit more difficult to organize this this year because people are really busy and i think in the coming years maybe it gets easier for me again because i attend conferences too and then i can like if i would have been at c plus now this year i probably would have been able to find more speakers don't know if i want to say that but kevin henny unfortunately didn't have time he was very very pleased about knowing that this event exists and would have loved to to take part in it but he's busy today so and we had yeah in by wanted to prepare something but she's busy with a conference also understand that and then we had another speaker drop out which is david sanker and he's having a fever that's also a good excuse and i hope to see some of them next year and yeah cpp cast always awesome to to listen to that we would have had almost because teemo also was very excited about that but timur is on holiday right now so that's maybe also you know i see a lot of speakers knowing about this now and so we're going to continue that that's a plan to do that every year and we have a lot of good content from this year and last year which is recorded and which i can play for hours and hours and hours and we're gonna see what fresh content we get and then mix up this and this will be an awesome event and one of the motivations is just to a help the existing speakers to give better talks and also to this if the new speakers and and i think a lot of the talks and some some things which has been mentioned today or last year has helped me and has helped other people and there's always some very very positive feedback about this event has been a lot of positive feedback about this last year and there's a lot of positive feedback coming for this program is on youtube later and also going to write a blog post about it so it's gonna find its content so and now we're going to stop talking and take us offline thank you for coming i want to thank phil and inboard again for hanging out here and if you want to hang out with with us again then you're welcome to do so but tonight we are now going to change into the launch to you know just have a casual conversation there if you want to join me there you're welcome to do so
