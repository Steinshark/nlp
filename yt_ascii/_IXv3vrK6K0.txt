i've spent over a decade filming documentaries around the world for clients like national geographic netflix the new york times and a bunch more and in that time i've been lucky enough to see things meet people and go places as a cinematographer that i never would have dreamed possible if this sounds like the kind of dream career that you've been chasing but maybe you think it's just a fantasy and not really possible then i've got good news for you it's entirely possible because if i could do it without going to film school then you absolutely can too but with all that said this is not a normal career path with a road map to success and if you've been struggling then it's probably because you're making a lot of the same mistakes i did and that's exactly what this video is all about five truths and tips that you need to be aware of if you want to film documentaries at the professional level because believe me once you get these things right things are going to go way more smoothly for you so without wasting any more time let's get right into it hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsyth and on this channel all i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer so just to give you a bit of context on my journey i am 100 self-taught and i never took a single film or photography course in school in fact i didn't actually know i was even interested in a career like this until i was in my late 20s so it's not like i was some sort of child prodigy who grew up with a leica in my hands i decided to go all in on this path after seeing the documentary war photographer while i was working as an english teacher in south korea and because i didn't have any formal training i just sort of stumbled my way through it making pretty much every mistake possible along the way eventually though after a couple of years of trial and error i started getting work as a photojournalist shooting stills for people like the new york times al jazeera and a bunch of other big international newspapers then after five years or so of that i made the jump into documentary production and i never looked back i should say quickly that while i consider myself a filmmaker in the sense that i do come up with my own ideas and fund my own projects sometimes including directing my first feature film last summer for the most part i spend my career career as a documentary cinematographer bringing big budget true stories to life from behind the camera if you didn't know that was a real job well take it for me that it definitely is and there is a ton of opportunity out there for people with the right skills and i want to help you develop those skills like a professional and since we're on the subject this is probably the perfect segue to let you all know that my professional documentary cinematography course is finally done and the enrollment is officially open as of today sorry guys future look here i recorded this video in advance and that line was supposed to lead into this segue where i was going to tell you that today was the day my documentary cinematography course went live to the public i had a whole thing planned where i was going to talk about how the course goes beyond lighting setups and goes deep into things like scene coverage and professional development gear trends business skills and a ton of other stuff for serious dog cinematographers that i don't really see talked about much on the internet the problem is that now i don't actually have a course to offer you anymore because all 100 spaces sold out in just a few days during the pre-order sale i gotta say that even though i was pretty sure people people were hungry for information like this i honestly didn't expect the doors to get rushed so fast i purposely made the decision to keep the intake small so i can actually interact with people in a meaningful way and respond to feedback so i'm really sorry if you were excited and missed out but if it makes you feel better pretty much everyone who wasn't on the early bird waiting list missed out too i will open it back up again probably just after the new year so if you don't want to miss out again you should check out the full course details through the link in the description and then get your name on the early bird list you'll also save yourself some cash too because there's a special discount for people on the list but i'm sorry again you'll just have to wait a bit to claim it thanks so much to all of you for smashing my wildest expectations with this thing and i'll see you all in the members group now let's get back to the video to start things off i want to mention a rarely talked about truth that matters more for documentary cinematographers or filmmakers for that matter than almost any of the technical aspects of the job and that's that without social skills and empathy you're not going to get very far and when i say social skills i'm not talking about table manners or a posh upbringing i'm talking about the way you interact with the people you're trying to film the hard truth is that no matter how good of a cinematographer you are you will only get to film what your subjects let you film and for them to let you into their world they're going to need to like and trust you this might sound super obvious but if you're not able to put people at ease and convince them that you're going to treat their story kindly and with respect then you're never going to be able to get that super intimate scene you've been imagining in your head oftentimes in doc we're filming people who are going through especially challenging moments in their lives and if you expect to stand two feet away from someone with a camera and document the whole thing you'd better believe that they need to like you and just as an example once i worked on a really big name show that i won't mention here where one of the dps was so unempathetic with the characters that they all got together and told the director that they refused to film scenes if that person was behind the camera that meant that anything involving characters had to be shot by me and the third dp and and the other person was only allowed to film b-roll obviously that made the whole shoot way more complicated and it was a total headache for the production managers and i'd be really surprised if that person gets the call for the next season now i know that's a bit of an extreme example and not normal at all but if you want to go far as a doc dp the first place i'd look is inward be the kind of person that people want to open up to and you will find very quickly that you're getting better more intimate footage without having to spend a ton on gear when i interviewed the emmy award-winning dp matt porwall for the cinematography course and if you don't know matt he's insanely experienced and probably best known as the dp of cartel land he said exactly the same thing so don't just take my word for it i'm just going to take a second before i go any further because i keep mentioning the course so i'm going to take a minute and just break down exactly what this thing is and future luke here again right here i was supposed to go into another big thing about how the course included interviews with industry-leading dps and directors like matt and how i was going to be adding more and more over time but again it's full so we'll just have to cut all that i am going to be posting a few of the highlights of my talk with matt on the channel next week and trust me you'll definitely want to catch that one because matt is one of the very best doc dps out there and a great teacher too i mean if you've ever seen cartel land you'll know what i'm talking about so if you want to get access to long-form conversations with people like matt you'll want to get your name on that wait list the good news is that by cutting all the course promo stuff we can get back to the video sooner moving on i want to touch on something that everyone loves and loves to hate and that's gear now these days it's become way more common to hear the advice that cure doesn't matter which is a mindset that i like a lot more than the older attitude of just buy more stuff but it's not entirely true because on one hand it's a mistake to think that buying gear will make you a better cinematographer or that having a new camera will get you work but on the other hand it's not really accurate to say that gear doesn't matter unlike directing cinematography is an inherently technical job and the tools you choose to work with will impact your story and the finished product now i'd love it if i could say honestly that you don't need to worry at all about gear but that wouldn't be good advice it is true that you can't buy your way into a powerful story and that owning equipment is definitely not going to get you jobs but at the same time if you don't have the right tools for the job it will affect your results now this isn't about me recommending a certain cinema camera or telling you without that fancy geared prime lens you can't shoot well you can achieve great results with minimal kit if you use it like a pro but there is a limit to that if you your story takes place mostly at night but you have an older camera with bad low light performance and f4 lens and no lights you're gonna struggle or if you're trying to follow characters as they live their lives but you don't have the ability to run a shotgun mic and a lav mic at the same time the results are going to suffer like try shooting at noon without an nd filter or making an indoor interview look good without a key light or capturing stable b-roll without a tripod and i think that you'll find that gear actually does matter sometimes i know it's way more trendy to say that gear doesn't matter at all it's just not really true a dp is the director of photography and so you do need to understand what your tools do and what the right tool for each job is so don't waste your money don't think that gear is going to get you work but also don't ignore it because you do need that base of technical knowledge to do the job well that's why i devoted an entire unit in the cinematography course to gear and i'm back one more time you can probably guess who's supposed to go here originally but i think you get the point by now waitlist next up i want to highlight the importance of mentors and teachers on your cinematography journey because it's so much harder to improve on your own than it is when you have the help of someone more experienced than you are we all need mentors and i've had a bunch of them in my life but now that i have a youtube channel and i'm on the receiving end of dozens of emails a week from earlier career dps i can confidently say that a lot of people out there are looking for mentors in the wrong way a typical email i get will read something like this hi my name is and so and i'd like to become a cinematographer i think your knowledge and experience could really help me out and i'd like to set up a zoom call so that i can ask you for tips and advice to help me advance my career can you see the issue there i do respect the fact that people have taken the initiative to reach out at all but this is absolutely the wrong way to go about networking emails like that which is how most people approach me are only about how i can help another person with their problems on their terms and while i'd like to help everybody my time is crazy limited because of working full-time as a dp and running this channel so from my end these kinds of requests come off as a little selfish to be honest and odds are that the other dps that you're reaching out to in this way feel the same way instead to network effectively you need to offer something in return and show that you really want to learn from that specific person and aren't just copying and pasting the same email to every dp you can find you need to offer value to these people to be taken seriously whether that's working for free or exchanging services or even just straight up paying for their time asking people you've never met to give up the limited free time they have while offering nothing in return isn't the way to get a mentor no matter how convenient that might be for you [music] the next hard truth i want to get across has to do with the inevitable ups and downs of this industry and just how long it takes to build your career and that's that impatience is not your friend if you come into this business thinking that you're going to be able to achieve goals quickly you're in for disappointment this path takes time a lot of time but luckily there's no retirement age unlike another job so if you dedicate yourself to the long game you can just keep doing it but it will absolutely not happen quickly and it won't be smooth and the journey is more like a roller coaster ride than a smooth upward curve if you really want to reach your full potential you need to slow down and start thinking in terms of years and decades not months and within that you also need to be braced for the low moments which i promise will come and not allow them to discourage you because the only way to guarantee that you don't succeed is to quit my ups and downs are all over this channel so i'll spare you from listening to them again but just to put it in context when i was interviewing matt porwall he told me that after dp and cartel land which was nominated for an oscar instead of being flooded by high-paying job offers he didn't get another solid gig for eight months just let that sink in a second after risking his life to shoot one of the most critically well received docs of the decade he didn't work again for nearly a year there's a bunch of explanations as to why this happened but the important part is that matt didn't quit the rough patch ended and he went on to win an emmy and shoot a ton of other amazing projects so yeah we all want to achieve our dreams fast but that almost never happens instead plan for the long term and learn to dominate your impatience because good things take time to build so that's it four tough but important truths and lessons that i've learned over 10 years is a documentary cinematographer to help you get to where you want to go conversations like this are exactly the reason i decided to create a dedicated course and i'm honestly really proud of what we put together sorry there was one final plug hiding in there anyways i hope that video was helpful and that no one is feeling too disappointed but if you get on that wait list you'll have a good shot of making the next intake see ya oh [music] foreign
