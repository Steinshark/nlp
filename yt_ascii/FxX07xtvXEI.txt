[music] okay okay this is probably top 5 coolest unboxings i've ever done so you probably out of xiaomi they've made a one-of-a-kind smartphone that i'm pretty sure nobody outside the company has actually seen you feel kind of honored they sent it here and i've done everything i can to have not looked at it yet and just before we get to that cuz you know xiaomi is kind of crazy there's more we'll stop fairly normal this is their brand new me note 10 light smartphone on top so you might remember a phone called the me note 10 i tested it last year i'm pretty sure it is the first phone with a 108 megapixel camera and it was $600 well this is basically that phone but with a less capable camera but it's 380 dollars we've still got a flagship gorilla glass body you've still got a flagship amoled display $400 is the kind of price where you start to expect some sort of obvious compromise but so far so good and it also has a massive battery 5260 million parts alright let's give this 64 megapixel camera shot okay very very early impressions are that actually it's pretty good now please show me i've gotta try it i barely have any nails as it is there with this one here that's good it works ok we should move on all right i've been eyeing this one for a while now i think i know what it is and i don't think you'll have seen this coming oh that's a little bigger than i expected it's bear with just cleaned my room today this is a smart jacket because nothing's good unless it's smart so you're looking at a jacket that regulates its own temperature so if i press a button down here it starts heating up it's got two different heat pads in a similar way to if you've ever used the heated seats on a car that kind of thing this is definitely one of those ones where it's like why is not done this before and if they have why have i not heard of it here in the uk at least i mean i know in some places it gets colder but here i know that it gets to temperatures where people would kill for the extra warmth you know the kind of temperature where it doesn't seem to matter how many layers you have on it's still freezing the one downside to bear in mind is that you know doesn't power itself you need to have a power bank permanently slot it inside of it but i can say it works i need to get this off now moving from something that's smarter than it looks to something that probably looks smarter than it is we've got this it's xiaomi's writing tablet and i'll be honest it looks a bit like an ipad but for the price you can get it for it's definitely not like an ipad let's find out oh okay well it's very thin very light made of plastic so the way this one works is you got a pen feels like a normal pen you write on it the same way you would i guess on an ipad and then you tap that home button once and it disappears and you know i'm actually kind of surprised how well it disappears whatever i written previously is invisible that's it okay let's give a giver to go with a quick drawing as someone who likes the idea of taking notes with a physical pen and just someone who generally likes art i'm a fan of this one and i've not used a product quite like it before what i actually thought was really cool though if i've understood this right is that charlie's not making musical instruments and knowing them shouldn't be some sort of normal music instrument there'll be some sort of smart element to it i like this matte finish by the way matte finishes generally are quite a good way to win me over so you might know i used to be really into the drum kit when i was younger but as far as general musical ability it's pretty limited i'll give it a shot ah stalin i actually carried on using this after filming just till i could form an opinion on it and the best way to describe it is as a great learning tool if you're actually wanting to learn the instrument the app has a fairly limited selection of songs but credit where do with each one it does walk you through showing you exactly what you need to do with actual leds on the instrument as visual indicators and still not enough to rescue my a miserable musical talent [music] then there's the companies me 10 pro which is their highest and flagship for 2020 and this is one of the few phones that actually trades blows in terms of specs with the galaxy s 20 ultra but i've already covered this furnace separate videos so we're not gonna delve into it but one interesting thing about the unboxing experience is that we can get it out the phone comes with a 65 watt charger but the phone itself only charges with 50 watts so i asked jeremy about this and they said that this is basically so that you only need to carry around one brick for your phone and your laptop okay this one is one of those boxes that i can tell exactly what's inside it from the front do you remember that dji osmo pocket that got released last year but tiny camera with a built in gimbal that could take 4k video for around $350 yeah well this one looks like pretty much the same product but for $200 we're talking alarmingly similar there we go it's a pretty boxy looking it's predominantly plastic materials but the construction feels tight now this is a gimbal camera so the only real reason it exists as opposed to you just recording with your phone is that this should have a level of stabilization that's one step above the optical image stabilization built into your phone and it works i took this one out for a spin to the stabilization is great that much becomes apparent from the moment you turn it on but i would say this only makes sense if you're being particularly active side by side with the galaxy s 20 ultras front camera for example it is wider and more stable but the phone does do a better job with dynamic range also i found that tiny touchscreen a tad finicky but you get used to that let's go for want to have zero idea about any guesses [music] it's a shaver well it's actually like seriously compact the blade is tiny how small of these people's faces i guess can i have to try it didn't think i'd be doing that today it's still surprised and slightly afraid i did try it i've never actually used an electric shaver before this one but it got the result i wanted it was pretty comfortable and it's cheap all right next up is the red knee 8a this is a phone i've actually been meaning to cover for quite a while now i really like covering entry-level phones it's just that i feel that more of you guys want to see flagships immediate reaction without even having turned it on this is a good first impression for ninety dollars it's a plastic back but it's got this kind of nice textured finish that gives it grip and reduces fingerprints so ninety dollars and for that my main point of reference out of the phones i've used is the nokia 2.2 but this immediately feels like it's kind of a terrible that i like the nokia but this has a few luxuries that you don't expect at this price a six point two two inch display a mid-range snapdragon chipset and a five thousand milliamp hour battery one thing i do like about nokia phones that want a bit of a side note is just that they all get updates like even the cheapest phones are sitting on the latest android ten that's pretty good on the subject of things that are potentially cheaper than you might have expected me true wireless earbuds basic i'll put a poll here these are true wireless earphones guess the price the answer is $19 true wireless earphones $19 so this is by no means a fair comparison but here i've got the galaxy buds plus which are about 120 dollars you will notice a very immediate physical difference there's no questioning that the galaxy buds are a premium experience in comparison they charge with us bc compared to the old-school microusb here they come in a case that feels weighty and sturdy chemise feels featherweight in comparison and the buds just kind of slide out of their case when you want to use them i found that these ones almost needs a little bit of a tug but but but but the sound quality wow i wasn't expecting it it is rich it is supremely bassy and genuinely fairly detailed - these are basic earphones externally but they can't where it matters in my opinion now if you thought i had a rubik's cube sitting on my desk this whole time you'd be wrong this is a showme cube but yeah again i'm pretty sure there's more to it than what it seems oh making noises i feel like this could be the fidget toy of the future it's got a really like satisfying click when you lock each section in place if you're wondering what the inevitable extra feature is well it's a bluetooth cube that pairs with your phone which lets you do two things a visualize exactly what you need to do to solve it and b learn the patterns that can help you to solve it even on your own and just before the final one we've got an outdoor bluetooth speaker which i'm guessing will have kind of an even bigger volume output than one intended for indoors [music] you ready already it looks clean i like the design language it's got a dial on top i'm assuming that's with volume which is a pretty cool touch that's nice and straight away bang it's in the bluetooth that was fast setup sure ma with this your result it shows that not distorting or geography very well yes ma'am [music] that's pretty impressive it's louder than i expected it to be but there you might have heard this is a bit of distortion at the top end if you crank up the volume to the absolute max okay this elusive smartphone and here's the background for the last few years with each flagship phone launch shammies released a transparent version so for example this is their me eight transparent edition and i thought it was epic i thought was such a cool interesting new thing to do but the phone did get a fair bit of backlash because the components you see here they're not actually real components these are just made for the sake of design anyway it's following that they dial this transparent design up for the mean nine released last year again not real components but you can't say it's not different but for some reason maybe didn't sell well not sure jamie didn't continue this trend for the me ten phones there was no official transparent version sold but they still made one and i mean that in a very literal sense of the words they made one so you can't go in store to buy one of these that is insanely thick and heavy just going on there how high do this [music] think of realize why this package was so heavy - there's two phones in here and on one of the phones is [music] okay so this is me 10 transparent addition i still not seen it yet about to have my first look now wow a few moments later couple of thoughts actually so for starters this is in a way it's less flashy than the transparent versions before which weren't actually transparent but the flipside of that is what you're actually seeing are the real working components of the phone so you can see the quad camera set up there's a two megapixel depth sensor 108 megapixel main camera 2 megapixel macro 13 megapixel ultra white you can see the nfc tag toward the top wireless charging coil sim card slot right at the bottom and then the stereo speakers you can't really see them too well but they're on the top and the bottom the specs of this are fairly similar to the meet end pro just the meet emperor has better cameras but still the fact that this has the same 100 8 megapixel camera as the meet and probe which is very similar to the 108 megapixel camera on the $1400 galaxy s 20 ultra is cool i'm getting serious 1+8 vibes from this in terms of the kind of price to performance and the way it looks that's for this last phone whoa okay i know what this is this is a redmi note 9 probe i literally saw this get announced a few days ago suspect wise is actually really similar to that me note 10 light we took a look at earlier the main difference actually being that this is 299 dollars and you basically sacrifice two things it's display you miss out on the kind of curves and the high contrast colors that the amoled panel has here and also slightly performance this one has a slightly slower chipset in it still though 299 for a camera and a battery like this that's interesting thanks a lot for watching if you enjoyed this video a sub would be incredible this took an absolute age to put together and what having said my name is aaron this mr. who's the boss and i'll catch you an actor [music]
