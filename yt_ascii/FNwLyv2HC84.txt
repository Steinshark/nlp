so the store of cain and abel is of course one of the most known in scripture and so i thought that i would go over the story with you to look at some of the details to look at how it relates to the left and the right that i've been talking about in my most recent videos but i also want to look at how there's a reflection of this story and a few pagan myths and hopefully it would also help you see the manner in which one can look at other stories from other cultures from other myths and how it can actually give you hints about some of the biblical structure it doesn't compromise it it doesn't question the integrity of the biblical story but sometimes because it follows similar patterns it can help us see what is going on in the biblical stories see things that we wouldn't have noticed at first glance this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] [music] i'm going to read the story to start off with and of course this i will not go through all the details of the story it's a very complex story i'm prompted to do this in part because when i was in london last week i i went on stage with jordan peterson i needed spent the whole time talking about cain and abel and those of you know that that jordan really loves that story and sees it as a reflection of of deep you know the the pattern of deep resentment which exists in humans and he he wanted me to do the q a at the end and as he was speaking i had these images of these street these three pagan stories that came up in my mind and so i asked him about it in the q a and he gave me his answer so i'm hoping they're going to publish the talk so you can hear what jordan's answer was but in the meantime i will give you my own answer in my own let's say intuitions about these stories and how they all relate together so we start in genesis chapter 4. now adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bore cain and said i have acquired a man from the lord then she bore again this time his brother abel now abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground and in the process of time it came to pass that cain brought an offering a fruit of the fruit of the ground to the lord abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat and the lord respected abel and his offering but he not he did not respect cain and his offering and cain was very angry and his countenance fell so the lord said to cain why are you angry and why has your countenance fallen if you do well will you not be accepted and if you do not do well sin lies at your door and his desire is for you but you should rule over it now cain talked with his with abel's brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and killed him then the lord said to cain where is abel your brother he said i do not know am i my brother's keeper and he said what have you done the voice of your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground so now you are cursed from the earth which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood and from your hand when you till the ground it shall no longer yield its strength to you a fugitive in vagabond you shall be on the earth and cain said to the lord my punishment is greater than i can bear surely you have driven me out this day from the fall of from the face of the ground i shall be hidden from your face and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth and it will happen that anyone who finds me will kill me the lord said to him therefore whoever kills cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord said a mark on cain lest anyone finding him should kill him then kane went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of eden and kane knew his wife she conceived in bore enoch and he built the city and called the name of the city after his son enoch to enoch was born irad and irad jail and mahuja will be caught methus shall and methusel begotlamic so let's keep going a little bit thenlamic took for himself two wives the name of one was ara and the name of the second was zeela and arab or jabal and he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock his brother's name was jubal he was the father of those who play the harp and flute and as for zela she also bore triple kane an instructor of every craftsman in bronze and iron and the sister of tubal kane was nama then lamix edge with wives aranzila hear my voice wives of lamech listen to my speech for i have killed a man for wounding me even a young man for hurting me if cain shall be avenged sevenfold thenlamic 70 sevenfold so of course this story has many elements in it at first when we look at it we noticed a few things if you're interested in some of the details of this i already made a video called the mark of cain which looks at the relationship between cain and civilization but a few things you can notice is of course the relationship of increase between civilization the increase of civilization the increase of the curse and how these things go together that is as cain becomes a nomad and and sets up a city which looks like a contradiction but is not at all he sets up a city he also sets up an increase in power and he sets up at the same time an increase of the curse with his descendants all of these things are there in the genealogy and the way in which it sets itself up so of course as i mentioned many times before this will lead up to the flood as the final result of this increase of of the curse of technology of evil in the world all of these things are going to increase now the first thing i want to do with you is i want to look at a few images of cain and abel and it'll be interesting to notice the relationship of the left and the right hand that i mentioned in my different videos and you'll see the different ways in which it can be portrayed and so here you have a version a few versions of the the sacrifice of cain and abel now notice in each image one of the things you have is you have able who is on the side of the blessing that is on the right side of the image he's on the left side from our point of view but on the right side from the point of view of god who is represented as this just dark glory that moves into light and through the hand of god here that you can see here and so the right hand is blessing if you remember that i talked about how the right hand has the blessing the right hand of christ and the icon of the of the pantocretory so the right hand is blessing abel who's offering the sacrifice you can see this represented as a straight line of array of light or array of blessing which comes down upon the the the lamb and you ca and if you look carefully you'll notice that above the land there's also a flame so the fire is going up the blessing is coming down and cain here is being ignored we could say in this image so there are different ways of representing it here you see now of course this is a later image and so god is represented completely which we won't talk about here but you can see nonetheless that god is represented here his hand is on the right hand he's blessing abel who is down here his fire is going up towards god kane is here god is looking away from cain and the fire of his of his sacrifice is not going up it's coming down towards below and so if you remember again the images of the last judgment how on the one side the right side is going up the left side is going down all of these things come together here's just one more image one more version one more way of representing it which is interesting here you again have kane and able abel here and came here god appears here of course this seems to be christ though not sure he has a cross in his halo and so christ appears above with his right hand he is blessing abel below and here interestingly enough the the smoke from abel's sacrifice is going up but the smoke from able sacrifices is returning on cain it's turning back on him and he's blinding him is going into his eyes and making him blind at the very powerful image of the left hand of the the straight and the curved if you remember i've talked about that in terms of the for example the staff and the globus the different versions of this or the staff and the snake you know if you think about it that way the different aspects of the the two the two sides let's say of the basic structure and so you can see the right and the left hand symbolism being represented very well there now what i wanted to talk about is i wanted to talk about i want to bring up three pagan myths and so i'm going to tell you the pagan myths and then we're what we're going to do is we're going to look at those pagan myths in with the frame of the biblical story of adam of cain and abel and what i'm hoping is that it'll help you see how you can actually use pagan myths to understand the bible without without feeling like it is compromising it or questioning it but rather see it as as these pattern stories that all are participating in the same pattern seen from different points of view over different aspects of the same patterns and so it can help you see a pattern in scripture that maybe you hadn't noticed before and so the first story i want to tell you is the story of romulus and remus so most of you will know the story this is of course a verge a story an image of them when they were very young and they were being suckled by a she-wolf and so the story of of romulus and remus is that both of these brothers find a place where they're going to find a sith they're going to found a city a city which in the future will be come to be will be rome it will be the city of rome that they're going to to found and so romulus decides to trace the limit of the city and after he's traced the limits sometimes built a wall or traced some kind of limit his brother remus jumps over the wall basically questions the limit that that romulus is trying to set as being the city and because of that romulus kills his brother and then founds the city of rome so that is story number one now story number two the titan prometheus who are was one of the titans as as as you know the titans are ambiguous characters in the story they are sometimes seen as gods that precede the the lineage of zeus or the gods that are under zeus but somehow have been pushed in the margins they they they have a marginal existence there are many versions of how this there's a relationship to them to to to the how zeus is related to the titans that is probably the best way to understand it is that there are these these gods which were there before they're there on the margin they they're related sometimes to the notion of the giants in general they're different associations which come to be brought together so prometheus is on the earth and as the humans are offering a sacrifice to zeus what prometheus does is that he tricks zeus usually for the sacrifice you would give the best part to the god but what zeus what prometheus does is that he takes the bones of the animal and then puts him on the altar and hides the bones with the skin of the animal and so zeus can't see what is being sacrificed and prometheus sacrifices the gives a improper sacrifice we could say to zeus and so because of this improper sacrifice zeus decides to remove the fire the divine fire that humans had the fire that humans had to to warm themselves to also create technology so prometheus has to you know climb up mount olympus and steal the fire from the gods in order to bring it down to humans and give it back to humans in doing so he becomes the patron of technology the patron of the different crafts and is represented as such now interestingly enough the image that i'm showing you here is an image from the rockefeller center in new york which is a celebration of prometheus in the myth prometheus is then in the myth prometheus is then punished by zeus for doing that he is tied to iraq and every day an eagle comes and eats his liver importantly enough it's good to understand that the liver for the ancient greeks was seen as the seed of emotion we could understand it at this as the seed of the passions may be a good way to see it that way and so prometheus ends up in this cycle of the passion because every day the ego comes and eats his liver but then it grows back again the next day and so by by engaging in this behavior prometheus falls into this cycle of passion and of course the last story is the story of hephestos so hephaestos is in different versions sometimes he is the son of zeus and hera sometimes he is a a only a son of hera that was that was born without a relationship to a man that was kind of almost like a virgin birth of of hera and what happens though with this character hephaestos is that at some point he acts in an improper way we could also say something like he he breaks he breaks the rule he makes an improper sacrifice and because of that he actually what he tries to do is he tries to have a relationship with his own mother and so he tries to seduce or to rape or to you know try to to have a sexual intercourse with his mother and because of that he is thrown out of paradise he had thrown at his he is thrown out of the mountain olympus this mountain where the gods live above and down into hades and now in hades he becomes a blacksmith and becomes the the great artificer who who develops all the weapons and all the different the different metal objects that the that the the greeks and the greek gods use so now if we think about these stories which it's interesting to notice how they come to be related to each other so in the story of cain and abel it doesn't say why it is that you know cain's sacrifice is refused and to a certain extent it's possible that that doesn't really matter what really matters is only the fact that it's not the right sacrifice and that sometimes this is not necessarily that we don't necessarily always know you know what is the right sacrifice or what isn't that's possible but in the story of prometheus it is suggested that there is a kind of trickery in the sacrifice that is prometheus tries to trick zeus by offering the least good you know the not the best fruit but the the worst fruits but that of course if you do that you know you can't trick the gods and that is what prompts zeus to remove the fire from the humans in the story of cain and abel it is what prompts kane to become resentful he doesn't offer the proper sacrifice he becomes resentful but then he founds a city and so it's very important to see the relationship that in the story of prometheus the idea that there's a relationship between improper sacrifice or a presumptuous sacrifice maybe is the best way to understand it you know a kind of trying to trick reality or trying to to not be forthright and true about what is real and artificing you know we even use it you can understand that we use the notion artificer we say that something is artificial because we see it to a certain extent as a a fake or a lesser version of that which is the true thing so in the very story of cain now you can understand and in the story of prometheus that there's a relationship between the improper sacrifice and that which pretends to be something else and the artificing and how technology although it is an increasing of power it is something like a an imitation of of the natural processes a possibly a let's say a an increase but an increase in which the essence of something is diminished as it is it add as it increases its power so we can see that of course in the story of cain and abel that is that as kane increases the power and as his generations increase in power and in making weapons and different aspects of that then he is also increasing the curse now in the story of cain and abel you can understand that even as the arts that is the artificial version of natural patterns that are imitated by humans and so there are natural patterns that kind of reveal themselves to us and now humans will imitate those patterns whether it's music whether it is by different different you know images making images that resemble something else making buildings that have the let's say the the proportions natural proportions of a of a of a natural space but now in closing and kind of creating a shell around it in order to to protect cain and abel so you can kind of you get this intuition of what it is that what are these themes dealing with and you can also see for example in the story of hephestos the same type of pattern which is that festus is presumptuous he tries to do something which is unacceptable he tries to raise himself up at the level of his father by having a relationship with his own mother and because of that he gets thrown out of paradise just like prometheus is let's say thrown out of the presence of the god chained to the to the rock there's the punishment and that punishment will lead hephaestos to create the the the artifices that he creates now in the story of hephaestos you get an even better sense of what's going on because in the story it says that hephestos they're they're two virgins or the different strains one is that when zeus threw him out of of olympus he fell and then became lame and there are other versions where he was already lame before and that is possibly one of the reasons why zeus threw him out to a certain extent it doesn't matter which one of those versions you you you look at what's important to us understand is that there's a relationship between weakness and artifice there's a relationship between the fact of not having self-sufficient power within ourselves and having to add this power from the outside like the garments of skin in order to increase one's power and so if in adam and eve the fall and the the fallout of the garden makes them weaker and because of that they have to supplement their power the same thing happens to cain as he's chased out further out from the the the garden he becomes weaker and fragile and and is in danger and so has to create the city to compensate for his weakness you see that of course in the in the story of hephestos now what's interesting is that you can see kind of all these themes coming together that there's a relationship between presumption a relationship between presumption and then also weakness maybe even presumption in weakness and that this is what let's say brings about the the civilization itself and brings about technology as a means to supplement that that that weakness and so it's very interesting to notice how if you look at the different stories you can see these weave patterns they're not exactly the same you know it's those all these stories are not the same but they have enough elements that are similar to help us see how a through line of what it is that these stories are talking about because they they are using different analogies to bring about similar conclusion or to help us see similar things so you can understand for example that the passions that prometheus deals with is cycle of passions is related to even the causing of technology and the desire for more power that technology brings about it's also related to the fact that cain when he is resentful of his brother and angry that he his sacrifice is not accepted that god warns him right that sin is at his door and is watching him and is there to devour him and so so this is of course related to prometheus who's in this cycle of of emotions or cycle of passions which could also be seen as a as a cycle of sin and that cycle of sin is related of course to hephiso's transgression which is a a sick circular transgression as well that is wanting to have intercourse with your own mother breaking the normal causality which will then lead him to becoming an artificer so all of these things are related and so what's important is to see that at least at the outset in the laboratory of symbolism as we're looking at the different stories and how they relate to each other and how the analogies come together and how the analogies show mirror each other what what we don't have at the outset is a kind of moralism is a kind of lesson the lesson isn't there quite as quite at the outset you have to be able to distill the imagery and to get a sense of what it is that's going on and then later then you can apply it and you can apply it in different ways because you have a sense of what what deep deep pattern these stories are bringing to the fore and so you can then use the story of cain and abel to talk about resentment you can use the story of cain and abel to talk about how the more you increase your power the the more there is danger that you will also increase the let's say the curse or the let's say the consequences of that power in the world and there's so you can use it in different ways you can there are different aspects that you can bring about once you start to kind of understand the the story and so there's another little interesting aspect in terms of circular causality that is there in the story of cain and abel which is not in the bible but appears in later traditions that have to do with hephaestos wanting to have a relationship with his own mother so when we get to the last part for example of the story of lamech when it says he you know he says to his wives hear my voice why islamic listen to my speech where i've killed a man for wounding me even a young man for hurting me if cain shall be shall be avenged sevenfold and lamech seventy sevenfold it's very strange and mysterious text because he doesn't tell you who did he kill what is he talking about who's he referring to none of this makes sense and so of course these these cryptic texts especially the very early ones they will give rise to legends and then if you understand all these analogies that i've been bringing up you can understand why the legends look the way they do the legends related to these stories often are a way to explicit what it is that's going on and so the with how the the way the legend goes which is based on different pseudographic texts both in the christian sources and in the jewish sources as well you see it in rashi but you also see it in in the i think what is i forget what it's called the book of adam and eve this i think it's that that's the book the the legend goes that lamech became old and was became blind and so as he was old and blind he was taken by his son tubal kane to go hunting so tubal cane brought him hunting and so as they were hunting they saw in the distance something which they thought or that tubal cane thought to be an animal and when lamic shot the arrow it turned out that that if that that character was actually kane and so lamech kills kane but then when he finds out that he's killed his own ancestor he gets extremely angry and then kills two bill kane as well and so he kills kane he kills two boat kane and then that brings him to say that he will be avenged 77-fold and so what's interesting is that you see both the increase in violence you also see the circular causality where lamech is killing both his ancestor and his son right we we talked about the problem of revolutionary revolutionary myth where you have zeus you know you have saturn that that the kronos who castrates his father and then has to eat his children in order to to to stop the revolution you see the same story in some versions of the story of zeus where you know he ends up killing his father and he or he ends up killing his children so you have this problem of the revolutionary story and how it tends to self-devour and self and and self you know and and break apart and so you have a version of this in this legend about about cain and abel where ultimately the process that cain enters into this prophets this process of supplementarity based on the killing of his own brother leads to a place where he is killed by his descendant and that descendant also kills his own son and so he is left in a position an impossible position of tragedy where the entire line of cain self devours in the end and leads to this increase in violence which is represented in the idea of to of oflamic saying you know if cage will be avenged sevenfold then i will be avenged 77 fold so as you kind of understand the structure of these stories and you you will be able hopefully to see that that even the legends that get associated with the biblical story they're not usually not arbitrary of course they have less force than the text themselves but it but if you can get the pattern then when you look at those legends you'll be able to understand them more easily so i hope this has been enlightening and i know for some of you it might be frustrating because i'm leaving it at least in this case into all these analogies and bringing you up into the laboratory of symbolism and be interesting to see how you can take all these references and links that i brought together and then apply them to specific context and so i thank everybody for your attention and i'll talk to you very soon
