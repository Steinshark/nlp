the crypto markets are crashing and two of the world's largest cryptos luna and ust face extinction from a multi-billion dollar bank run that's billion with a b as of recording i still don't know if these coins are going to recover and the big question on everyone's mind is how did this happen i brought on an expert to explain it but first we have to talk about the basics of this stuff tara usd also known as ust is an algorithmic stable coin which is different from fiat backed stable coins like tether which at least pretend to be backed by real money algorithmic stable coins on the other hand aren't backed by anything the way they maintain their peg to the us dollar or euro is with market dynamics by incentivizing arbitrage usually there's a pair of tokens one of them paired to the currency and the other can fluctuate and i'm not going to get into exactly how this arbitrage thing works because it's quite complicated and others have covered it in a great amount of detail the point is is that usually these things work really well and make a lot of money for everyone right up until they don't and things go boom historically every single algorithmic stablecoin has eventually lost their peg in what's known as a death spiral where people lose their faith in the coin finally and rush for the exit and because this stable coin is not collateralized in any real way most people end up losing their money in these exit situations famously mark cuban got wrecked with a stable coin called iron and its titan pair many people have compared this token pair to ust and luna however there are differences which we're gonna get into but the point is there's been a lot of failure in the algos stablecoin space which you need to know about people meme about all the different failures and say look you guys are trying alchemy it's impossible you can't create value from nothing despite this fact it hasn't stopped people from trying every time a new algorithmic stablecoin fails two more crop up with new new strategies about how they're going to finally defeat this death spiral and the most popular and successful attempt at this has come from terra labs a company which created luna and ust these two coins are extremely popular and in the top 10 of all cryptocurrencies so the project is massive and if these coins were to go bust billions of dollars would vanish one reason the people have invested so much into ust and luna is because of a savings protocol called anchor which promises people a stable return of around 20 percent which is obviously insane especially given how stable stable coins are supposed to be as a reminder bernie madoff only promised a stable return of 10 percent a year and the anchor protocol is nearly doubling that leading many people to accused of being a ponzi scheme however luna investors who often call themselves lunatics say everyone knows these rates are unsustainable and claim they're just being used as a growth tactic to get people into the ecosystem and that they will eventually be lowered over time as of a day ago there was 14 billion dollars locked up into this 20 percent a year free money scheme and this has been one of the major drivers of adoption and this 20 return was seen as a great investment for many right up until the crypto markets went into free fall over the weekend and luna and ust were hit some of the hardest of all luna fell 50 percent in one day and ust actually depegged all the way down to 69 cents nice as for the anchor protocol there was roughly seven to eight billion dollars withdrawn from the protocol over the course of a couple days like i said billion dollar bank run and as of the time of writing i really do have no idea if ust is going to recover at all and that's why i brought on my guest today bennett tomlin he's something of a stable coin specialist and you may recognize him from my tether video and i couldn't think of a better person to talk to to really get get to the bottom of this bennett thanks for coming on the show so this is absolutely insane we have billions of dollars hanging in the balance here and i guess my question is what are the scenarios here which ways could this go sure so the first way this could go is that people continue to lose confidence in this system and try to exit their terra into luna which when you do it below peg mints more luna and provides continued downward pressure on the price of luna which is the algorithmic stable coin death spiral that's often talked about is once the confidence is shaken it can feed into itself and as the protocol is trying to protect itself it's also destroying itself by draining any of the remaining value out the other option is that dokwan and terraform labs are able to using their bitcoin reserves by partnering with appropriate market makers and venture capitalists that they're able to at least for now get this back to peg once they have it at peg they're going to need to convince the community that this is still a thing worth having confidence in what you might see in order to try to get that confidence back is doquan and terraform labs or perhaps just the terra community broadly may try to find a scapegoat some kind of entity firm or person who they can come up with a plausible motivation for wanting to attack tara i'm already finding that by the way they're coming out and saying that you know centralized banks want to bring terra down they want to take down luna so you're already seeing that occur but one of the interesting things i thought about the luna found foundation guard or whatever it's called is that they bought bitcoin to supposedly protect the luna peg but since the markets are pretty correlated when the markets go down like this and you have like an attack on the peg aren't they selling bitcoin at a loss to protect luna and then making bitcoin crash even harder like am i getting that right why would you invest in an asset that would probably be down when you need it the most because i think daquan's goal with purchasing the bitcoin wasn't really to stabilize the peg or make the terra system better i think that the primary goal with purchasing this massive amount of bitcoin was to make it harder for people who care about bitcoin to criticize luna or terra because he was on pace to become like one of the single largest holders of bitcoin in the world and once you're in that position you have a lot of influence over bitcoin and you can get a lot of things you may want because no one wants you to suddenly market sell 10 billion dollars worth of bitcoin that would be very bad for anyone who holds bitcoin or anyone who holds assets heavily correlated with bitcoin which is the entire cryptocurrency market they've now made it where criticizing terror criticizing luna and destabilizing their system risks destabilizing a larger portion of the crypto ecosystem as a whole and as such many perhaps all crypto holders now have an incentive to try to make sure that luna and tara survive i think also another part of this that we have to talk about is obviously their success with the anchor protocol or i call it success they've been offering these crazy 20 rates of return can you explain is this weird game it feels like bernie madoff the whole like you get this really stable return actually it's way over what bernie madoff was offering can you explain like explain that i know they're saying that look it's just a growth hack but i it feels it feels awful ponzi-like why are you laughing yeah i i'm laughing because when cass and i did our episode on tara there's the moment when we talk about this and cass asked me why does this feel like a scam i'm like it feels like a scam because they're telling you they can guarantee a 20 interest rate and when someone tells you that they're basically always scamming you that's that's not a real thing that generally happens and so for a long time tara form labs was providing funds well they're still providing funds terraform labs is providing funds to the anchor protocol so that you can get a rate higher than the market can support for lending out your tara it did used to be this like guaranteed stable 20 percent or so 19 whatever percent yield they recently did make it so it starts to float a little bit but it still subsidized so that it you get more for lending it than you get then you pay to borrow it crazy idea and only in crypto by the way only in crypto yeah yeah normally that goes the other way the good faith explanation for what they were doing is that they hoped they could get this big enough that it would actually start being used for like real things commerce or foreign exchange your payments or currency things things currencies are used for but instead everyone just used it for the free money and eventually free money ends right right well it seems like every time a stable coin fails an algo stablecoin fails it just seems like somebody has a new idea for oh i know what they did wrong i'll i'll fix it this time this is gonna be the one true see i i wish they had new ideas this like tara is not very meaningfully different from like the economic concepts behind dan larimer's new bits from like 2015 or would or not yeah new bits bit shares from like 2015 or it's not super meaningfully different from the titan and iron finance one which famously broke and lost mark cuban this one just feels very well funded and it feels like this one's big i think what makes tara so interesting is none of the other algorithmic stable coins have grown to' billion dollars dokwan and terraform labs were way more effective at marketing and growth than any of the previous algorithmic stablecoin teams and because of that it got to a scale in size where it ended up posing this relatively unique risk to the cryptocurrency ecosystem that no algorithmic stablecoin has really been able to do before because they were always so much more isolated it was a lot easier to call many of the older ones ponzis it really emphasize the game or the scheme part because they were a lot less likely to interact with other protocols and to become this more broadly accepted part of the ecosystem but there's places that had ust as a base pair and stuff for exchanges right like this had started to reach out into a broader part of the ecosystem now we're talking about a stable coin that was able to sponsor a u.s sports team right and so like it's it's entirely different and it's way more deeply connected and so seeing it play out in this way has been a bit of a contrast to past algorithmic stablecoin blowouts and might perhaps give us some idea of what might happen if say a stable coin about four four and a half times the size of tara were to suddenly become much less valuable frightening and i hope that doesn't happen anytime soon thank you so much bennett for coming on and explaining all this stuff to us guys bennett and his co-host cass have a podcast that i want you guys all to go listen to you want to shout it out real quick yeah sure caspians and i are the co-hosts of crypto critics corner you can find it on youtube or anywhere else you listen to podcasts great podcast i listen to it myself thank you so much for jumping on and explaining these what's happening crazy times stay safe out there we'll see you
