so you've told me a lot of times you know you see all of these symbols maybe things i've done or written down or other people and you're not quite sure what they are so we're going to go over very basic symbols specifically ones from logic and set theory so this is a piece of paper you gave me you said that some of them you don't really understand so we're here to clarify this let's start with the very basic ones the connective this one if we have any statement fi and let's say another statement si and we want to say that both of them hold at the same time all right so normally you would say fi and si so we use this small wedge to say and so this means f holds and s holds so what does that actually mean like like give me a practical example so for example you want to say three is a prime number and three is odd you will write this down and you can write the statement three is prime and three is odd and then you can put this little thing to say both of those things are true now let's say that you want fi and si and you want to say at least one of them is true maybe one of them is not maybe both are true but at least one of them is true so this is all and you flip the wedge so for example it's raining or it's not raining one of them is true the other is not as a whole the statement is true in that case the two only one can be true that's right but you told me when i use that symbol that down wedge or one of they they could both be true yes al so it could be it's raining and the sun's out for example that's a good example right that's how you get rainbows is there a symbol where only one can be true so on on this list that would be this plus i actually wouldn't use that we don't use that as much in maths so in those cases normally you just spell it out and you say exactly one of those things is true but in computer science for example if you understand logical operation exclusive or right or is exactly this only one of those is right let's do negation let's say that something is false so the fact that it is false is a true statement so you want to say this is not true so two is not an odd number although it's odd being the only even prime but it's not an odd number so this is this little upper brackets i guess sometimes people use the this tilda symbol this is f is false let's talk about implications so the idea of implication is can be a little bit confusing sometimes outside of mathematical well outside of any math we just use this arrow to mean that if fi is true then si is true now it tells you nothing about the truth of fi and it tells you nothing about the truth of s all it tells you is that if this is true then this is true if it's raining take an umbrella tells you nothing about whether or not it's raining can you give me a more mathy example if a number is even then it is not odd yeah yeah this double arrow just means this and also the other direction so this is f implies si and si implies f so this is true exactly when that is true how's that different from the first one so the first one just tells you that if i is true then is true if it's raining take an umbrella if i took an umbrella tells you nothing about whether or not it's raining in this case right i take an umbrella if and only if it's raining so if i see someone with an umbrella i know it's raining exactly okay yeah so in this case with that single arrow fire has all the power kind of yeah it's a stronger condition right if you know f then you know p now what about these double ones well here it gets slightly more complicated we write this to indicate a statement about statements all we've done here is part of the language of mathematics right so if i want to write a formal statement this is what i use now i want to make a statement about those statements right so for example in some context this would be true then in that context this would also be true so this is called sometimes material implication now mind you a lot of people will use those things very interchangeably and there's little to no difference to them if you're working in let's say the very basic logical frameworks then there actually there's a way to think of them as being exactly the same however if you want to be formal and technical about that this is a statement about this the finei and the truth this is what's called as a meta statement it's it's kind of hard to to explain that without going into a lot of nitty-gritty of how logic works and what does it mean to be a a a true statement because truth is understood within a context this is why a lot of the time people don't bother to you know differentiate between them but if you talk to a logician which i turned out to be one there is a difference difference so these are called quantifiers so this is for all the a is for all and the e is exists so you want to say that for any number you know something is true then you can say for all x right so for all x if x is greater than let's say one then x is greater or equal than two then you can take the statement and interpret it in a context for example in the natural numbers so for any x if it's greater than one it's greater or equal than two that's true right if you consider the rational numbers one and a half tells you that this thing is false similarly you can say that there exist an x such that whatever right that x + x = 1 so the exist x such that x plus itself equals 1 again falls in the natural numbers through in rationals the state the statement doesn't have to be true or false it's just a statement that's a statement yeah okay right exactly yeah exactly like it's raining outside is a statement is it true is it false you need to check you need to understand you need to ask where is outside right are we in england are we in morocco are we in brazil all places may or may not be raining what's the e with the cli throw so this is just not this is just a way to write does not exist well this is something that we use less often this because it's just negation of exist okay we can talk about this some other time let's move to the set theory symbols all right we'll come back to those other logic symbols another time if people request it yeah do you another piece of paper let me get you another piece of paper okay let's talk about symbols from set theory now so first of what a set just like the the number three is a mathematical abstraction of how many fingers am i holding up right now a set is the concept of a collection so you can think of the collection of all the books on your shelf or all the rocks or all the other incredible things that you have in your office these are the different sets in mathematics yes a set obviously a set isn't a collection of books and it's not a collection of rocks right is the set always a collection of numbers what else can you collect sets of so that's a great question sets are collections of mathematical objects which are themselves a mathematical object so so what's a what what's a mathematical object could it also be polygons or yes for so a mathematical object is simply something that we think of as an abstract idea that you can find in mathematics could be a number or a function or a number field or a collection of vectors or anything right so the first one is the empty set now a lot of people would think that this is a fi which is a greek letter but it is in fact a letter in the danish alphabet which i'm not even going to try and pronounce cuz i will get completely burned on that in the comments it was introduced by i think bubak kei in the 1930s simply as a simple way of writing something's empty before that there were other symbols i don't remember any of them so what is the empty set it's simply a set that has no elements but it's not zero it's well zero is a number now now you may recall another video we've made where you can think about numbers in terms of sets and you can think of this as being zero you can think of zero as just a representation of how many elements how many members are in this set so the empty set is not no set exactly it's the the common analogy and this analogy breaks down real fast but it helps here is think of a set as being a bag containing stuff and empty bag is not no bag if you're heading out to the supermarket and you have an empty bag you still have a bag again this analogy will break down as soon as you move from that let's let's do this so if we have a and b are two sets and we look at that so this is the set difference so this means the part of a that is not in b what does that even mean is it the same as minus is a a minus yeah exactly it's a minus b so you can think of of set as being some kind of an abstract property so if a was all the prime numbers mhm and b was all the odd prime numbers mhm two is in bag a but it's not in bag b yes so is the difference there two is the set whose only element is two right yes yeah exactly that's a very good very good the result of this after i do the the calculation or the working out is a new set yes with a with a with a bunch of things in it that is the difference exactly and the difference could be empty if they're the same or if maybe b was larger right take a to be the set of prime numbers b the set of all numbers if you remove all numbers from all the prime numbers you get nothing right right so then you have this little c over here which sometimes people use like that now this is used more in introductory classes once you move on to more advanced set theory this kind of loses meaning and and becomes different and we want we already have so many things in in this kind of exponentiation notation so we don't really use that in research but it means the part outside of a so it's all the things that are not in a that could be pretty i mean could be pretty big is it not always infinite well it depends on the context right this is why we don't use that in actual research because can you give me an example yeah so if you say my my interest right now is just the natural numbers that's it then if you look at all the odd numbers and you look at the complement then everything that's not an odd number is even number right the set of even numbers exactly okay so that would be everything outside but that depends on what is the context what is the whole set that you're dealing with right now okay let's let's do these guys because they're actually analog for the logic ones so we have this what's that called so this is called an intersection and and in a way it's kind of like the end symbol and you can see that it's shaped kind of similarly and in very old notation it was in fact used to indicate the same thing so this is the common part of a and b so if i was saying that out loud do i say and or no what do i say how would you say that out loud a intersection b or a intersect b so for for example if we stick with the natural number example if you look at the set of prime numbers and you intersect it with the set of even numbers what do you get two just one element which is the number two similarly we have a union b which would be all the things that are in at least one of those everything which is in a or in b so if a was the even numbers and b was the odd numbers the result would be the natural numbers exactly so now let's say that you want to say what what would be an implication right so to to think about being in a implies that you're in b that would be what we call set inclusion so a is a subset of b so a is a subset of b does that mean that everything in a has to be somewhere in b exactly it's exactly what it means this is a notation that is kind of very uh i i'm not going to say divisive but there are some strong opinions on this so if you have this small line down here it's kind of like less or equal so it allows the possibility that a maybe is equal to b yeah right because suddenly everything that is in a is also in itself is an a and then you can have without that and some people will say oh this is not equal right so this means that a is a subset of b and a is not equal to b so b has to have more elements in it yes but other people would say no this is just the same thing as that right so what i normally do is you add this and you say no this is a strict subset so you add this line so this would be here so if you so if asf has put that little extra line in there he's saying to me b must be bigger than a exa a is a smaller thing yeah exactly that and then you can say that it's just not a subset by just saying the whole thing is not true right so let me put this so if i see that there is something in a that is not in b exactly very good you could be a set theorist no i could not the last one we're going to talk about here is going to be this and the negation of it so this is actually not a connection between two sets but between something and a set so when i write that small a is this symbol what's that symbol called so this is the membership symbol membership yeah so this means that a is an element or a member of capital a so for example three is a member of the set of prime numbers also of the set of odd numbers and many other sets now you can put this line to say this is not true so a is not a member of a so four is not a member of the prime numbers [music] exactly okay so let's talk about some examples for sets that are very common throughout mathematics now mind you as with any notation just like the letter that you write for a is a has a different name or even maybe a different meaning in different languages these two might be used in a non-standard way in different fields of mathematics but here is how the the common kind of most this is how you use them anyway yeah well actually no this is called blackboard bal font it was i'm guessing used to indicate a bal face letter on a blackboard where it's kind of harder although you can just break off a piece of chalk and put it sideways but whatever you can do that with a pen though so it's good that we have this yeah so this is just a bold face n which is normally the set of natural numbers right non- negative integers now i think i've said it last time those point of contention whether or not zero is a natural number it is let's let's just put it out there but in some context it's easier to omit it next we have this blackboard z or zed depending where you are in the world and this is the set of integers so that would be zero and one and minus one and two and minus two and so on in both directions so this is all the whole numbers next we have q again blackboard bolt which is the rational numbers so these are ratios of integers so this is one which is 1 / by 1 and 1/2 and 3 9th well it's 1/3 but yeah same thing okay or seven halves which also known as three and a half okay yeah but not the square root of two but not the square root of two to get that we go to the real numbers which is the blackboard front with r so these are the real numbers and these include things like pi and e and the square root of two and many many other numbers and one number they don't include is i which is the imaginary unit the square root of minus one or a square root of minus one to have that you go to c again black bold bold which is their complex numbers you have here a few letters in hebrew oh yeah we use alf a lot beth also has a prescribed meaning giml and dad not to much but to talk about these we need to do a whole other video alf will actually feature heavily in a whole other video with asf which is coming very soon it's all about absolute infinity so stay tuned or subscribed for that also have a look at the links in the video description for more videos podcasts and links relating to this work [music] al one is the size of how many types you can get from well ordering of the natural numbers but it's not all the different ways you can rearrange them it's not it's not no that is actually two to the al knot
