do you ever walk into those mom-and-pop computer repair shops that have been around since the 90s and notice that half the inventory on the shelf seems to be from the grand opening day? what is this? why do they have so many of these? where is all the modern hardware? this usb switch looks old enough to be my dad. how's it $30? sir, you couldn't possibly need some of this stuff. so i'll tell you what, i am going to buy every last item in your storefront. but i warn you, i'm a pretty tough negotiator. do you like games of chance? i do. so do i. but this guy looks cool as a cucumber. am i going to end up paying full sticker price for 12-year-old ink cartridges? or is he going to cut me a deal? will i be walking out of here with core i9s or core 2 poos and athlon 60 poors? all i know for sure is that if you go to black lab new news computers tomorrow, you will find it to be quite empty. thanks to our corporate credit card and the ridge, who sponsored this video and asked me to tell you about their $75,000 giveaway where you can win either $75,000 cash or a hennessy ford bronco raptor. no purchase necessary. you can find out how to enter down below, but i can give you a little hint. if you want to get a ton of bonus entries, you want to check out these ridge x hennessy collab products. we're also going to have those linked down below. obviously, i was poking some fun at you in the intro, but it doesn't change the fact that you have a wireless n access point from air link, whoever the hell that is. so that's quite old inventory, but i'd never sell it to somebody for $80. and air link is a big company. didn't they go to business a few years back? so did ncix. this one, for example, you clearly tried to get rid of at some point. $570. that was probably what it was worth in about 2002. if i can remember, someone actually ordered that and i got stuck with the inventory. if i had to guess, i'd say this is probably a similar story. but some people play retro games now and they want the old computers and they need the parts. what socket is this even for? i don't recognize it either. not everything's going to be like that, though. i'd imagine this was just... that was a stock item, yeah, that i got stuck with. these were rarely popular at one time because everybody wanted their media onto a hard drive that they could access through their house. and they were great for piracy, this one in particular. and they were great... really? he's making my dream come true, actually. oh, clearing out the dead stock? it's all dead stock. even the dead laptops in the back are dead stock. i said buy everything in the storefront. what can you do for me on this one? windows 7 era. a lot of people in construction use those. still, to this day, it can still run windows 10, no problem. yes, it's an i5. it's 8 gigs of ram and it's got a 256 ssd. basically what you're saying is i'm not getting a great deal on this. no, you are. you still are. it's a massive $400. $400? oh. which is pretty good for an indestructible laptop. indestructible, you say. so i have four of those. i only saw one in the front. $400 panasonic toughbook. three of them. i'm not taking all of them! i thought we were friends. storefront! surely you're not going to charge me $150 for these ancient sennheiser wireless headphones. you're correct. you really want them? i don't want them. look at the foam on these things. how's half price? 80 bucks. done. how much for this entire wall? smart cover for the ipad mini 4 car charger with qc 3.0. i mean, we've got a few of those. that's actually pretty good stuff. there's also some absolute junk. what is metal cable? it's metal. universal clip lens. does anyone have a computer that is on? that's not how you hold it. that works really good. two of those. give me a price. $500. kindle fire stamps. universal car holder. your cat can't chew it. that was worth a lot of money. did i say $500 for the whole wall? i meant to say $1,000. really? a three and a half inch card reader? people still want them. hey look, you saved me the trouble of waiting around for these batteries to bulge. i get three of them. $980. even with ridge's help, i'm really not sure about this right now. now it's time to have some fun. let's have plus minus 5%, plus minus 10%, and then each of us gets to write one sticker. and so we each get a side that we decide. where does the front of the store start, keith? okay, so it doesn't include that wireless headset then. you're going to save a lot. there's a 66% chance it'll be something within reason. and keith gets to decide what our outliers are going to be. he could say plus 100%, but there's a chance i'll get it for free. my wife's going to kill me. plus 100%, we got a gambling man! it's just the bin. i'm rethinking about it. you know, my truck just broke down, right? well, let's find out if i've paid two grand for a bunch of old cables. please be lucky. 10% discount. not too bad. great, so that one's $882. the next thing i'd like to talk about is this shelf, because you did say it's reduced to clear up to 70% off. correct. how much for the shelf? well, there's a brand new printer, color laser printer. we've got a core i7, windows 7 era machine, windows 7 xeon machine with a blu-ray disc. that looks like another brand new in-box printer. it's a brand new in-box color laser printer. that's $700. is this shelf, because it's these? are you going to take all these? oh, good. ups is with dead batteries in them. that's right. but you can get the batteries. i might as well throw in the amp, too, for the guitar. i mean, i have to buy everything, so it doesn't really make a difference how you bundle items. it's just what's going to be in the bundle when we play our games of chance. oh, good, an ipad mini 4 keyboard cover. $3,700 with 20% off. we've got marbles. we've got baseball. we're not going to kiss after, are we? we've got a hippo that says, i'm broken. let's do a putting challenge. i win. i get to roll the die. you win. i pay the price. no more questions asked. deal. from the please keep social. so the rate above there. that's fair. now, i am not a golfing man. oh, no. okay, she's going somewhere else. it's a really light ball. this is really important to me, so, you know. oh, geez. minus 5%. i'm liking this die right now. i'm okay with that. $2,812 all right, i just spent three grand, boys. let's clear out this shelf. as much as i was memeing in the intro, keith does have some... oh, it's an empty box. oh, it's an empty box. oh, thank goodness. uh-oh. not everything up here is an empty box. oh, no. what is this logitech speaker with glue all over the back of it? i use it for the store, but if i was to sell it, it'd be like $299. i'll let you roll for it. give me a bin. i think this is one of them, eh? yeah. i don't know what i'm going to do with all this stuff. oh, no. i found a subwoofer. oh, no. honestly, i love that system. i can see you really love those speakers, and this is tearing you up. so i'll tell you what. i want to throw you a bone. if you make this shot, i'll pay you double for it. keith, keith, keith. it's an impossible shot. it's a broken hippo. no! $600 for the speakers. keith getting a sound system upgrade. i want this amp now. also, i get this sign. no, not my sign. oh, no. i get an imice. we just do the best. oh, you get two imice. oh, come on. please tell me this elite x2 is not very new. and broken. it must be broken. it doesn't power. it's broken. because you don't have it plugged into an adapter, and there's no battery. you admitted nobody cares about these. it was $189. 10 years ago. i'm going to give it to you for $49.99. people still might use it. dashcam from izeeker. shenzhen hengyufa trading co-limited. come on. everything is from there. come on. it's 20 bucks. $79.99. what? come on. i'm seeing $50 on amazon. come on. for the new version. what is this? a bottle opener? evga mount holder. a retention bracket. yeah, because they even still make gpus. this is not worth $90. i'll give you $10 off. $80 baby monitor. hdmi 1.4 splitter. so who would use that? a pub? restaurants? i don't even want rgb extension cables. they light up. you know how many people like those? this is part of your security system. yeah, but that... okay, so here we go. here we go. so a lady came in here and said, do you want an old ghetto blaster? i said, no. do you see all the junk i have in here? she said, but it still works. and it works perfectly. i said, sure, i'll take it. so then i looked it up on ebay. they're $600. you're welcome. they're averaging around $400. do they work? because if this works... oh, parts only. oh, s***. oh, we're drinking now. the middle is minus 25 percent. you get to pick what's in two of the outside ones and then i will match it in the other ones. plus 10, minus 10. plus 10 for two of yours. i need my truck fixed. i don't want to be stupid about it. see, that was too easy. i should get a... you get to pick the next game. so what's my total for that?

oh, i'm getting li-. sorry. a little lightheaded. i am paying a lot of money for old tech that i don't need right now. i feel so much better today. thank you. i don't even know what these are. so i had a customer who wanted to do ethereum mining. i see that. a month before it all got kind of shut down. that's when they bought all this stuff. so they're basically new cards. give me a price. let me just do some adding in my head. sorry. one sec. $3,500. and we're talking canadian dollars. so that's about three grand us, guys. and there's a mouse down there. oh, good. and i got the boxes for it. fine. pick your game. oh, and a keyboard. how about we play darts?

this ebay listing is saying 40 canadian plus 60 shipping. i'll give it to you for $40. so you're saving on shipping linus if you pay 80 for that thing. thank you. okay, $80 is fair. lenovo thinkcentre core i5-7 series. oh, those are super cool. yeah. stop it. i have about a dozen of them at home. 300 final offer. you've only got eight gigs of ram. done. you haven't seen what's in the glass cabinet back there. what's back where? back there. yeah, let's get this customer tv out of here. thank goodness. okay, that's not so bad. i thought it was full. a nintendo ds xl. what's the price for this? these guys know. no, no, no. they're 150 bucks. offer on the tv. yeah. oh, that can't be worth more than 70 bucks. okay, yours for a hundred. a hundred?

dice. dice. oh my god. okay, give it to me. he's rolling the die! lucky buzz lightyear. here we go. come on. no! how much for this bin now? $2,720. but hopefully, at least, you're feeling somewhat charitable right now as we go into the cable walls. correct. dvi cable. other more different dvi cable. usb 2.0 a to mini 4 pin. it's like a half a dozen of them. 20 dollars? this is just a power cord. correct. five bucks, 30 dollar power cable. oh, for y cable, i see. usb midi cable. so, this is yellow. it is yellow. i knocked it down to $19.99 from $40. you know, some stuff is really weird, but some people need it. they haven't needed it. yeah, they clearly haven't needed it. some people still ask for serial to serial, which is fine. yeah, i don't think prices are going to matter for these. usb 3b cables. oh my goodness. you have so many of these. i acknowledge some of this stuff is worth something. this s video cable, for example, is very long and someone somewhere needs that. i will make you an offer for everything that was on this cable wall that i think is very reasonable to allow you to restore this wall stocked with modern things. $1,500. and i'll say two. i got a counter offer. we flip a coin. if you win, we'll make it one. okay. all right, if i win, we make it 25. so it's only a small penalty for you. huge penalty for me. okay, i'm calling tails. damn it! what did i just buy? $2,500 worth of cables. firewire cables in here. what even is this? this is a smart card reader. get those cables in there. and i want the cable management products too. i have a feeling a lot of this isn't going to make it into the final video. so make sure you get subscribed at lmg.gg slash floatplane where we're going to have a ton of behind the scenes. i don't think this is worth more than like a hundred bucks. it doesn't even have front usb 3. this is first gen i7, maybe second gen. this is probably not even worth a hundred dollars. well, if you're, you know, a dishonest person, that sticker is worth a hundred dollars. but you're not. how's that corner you painted yourself into? i'll give it to you a hundred dollars because i'm a very honest person. okay, good. oh crap. this one has usb 3. this is like one generation newer though, man. so let's do $200. $200? this drone- so that's brand new. i think they're $89 on amazon. no way. yes way. when are you going to get a $10 drone? it's got a camera on it. this is dead. $39.99 for you. bad and dead. bad and dead. this has pci x in it. 50 bucks. fine. it's not worth 50 bucks, but i feel like that's the best i'm going to do with you. ah, i want this ps2 for the same price. okay. all right. you overpaid. what's that? nothing. all these monitors for $200 total. done. he didn't see the one in the box over here. oh, i didn't either. we might have also missed this monitor over here. $690. this is the first good deal i've negotiated today, i think. you want to gamble on it? and i'm still going to gamble on it. i'm going to draw five lines on this cable. i'm going to pull the cable through your hands. okay. for every line that passes through your hands, you get 5% on top of the negotiated price. but if it reaches the end, i get 20% off. okay. and you'll be blindfolded. i don't think either of us is going to be able to tell from what i'm doing right now, exactly where these lines are going to land and go. how many lines will he get? i guess we will find out yet. let's see if he gets some lines. oh no, come on! how do i do? i pay 25% extra, josh. i'm going to watch your channel way more often. you've got to help me out on this cable wall. ancient rgb strip, actually worthless. literally expired 10 years ago. usb to ps2 adapter. how come you just show the bad stuff? what about the good stuff? a one to three rgb led splitter cable. you know how many people need this stuff? oh, there's a 256 gig micro sd here. that's at least actually worth something. usb audio jack thing. cable management do-dads. oh, wait. oh hdmi 1.4, 100%. 100% of what? ddr3 laptop memory for $70. i'd probably charge somebody $19 for that. very generous. big fan. more ddr3. electronic anti-lost alarm. you'll never have to watch that show again. $90 laptop cooler. at best, does vantec even exist anymore? he doesn't know. you don't want two trains, do you? ah, i mean, it's in the front of the stores. 20 years old. some of these cd wallets. cd bag, good quality. 4x speed dvd rws. even with the train. there's no way this is worth more than a g. but a g sounds good, so i'll accept your offer. crap. crappy imac and old gaming pc. i think the old gaming pc's got 32 gigs of ram. $750 for the lot. how about $1,000? that's easy. you get $500 for that. and easy, you get $500 for that. and then you get $100 for a monitor. and then you get a gaming keyboard. and mouse. camera not included. okay, $1,000. but we roll the dice again. agreed. okay, i want to roll it this time. we ready?
