so these are the 2024 ipad pros they've had a pretty big redesign they are shockingly almost concerningly thin they have a new chip they have new display new accessories long story short these are the highest end probably the most expensive tablets in the world i just specked mine out over here and it is coming to l 2,877 which if you convert that to dollars is like l 3,600 which is just i mean that is just an obscene amount to pay for a tablet but i am sitting here right now now hovering over the buy button and i wanted to make a video about this because when i woke up today i did not expect to be in this position i am not an ipad guy i use a smartphone a smart watch a smart fridge a smart air purifier hell i even use a smart toothbrush but the one thing that i've really struggled to grasp is tablets cuz when i first started this channel tablets were awesome phones were tiny so there was a real need for size tablets had better quad core processors and significantly more advanced software compared to those simple phones but then phones got good their screens doubled in size they got a lot faster they could handle multiple tasks at once and as soon as that happened the whole appeal of an ipad or an android tablet evaporated for me like why take around something that does what a phone does but needs a laptop's worth of space without being able to do what a laptop does that's the exact reason why in the 2015 2016 era there was a massive drop off in general tabler interest but then why am i sitting here right now like the world's biggest hypocrite about to spend basically a small car's worth of money on a tablet well that's what i want to explain for starters i expected this thing to be thin i mean watching the apple keynote they didn't exactly hide the fact that the 11-in ipad pro is just 5.3 mm and that the 13-in is just 5.1 mm and therefore apple's thinnest device ever but even then when i picked it up for the first time and i turned it around in my own hands it still feels absolutely insane that i'm holding a full-on computer with an m4 laptop quality chip inside because this thing is 579 g okay to give you some perspective i take this remarkable writing tablet with me almost wherever i go i found that no matter how much i do love my laptop and my phone there's times where you just want to write on a big screen you know sometimes you want to plan out a youtube thumbnail before you take it we've actually been planning out what our future studio is going to look like when we move home sometimes you just want to sit in a coffee shop and brainstorm ideas or draw up concepts for a product it all needs a pen and this thing this black and white 10-in e in tablet that does well basically one thing this is just over 400 g so i'm thinking damn i mean i don't even normally care too much about the weight of stuff i pretty much always buy the plus the max the biggest gadget you can get and to be honest it is also so slim that it is a bit concerning i feel like we've been here with the iphone 6 in 2014 and we all know how that turned out but i do get it here i think for something like this much more than on a phone it's important to be this weightless because this 13in ipad pro is just light enough and i say just because it is on the line and after about 20 minutes i was feeling it but for me i can just about comfortably hold it with one hand and right with the other and so this is starting to feel like it could perfectly slot into my life instead of this but just with the perks of being able to do a lot more like for example potentially replace my laptop too and i can't quite believe i'm saying this because trust me when i say i love my macbook i take this thing even if i'm leaving home for like 30 minutes my family is mildly concerned that i will still be using this in one arm while walking up the aisle at my own wedding can neither confirm nor deny but when i use this new ipad and the new pro pencil and the new magic keyboard all together this is the first time since like 2013 that it really felt to me like tablets are not just big phones that their capability feels like it has reached a tipping point at which point i'm actually sitting here questioning if i even need this because well this this is the new magic keyboard and while i know it might look like one of those cheap amazon folio cases from the outside using it is actually crazily similar to using a mac so on the inside there's a metal finish now the trackpad is bigger this is a charging port and then if you want to plug in other things you can use the other usb port on the ipad itself but what was very cool to me is that the second you snap the ipad into the case it also controls like a mac it's like every bit of muscle memory that i've had from years of using a macbook it all translates perfectly the swiping gestures the quick shortcuts you can also just hold the command key at any time to see all the shortcuts available within any app you're using but even the quick functions like brightness control volume control the search bar i was just so surprised by how usable the ipad is without even touching the screen also the hinge now there's obviously no way that you're going to be able to get a laptop quality hinge like this fitted into a thin ipad case but what's quite cool is because the new ipad basically weighs nothing you don't really need one when you see the case it definitely raises doubts about being usable in a car or on your lap but my first impression from actually typing on it is actually that it's way more solid than it looks it's not perfect though the downside seemed to be that the trackpad is still not quite full macbook pro size and the hinge doesn't go all the way back it locks around here and the main one actually is that this thing's l350 here in the uk and it doesn't seem like the ipad pro works with any other magic keyboard so you have to buy the new one and then there's also this new apple pencil pro which has its own perks compared to the normal apple pencil i do find it so funny the way they talk about all their products like i'm pretty sure they introduced this with it takes the pencil experience to a whole new level apple pencil pro it takes the pencil experience to a whole new level wow now in my brief time with it i did find it a little bit fiddly like there's quite a few times where i very interesting there's some new stuff here that i'm not too bothered about like barrel roll which thanks to new gyro sensors can allow you to rotate your pencil just like using a real pencil and using different parts of the nib for different thicknesses but then on the other hand the fact that you can now just squeeze it to bring up your menu that's awesome that's going to save you a lot of time because i mean the old pencil didn't have any kind of buttons so your thumb had nothing to do it was like a lost function the fact that there's now a vibration motor inside which creates this satisfying little snap when you're doing things and also the fact that you can now add it to find my in case you lose it that's pretty important because i me i'm pretty sure i'm going to lose it so it looks like a laptop but does it run like a laptop well apple didn't actually just kit this new ipad pro out with the same m3 chip that you get on the latest macbook ss they actually went one further and announced a whole new generation m4 chip that goes in here how much faster is it than m3 i couldn't really tell you to be honest the way that apple talks about performance jumps is actually really annoying because sometimes they compare to m3 sometimes they compare to m2 sometimes they compare to m1 and they'll always give you numbers based on really niche use cases as opposed to the more general ones that would matter to all users like app opening speeds but i think the high l takeaway should be probably not a massive jump from m3 but because the ipad hasn't actually been updated since the m2 chip and because this new ipad has better thermal design that can keep temperatures more under control actually pretty huge and it's going to be a lot faster than like samsung current tablets they're still using phone chips which is one of the key reasons that i've been hesitating moving to one of those we should get one thing clear this is only about 50% as powerful as my macbook pro and if you're actually going to kit it out with the pencil and the keyboard and everything then you're actually paying a lot more per unit of performance than you do on mac and it isn't even going to do 100% of what a mac can do because ipad os which is based on ios is designed to be simpler but the way that i've started to see this is i mean as soon as something like this can do the things that normally require this surely it's an absolute no-brainer to be doing those things on the ipad and for my uses i feel like today might be the day where we've just reached that level i mean if i can swap both my massive very heavy laptop and my remarkable tablet for just one ipad in totality that would change my life i would be cutting the weight and the size of my tech by about five times but also i feel like in a lot of ways the ipad can actually do things even better than the mac can like i think for the most part mobile apps are a lot better designed than computer apps like games i mean gaming on a mac kind of sucks and i genuinely think i would get a lot more gaming utility from this ironically less powerful device than i do my current spc to the max macbook just because ios and ipad os they're built for games but also even bigger picture i just feel like a lot of mobile apps are way better designed than their laptop alternatives like mobile photo editing is now so good that half the time i actually sending stuff from my laptop to my phone to make edits and it's not just cute little phone apps on the ipad i was literally today using the exact same pixel meter app that i currently use on my mac it didn't seem like any function was missing or cut back and every single command that instant on my mac was also instant on the ipad the only times i noticed a difference were when there were super intense things that required loading bars and then those loading bars did last about 50% longer on the ipad but yeah like we're currently in the process of planning out our smart future home and everything is controlled by apps it's all designed to work off well basically ipads because because times have changed 10 years ago we were living in a pc first world and swapping your laptop for an ipad it would be seen as a move only filthy casuals would make but i'm starting to feel pretty strongly like that's not the case anymore i mean now services are often designed primarily with the app in mind first and because the apps are designed around phone touch screens and phone hardware more often than not i find them way more intuitive and optimized tell me if you feel the same but i always feel way better when a product tells me to use their app than when they direct me to a website and so the ipad which is the biggest most powerful form that you can experience those optimized apps in is becoming way more appealing to me so then i'm thinking okay what else do i do on my laptop that i might struggle with here google docs but that's actually better on ipad cuz you can actually browse all your stuff even while offline which you can't do on mac i checked draft videos before we post them using this website called frame.io it makes it really easy to leave comments at different parts but then i looked it up and there is a specifically made ipad app for it and i also still sometimes edit videos far less than i used to cuz thankfully we have some really good editors now but i still sometimes put together the music for our videos or do some editing for personal stuff like we made this video invite for our wedding it's very cute but the point is ipad has final cut pro as well now they actually just announced final cut pro 2 just for the ipad i don't actually think it's a final cut pro successor like the name might imply but it is very much a full video editing experience i did find it pretty fiddly when trying to use final cut with the touchcreen it just feels like a strange intersection that can never really be as efficient as using a precise trackpad but when i tried it with a keyboard attached different story in moments i actually forgot i was using an ipad do you see what i'm saying it almost feels like all the perks of a laptop when you want one but combined with all the perks of a mobile when that suits you more you know everything being a sleek app instead of a clunky website which is definitely the way to go for most banking services social media uber deliveroo actually netflix too movies is a massive one to be honest because almost all of these video streaming platforms they are all infinitely better on phones because they actually let you download stuff offline it all feels a bit silly to me but essentially because computer oss are more open it would be easier to pirate things if you could download offline on there but on an ipad well it kind of gets a free pass because it's still running a mobile operating system but a mobile operating system with the media experience of a high-end laptop oh we should probably talk about this screen actually so this is an oled screen well technically actually it's two oled screens stacked on top of each other to be able to get the deep contrast benefits of oled but also the ultra high brightness that apple wants for hdr apple is basically saying that this is the best screen they've ever made for a consumer device they're calling it the ultra retina xdr display and it looks unsurprisingly very good the contrast is the biggest thing that i noticed like when you watching stuff with blacks those blacks are so deep it's like you're staring into a void and again it feels so trippy there's such a big disconnect because you don't expect to screen this good on a device so thin like if you ordered a monitor for your computer and it was this thin you would already be an awe and yet this isn't just your monitor this is your full-on computer it's your camera it's your touchscreen it's kind of crazy now they've also added in the option for a nano texture screen which they're saying scatters the ambient light to reduce glare but also without any reduction in brightness it definitely seems to work as advertised and it might actually solve the macbook's visibility issues but this is also how the cost starts to rack up this is how i got where i ended up because you basically have to spend a minimum of 2,000 to get a nano coating on your 13-in ipad also one thing apple didn't mention battery life at all during the presentation their site says that the new one has about the same battery life as the old one but given that we've now got two panels firing at the same time it's definitely something that i want to keep a very close eye on while i'm testing and then the final sort of extra perks the cameras are while not the priority definitely better on the ipad than even the topend macbook pros a because you actually get a camera on the back which i mean you obviously don't yeah although it is weird that they've removed the secondary ultra wide camera that they used to give you on the back on the last ipad pros and then b for the front it's an ultra wide camera that's now on the horizontal bezel so it keeps you centralized and can also use something called center stage when you're on calls to keep you in the middle even as you move around the room i'm also just thinking ipads can have cellular like what if instead of worrying about wi-fi all the time my main computer is permanently connected with its own internet connection i'm not particularly keen on paying a whole extra monthly contract but it's a tantalizing idea and then also just like the mac ipads can also hook up to sd card readers ssd storage drives even going into bigger monitors for when i'm docked into my desk at home with a whole system called stage manager that's kind of designed for big screen multitasking so honestly you could probably tell i'm a very excited man right now like this could be one of the most freeing tech decisions that i've ever made and it's also making me quite excited for wwdc cuz they talked a lot about ai during this presentation but they didn't really show a lot of ai things so i feel like that'll be them but this could also be a big mistake because i mean is this going to be fast enough to do all those things i normally do without feeling sluggish or fiddly is the ipad going to force me to switch my phone over from a samsung to an iphone because it doesn't have many ports and i'm going to have to rely on more wireless proprietary airdrop stuff there's the fact that let's be honest apple doesn't want you to buy an ipad instead of a mac they want you to buy both so in what ways is the ipad artificially limited so that it doesn't cross over with the mac too much the file system system the one major remaining advantage that i feel like pc still has is that it's designed for granular organization over files i need to find out if i can actually have that same control or find a way around it and then finally what i'm going to do about storage the ipad pro goes up to 2 terabytes which is great but i'm an 8 terab kind of guy on my macbook so am i going to need to start subscribing to icloud become better at managing my files or just keep a small storage drive that i plug in every now and again i have no idea yet but if you want to see what my experience is like with the ipad subscribe to help us overtake apple we are very very close and make me i glad puns are getting worse
