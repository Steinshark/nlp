bugatti has done it again just when you thought the combustion engine had peaked with all future development shifting towards electrification bugatti announces a v16 engine yes that is what it sounds like and it's something we haven't seen in production cars in over 80 years bugatti was mad enough to develop a w16 putting it inside the only 16 cylinder production passenger cars of the 21st century and they're still at it with a new v16 on the way while confirmed specs are scarce there's actually a lot we can learn from released images so we'll dive into all the v16 details but to truly understand this engine we need to back up and understand how we got here starting with the unique masterpiece that is bugatti veyron w16 engine so it all starts with the bugatti veyron which had an 8.0 l w16 engine essentially this was two vr8s at a 90degrees angle with these vr8s having a 15degrees angle between each cylinder bank so we have quad turbochargers and in the most potent version going in the veyron superport this was making 12200 metric horsepower 6,400 rpm 1500 nm of torque from 3 to 5,000 rpm with a red line of 6500 rpm the big advantages here tons of power power huge engine very unique quad turbo double vr8 design worthy of going into an elite level of supercar now it's not exactly accurate to describe this engine style as compact but putting 16 cylinders in this configuration versus say a v16 actually is pretty compact as far as the dimensions and the size of this engine all right so as we go from the veyron to the shiron how did this w16 evolve and a lot of the specs look the same right it's still an 8 l w16 you still have those two vr8s at a 90degrees v and you still have quad turbochargers but you'll notice it's a lot more power 1600 metric horsepower and 1,600 newon met of torque so more torque as well and a slightly higher red line so how are they able to make so much more power well the big change came with the turbochargers two changes here first of all the turbos were 69% larger nice the second thing that they did is they now are using sequential turbos so instead of each group of four cylinders having its own turbo charger like you see here on the veyron now you have a shared exhaust manifold for each cylinder bank and so what they're doing here is using sequential turbos so at low rpm all eight cylinders are dumping into one turbocharger when you get to higher rpm you open up this valve here and then you're using both turbochargers to create boost at that higher rpm and you blend this as you accelerate from a low rpm to a high rpm slowly opening that valve and then using both turbochargers to maintain that boost this gives you better response on the low end better torque on the low end and then still allows you to have that massive top end by using both turbochargers so if you look at the torque curves it's really interesting what they did here because if you look at the previous with the bugatti veyron you can see it's a fairly narrow section of peak torque just about 2,000 rpm for peak torque there we're using the sequential turbocharger strategy you widen that so much so you have so much more useful torque on the lowend and more useful torque on the high end more than doubling that range of peak torque so if you were only to use the two turbochargers at a larger size yes you'd get more torque early on and that earlier lower rpm range but that torque would fall off as you got into that higher rpm and those those two turbochargers became restrictive so then you switch over to this four turbo design which yes if you only use four turbos like you did previously but they were larger well you'd have less torque on that bottom end following this dotted line right here before you reach that higher end so you blend both of those eliminating those downsides using sequential turbos to have that huge flat torque curve okay so if you look at the progression from veyron to chiron the performance goals were to not only increase the torque but to widen the torque curve meaning not only more power but a more useful range of power keep those goals in mind as we progress to the next evolution with the v16 all right so let's dive into the v16 now the history of the v16 as far as production cars is very short it all starts with the cadillac v16 yes named so because it had a v6 which was around in the 1930s now this had a 45degrees angle for that v and you might wonder why use a 45degrees angle well you want to split up all of your power strokes between the cylinders evenly so if you want to calculate your firing interval you look at the number of strokes this engine has four stroke engine multiply that by'0 dees so for every power stroke you have 720degrees of crankshaft rotation and you divide that by your number of cylinders so that gives you 720 id 16 45degrees in other words you have a cylinder firing every 45 degrees of crankshaft rotation why is that important to the design of that v well when one of those pistons which are sharing a common crank pin is at top dead center as that crankshaft rotates 45 more degrees the piston it's aligned with on the other side is then going to be at top dead center so you can use both of those in order to have that 45degrees separation with your firing interval so cadillac is essentially using two inline 8 cylinders at a 45degrees angle but wor i to characterize bugatti's v16 i'd say it's more like two v8s connected together with the banks at a 90degrees angle so how did i get there well looking at the new engine you'll notice there are number labels for each of the cylinders now if you have an engineering degree and an advanced understanding of mathematics such as myself you'll notice that three is not the number that comes after one and not to brag but i also noticed that 11 doesn't come after one either usually the number two does which is all the way down here so either bugatti has a really hard time counting or these numbers represent something else entirely like the v16 firing order okay so how does this firing order tell us that it's a 90degrees v well you can see that one and three are across from each other which means you're going to have one cylinder fire then 45degrees of crankshaft rotation another cylinder fires then 45degrees of crankshaft rotation and this cylinder fires meaning you have 90degrees of crankshaft rotation between these two cylinders which share a common crank now if that is the same pin that they are sharing that isn't split that means you have a 90degrees v okay the next thing that stood out with the numbers on the engine is that all of the odd numbers were on one side whereas all of the even numbers were on the other side which means it alternates firing from one side to the other side odd side even side odd side even side so we've got our odd side labeled a our even inside labeled b and splitting this up and creating these two separate v8s we're going to discover that they're two crossplane v8s right this is a little tedious to understand however what we're doing is very simple we've got our two lines of cylinders we've split them in half we're labeling them 1 through 4 5- 8 1 through 4 5 through 8 and for each of these we're then going to recreate the firing order as if it was just a v8 engine okay so for our v16 engine one correlates with one of our first v8 engine then number two correlates with six of our b v8 engine then three correlates with five on our aviate engine and then four correlates with three on our bv8 engin so you can see as you do this for all of the firing orders for each of these two v8s you get each of these firing orders for the individual v8s now what does that tell us well with a crossplane v8 you tend to fire the outside cylinders than the inside cylinders here's a simple visual showing what that looks like so again you've got the outside cylinders firing then the inner four cylinders firing then the outer four then the inner four on a flat plane crankshaft you see it alternate between two cylinders on the outside two cylinders on the inside two cylinders on the outside two cylinders on the inside so here you can look at these firing orders and see that two and three and six and seven are all grouped here together meaning it's going inside outside inside outside same with b 6 and three 7 and two are inner ones all group together so it's going inside outside inside outside as far as the firing order so that tells us that this is a crossplane v8 now again looking at these numbers you might say wait a minute why is this firing order different from this firing order and actually it's just mirrored v8 in order to balance things out so if you look at for example going from 5 to four okay we're drawing an arrow from 5 to four then we go from 8 to 7 8 to 7 then we go from 2 to 6 we draw an arrow from 2 to six then an arrow from 3: 1 so we draw that arrow from 3 to 1 if you do the same thing on this one you're going from 3 to 7 all right there's that arrow 3 to 7 and you can see these perfectly mirror all of these arrows perfectly mirr each other so you're balancing things out and you're alternating when this one is firing the outside cylinders this one is firing the inside cylinders when this one's firing the outside cylinders this one is firing the inside cylinders so they reverse things they mirror it everything balances out and it's a nice and happy v16 engine okay there's one more critical detail to understand in order for all of this to work out so if we're going from odd on this side to even on this side and alternating back and forth each time that means we have 45degrees of crankshaft rotation between this one and this one so in order for that to work work out it means this crankshaft has to be offset 45degrees from this crankshaft so if you were to look at it down from the side you'd see a cross for one of the crankshafts a there and then in order for that firing interval to work out where it goes back and forth you'd then have a 45degrees switch in that crossplane crankshaft for the other v8 engine all right time to come clean made remac the ceo of bugatti actually posted some photos of a prototype engine on facebook so we have a few images we can analyze first we can see the crankshaft and since two cylinders share a common crank pin we can confirm based on the firing order that it is a 90degrees v8 and you can see it's clearly a crossplane crankshaft which halfway through has a 45degrees offset creating the two v8s which alternate power strokes every 45degrees of crank rotation oh and there's a photo of the engine block where you can eyeball 90degrees pretty easily so was all of this a waste of time since those photos exist maybe moving on it's important to understand that all bugatti has informed us of thus far is that it's a v16 engine and it's part of a hybrid powertrain those are the only two things confirmed reportedly however there have been private customer presentations where more information has been divulged allegedly it's a cworth developed 8.3 l natur naturally aspirated v16 revving to 9,000 rpm and producing 1,000 horsepower all right i don't really care about speculation i'd rather just learn the numbers from bugatti directly when they choose to reveal them however that doesn't mean we can do a little bit of math and just see if these reported numbers actually make any logical sense so a way to compare them using another cworth naturally aspirated engine out there is the one that goes in the gordon murray t50 it's a 4.0 l v12 revs to 12,100 rpm 654 horsepower making that peak power at about 11,500 rpm so let's imagine these numbers are accurate our bugatti is probably going to make peak power you know 500 rpm or so lower than the red line so let's say 8500 rpm it's going to then be making 1,000 horsepower divided by 8.3 or about 120 horsepower per liter now that's much less than the t50 the t50 though is revving higher so it's not really a great way of measuring them side by side because they rev to different rpm so what's a better way of doing this well looking at breake mean effective pressure a simpler way of doing that is just looking at torque per liter so this the gordon r t50 4.0 l cworth v12 engine is making 299 lbt of torque at its peak horsepower number so at 11,500 rpm we canal calate the same for the bugatti if it were making 1,000 horsepower and that would be 618 lbet of torque at 8500 rpm okay so now what is our torque per liter at that peak horsepower number so for our gordon murray t50 that number is 74.7 lound feet per liter and for our bugatti again we're trying to find something close to say all right is this realistic the number ends up being 74.4 pound feet per liter okay so these numbers are extremely close to one another so the numbers are feasible and as far as speculation goes i am inclined to believe that it's going to be naturally aspirated for several reasons number one the power numbers make sense for it to be naturally aspirated that's one indication we're on the right path number two looking at the intake manifolds there aren't intercoolers visible and the manifolds while shared have split throttles between the two sets of v8 if it were turbocharged you'd likely expect to see a more simplistic manifold style connecting all eight cylinders of each bank much like you see on the turbocharged w16 engine from the chiron number three it sounds like a high revving naturally aspirated engine but that's generally difficult to objectively confirm and number four when asked about it in a facebook post mate rimx said translated to english you are good in response to hoping the engine is 1,000 horsepower naturally aspirated you'll also notice this is in response to having 1,000 electric horsepower so reportedly the setup has two electric motors in the front you've got a 24.8 kw battery in the back you've got your v16 engine paired with another electric motor each of those electric motors at 250 kw or combined rating of 1,000 horsepower so you've got your 1,000 horsepower v16 you've got 1,000 horsepower from electric motors combined peak of around 1,800 horsepower and for the rear sending that power through an 8-speed dual clutch transmission okay so the big question why go with this v16 hybrid strategy well it does make a lot of sense when you think about combining remac and bugatti so the ceo of bugatti also the ceo of remac combining their two strengths electric and combustion into one allout performance vehicle and also just having a really unique experience right that's what bugatti is about so you know while a v16 is large and heavy and it's going to be comp complicated and expensive these are things that really don't matter to the bugatti buyer right and if you start to look at okay what was the evolution of the veyron to the chiron well they tried to push out that torque curve right they wanted to have more available torque across a wider rpm range and what does electrification do for you well you can raise that performance even more and you can have it start at zero so you can have the ultimate torque curve here instead of you know suffering on that low end with combustion engines you fill all of that with the electric motors and then as you get into those high rpm you use that insane v16 engine to provide the torque on the higher end and you have a much more beautiful torque curve even though this one already was quite good so really impressive looking forward to
