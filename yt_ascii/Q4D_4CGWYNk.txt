do you see a connection between world war two and the crisis we're living through right now sure the need for collective action reminding ourselves of the fact that all of these abstractions like everyone should just do exactly what he or she wants to do for himself and leave everyone else alone none of these abstractions work in a global crisis and this is just a reminder that we didn't somehow put all that behind us when i hear stories about my grandfather who was in the army and so the soviet union where most people die when you're in the army there's a brotherhood that happens there's a love that happens do you think that's something we're going to see here or none there i mean what the soviet union went through i mean the enormity of the war on the russian doorstep this is different what we're going through now is not we can't talk about stalingrad and kovat in the same breath yet we're not ready and the the sort of you know that just the sense of like the great patriotic war and the way in which i was very moved by the soviet custom of newlyweds going and visiting war memorials on their wedding day it's like the happiest day of your life you have to say thank you to the people who made it possible we're not there we're just restarting history we you know i've called this on the rogen program i called it the great nap yeah 75 years with very little by historical standards and in in terms of really profound disruption and so when you called the great nap meaning lack of deep global tragedy well lack of realized global tragedy so i think the development for example of the hydrogen bomb you know was something that happened during the great nap and that doesn't mean that people who live during that time didn't feel fear didn't know anxiety but it was to say that most of the violent potential of human species was not realized it was in the form of potential energy and this is the thing that i've sort of taken issue with with the corruption of steven pinker's optimism is that if you look at they realized kinetic variables things have been getting much better for a long time which is the great nap but it's not as if our fragility has not grown our dependence on electronic systems our vulnerability to disruption and so all sorts of things have gotten much better what other things have gotten much worse in the destructive potential of skyrocketed its tragedy the only way we wake up from the big nap well no you could also have you know jubilation about positive things but it's harder to get people's attention can you give an example of a big global positive thing well i could happen i think that when for example just historically speaking hiv went from being a death sentence to something that people could live with for a very long period of time it would be great if that had happened on a wednesday right like all at once like you knew that things had changed and so the bleed in somewhat kills the sort of the wednesday effect where it all happens on a particular day at a particular moment i think if you look at the stock market here you know there's a very clear moment where you can see that the market absorbs the idea of the coronavirus i think that with respect to positives the moon landing was the best example of a positive that happened at a particular time or recapitulating the soviet american link-up in terms of skylab and soyuz right like that was a huge moment when you actually had these two nations connecting in orbit and so yeah there are great moments where something beautiful and wonderful and amazing happens you know but it's just they're fewer that's why that's why as much as i can't imagine proposing to somebody at a sporting event when you have like 30,000 people waiting and you know she says yes it's pretty exciting so i think that we shouldn't we shouldn't discount that so how bad do you think it's going to get in terms of the global suffering that we're going to experience with this with this crisis i can't figure this one out i'm just not smart enough something is goin weirdly wrong and they're almost like two separate storylines we in one storyline we aren't taking things nearly seriously enough we see people using food packaging lids as masks who are doctors or nurses we hear horrible stories about people dying needlessly due to triage and that's a very terrifying story on the other hand there's this other story which says there are tons of ventilators someplace we've got lots of masks but they haven't been released we've got hospital ships where none of the beds are being used and it's very confusing to me that somehow these two stories give me the feeling that they both must be true simultaneously and they can't both be true in any kind of standard way well i don't know whether it's just that i'm dumb but i can't get one or the other story to quiet down so i think weirdly this is much more serious than we had understood it and it's not nearly as serious as some people are making it out to be at the same time and that we're not being given the tools to actually understand how here's how to interpret the data or here the issue with the personal protective equipment is actually a jurisdictional battle or a question of who pays for it rather than a question of whether it's present or apps i don't understand the details of it but something is wildly off in our ability to understand where we are so that's that's policy that's institutions what about do you think about the quiet suffering of millions of people they've lost their job is this a temporary thing i mean what i'm my ears not to the suffering of those people who have lost their job or the 50% possibly of small businesses that are gonna go bankrupt do you think about that sure it's suffering well and how that might arise itself could be not quiet - i mean right that's the could be a depression could go from recession to depression and depression could go to armed conflict and then to war so it's not a very abstract causal chain that gets us to the point where we can begin with quiet suffering and an anxiety and all of these sorts of things and people losing their jobs and people dying from stress and all sorts of things but look anything powerful enough to put us all in doors in a i mean think about this as an incredible experiment imagine that you proposed hey i want to do a bunch of research let's figure out what what changes in our emissions emissions profiles for our carbon footprints when we're all indoors or what happens to traffic patterns or what happens to the vulnerability of retail sales as amazon gets stronger you know etc etc i believe that in many of those situations we're running an incredible experiment and am i worried froth us all yes there are some bright spots one of which is that when you're ordered to stay indoors people are going to feel entitled and the usual thing that people are going to hit when they hear that they've lost your job you know some there's this kind of tough tough love attitude that you see particularly in the united states lee oh you lost your job poor baby well go retrain get another one i think there's gonna be a lot less appetite for that because we've been asked to sacrifice to risk to act collectively and that's the interesting thing what does that really can in us maybe the idea that we actually are nations and then you know your fellow countrymen may start to mean something to more people certainly mean something to people in the military but i wonder how many people who aren't in the military start to think about this it's like oh yeah we are kind of running separate experiments and we are not china so you think this is kind of a period that might be studied for years to come from my perspective we are a part of the experiment but i don't feel like we have access to the full data the full data of the experiment we're just like little mice yeah in a large does this one make sense to you lex i'm romanticizing it and i keep connecting it to world war two so i keep connecting to historical events and making sense of them through that way or reading the plague by camus like almost kind of telling narratives and stories but my i'm not hearing the suffering that people are going through because i think that's quiet that everybody's numb currently they're not realizing what it means to have lost your job and to have lost your business there's kind of a i i am i'm afraid how that fear well material as itself once the numbness wears out and especially if this lasts for many months then if it's connected to the incompetence of the cdc in the w-h-o and our government and perhaps the election process you know might be biggest year is that the you know elections get delayed or something like that so the the basic mechanisms of our democracy get slowed or damaged in some way that then mixes with the fear that people have that turns to panic that turns to anger that anger can i just play with that for a butcher what if in fact all of that structure that you grew up thinking about and again you grew up in two places right so when you were inside the us we tend to look at all of these things as museum pieces like how often do we amend the constitution anymore and in some sense if you think about the jewish tradition of simchat torah you've got this beautiful scroll that has been lovingly hand drawn in calligraphy that's very valuable and it's very important that you not treat it as a relic to be revered and so we one day a year we dance with the torah and we hold this incredibly vulnerable document up and we treat it as if you know it was ginger rogers being led by fred astaire well that is how you become part of your country in fact maybe the maybe the election will be delayed maybe extraordinary powers will be used maybe any one of a number of things will indicate that you're actually living through history this isn't a museum piece that you handed by your great-great grandparents you
