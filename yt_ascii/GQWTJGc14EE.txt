hello everyone i'm pleased to announce my new tour for 2024 beginning in early february and running through june tammy and i an assortment of special guests are going to visit 51 cities in the us you can find out more information about this on my website jordanbpeterson.com as well as accessing all relevant ticketing information i'm going to use the tour to walk through some of the ideas i've been working on my forthcoming book out november 2024 we who wrestle with god i'm looking forward to this i'm thrilled to be able to do it again and i'll be pleased to see all of you again soon bye-bye you could take any somatic cell in your body like a muscle a skin cell and you can reprogram it using genetic reprogramming to and turn it back into an embryonic stem cell state that's so to revert to an earlier form essentially but we have to figure out and give it the right signals so that you can heal disease and that's what regenerative medicine the promise of it is really [music] about hello everyone so today i have the opportunity to speak with dr adil khan adil is a physician that i've worked with he offered tammy and i a treatment a couple of different treatments the treatment for her was particular successful it helped her deal with chronic osteoarthritic condition in her forearms and was quite remarkably successful and so that's very interesting and it deals a young canadian physician very very sharp character seems to be on the cutting edge of the expanding field of regenerative medicine which is what would you say it's developing not precisely in opposition to but in parallel to standard allopathic medicine that's more symptom based in its approach so the regenerative medical types are attempting to get to the root cause of chronic health problems and to address them and so there's much advance being made on that front and so we're going to talk through the potential of these new treatment protocols for depression chronic pain degenerative diseases like osteoarthritis multiple sclerosis fibromialgia and a variety of chronic pain conditions we talk about gene therapy st cell usage and tissue engineering so stay tuned if you're concerned about your health and about you know living living happily and healthily and even just living well thank you for coming in dr kh you treated tamion a while back and so maybe you could start by telling everybody who's watching and listening what you did and why and then we'll talk a little bit about what you do more generally and about who you are and and the way we go yeah so in your wife's case she had a very common issue which is chronic pain chronic pain is something that the medical industry has grappled with for years and traditionally they've used cortisone which is an anti-inflammatory drug they've used narcotics opioids and then if that doesn't work surgery so what we do is we identify that there's a gap where people don't get better necessarily with just cortisone and there and they don't always want surgery and so this is kind of that gap of patients who are just suffering or living with chronic pain and taking pain meds as we know oxycontin and so many other pain meds what they can lead to with addiction and all these risks and so what we do is what's called regenerative medicine so we use different types of regenerative molecules whether that's stem cells prp exosomes which we'll talk about to repair the tissue back to a previous state so in your wife's case she had what's called ostearthritis which is degradation of the joint cartilage loss and you get inflammation and then she also had some small tears in the tendons around the joints and it bothered her for 10 years as you know and she couldn't garden and she lost to garden so what we did is we used an ultrasound as you saw and we go directly into the tears and into the joint where the inflammation is to repair the tissue back to a previous state and so that's how it got rid of her chronic when was the ultrasound for diagnosis diagnostic and intervention and intervention yeah so how does the ultrasound intervene because it allows us to guide the needle directly into the area of damage right and how can you see what's damaged because the ultrasound and that's the skill so it's telling gray from gray ultrasound and that's the steepest skill set to give you an example i i treated muhammad olivar he's he's the guy who owns the bur khalifa and the six tallest buildings in dubai so he had a shoulder issue for 15 20 years and he did an mri mri was normal so they just did cortisone they did physio was living with chronic pain for 15 years and he's arguably the most he's the wealthiest man in middle east and he's a very well-renowned businessman so he has access to any doctor in the world right and so he found me and i flew down i did an ultrasound and we did and we found some small tears that were missed on mri and then we injected him similar to what we did with tammy and we fixed it but it's the principle is the same which is that sometimes you need to do diagnostic dynamic ultrasound to find the issue and that's how did you learn to distinguish as you said gray from gray and are the ai image system getting good at that we're training we're developing a machine learning neural net to do that but that hasn't been developed yet that's actually something we're doing because we're kind of set the standard for it because my mentor dr anthony galia he was the first one in the world to do this stuff he did it for tiger woods alex rodriguez a lot of a-list athletes so he was the one who taught me all this and he was the one who pioneered this field so i learned from him and i was fortunate because i got to learn from the best and because of that i was able to kind of take it and translate it into my own patients how much exposure to image data did you have to undertake in order to start to be able to distinguish thousands of hours thousands of yes it's it's not it's the learning curve is so steep and we have ultrasonographers as if you remember i brought her with me at the time who are specially trained by us and they're the ones who actually guide us because there's so much nuance between telling what's a tear and what's not a tear that you really need a specialist and unfortunately most yeah and a really trained specialist who actually knows what they're doing i know there's huge difference in radiologists for example in their diagnostic accuracy i know on the ai front that they're they have trained ai systems now from what i understand to be able to be pretty good at distinguishing like lung cancer lesions for example yeah they're pretty good at x-ray and cancer but muscular scal is still a big gap and so that's what we're developing because that's our specialty is we're going to develop a machine learning neural net using what's called supervised and reinforcement learning to teach to teach the machine learning algorithm to detect what's a tear and what's not a tear and then guide the physician on how to do it so that's kind of how we're going to scale what we're doing and how how do you get the data set set up properly because you need a training if you're going to reinforce the proper response you have to be sure that the material that you're training the machine on is actually accurate how do you solve that problem because we have a brilliant radiologist on our team who's going to be training the ai on what's not a tear and what's a tear and then you have normal you you have to first get 's more than one radiologist no we're just going to use the one who's specially trained by us who does our msk interventions and diagnos and she's she's obviously exal at what she does and she can train the ai to say but the a needs thousands of normal before it can recognize abnormal and that's that's the data sets that you have to build into it first and then she has to train it over time to say hey this is a tear and this is not a tear and then eventually it learns right right right right and what did you inject tammy with so we use something called exosomes so the way i explain exosomes imagine if you're if you're going so let's talk about stem cells first to explain exosomes so most people have a intuitive concept of stem cells they understand that they rebuild tissue or they repair tissue so they can come from umbilical cord they can come from fat they can come from the bone marrow they can come from amniotic fluid there's so many different sources where we can get them we use something specifically called mazeno stem cells which is just an embryological term to explain their origin of where they're being derived from and so and the reason we use maeno is because they're easy to access so for example the most easiest place to access is after birth right that you take the umbilical core tissue or you take the amniotic fluid and you can isolate the meenal stem cells or stromal cells is technically the right word but anyway most people call stem cells but msse for short and so what you do is you isolate those and then you can grow them in a lab for three to fours why are they in umbilical cord tissue why yeah because there's a is there just a rich source of repair and regeneration of the meenal stem cells from that so meaning the umbilical cord tissue is just rich in m's so why they're rich in m's well i read that that babies actually send stem cells into their mother's body to help the mother repair her own tissue right yeah there is that mechanism built in so i i think a lot of it it's probably that cross talk between the placenta and the mother right so i believe and the cool thing is your body has stem cells too right so and you have stem cells in your bone barrel and in your fat and they're basically cells that are undifferentiated that can turn into any tissue so there's different types of stem cells if you have embryonic stem cells which is from the fetus then they can turn to any type of tissue but as you know embryonic stem cells during the bush era and everything it was controversial right and what the reason for that was because they were saying are we going to be harming fetuses obviously that becomes ethical issues and so no one that never really took off but l luckily we figured out hey wait a minute we have something that's almost as good as emb stem cells not as good but it's called plur poent meaning it has ability to turn into many different types of tissue but not every type of tisue i see so they're slightly farther down the developmental chain it's not toti potent it's plur poent and so those plur poent stem cells mazeno stem cells are pretty ubiquitous you can you can get them from dental pulp you can get them from fat umbilical umbilical c we talked about bone mar there's a lot of different sources and so they're easier to harvest and easier to source and because of that accessibility that's where the research really took off in the last 10 to 15 years is with the mc's so are there variants of cells like is it a continual variant from the cells that are omnipotent did you say the ones that to poent toy poent that can turn into anything and then there's the ones that are what was the nextel flur potent and do the do the toip poent cells turn into the pur poent cells is that is that the developmental sequence and then into specific exactly yeah exactly yeah and that's kind of how it it can differentiate down the line and so the difference between a stem cell and a cancer cell so a cancer cell has some similar properties because it can essentially it loses the sign it or in a sense it gets kind of hijacked and it loses the ability to stop killing itself so meaning it it it stops apoptosis so it keeps replicating right and it has un infinite amount it can keep going right so right and and un differentiated to some degree to and so that's why there's actually something called cancer stem cells and so if we can target cancer stem cells and stop that process so there's that's an active area of research so they not all stem cells are good right because people think that's the problem with stem cells undifferentiated tissue in the wrong place could be a real le to tumor and le to tumor and and that's actually the problem with embryonic stem cells too they're too strong they have too much stemness meaning they can keep replicating and grow into tumors right where whereas meenal stem cells they can they have a finite ability to diff to grow so they don't keep growing which is why they're safe and so oh okay so when we grow them zeno stem cells the soup that they grow in so imagine the how do you say that maeno how do you spell it m n c h y m a l yeah w it's going to take me a while to get that one right yeah i know it's an embryological term so just call them m's mc's yeah so msc's when they're grown imagine the m's are the chicken meat and the soup the broth is the exosomes so the broth has all these nutrients and cyto kindes in there but there's no actual stem cells and why is that important because those exosomes can send all the signals which are the proteins the cyto kindes and growth factors to reduce inflammation and repair tissue without the risk of having cells which sometimes can not survive or can cause reactions in certain people so that's what used on tam and that that's that encourages the cells that are already there to to what to to repair them themselves what there grow it's a signal it's a signal that says to your body okay start repairing this tissue so it send signals to your endogenous so does it tell your does it essentially signal to the body that something's wrong it's sense to the bodies to start healing and regenerative pathways right well i know that for example and correct me if i'm wrong but part of the reason that your face skin doesn't repair itself when it wrinkles is because your body doesn't actually note that the damage has occurred and i know that some of the therapies that regenerat skin like intense pulse light produce enough damage so that damage is now signaled right your body has to figure out so the cross linking that occurs as a consequence of sun damage is so subtle that it can accumulate across time with no indication of damage and so the exosome signal to the body that something needs to be fixed exactly and that's what this really is all about and especially the first generation of stem cells we'll talk about second generation but first generation of stem cells is really about paracrine signaling which is basically signaling to the local tissue hey there's something wrong here start fixing it and that's that's really what it is and so exomes in the case of t's case they they send a signal to reduce inflammation and then they send growth factors to help repair and regenerate the tear so and then you can actually see if you do a followup ultrasound which we do all the time that the tissue is actually repaired and regenerated can you do that systemically yeah exactly so intravenous stem cells or intravenous exosomes are being used a lot for a variety of neurodegenerative conditions autoimmune conditions chronic pain chronic inflammation there's so many different things are being done for there's a recent trial done for inflammatory bowel disease which is a really terrible condition and right now the only really medications are like methotrexate or amuno supressant carnivore diet yeah carnivore diet it does work actually yeah but not everyone's gonna stick to it right it's a hard diet and a lot of doctors don't really know about it so they're not going to recommend it to their patients so patients have to self-educate right and so instead of just suppressing your immune system what the intervenous stem cells do is they do what's called imuno modulation so they actually reset or repair your immune system from a pro-inflammatory state to an anti-inflammatory state and is that the is that the exosomes or the stem cells per se it's more the stem cells so stem cells have a strong imuno modulatory effect exosomes don't have a strong imuno modulation so that's why you have to do intravenous stem cells if you want to treat something systemic autoimmune conditions and and there's there's trials that where patients have actually gone into remission and that's incredible to see because yeah you you've treated ms we have but ms is much more tricky because it's not just there is an autoimmune component to it but then there's also there's a lot of other components to it with and that's where it becomes you have to take a holistic approach so the way we're going to treat ms which we're working on is we're going to have the second generation of stem cells so what that means is instead of just using umbilical core stem cells we create what are called gene edited stem cells so we can actually take so this is this is what professor yamanaka in japan he won a nobel prize in 2014 for what's called discovery of plur induced plur poent stem cells ipscs so what he discovered was that you could take any somatic cell in your body like a muscle a skin cell and you can reprogram it using genetic reprogramming to and turn it back into an embryonic stem cell state that's so to revert to an earlier form essentially so i like to call it the yamanaka stem cell and basically it's a pretty crazy discovery if you think about it the fact that you can your body has this almost innate ability to go back to like a infant state and but you just have to overexpress certain transcription factors to do that and so that discovery was pretty incredible you know the immune system does that too is that when it's when it's mutating when it's adapting to the presence of a new virus or a bacteria it'll produce more and more accurate gripping mechanisms right at the cellular level but it stores representations of the ones that were part of the developmental sequence so we can imagine that that um an immune cell is trying to get purchase on a bacteria it'll sort of go like this first right it's it's not doing it very well but it'll stick a bit and then those what sticks a bit varies and then it'll stick a bit better and then that'll vary and then it'll stick a bit better like that well then if the thing mutates this grip might not work but this one might and so that the is still stored and if this one doesn't work well this one might so it stores that that developmental so there's more early variability and less fine accuracy there's a trade-off right between it sounds like the same thing is happening with the with the stem cells is that they'll differentiate into their final form which is specialized but that the possibility for earlier forms with more potential is reserved exactly yeah you know the same thing seems to happen with regards to junk dna so i had a friend tell me for example examp if you breed fruit flies and you breed them so that they don't have eyes you can do that you can alter them genetically so they don't have eyes and then you take the blind fruit flies and you let them breed amongst themselves for seven or eight generations the eyes will come back because the the genome takes information out of the junk dna and rebuilds the eyes and so even in the dna itself there seems to be additional information stored so that the system can revert to an earlier stage of development and then progress forward again so and that's that's really what i believe is you have 3.2 trillion cells or so in your body and i believe they're working for you but we have to figure out and give it the right signals so that you can heal disease and that's what regenerative medicine the promise of it is really about which is that we can use customize cell and gene therapy to restore your body back to a previous state and that's the era we're finally in it took a while to get here but that's but but you see how there's all these interesting almost clues from from fruit flies from the immune system that tell us that maybe this is possible and now we're just trying to put peace that together using next generation cell therapy therapeutics so can you distinguish let let let's speak more generally for a moment if you can distinguish between regenerative medicine per se and medicine as it's commonly practiced and it it sounds like the regenerative field is much newer and you're obviously at the forefront of that but how do you distinguish what you do from what physicians typically do well i think the big the big narrative shift that's hopefully going to happen is instead of giving pills for chronic disease we want to be giving cells and what that means is we can make customized cells now to treat chronic disease traditional medicine's amazing when it comes to acute care right if you get a fracture you go to the hospital phenomenal we're our surgeons are amazing they're so good at that but when when it comes to chronic disease unfortunately we've been told by regulatory bodies and by guidelines that giving prescription drugs is the best way to manage them and the reality is those drugs don't really treat the root cause they're just kind of symptom symp maskers exactly and so but now and it it was fair it was not an unreasonable solution but now we're kind of at this place where we actually have real solutions to get people better using these specific cell therapies and put them into remission or actually i don't like to say cure but at least remission right where where their disease is controlled and so they don't and they don't necessar have to be on pain meds and so i think people need to and this is i'll give an example like lupus is a terrible condition and again the only way they can traditionally manage it is an it's an autoimmune condition is usually some sort of immunosuppressant and so which brings with it all sorts of other risks like chronic infection of other sorts exactly and so many other risks with it and so there was a trial done in germany where they used something called gene edited car te- cells so what they do is they take your te- cells out of your body they add a chimeric antigen receptor which basically allows these te- cells to hone in and kill b cells which become hyperproliferative in lupus and so it's called cd c9 it's just it's it's a specific type of antigen that they add on to the t receptor the gist of it is that what it does is just makes it hone in on the problem so it's it's really it's really fascinating because you're you're gene editing these you're making these bspoke cells almost that are specifically designed to do a task and these and these cells they actually put everyone in the trial into remission and and even even a year followup even though their b b lympocytes went back up patients were still doing well their their symptoms didn't come back so that just shows you the power of these nextgen ration therapeutics so is that a widely used treatment now car car so ct is approved by fda however it's $500,000 and why is it so expensive because the pharmaceutical companies a lot of them just unfortunately because just patented and all this stuff they just charge a lot of money and so what we're doing is we're using our technology which we can talk about to create our own car t and hopefully offer it at onet the price and that's that's kind of the the goal that we want to take because it's just it's it's not a like very few people can afford that obviously but the point is you can make these customized cell therapies for different chronic diseases and and there's so many it's going to be autoimmune conditions cancer and everything in the next few years is going to shift towards gene and cell therapy to actually cure people or put them in remission as opposed to just giving them pills for everything how far along is regenerative medicine in relation to the treatment of cancer so carti is so a variant of kti is used for different types of leukemia and lymphomas and it's successfully been used for several years so that's one type of genea cell therapy that's being used and then there's also something called natural killer cells which are part of your innate immune system as as a name suggests natural killers they go there they kill things that don't belong so what you can do now is you can actually gene edit those natural killer cells with that car antigen i was talking about so you can create something called carn k and that carn k with that antigen onto it can hone in and kill the cancer so there's trials being done now where they're using k enk for different type of solid tumors as well and so and the results are very promising it's still early stages but to get again this is where the i think cross-cultural medicine becomes really important so when i worked in japan earlier this year i learned that they've been using these type of cell therapies to treat cancer for over 10 years but in in the us it's completely new so it just shows you that there's this disconnect why is there a 10year leg exactly so it's it's it's a loaded question because of the problem is there's the biggest problem by far is regulatory bodies and unfortunately the regulatory bodies in north america are making it very difficult for cell and gene therapies to be approved whereas in japan they set a framework it's called pwda which is just a framework for reged medicine regulation which started in 2014 so almost nine years so they actually approved different type of cell therapies n years ago whereas in the us it's technically still illegal to do certain stem cells let me ask you this question are you at peace with the mindless screen time you spend on your phone every day are you gaining that higher quality of life you know you desire if this sounds familiar i have good news starting on january 1st tens of thousands of men all over the world will start 2024 with a 90-day journey together in search of a more purposeful life it's called exodus 90 and it was built to help men enjoy the freedom of becoming who they were truly made to be exodus 90 guides you in removing the attachments that are holding you back from a better life and it actually works independent research shows that exodus 90 men report considerable shifts after the 90 days a dramatic decrease in time spent on their phones stronger satisfaction rates in their marriages a more meaningful relationship with god and true brotherhoods of men on the same path for the past 8 years exodus 90 has helped more than 100,000 men build their own road map for living with virtue in a culture that offers far too many paths to self-destruction so is it time for your exodus we start january 1st find resources to prepare for exodus 90 at exodus 90.com jordan that's exodus 90.com jordan to start your journey so why do you think that is is is it merely a matter of i mean 9 years is long in terms of 9 years is a long time if you happen to be suffering from cancer but on a historical time frame it's you know a blink in it's a blink in time i mean obviously there's going to be some resistance and lag in every system to the introduction of new innovations and perhaps some of that's useful because some innovations cause a lot more trouble than they solve but why do you think it is that there is a lag in the united states which is generally a very dynamic place with regard to innovation on the regenerative medicine side compared to japan i think it has to do unfortunately with the pharmaceutical companies because a lot of of them have lobbyists that influence seven for every member of congress and senator in in the us seven lobbyists right so plenty and i think they control 75% of mainstream television advertising i think it's something like that and i think it's actually higher for news broadcasts per se and they actually spend more money advertising to doctors than they do to even consumers so then doctors are inundated with these pharmaceutical reps and with this information and if you're if you're a busy do doctors have really really challenging lives as you i'm sure you know and so they're busy working they're in clinic they're trying to just help their patients they don't really have time to check everything that's going on outside of in they don't have time to travel they don't have time to look at what's going on in the whole world med journals and they're not trained very well to do that to begin with no they're not and they're basically told what they're what they're trained well to do is follow guidelines and those guidelines where do they come from from specialists who have industry sponsors or ti well it's a tricky business right because the pharmaceutical companies are within their proper purview to attempt to educate physicians about their new products but drawing the line between that and marketing per se and unethical marketing is very very tricky and i mean it's the same with regards to high prices for novel medical interventions i mean it can take a lot of time and money to develop a new drug or a treatment and it's not surprising at all that to begin with its exp expensive because everything that's introduced into the market to begin with that's novel is expensive hopefully then it gets widespread enough so the price starts to come down i mean it's easy to dam the pharmaceutical companies and i'm highly inclined to do that under certain circumstances you know because i think i don't know it seems to me that maybe a line was crossed when the pharmaceutical companies got the okay to advertise directly to consumers that seemed to have warped the system pretty badly and that was about 20 years ago if i remember correctly i think they move from from u what would you call it scientific research enterprises to marketing machines at that point and and it doesn't look to me like the consequences of that were particularly good so no and the the reality is that if you're a physician most of your continuing education comes from once a year conferences that are given by specialists who are considered the top in their field from institutions who are usually have some sort of ties with pharmaceu companies so where are you getting your continuing education from and it's really difficult for them to get out of that system and so the only reason i think i was able to get out of that system was because i always looked at prevention and i always looked at finding cures or that's just the way i i was taught because of functional medicine and functional medicine is this whole concept of trying to repair your body and trying to heal it there's before selling gene therapy a was just focus on supplements lifestyle like you you've obviously you know like carnivore like those type of interventions can be very powerful but there's no education on the physician side on that stuff well it's also hard to transform them into something that generates profit and this is you it's easy to be cynical about that but that's actually a big problem i mean i know there are a lot of off-the-shelf pharmaceuticals that are essentially free that can be used effectively for treating various conditions so there's a lithium i'm not this is not medical advice by the way for everyone watching listening but there's a lithium variant called lithium orate which is dirt cheap and has has virtually no side effects that appears to be reasonably effective in the treatment of manic depressive disorder and you can buy it on across the shelf for virtually nothing and everyone asks well why isn't this more widely known and the answer is well if the chemical is widely available and essentially free and no one can generate a profit from it no one has the incentive to market it or educate people about it right you see the same thing for treatments like what's the what's the precursor to precursor to serotonin five hydroxy trip tryptamine five hydroxy tryptamine which is a good precursor for serotonin it's also extremely inexpensive and by all appearan is relatively harmless and you might say well why isn't it more widely known and again it's the same problem if there's no market there's no impetus for the distribution of the product or for education about it so they just fall by the wayside and so it isn't merely a matter of the profit hungry you know vampires of the pharmaceutical industry it's actually a very troublesome technical problem when you're making dietary recommendations too it's like well you know how do you do that and at the same time or any form of prevention for that matter it's hard to even get credit for prevention right yeah you know if you're very good at prevention then the thing that you could be rewarded for just never happens and so that's great but but it's very difficult to reward and to note so how did you get interested in regenerative medicine and and why did your educational pathway diverge from the typical physician before i went into med school i was a personal trainer so as a personal trainer my job was to get people moving exercising and a lot of times you actually see them come off their medications diabetes high blood pressure just by exercising so then intuitively i knew i was like wait a minute exercise can solve so many chronic disease problems and then turns out in the literature 80% of chronic disease is is preventable right with with lifestyle though it's very hard to get people to make lifestyle ex and it is so so that i was always fascinated by that and so even in medical school i was kind of like why aren't we learning more about nutrition we had one lecture on nutrition in all of medical school one one and it was a can of it was probably wrong it was wrong it was a can of food it was a can of food guide oh great which is which is what sponsored by indust by dairy by you know we it's just it's like you have to have grains like it's it's just ridiculous but yeah but during but but then what happened was i got exposed to this whole like alternative medicine world because even though i was studying allopathic medicine i was simultaneously studying functional and integrated medicine distinguish those for the people who are watching allopathic so right so allopathic medicine is traditional medical doctor is you get a doctorate of medicine and that's that's a traditional you know drug based surgical based interventions that we learned in medical school so which is great learn disease treatment disease treatment but then functional medicine and intive medicine is taking naturopathic stuff that's evidence-based that has actual science behind it and lifestyle measurements to intervene and treat chronic disease so you know i went i went to the temple of asclepius in greece recently yeah it was extremely interesting a very large compound and at the temple of asclepius there were rooms where you could you they actually had people sit and dream in rooms full of snakes right and god only knows what the what the reason for that was my daughter used to have snakes as pets and she said that she would often have nightmares as a consequence of having the snakes in her room and i suspect it had something to do with their order so god only knows what dreaming with snakes would produce in terms of visions but anyways there was a place set up where you could have a healing vision but there were also theaters and stadia there and places for massage and for for saas essentially like it was a compound that was devoted to health that was multi-dimensional right and so and there were theaters there because part of the healing process was drama and part of it was exercise and part of it was vision and when i went to that temple i thought these people were more sophisticated than we are in their approach to disease right because they were it wasn't merely a matter of i know there are modern medical miracles and certainly surgical bone setting and that kind of thing hip replacements and so forth some of the things that can be done are absolutely miraculous but our notion of what constitutes health and how to progress towards it i don't think is it's certainly not as sophisticated as what the ancient greeks managed at their heights no and i believe in 30 years we're going to look back on this era and be like wow we did a lot wrong and the reason is because just as i was saying we're we we realize now that the system is is broken the us spends more money per gdp on capita than many developed countries but they don't have better health outcomes and they're just drowning in debt because of how much their health expenditure is going up and the reality is like you were saying people aren't going to it's yes i think i think the concept of people promoting exercise health and healthy living is great but the reality is it's really hard to get people to change and the environment is obesogenic meaning it's set up let's be honest it's set up for failure because of just the accessibility of processed foods and the way the envir massive calorie foods you know and the advertising 1500 in in in i think netherlands they banned direct to consumer advertising of sugar to children which is great that's a great start and japan i think did that as well so there's there starting to be finally this notion that hey process refined foods like sugar is really really bad for you and it can lead to food addiction what are the obesity rates in the us is 40% i i mean i think overall some states are higher than others yeah yeah it's stunning it's absolutely stunning and and and catastrophic yeah so i think the reality is it's going to be really really hard to get people to change unless there's huge policy changes which probably won't happen anytime soon so what we're doing is we're trying to build resiliency in people's body so that they can get the benefits of healthy living without necessarily doing healthy living so it sounds kind of crazy but that's what gene therapy is all about so well it's kind of crazy except you know i mean people people also handwave about the pathology of pill taking but one of the things you learn as a behavioral psychologist perhaps above all else is that behavioral changes are very very difficult for people to make even what you would think of as small changes and everybody kind kind of knows this because they have their new year's resolutions and they decide they're going to go to the gym and they go for like a week and then they quit and people revert back to their old habits and you might say well people should behave better it would be better for them but then you think well how often do you take that advice for yourself and so one of the things you learn as a behavior therapist is to help people make behavioral changes very gradually and incrementally but that's very labor intensive right and it's also difficult for the people themselves to do especially if you're dealing with someone who imagined that they're quite ill and they're in crisis maybe economically not least as a consequence of the illness then to ask them to make a radical lifestyle change is maybe it's even necessary but the probability that they're going to do that on top of everything else they're struggling with is very very low so it's a tricky very tricky thing to get it's called social determinance of health basically if you're low socio economic status that's the best predictor of health long term so if you're unfortunately if you're poor and you don't have access to much capital then you're more likely to have obesity more likely to have chronic disease and then helping those vulnerable populations you're going to get cheap fast sources of calories so how can you tell people yeah you just need to exercise more and eat less it doesn't make any sense so yeah well and people also won't do that the the literature on diet's pretty damn clear is that if you put someone on a diet that actually requires food restriction so they're chronically hungry they may diet successfully for a while lose some weight but as soon as they stop dieting they're going to revert not only back to their original weight but generally gain weight on top of that and so any diet it seems to me that any diet that involves protracted periods of hunger is actually doomed to failure and that's what the fitness industry promotes to people so they're set them up for failure because they see all these people online who are doing these extreme diets but they're doing it a as a profession and b a lot of times are enhanced using other things but so the regular person sees those people and then they wonder why it's so hard for them well and those people are actually specializing in doing that right because they maybe they make a living doing it so they can put the time of effort into it one of the advantages of the of a ketogenic diet or a carnivor diet is that you don't have to be hungry that's a big deal because protein is very satiated and you can eat as much as you want so that's a that's a massive that's a massive improvement over diets that involve like chronic calorie restriction because there there's no way that like the other thing too you see people develop eating disorders this way too is like if you get in a fight with the systems that mediate hunger you're going to lose because those systems are very very powerful when they're overactivated and you see this with people with eating disorders they get into a war with their hypothalamus and like they don't no one wins that war no you're going to be set up for failure or you develop a very unhealthy relationship with food yeah so it's developing a healthy relationship with food which means you're eating it for nourishment and not for coping with emotions or stress or so many other reasons why people use food for and developing that healthy relationship is really what it takes a lot of therapy actually and it takes a lot of work which is cognitive behavioral therapy right cbt and cbt is only one is one of the few evidence-based therapies out there to help people treat obesity right and so but it's not but it's a lot of work it is a lot of work and a lot of attention a lot of strategic planning it's expensive for that reason too ex and time consuming on the part of the people who are being treated so all right so how did you now you said that you worked as a personal trainer and so you were already interested in lifestyle modification and then you and how long did you do that and and and why did you decide to go to medical school so i was basically doing that from undergrad like for three four years and then i got into medical school but the reason i decided to go to medical school was mainly because intellectual stimulation because obviously being a personal trainer there's only so much you can do and it kind of becomes repetitive very quickly and so i wanted to learn more about how i can help and heal people and being a doctor naturally seemed the best way to do that but what i didn't realize was when i went into medical school i was a little bit disillusion because i realize that a lot of these things just don't resonate with my belief system which is that i don't believe just giving pills to people i just it just never resonated with me and so i was always kind of trying to learn more about how can i actually get to the root of this and that was just a question i always wanted to ask myself i like i did like surgery because surgery is very gratifying because if you have a trauma if you have someone you can you know you can fix them you get them on their way and they're done right so but but but then you realize even in surgery most of what you're treating is the end stage of chronic disease like hip replacements is ostearthritis like opthalmology a lot of it is cataracts and that's related to diabetes and so many other surgical specialties are actually vascular like a lot of just chronic vascular disease heart disease like these are just end stage of lifestyle stuff and so the reality is if you look at even most surgical specialties a lot of them are just doing what could have been prevent yes exactly mopa and so that's why i ended up not going into surgery and then i kind of got into this whole world of i i i naturally because of personal training i like sports medicine so then that's where i went to sports medicine with dr anthony gallia and that's and was that a was postmed school yes after residency training after residency training then you do sport medicine with dr gia who's kind of the pioneer of the platelet rich plasma injection yeah sports medicine is the medical domain that probably overlaps most with cognitive behavioral therapy as it turns out interesting yeah right well that makes sense yeah and so interestingly i've had yeah i've had professional golfers i've treated using some we do something called a vegas nerve injection which helps with their nervous system but to help performance based anxiety so but but anyway so when i went to sports medicine i got to dr gallia and and kind of the pioneer of platelet rich plasma which is where you take your blood you centrifuge it you concentrate the platelets in the plasma and those plat ls release growth factors that stimulate healing this is kind of like a lower version of the exomes we were talking before if you to compare prp to exomes the cyto kind profile is about 10 times weaker prp is the platelet which so prp is still good for like muscle attendant tears like acute injuries it's not great for chronic tear wear and tear it's so that's where exom stem cells were more superior but when i work with dr gallia obviously i got exposed to all this kind of alternative stuff but then i realized he's treating some of the most high-profile people in the world i'm like there must be a reason they're coming to him so why would these people who can go to any doctor right so is it alternative or is it cutting edge exactly exactly and that's and the media used to pr it print it as though he's you know some there's a lot of negative stuff out there about him so it hard to discern right it's like what's what's really the truth and then you realize quickly once you're in there some of the most important people in the world come see him and so i realized this he's obviously doing something right and so and then that's when i got into regenerative medicine and regenerative medicine prp was a great starting point but now it's evolved into cell and gene therapy and tissue engineering how did you learn to read the relevant scientific literature i had to just make google scholar alerts and just for everything regenerative medicine based and just reading primary literature sources and then just reading was that something you did fundamentally on your own yes yeah yeah because one of the correct me if you think i'm wrong but one of the things i i did a fair bit of research with psychiatrists especially back at migel when i was when i was doing my phd and one of the things i learned very rapidly was that there was a big difference between physicians and scientists in that so if you're trained as a as a boulder model clinical psychologist you're basically a research scientist who does clinical work so you're trained to evaluate the scientific research you're trained to learn how to do statistics and to understand them and to write scientific papers and to evaluate them and i thought the same was true of physicians but it's but i soon discovered it wasn't true at all and even the psychiatrists that i did work with they often had statisticians do their stats and i thought that was so unbelievably well you know even the peer-reviewed process get do you know how that works the doctors don't actually review the data they just get they just get this primary paper and that's and then no one vets it to them right they just go through it and they're just like yeah it looks good yeah well it's very well it's it takes a long time to learn to evaluate scientific research it's not a this is why i was wondering how you managed to do it because it's a very intense training process even to to to understand the jargon that surrounds the statistical analysis that's years of work and now the medical literature is doubling so fast in from 1900 to 1950 it took 50 years for the medical knowledge domain to double now it takes 73 days it's 73 days for the medical knowledge literature yeah i can believe that you know i've been reviewing some of the psychological literature pertaining just recently to discuss sensitivity which is a neurologically based partly gastrointestinal partly emotional response but it has implications for all sorts of things you wouldn't expect so for example societies that are what would you say characterized by higher levels of infectious illness are much more likely to to have authoritarian forms of local and national government like way more likely not a little bit there's a massive connection between discust and authoritarianism as it turns out anyways i was reviewing that literature and i haven't looked at it for you know five years and i was just absolutely stunned at the proliferation of new papers it is essentially impossible to keep up and so but it's also extremely exciting because there is so much knowledge being generated constantly that and so the big the big i think the the key takeaway is you have to be able to look at it from a bird's eye view because there's too much so you have to look at trends and you have to look at where is a science headed and that's that's the tricky part where that's for sure and the science and that's the problem with current medical system is that everyone's in silos and then you have scientists and you have doctors who are in their little silos but they're not stepping back and looking at hey where is medicine headed and how can we take the best of what the science is presented to us and bring it into patientss because while we into public policy exactly and so a lot of that and there's a huge what's called a clinical translation gap of 15 to 20 years so meaning that there's data out there to support the use of certain treatments but a lot of regular doctors don't put it into their treatments for 15 to 20 years which is crazy right and so patients aren't getting access to the best treatments available and it's not it's it's very unjust because a lot of people are living with chronic disease and suffering when there are options for them and that's really what got me super motivated to get into this field because i saw people suffering with chronic pain especially people don't realize how hard it is to live with chronic pain is one of the most challenging things it leads to mental health issues it leads to disability and in fact chronic muscular scal conditions have a greater cost to society than any other disease meaning the total cost of there's billions and billions of dollars because of misw work days and because of the disability burden heart disease kills more people but quality of life and economic burden of muscul scle is the highest so it's a very important problem and that's why i was so motivated to get into this field because i saw these people not getting better and and i've been able to help a lot of people that no one was able to help so i it's well let's talk about that a little bit so when you when you first see someone now you're the the regenerative medicine practices that you engage in that's an element an aspect of lifestyle medicine so you're looking at sleep and exercise and stress a broad sort of i would say a behavioral analysis so how do you move from the general behavioral analysis through the diagnosis to to the recommendation of the therapies that you can provide and what ther like how do you step along that how do you decide who's how do you yeah well that's what i mean how do you how do you lay out the diagnostic process and determine what treatments are appropriate if someone came to see you what could they expect yeah no i have a i have a team who are kind of health coaches and biochemists who can work with the nutrition and lifestyle stuff so they try to optimize that as much as possible but sometimes that's not enough right and that's why they're coming to me because they've already tried the traditional things a lot of them i've already seen multiple specialists and so the most common thing i see by far is ostearthritis right osteitis is just like we're talking about it's cartilage wear and tear it's chronic inflammation but now we realize that ostearthritis isn't just chronic inflammation there's there's all these hallmarks of aging there's 10 hallmarks of aging as and as you probably know aging and longevity is a huge hot topic because if we can cure aging we can pretty much treat almost all chronic disease because they all have the same same 10 hallmarks so i'll list a few of them genomic instability mitochondrial dysfunction loss of proteostasis stem proteostasis which is protein regulation like homeostasis of protein regulation and those pro you get malfunction of proteins and they build up and that can lead to cell dysfunction and then there's also like stem cell exhaustion chronic inflammation and inessence there's all these different hallmarks so there's about 10 of them and now we realize those 10 hallmarks of agent aging actually govern most chronic diseases so even ostearthritis what happens is those condra sites which are the cells that line the joints they become they have all these different hallmarks of aging so they get they get those epigenetic alterations so mitochondria start becom dysfunctional all those things start happening at a cellular level which can happen years before the doctor picks it up right sure and so that's part of the problem well i know with with neurological conditions often you don't see any overt symptoms till 95% of the underlying tissue is being destroyed and so that's why diagnostics is becoming advanced too in fact they're using exomes which are can be a biomarker for a lot of these diseases because these cells start releasing these different biomarkers and you can detect them using exome technology so it's becoming and even the diagnostics is really far behind now in traditional medicine because they're not doing any of this stuff but anyway so to the point so if you have someone let's say a knee that's really bad osteo like stage four they want to they've been told by the regular doctor they want to get a knee replacement and they they want a second opinion so that's usually why they come to me and they want to look at the alternatives and they've tried you know the lifestyle stuff and so what we do is we assess we assess their x-ray mri we do an ultrasound examination and then we see if they're an appropriate candidate for our procedure and the way we do that is based off mris so you have to have you have to have characteristic findings for example like bone edema which is inflammation in the bone that's something we can target and treat with stem cells because they're very anti-inflammatory and then we also have to make sure their bone isn't to deform so for example because there's and this is a problem with my field if you google regenerative medicine doctor there's a thousand of them in the us and and there's so many of them not doing things properly and the problem is because of the lack because there is almost a black market where there is a lot of people doing it illegally in the us because the fda can't keep up with shutting down all these clinics there are so many stem cell clinics even though stem cells are technically illegal in the us so it's it's become a weird place because it's hard for patients to kind of figure out who's actually telling the truth and who's just selling them a pie a lie and that's and that's the biggest problem with the whole stem you see the same thing with plastic surgery exactly exactly it's the exact same thing and yeah well it's a pito distribution problem which is that in every field only a tiny minority of people actually know what they're doing right right so you always have a signal to noise detection problem is like who are the people who actually and then of course often the people who don't know what they're doing genuinely think they know what they're doing tricky absolutely it's really problematic yeah and that's that's exactly what happens and so why should people trust you because i'm a canadian physician and in canada we were never taught about money we were never taught about the business side we always taught about patients first and making them better and i think that's being on the global stage as i am now we i'm traveling i'm treating people around the world my focus is never on the monetary stuff and i i always focused on treating the patients first yes some of the treatments are expensive and that's just because the market price is expensive but as we talked about earlier anytime there's a new technology over time the price is going to come down and there's always going to be early adopters and over time we want this to be accessible to the average person in fact we want it to be covered by insurance which in japan it is so if japan's doing that already i think eventually there's going to be an impetus for this stuff to move over here it's just going to take time yeah but yeah i think that's because i went into medicine generally to make a difference and help people that's always been my motivation it has never been anything anything more i i and and and the big thing too is honestly if a lot of patients who see me they they can tell i'm pretty like i'm honest and i'm transparent and i don't promise the moon like there's certain things that we can fix certain things that we can't fix stem cells aren't a magical cure for everything but the next generation of cell therapy like we were talking about like the gen a cell therapy that really will be allowing us for custom cell lines for almost every medical condition like diabetes cancer dementia there's parkinson's disease there's a clinical trial done this year those ipscs i was talking about earlier and they are ipscs are the induced pl potent stem cells the yamanaka stem cells so they created what are called ipsc dopamine producing neurons oh yeah and then they transplant them surgically into the areas where they lose those dopamine neurons and then they did a one-year followup and all so many of the patients basically go into remiss their symptoms get so much better and they actually regrow new neurons that produce dopamine this was a blue rock therapeutic clinical trial so this shows the power of ipscs and this is just the beginning of ip this is what i'm going to call the ipsc revolution there's going to be so many different ipsc cell lines that are going to allow us to treat specifical medical conditions so in the future people will think about cells to treat their conditions as opposed to pills let's go back to osteoarthritis because that's a very interesting place to dive into because generally once people have when when people have rheumatoid arthritis and use anti-inflammatories you can slow down the degenerative process but often when you see people in late stages of osteoarthritis they've already suffered a tremendous amount of loss of cartilage for example and so you evaluate people using mri and you said there are there are times when their joint damage is too far gone for you to be able to intervene but so what at what level of severity can you intervene and what sort of what sort of responses have you seen and how widely generalizable is that yeah it's so even for so there's four kind of stages of osteo thetis so we can even treat stage three stage four which is the more advanced one as long as their bone like i was saying earlier if their bone is actually deformed where they need some sort of alignment or corrective where the problem is mechanical if it's mechanical then stem cells aren't going to fix that right they need some sort of surgical correction so but if it's more inflammatory base or if it's more based off like toell dysfunction we're talking about then that's something stem cells work really well for so for example people who have chronic daily pain pain at night pain is it's affecting them all the time that's very inflammatory base and that's where stem cells work really well for and even mri we can correlate if they have inflammation in the bone then we have a specific target so it's very it is generalizable because if we have patients like that we know it's going to work co so it brings down the inflammation and it and it can help to regrow a little bit of cartilage but this is the first generation of stem cells which are the umbilical core stem cells now we're transitioning over the next six months actually we just licensed it that we just have this technology now it's a second generation of st cells so they're the yamanaka stem cells but specifically for ostearthritis so they're they're the ipsc drived msc's so they're meenal stem cells but they're ipsc derived and they're gene edited to overexpress certain transcription factors to target osteitis so how see how specific the cells are getting is becoming a really cool technology because it's not just like okay stem cells it's like no this is a very specific ipsc derived msc product for osteoarthritis so that's the era we're in now so you can treat muscle tears and damage and tendon tears and damage and you can treat osteoarthritis what other what other conditions do people suffer and come to you for that you you have had success in treating i've had i get a lot of so because of the online world i get patients from all over the world and most of them are chronic complex conditions so a lot of them are like fibromyalgia which is just like chronic pain everywhere there's chronic fatigue syndrome there's people with toxic mold who don't get better there's people with rheumatoid arthritis who just have chronic inflammation and joint pain everywhere and they've tried all the meds inflammatory bowel disease so we're getting a lot of chronic complex conditions and now we're building out a team of specialists so so these are long-term systemic dysfunctions exactly and so it's about restoring your immune system and getting it to be functional again and that's kind of what we can do with the combination of the systemic intravenous stem cells and with the different and different peptide protocols we have and even we're now we're manufacturing and we have our own what are called fal microbial transplant pills fmt pills but basically fmt as you know is to repopulate the good gut bacteria and the gut is where most of your immune system is stored and that so if we can restore the immune system we can treat a lot of chronic diseases even even parkinson's so tell me what you're doing with those with those so we have our own process to manufacture fmt we have a human microbiome is this in canada no mexico in mexico so we have a manufacturing plant there that's where we do stem cell manufa are you are you is that product available already it'll be available in the next few months oh so and so our scientist her name is dr caroline gabis great phd human microbiome specialist and this is her specialty and she has her own proprietary process on how to manufacture these pills select for the donors and give them to patients and the beautiful part about these treatments are only one week long and they can have a huge impact on your body and who who do the feal transplant pills work best for so you can use them for even anti-aging and longevity because in mice fmt has been shown to extend lipan by 30% so i think there's g to be a lot of people who are just going to use it for long and that's a consequence of gut biod proliferation because the gut microbes produce so many different metabolites and help with process so many different cellular processes they're not just that can be used post antibiotic treatment as well right yes and so we're we're going to make so we're going to make one for children as well because a lot of toddlers and a lot of young kids unfortunately get antibiotics like crazy they and there's actually well in in cesarian birth actually is a problem right do you want to explain that yeah because you don't get exposed to the vaginal flora which is the bacteria so i recommend anyone who gets a c-section just take the stuff down there after your baby's born and rub it on their face right and just get them that exposure to the good bacteria so the reason is because that's a good example of just how bloody complex things are who the hell would have ever guessed that a cesarian birth would cause postbirth trouble years later because there there wasn't the proper trip through the vaginal canal man that's unbelievably complicated it is and that's why what but what we got to learn are principles what's the principle of of the human body immune dysfunction is one of the most important principles that governs so many different chronic diseases so if we if we can train your immune system properly at a young age i always say like your immune system is like a teenager if you don't train it properly it's going to misbehave when you're older so now we're learning how to train it properly which means you have to get exposure to certain bacteria you have to be played with pets you have to play with soil you can't be afraid of germs when you're young because that actually leads to more issues older and antibotics much clean cleanliness too much cleanliness and we know that antibiotics for every antibiotic course that children take it increases their risk of autoimmune disease by 1% so it can become accumulative that right yeah and so it become it it was nih research that's interesting because i was chronically treated with antibiotics for recurrent tonsilitis right probably 20 times so and i i i think a pro and and we talked about the beginning of an interview what we did for you i think you have a component of immune dysfunction which is why we're going to be doing these different different cell therapies to get your immune system functioning again and get you out of this chronic pro-inflammatory state now you've also treated depression yeah yeah so let's talk about that a little bit because the first thing people who are watching and listening should understand is that there isn't any such thing as depression there are multiple medical and physical conditions that produce decrement in mood and some of those are lifestyle associated and some of them are a consequence of not having a functional life and some of them are pure consequ quences of physiological mal malfunction so there's a lot of evidence for example that chronic depression is an inflammatory condition and there is evidence as well that part of the reason that ssris work is not directly because of their neurochemical consequences so on serotonin function but because they're actually anti-inflammatory right and there's a big that's statins too by the way oh yeah oh oh so no i don't know that so statins for people who don't know are cholesterol lowering drugs but the reason they actually have an effect on mortality we believe is because they reduce inflammation uhhuh so what's the underlying cause chronic inflammation where does that come from chronic immune dysfunction and where does that come from your gut right well there's a huge overlap too between depression and immunological problems and so okay so what have you done with regard specifically to the treatment of so-called depression so let's come back to the fundamental principles of what causes depression from a cellular level it's neuroin there are some chemical imbalances and then there's a gut brain access you have more serotonin receptors in your gut than you do in your brain right and so it's looking at this from a holistic approach and so for me as an interventional physician what we can do is we can reduce neural inflammation by using intravenous exosomes they cross the blood brain barrier they reduce inflammation in the brain and then we can also help with the nervous system what are symptoms of brain inflammation what how what every neuros if you look at this data out there with if you go to the literature almost every neuropsychiatric disorder is linked to neuroinflammation it's it's hand in hand it's almost kind of like autoimmune conditions and intestinal permeability or leaky gut right you've heard of leaky gut it's i know there's michaela interviewed a psychiatrist at what's the big hospital mlan mlan in boston who's been using dietary manipulations to treat like schizo effective disorder and i think it's very probable that the really catastrophic neuros psychiatric diseases like schizo effective disorder or schizophrenia we're going to find out they have a physiological basis exactly and so we're starting to learn depression to manic depression exactly and so we're starting to learn about those physiological basis and that's what we intervene on so the way we do that is reducing neuroinflammation and that's with exosome treatment primarily intervenous exosomes and then what we do because we know so many mental health disorders are rooted in unresolved emotional trauma and a lot of that comes from do you know paul kti no he's a psychiatrist he wrote a book about this but he talks about how many depressive and anxiety disorders are rooted in this unresolved emotional trauma from childhood and they and sometimes it's in the unconscious mind and they don't even know it and so what we do interventionally based is we actually do something called the stell ganglion block and inject into the vas nerve because the stellic ganglion inates into your sympathetic nervous system and a lot of times your sympathetic nervous system over exactly it's over that's chronic chronic flight exactly and that's also because of that unresolved emotional trauma and then the vegas nerve the vegas nerve is kind of this master nerve regulator of your paras sympathetic nervous system and that's the one that helps you to relax and calm down but a lot of people what that happens in neuros psychiatric disorders is they can't relax they they're just they're just jittery they're just irritable you tell them to relax it's like telling it's like telling an obese person to stop eating to eat less or someone on cocaine exactly it just it's not helpful so it's it's just telling people who are anxious and depressed to relax is is not helpful and so what we do is we're trying to intervene and so what we actually inject directly into the stell gang we inject some called peptides and anesthetic which calms it down and then into the veg nerve we inject peptides and actually some exosomes which help to remodulate the signaling of the vegas nerve so this can have a tra dramatic effect on their nervous system make them more calm make them more resilient and deal with stress better and just make their bodies so you you help with parasympathetic activation exactly and so i have a diagnostic question for you yeah one of the things i noticed when i was practicing as a clinician in concert with phys ians who were prescribing ssris i mean i i had clients who showed like a miraculous response to ssris upon occasion where they would be chronically depressed for months or even for years and they'd start a course of anti-depressants and if they were fortunate their symptoms would remit in like well between three days and a month and it's not supposed to remit that quickly yeah but but there's a neurochemical effect as well as the neurophysiological effect but here's one of the things i noticed i want i want you to tell me what you think about this so as we already discussed there's a lot of different disorders in the depression bin and one of the things i would do with my clients is do an evaluation of their of the dimensions of their life so imagine this are do you have a long-term partner do you have friends do you have a job that you enjoy or that at least is functional and providing for you you know economically are you do you have plans for your education do you take care of yourself physically do you have an alcohol or drug or other like abuse problem etc so multi-dimensional analysis of functionality along all these different well dimensions of life now now and then i'd have a client who had no problem with any of those but was depressed right and those were often people who showed a stellar response to an anti-depressant as opposed to the people who well they didn't have a partner they didn't have any friends they didn't have like their life was just an absolute bloody catastrophe then you could imagine two different forms of depression there's many different forms but two classic forms one would be you're not depressed your life is an absolute shambles and you're miserable because nothing you're doing is working and then there's another person that's like oh no like you work hard you're well educated you have goals you have a partner you love you have friends but your mood is just absolutely disregulated you're worse in the morning something's wrong with those people physiologically so i'm wondering if when you do your diagn notic process if you look at could because i could imagine that there's a subset of people whose lives are in functional order but are suffering dreadfully for whom a physiological intervention like exosomes would work particularly well and those are the ones we're primarily treating yeah okay and okay and so why are those the ones that you're primarily treating is that just the people who end up coming i going to say i think it's just selection by yeah probably probably i think the people who seek me out are generally those type of people un they have the wherewithal to do it exactly unfortunately the people in the other category probably don't even know i exist right because they're just going to their family doctor and they're just that and that's the means that's all they have yeah well of course the case if you have a chronic illness long enough it's going to start to affect your function and all these other dimensions of life too so it's not a clean cut but i often think too that the research literature pertaining to the effectiveness of anti-depressants would be a lot cleaner if the diagnostic categories were set up properly it's like well are you depressed which means that your life is fun but your mood is disregulated or are you just merely suffering the consequences of having an absolutely disregulated life there's no way that a pharmaceutical intervention is going to fix that i mean i did see some of my more seriously affected clients on the behavioral side now and then they'd take an anti-depressant and it would decrease the probability they would commit suicide which isn't nothing and maybe it would help them a little bit garner enough energy to start to improve some of the things they could improve but it it couldn't be a magic bullet because an anti-depressant isn't going to give you a life partner for example no and it for us it's about restoring the cellular processes as much as possible so they have resiliency to deal with the life that's yes yes and that that's why we take this approach and so we were talking earlier and because the intervention that we're doing is so powerful we actually have the canadian military wanting to cover this for their veterans and that was for for specifically which treatment for the vegas nerve and the stell ganglion block the because i'll to it no it's a i me for me it's a minute procedure i've done hundreds of them and it can have such a big impact i'll give you an what do people give an examp so i had i had a special forces operative he has a world record for the longest sniper in the world he's 3.2 kmers which is crazy so he's but he's but he's so he's a high level special force operative in canada his mid-40s really really bad ptsd to a point that he tried every medication tried every psychiatrist psychologist and he was basically told that you can do maid which is been medically assisted su suicide essentially right in canada that's now allowed and oh even recommended it's it's honestly it was heartbreaking because he has four children and the fact that this was the only option that our government is giving to him was really it just made me devastated and so i actually wasn't even into mental i mean i'm a sports do by tr so i this was actually one of my you know one of my friends friends so i so he asked me is there anything i can do and so that's how i started getting into this whole interventional mental health stuff and so that's how i came across the these procedures and i talked to some of my friends in the states and so he came down we did the procedure for him the stell gangon and then the vegas and what do you do to do that exactly so yeah so we use so in the stell gangon we're injecting something called bupivacaine which is an anesthetic and we mix it with certain peptides and what the combination of peptides and sengan do is they suppress that sympathetic overdrive and then the vegas nerve we inject some exosomes and peptides and what that does is it modulates the veg and so you do both of those at the same time at the same time oh yeah and then and then we do usually we try to do dual we do both sides oh yeah and so afterwards he said like he literally said a weight have been lifted off his shoulders and he started crying wow oh yeah it was the most dramatic thing i've ever seen i don't say this happens to every he cry how long yeah 10 15 minutes with his wife was there too and he just said he he was and he he he gave me a coin which they usually don't give to anyone who's not in the military so that was like a huge honor for me and i felt i just felt very privileged to help someone like this it was that fast it was that fast and now he's doing pretty good he's he's back to playing hockey he's play feeling better he's just it just it's it's it's hard to explain because there's so much emotional baggage and unconscious reservoir of these different traumas that are built inside of your body i think they they lock themselves into something like a positive feedback loop e yeah because like what once you get anxious to a certain point every little thing makes you more anxious right and then you can start to become anxious about the anxiety itself and it like i actually think that most of the things that we regard as psychiatric disorders are positive feedback loops that have gone out of control so for example let's say your mood starts to fall and then you isolate right and then you start performing worse at work well obviously if your mood is low and you isolate and you're performing worse at work your mood is going to get lower and then you're going to isolate more and so it loops yeah with with u panic disorder what happens is people get anxious right but then they start to avoid and that makes their anxiety worse and so then they're in a loop and with alcoholism what happens to people is they start to see that if they drink it cures their hangover well that's obviously that's going to generate a positive feedback loop and so many of the things that we see as conditions i think are positive feedback loops that have that are self- sustaining and inspiring so for us creating an intervention that breaks that spiral positive feedback loop yeah yeah yeah so how many people have been treated with this with this particular treatment at this point i've done hundreds including panic attacks for young girls like it's been it's been incredible to see the changes that one intervention can have on people is it for everyone no but there are a lot of people it can help yeah and so how how do you decide who can be help and who like what are your inclusion and exclusion criteria for the treatment i mean the biggest thing is a lot of them if they say yes to have you heard of gabber mate yeah yeah so his like ace you know aces adverse childhood events he has this questionnaire so a lot of them if they're positive to that that's given me an indication that they have some sort of unresolved childhood trauma and almost i would say it's crazy almost 90% of them say yes it's so many of them have these issues that they've just kind of buried in the past and they're dealing with depression or anxiety but they actually have something that triggered that maybe when they were younger so that's a good indication that classic freudian analysis yes so that to me is a big indication that this these treatments will work and for a lot of people who just have anxiety it can be very helpful too so like panic attacks or low stress resilience and day-to-day irritability then that's an indication where they just need you ever do personality assessment on your clients well here's something this would be a very good thing to do on the research end of things is that before before you do your intervention have them do a big five personality inventory and then have them do it 6 months later and see if you get decreases in trait neuroticism right yeah right because if you did that would be absolutely fascinating if you could actually we are going to start a trial so i will include that because you bet use the big five aspect scale because it gives you more differentiated analysis but if you could show that you could decrease trait neuroticism with a physiological treatment like that that would be a major that would be a major discovery yeah no i think that's great so what we're that's a resilience measure essentially right an emotional resilience and i get that feedback all the time my patients say that i have more resiliency what used to stress them out doesn't stress them out anymore and so i see that anecdotally so it'd be great to quantify that absolutely well and it would be quite the miracle if you could produce a transformation in a in a personality trait because neuroticism is actually very stable right right and so and very difficult well difficult to amarate goes along with stable but you know there is there is there are other indications that such things are possible so for example a single dose of psilocybin that produces a mystical experience produces i believe it's a half standard no it's a one standard deviation increase in trade openness a year later that's permanent exactly right one standard deviation we you just well you just took the words out of my mouth because i was going to say we call this procedure the vshot the vegas nerf shot and basically we combine it with psilocybin assisted therapy a macro do and so that combination is so power ful to kind of reset their which do you do first we usually do this first and then send them off to therapy afterwards this the cybin therapy no we do our injection first calm down the nervous system and then afterwards they go off to therapy and do cocy yeah so they do the they do the the physiological intervention that decreases stress reactivity first right so that would also increase the probability that the experience they have with a hallucinogenic would be positive because their nervous systems are calmed down right because set matters right so if you're in an anxious state and you take a hallucinogenic the probability that that state will be magnified into something approximating a bad trip is very high yeah and so we wanted we're going to start a hopefully a phase one trial sometime next year for this intervention so we can actually get some real data behind it yeah yeah use the big five use the big five right that's great that's really powerful because if you get big five aspect scale right no that makes perfect sense yeah yeah well that would be really remarkable if you could manage that all right so you and what sort of what sort of effects have you seen with the people that you've treated for depression so you talked about anxiety more specifically so yeah no depression i think i think the big thing with that is combining it with that some sort of psilocybin or some sort of psychedelic assisted therapy and the combination of that with everything else that we do has been great and so it can help people who are even like i like that veteran i was saying who was ptsd who was suicidal and it it shifted him from not being suicidal anymore to basically not being suicidal he was just it actually changed his life and it's been super impactful on people like that but but he's also the right candidate because he has severe ptsd and because of that ptsd and he has a life and he has a life he has a wife he has kids he has all that other stuff so it may not be for everyone but i think there are a lot of people who fall into that category where they have this trauma and they have these issues that they haven't dealt with and they need this intervention can actually make a big difference on their life and how do you protect yourself against over like you know people say anecdotes are not data and that always bothers me because anecdotes might not be data but they are they are definitely hypotheses yes right so but how do you protect yourself against overinterpreting the positive consequences of your interventions as a consequence of this plethora of anecdotal information that you are receiving i mean for me it's all about getting the patient it's all about clinical outcomes as a doctor my job is to improve my patients health or quality of life and to at the end of the day if they're feeling better and they're getting then they tell me that that to me is what matters the most and the way i achieve that often is multimodal meaning that you have to use multiple interventions and the problem with traditional randomized control trials is they only want to look at really one intervention for one that's not how the body always works well it's also a it's also a conflict with the immediate necessity of medical treatment right because it's lovely if you can just change one thing but if you're dealing with people who are absolutely bloody desperate you're going to be tempted to throw you know everything and and the kitchen sink out them and that's the reality of the patients i see they're refractory to the traditional medical system so they're looking for alternatives so it's not it's not often just one intervention i often have to do multiple things to get them better and that's why the trials we're going to be doing are going to be we multimodal we're going to have multiple things that we're using to intervene and when you say trials like are these actual research trials clinical trials yeah so for example we already we're starting a clinical trial for ph a phase two trial for a gene therapy which we haven't talked about yet but but basically we're going to be looking at it's called fosta and gene therapy so it's basically the world's first reversible plasma gene therapy so traditionally viral vectors were used for introducing a foreign gene into your body but what we've developed is a plasmid which is just a circular strand of dna it comes from eoli but there's no actual live bacteria in there and the plasmid the beautiful part about the plasmid is is it can target any protein or peptide up to 10,000 base pairs with 100% accuracy and it's what do you mean by target what does it do exactly so meaning it can tell your body to whatever gene of interest to produce more of that so for example whatever gene of interest yes oh yeah that's promising yes it's very promising and it's it's what's called an episomal vector so it's non-integrating so it's not going to go into your genome and make you like translocate or have those risks that viruses may have and it's also because it's not a virus you don't have to take amuno supressant it's not immunogenic so there's all these cool benefits to it so so is it temporary it lasts and that's the beautiful part it's it's reversible because it's eoli origin so you can take a tetrac cycling if you want it out of your body so it has that safety mechanism and it last for about one and a half to two years so so you can repeat it as needed whereas vile vectors you cannot repeat them once you do them you do them and you can't really get them out of your body so so this technology is really beautiful and we did our phase one already so we're doing our phase two targeting what conditions so sarcopenia because and what is that that's a loss of muscle as you get older which is which is which is probably the biggest driver of aging because as you lose muscle your body to protect itself and regulate your immune system and vitality goes down you become frail and that frailty we know is such a big predictor of mortality and this falls falls and even in covid studies they found that people who had more muscle mass had better el well you know one of the best predictors of lifespan is grip strength exactly yeah yeah which is quite remarkable a proxy right and yeah it's a proxy for muscular integ integrity essentially yeah and so if you look at it if we can preserve muscle that can be one of the best ways to have that's a huge deal exactly so fat so fallatin is a peptide that's naturally made in your body and as you get older your fallatin levels decrease and so what we're doing is we're just delivering this through a gene therapy form the plasma vector and it increases your f statin levels for one and a half to two years and it's completely reversible if you want to have your body for whatever reason and it wears off on its own well what happens if you increase fallatin levels so it inhibits myostatin which is kind of the enzyme sets a limit on how much muscle you can put on so it makes it easier for your body to put on muscle it also increases why does it decrease with age because the aging process is cruel and so so many different peptides as you so you think it's just a consequent another element of degeneration exactly degeneration exactly and so entropy yeah and so if we can restore it back to your levels your youthful levels not only will you inhibit mil stattin which makes it easier for your body to put on muscle it'll also activate what's called foxo3 pathway which reduces systemic inflammation so it has this and so we showed in our phase one trial that patients over the age of 60 on average reduce their intrinsic biological age by 12 years which is actually incredible wow that's 60 yeah and there was actually some hyperresponders who had biological age reduction of access of 60 years which is crazy to believe so does that mean they're going to leave 60 years longer we don't know that yet but they're tell probably not probably multiple dimensions but still but but they t themir length which is a proxy we also set a world record for that as well you show tel l increase as well in that patient who was a hyper responder and so we're actually applying w yeah so it's pretty powerful it's it's as another animal studies that have been done with thisat and gene therapy has been around for a while in animal studies what's it showed with animals similar 30% 32% life extension in in mice but actual life extension not just the markers no exactly life extension wow and so when people fast i mean i know animals that that are are starved to like 75% of their body weight they'll live 40% longer something like that does that have anything to do with with yeah because it activates similar pathways which are anti-inflammatory pathways regenerate pathways pathways that help with cell your sines like all the hallmarks of aging that we talked about so whenever you think about any intervention think about how is it affecting the hallmarks of aging so now we have an understanding of biology because in physics we always had first principles right the like newton's laws like we understood first principles right in biology we never had first principles until recently now we understand there are what are called fundal principles chronic disease and cellular are those associated with those 10 for agent exactly those 10 hallmarks govern so that gets you to that gives you a foundation on how to interpret data and how to figure out if an intervention is actually going to do something for you and so and where are you with this trial so the phase two trial is going to start in spring 2024 in canada we have tentative approval we're just getting the funding together to start it and so this phase two trial is to look at fall stat and gene therapy is going to be randomized control tr with the placebo group and and basically to look at sarcopenia osteopenia and then different inflammatory markers how old are your cl your have anyone from age it's going to be open to age from 30 to 80 so really interesting to see what it does with people who are particularly old yeah exactly and that's where it's the most powerful but even in i mean younger people don't need it as much but a lot of them just do it for the gym like i've done it on myself just for the benefits of more energy more strength in the gym because obviously by inhibiting my statin it gives you more there to date there hasn't been any adverse effects so wow that's that's the beauty yeah it's been study for over hard to believe i know it's been study for over six years and we haven't seen any adverse effects to add some credibility to it we are backed by peter theel and sam alman those are our two seed investors and they're both well-known names in in the world and and i think the reason they they backed us is because they understand that this has a potential to revolutionize a lot of gen thies because if you think about it the only other real big gene therapy competitor is crisper right and crisper but the problem with crisper it's yes it's more powerful than minicircle our technology but it also has off-site targets so meaning it may hit it may do something that's unintended so and that's the risk with crisper whereas with the minicircle vector it's not as powerful but it's going to whatever vector that we want to do it's going to do that with accuracy and that's the be that's the beauty of this plasma vector technology h well that's ridiculously exciting it is so i wanted to also ask ask you about let me see i just check my notes here too yeah tissue engineering so we are talking about earlier can we regrow cartilage for example in osteitis so with the first generation no the second generation what we can do now is we can combine those ipsc ms's that we're talking about they're engineered specifically for ostearthritis and then we can use a 3d bio printer and we can embed them into a scaffolding basically a scaffold and then you can implant those arthoscopic and then that can regrow new cartilage uhuh scaffold the scaffold with the embedded stem cells so that's called oh that's the intersection of gene therapy cell therapy and is that specific is that specifically for carage or can you do that with other organs no you could do then that's that's the promise of it right this is just the beginning of tissue and how far is that advanced and are you doing specifically so for cartilage there's already trials being done is dr farad galak in university of washington he's already been done doing trials in humans with with the similar technology and then so we're we're just starting to do our own trials with that this year and who's we the regenerative medicine community okay i see i see but but you also you have people that you're working with who are involved in these specific trials yes i have my own group and we have our own company and we have our own researchers and scientists we're working with and where's that company located so we have our minicircle technology company that's in austin texas that's in austin and then we also do research in mexico why in mexico because so you can do phase one trials a lot quicker offshore yeah and then you can get the approvals and move things along quickly and then we can move onshore for the phase two so that's kind of our strategy that's kind of our strategy because if you just go through traditional health canon fda it's going to take 10 to 15 years to get anything done yeah yeah that'll just kill you exactly so we figured out kind of a disruptive model where we can do phase ones quickly get our trials done collect our patients collect our data show our safety risks in that are there risks in that in doing it that quickly do you think i mean the science the technology we're using already has really good basic science behind it and has lots of animal data so there's already safety data there to and we're not doing it without unreasonable justification so there is mechanistic basis for what we're doing as as well as good safety data on animals so the next logical step is put it in humans someone has to do it so it's and that was the same thing with the plasma technology it was just we were the first ones to do it in humans it was done in animals for a long time but then we were the first ones to take it into humans when did when did that start to happen about six years ago wow that's years yeah it took six years of r&d to get it into commercial product but now we have our first commercial product and we're doing phase two but we're also offering the fall stat and gene therapy and approved regions like mexico prosper dubai we have approvals in certain areas or we can do it so do you enjoy the business side because it sounds like you do i enjoy helping people and creating scalable technologies allows me to help more people and that's really what well fair enough but that you know that's the intelligent integration of the business vision into the into the medical practices right is if you set up an organization properly then you can move faster you can do more things and you can scale exactly i can only help so many people one-on-one as a but if i create technologies and do trials that are large scale eventually we can help millions of people the the dream is imagine you go to your family doctor let's say 20 years from now and you get these gene therapies you get these cell therapies and you keep every two years and keeps you healthy and you never get sick that's that's the world i want to see yeah yeah where we just eradicate chronic disease now you're going to treat me for something tomorrow as i understand so exactly what are you planning to do to me well as you have talked about publicly you have toxic mold you've been exposed to it right and i think in florida that's the theory yeah that's the theory and so what happens with toxic mold is it kind of hijacks your immune system and makes it difficult for your immune system to function properly and so what we did for you the first time was we did intervenous stem cells which is to help your body to build some resiliency and to right and that was different than the ex tammy did that as well but she also did the exosome treat yes yeah because your your your problems more systemic and so what we're going to do now is we're going to do what called intervenous natural killer cells and natural killer cells as we talked about earlier are the cells in your innate immune system that can kill chronic it can kill cancer it can kill chronic fungal infections which is kind of what happens with mold so it's basically giving your body the what do you make of that sick building syndrome literature i think it's very underappreciated because a lot of physicians don't test for mold and they have a lot of patients with chronic illnesses that well the literature is horrifying you know i mean i was reading about the state of military accommodations across the united states and the unbelievably high levels of mold toxicity that military personnel are exposed to it's absolutely horrifying in fact you can't read it i guess it's about as bad as the discovery that asbest was causing cancer i mean asbest was used everywhere all of a sudden it was like oh oh we're killing people like lead in gas i mean these things have happened and there's a new theory on cancer it's called cell suppression theory which and now is getting a lot of traction is basically that the idea that fungal spores are hijacking the cell and preventing cell opap toos so they're preventing the cell from functioning properly so then they're saying that the root cause of cancer is actually potentially fungal infections in addition to everything else that happens with omic instability but but this is one of the potential risk factors because we get expos we all get exposed to funguses all the time it's part of living in water environment most people's immune system can deal with it but some people's immune system can't well especially if they're in a place where they're being chronically exposed to levels that they can't actually tolerate exactly so how do we build a resiliency in your body so you can deal with those fungal infections we give you the cells to do that and that's what the natural killer cells are going to do and eventually we' probably give you the fmt as well so we can give you your fmt is the fom microbial transplant because then your body again we're strengthening your immune system and building resiliency for you to deal with these chronic infections in your body so it's all comes back to first principles and that's the biggest i think takeaway for people to understand is biology is moving at this point at this alarming pace almost where we're where we're understanding down to a single cell function how cells can operate and target those in make very specific targeted int to take this pill and hopefully hopefully doesn't hopefully disase doesn't right right okay so if people are interested in the listeners are interested in following up with such things learning more about it what should they do i think scientists are the best people to learn from unfortunately online a lot of the people who are the loudest aren't usually academic scientists because they just don't get a lot of attention so my favorite podcast on these topics if you're interested they're very dense but there's one called called the stem cell podcast and there's one called the immunology podcast and there are academic scientists who are top tier who go bring on different scientists on their show and they talk about these different topics and that's where i learned from and i i think that's where you have to go to you have to go to scientists who are doing their hard work to make this a possibility for patients to get access to one day and i talk about it a lot online i try to take that information and disseminate it in a way where people can understand it right because it is complicated and there is a lot moving at a fast pace and so my job as a clinician scientist is to take that information and simplify it and make it digestible so people can access it and hopefully give them hope that there is a brighter future of medicine ahead of them right all right well that's unless you have something else you'd like to tell people who are watching and listening that's probably not a bad place to close off is there something that you wanted to cover that we didn't discuss yet i i i like to tell the world that we're in the world of medicine 4.0 yeah and so medicine 4.0 is essentially using cell and gene therapy that's targeted to allow for more longevity which means a broader lifespan and health span where you can do what you want and live a high quality life so instead of just saying exercise eat well we can use these gene therapies like fallatin to allow your body to get all these benefits even if you're not exercising of longevity and that's where the era of medicine we're headed towards and that's what we want to really share with the world h okay well thank you very much for all the information that we walked through today that was much appreciated and very enjoyable and to everybody watching and listening thank you very much for your time and attention i'm going to talk to dr khan for another half an hour on the dailywire plus platform i think we'll go over well some of the topics that we've gone over already but i want to also as i usually do on that platform delve into the development of his interests and and so we'll go a little further down that road and if you want to join us there please feel please feel welcome to do so otherwise hopefully you'll tune in again in the relatively near future and thank you to the dailywire plus folks for making these conversations possible thanks again sir all right thank you you bet you [music] bet
