ant group is one of the biggest private companies in the world and it was about to go public in a dazzling record-setting debut until it couldn't and then suddenly things went very wrong very fast there have been a lot of news that the ant ipo would be delayed for over a year which goes to say a whole lot about the level reforms that the government thinks the company needs the key regulation has to do with ant's super profitable micro lending platform the way it's set up right now it mints money china is about to chop it down to size so let's talk a little bit about this product but first i want to talk a little bit about the asian arbitrary email newsletter it's a new thing that i've been working on and rather than doing another boring ad read i'm just going to talk a little bit about something that one of the letters that i'm working on right now tell you so you can start looking forward to it for a future newsletter soon to come out i'm going to go back to one of my most popular videos the haka explained and i'm working on right now sprinkling in a few more interesting other things that i was not managing to be able to fit in last time right now i'm trying to decide if i want to add more about the taiping rebellion or about their cuisine or about their migration to malaysia and thailand all the other parts of southeast asia that's a really exciting one the really interesting one i'm looking forward to sharing that with you guys so yeah i hope you'll find it worth subscribing and i'll hope to try to make it worth your while you can expect a newsletter every four days at 1am taiwan time so much thanks in its ipo documents and group organizes its business lines into four categories digital payments credit investment and insurance digital payments is the alipay stuff it processes payments between buyers and sellers kind of like paypal credittech is the credit business and the focus of this discussion in the ipo documents is described as our credit taxes address the unmet credit demands of unserved and underserved consumers and small businesses in china we openly collaborate with our partner financial institutions through our technology platform we originate loans which are then independently underwritten by our partner financial institutions as of june 30th 2020 we worked with approximately 100 partner banks we generate technology service fees from our partners financial institutions that are based on the credit balance originated through our platform our approach is not to use our own balance sheet or provide guarantees this segment also happens to be anne's flagship money machine it grew 59 in the first six months of 2020 and it now contributes some forty percent of ant's revenues it's likely quite profitable the key consumer product behind this credit tech platform is a service called hwape which is literally translated as just spend there's another one called jebe which is similar but i'm going to focus on hua bae huape is called a micro loan product but from the perspective of the consumer it acts like a credit card huawei targets young internet savvy users who buy things using alipay users who choose huawei to make a purchase inside alipay set it as their default so yeah it is a lot like a credit card we can talk about the interest fees huawei's first month 40 days actually interest is free then after that the interest rate goes up to 0.05 a day a day so every day you carry a balance on this thing it adds another 0.05 percent you can pay that back monthly or in installments if you pay back your loans then its smart machine learning algorithm decides that you are a credit worthy customer and steadily raises your limit and also makes money from merchants who pay a processing fee 0.8 to 1 percent of the transaction to be featured within the huape system presumably the convenience of offering juape means that consumers are more likely to buy from you ant does not make money from the loan or the loans interest like as its prospectus says ant does not lend its own money it's lending the money from its partner banks there are over a hundred such banks and also makes fees securitizing and selling those loans to investors kind of like with the subprime mortgage thing yeah it's not that much i think it's about 10 this way and presumably does not take on the credit risk of the loans that it makes partnering with the banks also subtly co-ops resistance from the financial industry by cutting them in into a piece of business flow so just what really is this thing if the above sounds a bit familiar to you then you're not far off if you phrase it in the way i just did huabei acts kind of like visa or mastercard these and mastercard are payment networks that help facilitate online and convenience payments they do not issue the loans themselves those are done by the bank issuing the card so jpmorgan chase for my for my chase card these and mastercard provide only a network that connects buyers and merchants and for the convenience of facilitating the transaction they take a one to two percent fee if you believe that huawei is visa and mastercard then it would be an amazing business visa inc is a 450 billion dollar company that company makes 23 billion dollars a year in revenue and over half of that revenue falls right to the bottom line as net profit that's fantastically profitable furthermore visa does not take on the loan default risk from transactions on its network but at the same time there's a lot of things about huape that differentiate it from just a simple payments platform for one thing huabay is so closely tied to the alipay and alibaba ecosystem the app pushes the huawei product very aggressively they regularly run promotions for it for example they randomly give away 50 cents free to a customer if they make huape their default payment system taobao is the dominant e-commerce site in china kind of like it's amazon if you want to make a purchase in taobao huabay is there to help you taobao will give you a small discount small as 50 cents maybe or offer installment methods to use wape to check out do so and then huawei becomes the default rather than the normal digital cash balance on your app the alipay app which everyone uses i don't think visa has a mobile app that people use on a regular basis for payments paypal maybe venmo cash app maybe but visa also does not issue your credit card that is also a debit card and then makes the credit card the default every time you swipe at walmart and as many people know defaults are powerful once huawei is the default it sits on top of all of a customer's purchases it is then that you start getting the horror stories about ordinary chinese people finding themselves locked in a cycle of never-ending credit card debt regardless of whether they're chinese or american credit card debt can happen to anyone probably worse for chinese since there are millions of people out there who had never grown up with something as convenient as a credit card in addition there is something to be said about the credit business's sheer size and the systemic financial risk posed by that side the ipo documents say that the average outstanding bounds as of june 30th 2020 is just 295 or 2000 rmb but china is all about scale and alipay has some 700 million users huawei is specifically used by 400 million people and by itself is the source of some 10 of all loans generated by china's financial system its loan volume in the first half of 2020 was over 1.7 trillion r b which makes it far larger than any one bank including any of the chinese big four not to mention that these loans are going to act almost all the same since they have been all approved using the same algorithm think about the credit rating agencies before the global financial crisis all of this is a little worrying when you combine a general public unfamiliar with how debt works with a massive organization heavily incentivized to make as many loans as possible you got a recipe for financial disaster and so aggressively pushes hua bae because alipay otherwise does not seem to make money the independent business magazine kai sheen recently reported that ant's payment business the segment that kicked off alipay in the first place does not make money and is probably in the red it used to be the company's cash machine but then 10 cents started wechat pay and that kicked off a massive battle between the two tech titans huge subsidies and technology product costs were incurred to gain an advantage then in 2017 the government regulated that bank payments need to be routed to a government clearing system this basically turned the business into a low margin grind kind of like how it is in the u.s the chinese government apparently did this as part of their clampdown on capital flight around that period of time with their old transactions business pinched off alipay apparently decided to build a payment card network like visa and mastercard but a card network is hard to build and china already has one called union pay union pay is no longer a monopoly but it took a max of visa and mastercard half a decade to get a china license for their network and the process is still not done yet alipay did not have the patience for that so they created their own private credit card network and let it grow to immense size without virtually any oversight that's what they did wrong is it really financial innovation if it's just the same thing over again but worse and not working as well and for the potential disaster i think that's the side the chinese regulators are taking right now all right everyone have a good evening take care of yourselves bye
