- i am going to uber people,
but at the end of the ride, let them keep the car. we literally have a lamborghini, and i'm going to give it away. you want to watch this video. i'm about to turn on uber
and whoever we pick up first is literally getting a free car. i better get five stars. - ooh.
- two minutes away. get out, get out, get out. - to the van. we are watching jimmy on the big screen. we got a surveillance bus, - and we're gonna watch
him give away a car. - low-key, i'm freaking out a bit. i see the guy waiting on the corner, and i don't think he
realizes i'm over here. please don't cancel the ride. i'm trying to give you a car. bryce? right here. - hook, line and sinker. we got bryce. - how's it going?
- good, how are you? - this is actually my
first ever uber ride. - i wonder if this guy's noticed
just this massive black van 10 feet behind him this whole time. - i've missed a turn like four times. - is this really your first trip? - yeah, no, this is
literally the first time i've ever ubered anyone. if you had to choose, who would you say your
favorite youtubers are? - i don't know. it's pretty, there's a
lot, you know what i mean? - yeah. i know there are,
there are quite a bit. have you ever made videos? - one day maybe. - hey, you should go for it. - jimmy literally doesn't know how to talk about anything
other than youtube. - figured out who you remind me of. - who? - it's a little hard with
the mask but, mr. beast? - oh no, the kid knows. - yes, i am mr. beast. can you give me five stars? - he said, make sure you rate five stars. - well then, here, you can have the car - actually?
- yeah. - like, for real?
- yeah. are you crying? - nah. nah, i'm good. my car broke down recently, so ... - all right. well, perfect timing. so, here, come hop in the front seat. hey, there's the squad. - congrats! - you like it? - yeah, i love it, bro. - well, if have you
didn't believe it before, now you have five cameras pointed at you, so you probably do now. congratulations, bryce,
on your brand new car. - thank you so much. - i'm gonna go hop in the black
van and give away more cars. since my first passenger recognized me, i decided to get a disguise. i'm gonna head to pick
up my next passenger. hopefully they don't recognize me. hey, are you ed?
- yeah. - yeah, hop on in. how are you guys doing? - good.
- good. - i like your mustache. - thank you. sorry, i'm new to uber. this is actually literally my third drive. - how you liking it? - good. so far i've made 20 bucks. - hey, that's, a bag is a bag. a bag is a bag. - jimmy, you have to figure out which one of these people's
getting a car, dude. - oh, we went to the salvation army. not the, the goodwill store. - oh.
- oh. - it should be right up here. so you didn't mean to put this address in? - no, i did mean to put this address in, i think it messed up. so you guys gotta drive somewhere else? - yeah. so i'm just
gonna call another uber. - no, no, that's fine here. actually, how about you
guys just take the car where you need to go? - are you serious? - you guys got it. don't worry about it. all right. have a nice day.
- all right. - i literally gave them the keys, and just walked away. they were so confused. what's up, boys? we actually have a problem, because i'm doing a video
where i uber people, let them keep the car. but there's three of you. what should we have them
do to compete for the car? - the only thing i can
really think of is a race. yeah, he's gonna dust us. - oh, is he? you run track?
- yeah. - oh, gosh. gentlemen, you are about to
race for this car right here. dead serious. whoever touches that wooden box and then this car first, gets to keep it. - 3, 2, 1, go. - all right. oh, he got a head start. oh my gosh. oh, he's break away, oh my gosh. he's break away. oh no.
- gimme the sentra, gimme the sentra. - there you go. congratulations on your brand new car. - yo, thank you. - no problem, man. - thank you. thank you very much. i appreciate it. that's so exciting, man. thank you guys so much. - yeah.
- thank you. - all right, we're gonna
go give away more cars. - what do i do with this one? - you just drive it. it's yours. - i'm with that. i'm with that. this just makes it so much
easier for me and my parents. i'm honestly, probably about
just give this to my mom 'cause she deserves it for sure. this is definitely gonna help a lot. - carl's about to do his
first ride as an uber driver. are you excited? - no, i just got one. i just got one. - oh, really? - on a scale of 1 to 10,
carl, how nervous are you? - 27. - carl, it's not that bad. you're just gonna pick up a random person. we're just gonna have
you do a bunch of cringey and embarrassing things in
front of 20 million viewers. - okay. - if he asks why you
have so many lights on, tell him it's because
you're afraid of the dark. - hello? i'm carl. - hey, no problem, man. - we've all been there. - i was trying to get into that
man's car when he pulled up. - oh, no. - carl now has the passenger in his car. things are about to get fun. every time you pass a light, i want you to bark and punch the roof. carl, you're at a light - bark. - i'll let that one slide this time. but next time i want a better bark. - bark.
- there we go, there we go. imagine being that guy in the back seat, just how awkward it must be right now. i hate to do this to you
buddy, but i need a hee-haa. - hee-haa. - (indistinct) crazy. - hee-haa! - oh my gosh, carl just hee-haa'd. - carl, on a scale of 1 to 10, how much do you hate me right now? - yeah, about a 10. - i would feel bad, but
we're giving the man a car, - yeah.
- so it's fine. when you get to the destination, tell the guy that you liked him so much that you're giving him your car. clap if you heard that. now it's time for the big moment, carl, give away the car. - here we go. - you've been my favorite
passenger so much. you just keep the car,
obviously i'm bad at ubering. - yo, you got me home. you're good. - i do wanna keep the lights, okay? - i'm pretty sure you -- - you can keep the lights actually. this whole thing has been
for a video, i promise. i'm not weird. - we run a channel named mr. beast, and we like to give away stuff, and so, - are you serious, dude?
- oh, yeah. it's your car now. - get outta here! i just, i'm speechless
to be honest with you. thanks for freaking me
out and weirding me out. i guess it was worth the car. - so you would say tonight's one of the best nights of your life? - yeah. yeah. - awesome. let's go give away more cars. i can't believe later in this video, we're gonna uber someone
with the lamborghini and give it away. imagine you called an uber, and then they gave you a lamborghini. what we just did to
carl was pretty brutal. and now it's chandler's turn. - no.
- don't punch me. - payback's gonna be sweet. - hey, michael, is that you? all right. cool. - chandler now has his
passenger in the car. wait, wait. we're at light, you gotta
punch the roof and meow. - we're at a light. you gotta do it. - meow. - chandler, you're about
to go pasta the light. - meow. - this is literally better than any tv show in my entire life. - meow. - what is that, though? - what is what? - when you do like that? - all right, chandler. are
you ready to give away a car? - thanks. i appreciate it.
- you can stop right here. - all right. by the way, man, i don't want this car. do you want it? no, no, no, ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chill. i'm cool. wait? so you're not an uber driver? - well, yeah, just for that one. i'll probably quit now. - we're filming up a video where we're ubering random
people giving them a car. and since we just ubered
you, you get to keep the car. - are you serious? you giving me a free car right now? - the whole time telling
me what to say, dude. i'm so sorry. - no, it's cool bro. it's cool, bro. - yeah, it's cool because
you just got a brand new car. - i'm blessed. like, man, you don't even
know. i walk to work. - really?
- yeah. - if anybody deserves this, this is him. my god. - this is the best day of my life. i'm overwhelmed with joy. - oh my goodness.
- thank you. - i'm so happy.
- thank you so much. - so far, we've ubered
five different people and we've made $59.94 so far. some people drive for
uber as a full-time job. and after you pay for gas and everything this would be pretty hard to live off of. so i'm gonna tip an uber driver, a car. confirm pickup. our uber driver is' minutes away. - oh. - oh, i think this is him. - how's it going? we're actually filming a video, and we wanted to give you something. basically, today was my first day ubering and i realized just how hard it is, so i wanted to give you a present. i want to give you this car for free. - oh, come on, man. don't make a joke. - no, it's not a joke. that's your brand new car. - are you sure? - like i said, i've been
uber driving all day, and it's a lot of work, dude. - i really appreciate it, man. i really have to, i don't know how can i express
my feeling towards this. - congrats on the brand new car. i'll see you guys tomorrow. do you know why i crammed
you guys in this car? - nope. - it's because tyler
cracked the windshield. oh, what are you doing? which means we should punish him. i had carl go to the party store and pick out the weirdest
costumes he could find. hand me more stuff. put on this wig. now that you have your disguise on, we're gonna go to the van and torture you. tyler, we are now in the van. are you ready? you look ridiculous. - i would never get in
a car if i saw this. oh crap. did you actually just mess up another car? - i'm actually shaking. oh, got a guy. i got a guy. - go, go. - i just saw myself in the mirror. i look so creepy. you michael?
- yes, sir. - sweet. i'm your uber, man. how you doing, man?
- all right. how you doing? - who wants to kick us off? all right. - do you like bananas? - do you like bananas? - yeah. i like bananas. - look at tyler's face, he's glistening. - get through the green light, and go, "boom, shakka, lakka,
green light. let's go." - boom, shakka, lakka,
green light. let's go. - how about another boom
shakka lakka at the next light? - boom, shakka, lakka, let's go. another green light. - i love what he looks
up and he's just like, - huh? - all right before you go,
real quick, real quick. i have these keys and i kind of want to
just give 'em to you. - man, you acting crazy. - no, no, i'm not acting crazy. - spill the beans, tyler.
tell him it's a show. - all right. i'll be honest with you. yeah, it's actually a youtube channel. that's jimmy. that's chan chan. - what's up, jimmy?
- not much. so have you ever seen the
channel mr. beast before? - no. i ain't never seen mr. beast. - we're filming a video
where we uber random people, let them keep the car. - what? - and since we just ubered you, you get to keep the car. oops.
- you lie, man. - no, that's your car. i'm serious. - this is crazy, bro. i got a new car, man. - yeah. this is all you. we'll give you $1,000
to fix the windshield. that was not on purpose. - the best day of my life, man. besides me getting married. i can't say that, you know, but, - aw.
- man, mr. beast, y'all the best, man.
- aw. - i really wanna appreciate, y'all. i really wanna thank y'all, man - because of you guys watching the videos we're able to help people like him and i'm glad you like the car. - that was the most awkward thing i've ever done in my life. we've given away a lot of
cars today, wouldn't you say? - yes. i would say. - well, we have this lamborghini and we will uber someone random and let them keep the lamborghini. - that's insane. - but before we do that, we gotta give away these three cars and whoever gives away their car first, i will give their mom $10,000. go! - get out the way, carl. - oh gosh.
- oh wow. - let me get my seatbelt on. did they even put their seat belts on? - mom, you're about to win $10,000. - i took a bunch of jimmy's apple products that i'm going give these people. - hold on, hold on. sir, do you want a car? you want this car?
- oh my god. is he about to already give it away? - it's literally a free car. - he's a psycho, don't listen to him! - literally take it. i swear on my life, just -- - no, no, hey take our car. - it's just free. all right, give up on it.
he doesn't want the car. - you want a free car? we're giving away a free car. i promise. all right, well. - i'm at literally some
intersection right now. it's a free car. that car, it's free. i promise you. - i'm trying to give away a car. if you guys need proof that
i'm gonna give you guys stuff. here's an ipad. you're gonna pass? - yeah.
- oh no. okay. come on, please. - i have a free car. it's free. i know you don't believe me. do you know who mr. beast is? - sir? do you want a free car? you don't want a free car? all right. - it's free. it's literally free. just stop. - i'm trying to give away a
car faster than my friends. - i'm all right. - you're all right?
- yeah. - i just don't understand. hi. no? oh! - please, you want it? you want it? - yeah.
- it's all yours. it's all yours. it's all yours. i don't know how to be weird about it. i got it, i got it. i gave one away. - but tyler, you've
already given away a car? - yeah. 20 seconds ago. - chandler hasn't given away one yet. neither has carl. - let's go. my mom is out of a job.
she's gonna be so happy. mom, you just won $10,000 thanks to this gentleman right here. - glad i could help you win 10,000. - the moment you've all been waiting for. i'm giving away this lamborghini. and i'm gonna start
looking for passengers now. go. - a few moments later. - oh, we gotta hit. - all right, we got a hit. - our passenger's a live show. let's do this. can't believe i'm about
to give this lamborghini to someone who called an uber. - free lambo, free lambo. - it's honestly terrifying
driving this car. it is so fast. - this is like watching a
youtube video, but live. - hey, did you call the uber? hop on in. where are we going? - to my job. - okay. where do you work? hey, what? why are you driving this in an uber? - i don't, actually, put your seatbelt on. - yes, sir. yes, sir. - okay, let's start it. - how old are you? - i'm 22. - you're only 22? - yep. i do this on
the side to make money. - this is like kind of surreal, man. - just riding in a lamborghini? - yeah.
- well, sir, if you owned a lamborghini,
how would that make you feel? - definitely wouldn't drive uber. - i'll go ahead and spill the beans. have you ever seen the channel mr. beast? - i knew it, dude. i just watched your video yesterday that you put out you gave
your 40 million subscribers, - 40 cars. well, i guess you
can see where this is going. - oh my god. - when i drop you off, this will actually officially
be your lamborghini. - are you serious? you're, you're lying. - nope. - no way, man. - i was supposed to wait
till the end of the ride, but seeing you freak out,
i didn't even wanna wait. how tall are you? - i'm very short. i'm 5'8". - perfect. - jimmy told him so early, that now he's like gotta
sit there in the car and just wait to win it. - there's a lot of accidents up here, man. so be careful with my car, all right. - okay.
- oh my goodness. - dude, this is insane. there's the squad. there's the camera. like i said, this is your lamborghini. let me open the door for you, sir. - holy crap.
