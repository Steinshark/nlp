so hello everybody i am here with robert breedlove robert was suggested to me on twitter i kind of asked a question who people thought i should talk to in terms of crypto and his name kind of came up on top he is the host of the the what is money show that tries to explain this bitcoin to stuff he has a pass in finance and in crypto and so it seems like he's the guy to go to and he he's already told me that he thinks that there are ways to think about this and to understand understand this in a symbolic way with a symbolic lens so i'm really looking forward to finally diving into bitcoin and crypto with him thanks jonathan glad to be here oh it's my it's great to meet you and i'm really looking forward because i have like let me just say at the outset which is that i have a i have a kind of a suspicion about bitcoin and i can't explain i can't totally explain it and it probably has to do with my experience which i kind of related off-camera before a little bit with you which is that i was involved i wasn't involved someone that i trust and that i respect set me up with with a crypto account which was called steams like this attention coin and you know then you kept telling me you need to you need to make sure you've got a whatever it's called an account where you like an exchange it got a wallet account and i didn't know what he was talking about so i just kind of followed the steps set this thing up on quadringa and then i lost everything within a day which because the ceo died we're not even sure some people think he pretended to die so all the money just vanished and what's been interesting is actually i didn't really get involved in the proceeds of that but i started getting emails from lawyers about like you know disinterring the corpse and trying to figure out if he was really dead it was really it was really fascinating just to actually follow how kind of mad and insane the whole discussion got and i'm noticing like all the craziness with dogecoin and just how mad it is in terms of almost like a meme coin which is happening so all of that is making me wonder what the heck is going on and also i i'm trying to kind of grasp to understand and try to be as open and as positive as possible to try to understand what's going on so hopefully you can help to shed a light on what crypto is and what bitcoin means that there's a symbolism yeah big task that i'm putting i'm putting on your plate there robert no no pressure at all no pressure i think you're you're drawing attention to one of the main elements of of this crypto asset space which is we have bitcoin and then we have everything else and everything else especially in martin like right now we're in a bull market so bitcoin is increasing in price everything else is correlated to bitcoin so it's increasing in price that creates a lot of noise and confusion it draws in a lot of new people and capital and attention and you get this confluence of just a false narratives i guess you would say so the one you mentioned steam that was intended to be a decentralized social media tool i believe and it's okay it's a good theory it's good on paper but it doesn't have any like market proven utility so for instance the last time we were in a bull market this is the tends to run in four year cycle so this was 2017. there were people just putting up a website a white paper a few pictures of advisors and they would go and raise 30 million dollars worth of bitcoin and ethereum in five minutes like it was the the most the fastest and most rich capital raising environment probably in the history of humanity you can literally just put up a website and raise a ton of money so in this world the way i like to distinguish between them is that we have bitcoin which is this innovation akin to the internet itself in many ways you can think of it as the latest layer in the internet protocol suite so the internet evolved in layers some of them you're familiar with http tcp etc that were essentially a it's a layered protocol for moving information without permission across space and time but the one thing that it lacked was the ability to move value economic value across space and time without permission that's what bitcoin adds to the internet so bitcoin it fits right on top of the internet it is it is part and parcel of it all of these other coins people call them altcoins more pejoratively people call them coins they are essentially copying the code of bitcoin and trying to use it to either compete with bitcoin directly as money or to disintermediate other marketplaces so the the line that i draw as i say bitcoin is the internet all other alt coins are liquid venture capital subjected to little if any due diligence so that's also part of the internet isn't it though like that's part of what the in the internet also is this there is an aspect of the internet you know the kind of not necessary there is the dark web but not necessarily just a dark web but just this kind of madness of of information right the idea that because everything is so decentralized the lack of authority means that you know multiple narratives can fragment you know infinite indefinitely and it's and because you don't have an authority structure you don't know what's real and what's not you can't you i don't have a way to legitimize something even a business online it's hard to know like how do you legitimize you see someone selling something online you know how do you legitimize this transaction it's hard to know yeah yeah that's a great point that you know information itself suffers from unlimited replicability can be replicated at infinitum so there's it's hard to find source of truth in the digital world and that's what that's another thing bitcoin has done like it is it's established a proof-of-work money which means it's a money premise on sacrifice so it actually brings qualities of physical reality like final settlement which is very important to money into digital reality and that is it's the only you hear this term thrown around a lot blockchain crypto assets it's the only market proven use case for blockchain is bitcoin everything else is just again venture capital it's just an idea and so i think it's very important to distinguish between the two and the other the other bright line between them is that bitcoin is the only money in the world that no one can control you could say gold fit the bill historically like that's why gold was selected as money was kind of an apolitical money that no one could artificially increase the supply of so it was it was a reliable store of value bitcoin has now become that for digital space whereas all of the other alt coins are controlled by someone whether it's a developer community an executive board or anything else they have not achieved what this critical property of decentralization that's really important to the power structure of money so bitcoin so the idea is that bitcoin it by its own process like it's controlled by its own reality let's say or it's all that's right right it doesn't no one can no one can clamp down and decide how many bitcoin there are it's part of the very process of bitcoin to to kind of lay itself out you know on its own let's say yeah there's this path dependent emergence that bitcoin's gone through where it was just it was released as the first of its kind into the world it was a first and only crypto asset it was considered a joke initially by most people you know they just thought it was a joke which gave it time to grow organically and gave its mining network and developer community time to grow organically gave time for its rules to ossify and it now you know it's a trillion dollar market and for all intents and purposes there's no way to to stop it or disrupt it and the the other thing that is important is that it's it's perfected the properties of money so these other coins that are claiming to be better in one way or another they don't actually address the five properties of money which are divisibility durability recognizability portability scarcity so bitcoin has essentially taken all of the properties that make money good and perfected them and so satoshi in doing that he left no design space left for another crypto asset to come and disrupt bitcoin and then just to talk back to your particular circumstances where you got knocked over on the exchange that's another area of common misconception people hear about all these exchanges getting hacked and all these scams and people launching these coins and disappearing with the money and they conflate all of that with bitcoin they think bitcoin is getting hacked they think bitcoin is stealing their money and it couldn't be further from the truth bitcoin is is operated with perfect fidelity over 12 years it's grown already to be the most secure computing network in human history never been hacked there's never been any unexpected inflation no double spending but everything else in and around the space is like the scammiest dirtiest space in the world so it's it's hard for people i think to disentangle the two we have this world shattering innovation that's disruptive to gold right gold's a tool we've been using for 5 000 years is money there's a 12 year old digital disruptor emerging against gold but it's surrounded in this cloud of scams and you know people trying to just get rich quick schemes i guess people are right so what it so what so when you say that it's it's never been hacked it's never been you know what is it about the system which makes it that way like what is there which makes it impervious to these problems it's really it's a beautiful composite of design and incentives so on the design side it's a very simplistic set of computer code really just designed to do two things which is create a new block of transactions every 10 minutes and maintain a supply cap of 21 million so it's the first asset in human history we know has an absolutely fixed supply it's an incorruptible money it's a money that no one can change and there's a bit of a a rabbit hole there but it's essentially the corruption of the money has been the chosen the chosen attack vector for all state powers throughout history they always clip the coins they always inflate the bills it's free money right it's this temptation that no one has ever been able to resist and for the first time in history we have a mod and gold was great at that historically because no one could just artificially increase the supply of gold but once we abstracted gold into paper currency people started to manipulate gold as well and central banking today they own about 20 of the gold supply and corrupt the world by by doing so bitcoin is this emergent incorruptible monetary base layer for human organization and it's something unlike we've ever seen and the incentive side to it and this is the it takes a bit of time to get your head around it but bitcoin essentially incentivizes everyone who interacts with it to operate in its favor so if you're mining bitcoin you're you're expending energy to secure the network and you're being paid in bitcoin if you're buying or selling bitcoin you have a money that is becoming increasingly scarce over time so its supply is diminishing so for instance in the past 12 months we've been producing us dollars for 108 years in the past 12 months one out of every three dollars in existence was produced in the past 12 years so we have the where as the us dollar inflation rate is going absolutely parabolic bitcoin's doing the opposite bitcoin becomes harder to produce over time so therefore the dollar price expressed the dollar price of bitcoin becomes more expensive over time the the simple way i like to say is that bitcoin is an insurance policy on central banking the more dollars that we print the more valuable that insurance policy becomes and this so that's what makes it interesting is that bitcoin has incorporated human nature or darwinian self-preservation as one of its core operating components that it's actually incentivizing you to secure its network incentivizing you to hold it and incentivizing you to sell your dollars and buy it so you can think of it as like this this vortex of incentives that no one has figured out how to stop and traditionally when these networks just using kind of like facebook apple amazon netflix google as a proxy when these networks get above 100 billion in market cap they're pretty much unstoppable bitcoin's already 10 times that size bitcoin's a trillion dollar market today so it it appears that it is one of the most significant innovations of our lives possibly even bigger than the internet itself all right so what so one of the things that because i've been thinking about this trying to figure it out because obviously i don't understand the technical aspects of it and and i probably never will which might be fine one of the things that makes something valuable like you name the five aspects of money and the what was surprised to me that i didn't hear in that is something like trust because trust is something which is beyond the the system and and a trust is responded like in a monetary system in a traditional monetary system trust is related to authority that is i trust in the money system because i recognize the authority that's why there was a stamp of the king on the coin is because the stamp of the king tells me that this is what it says it is right and that this has value let's say and so one of the things that happened with bitcoin in the past 20 years is that at some point it dropped to nearly nothing right like there was a massive crash i don't remember the it's been through four market cycles right giant run-up and giant crash yeah and so and so that to me like that extreme those extremes although although i could understand that they're maybe not as bad as those other cryptos that you talk about like that these kind of crap coins or whatever you call them you know there it seems like the fact that it doesn't have it doesn't have authority that in moment in a moment of panic then it can become nothing like it can go from everything to nothing i don't know if that makes sense that it doesn't have meaning like it doesn't have meaning it doesn't participate in a web of meaning so the trust factor of money i would argue it actually coalesces to those properties so the the very nature of value itself is value is the relevance of a thing to our goals right whatever closes the gap between my wishes and their fulfillment is valuable to me anything that blocks that process is destructive to value anything that is irrelevant is just value-less right so values this inherently subjective quality of existence quality of being and and you know we look at the world through a lens of value things to us or either obstacles or tools getting us on our way or blocking us along that path so historically gold was the tool that best satisfied those properties of money and that's why over an entire history of entrepreneurial experimentation the free market selected gold as money it was the most divisible durable recognizable portable and scarce thing in the world so we could say gold earned the trust of market participants without any authority being involved whatsoever you could say the authority of god perhaps right gold was governed by the laws of chemistry and nature such that its supply could not be artificially increased it's essentially indestructible so it had a very high stock to flow ratio which is another way of saying it did not inflate quickly its supply increased about two percent year over year so if you parked your wealth in gold you knew you could trust you had a lot of confidence that your wealth would only be inflated about two percent every year no matter what anyone tried to do right no matter what law government passed or anything that happened in the sphere of politics and human affairs nothing could change that so it was a trusted base layer so i don't think authority and that would be my point there with gold is that you don't need authority to establish trust what you need is time and experimentation right what what what tool solves the aim for people and the aim with money is to move your economic value or wealth across space and time so what holds its value across time that's what's first and foremost and then secondly what can be used to transact that value across space with other market actors and then one of the things gold has that bitcoin doesn't have is that you can use gold to make a crown right you can use gold to make you can use gold to make an altar or you can use gold to make a throne which actually marginalizes its monetary use case i would say because dedicated to something higher that's one of the reasons why i'm saying that it that's how it gets its authority because it's shiny and it and it gets dedicated up but it gets offered to god you could say so this is correct this is how gold so another way to understand money and by the way this is why the show is called the what is money show because this question has a million answers money another definition of money is that it is the most exchangeable or tradable or liquid asset in a trade network so if you go into a prison today very often they use cigarettes as currency right that's just the most tradable asset that they have access to and it best satisfies those properties so it is it is money in that trade network by definition so gold emerges as the most tradable thing because it satisfies those properties but it was only ever traded in the first place because it had industrial use making a crown building an altar built what jewelry dental electronics whatever this is and still today gold has a market cap of like 10 trillion dollars about 10 to 20 percent of that is its industrial use so it's its use as non-money anything gold can do this non-monetary there's a demand for that so we could say the entire configuration of demand for gold is part industrial or utility use and part monetary use and in in that lens it has it has a story it has a story use like a mythological reality yes like it's the head of the statue of nebuchadnezzar it's the you know it's the the first age is the golden age it's the it has it has a memory like in terms of of humanity that we can't get rid of like people think like i've heard people say things like if we all agree that gold wouldn't be worth anything then it would that it would stop that's not how it works right because that memory is deeply ingrained in in all of our stories from all the fairy tales all our myths all their stories have let's say something like gold silver and the other precious metals as part of the of a of a collective memory you could say yes absolutely they they have been proven over time to serve this purpose but with that process you have a a bivalent money a money that's part used in industry and part used as money and through that same lens this is another reason why bitcoin is radically new and i liked you you talked about the virgin archetype in one of your podcasts recently where the virgin is something that is purely dedicated to one purpose right it's untainted by any other purpose it has one sole focus essentially bitcoin is the first virgin money it's the only money that is all of its market capitalization is for its monetary use case you cannot make a crown out of bitcoin you cannot make a throne or put it in your teeth or whatever yeah it's close to pure potential you could say as close as possible it's the most purified monetary technology that has ever existed it's perfected all the properties of money and it has no alternative use case whatsoever and in in terms of to get back to your point on coinage coinage actually emerged initially as a private business function so when people would trade with gold you needed to weigh the gold you needed to say it you needed to make sure it was authentic yeah trust yeah trump trust that it was real the real thing exactly you needed to make sure it wasn't lead coded in gold etc so every time you exchanged gold you had to go through this time intensive process that increased transaction cost and was a friction to free trade basically in comes the the coinage function where a private certifier would instead stamp these gold coins saying you can trust this stamp you know can you trust me you trust me so you can trust this stamp that's right you're replacing the reputation of the coinage issuer with the need to say the gold and if that if it's ever incorrect then you go after the coinage issuer yeah well that issuer became more and more centralized and controlled by the state over time in almost every society around the world and that's why we always end up with these smug emperor or dead president faces on all of our money they're they're trying to actually insert belief or trust in the state right as being the bearer of that commonwealth but what they've actually done is just commandeer a free market function and again to look at bitcoin through that lens if you you run your own node that's why you run your own node in bitcoin which means you're running your own independent history of bitcoin with every transaction so you don't need to trust anyone you are your own central bank if you will or your own coinage issuer you can verify with 100 certainty and zero percent trust that the bitcoin you are receiving is in fact authentic bitcoin yeah and that's a game changer as well yeah and i think it's like i get it i understand like the image you use of the idea of the virgin and also the the notion that money is in a way potentiality right it's the yes the dissolution of your goals or you know it's like it's the dissolution of your goals whether it's buying something objects or services or whatever you know into a potentiality that you can then redirect towards different things like that's what money seems to be at least especially in the modern world and so this is to me like this is this is the key that i was trying to get to before and you probably won't agree with me but it seems like the fact that that's what it is means that it's either everything or nothing that it's either that it's either it will have it will like you said it will reach massive amounts of value or it will have me mean that be worth nothing because it doesn't participate doesn't have a kind of gritty hierarchy in it which is the goal like the like like you said the the gold is not pure value in the sense of pure potential it it also can be used to make things and so because of that it's like worse comes to worse right worse comes to worse if i have a an iron bar it has a value but i can also use it to make a sword right i can use it to make something you know if i have a stack of wood it's maybe will never be worth as much as bitcoin but i can use it to make a cabin whereas if bitcoin because it's just pure value that seems to me at least to account for its like huge up and down but i mean like what do you think do you think that now that there won't be another down or it's just gonna keep going up well so i guess first of all to speak about the volatility bitcoin has been through four as i mentioned earlier four of these price cycles yeah so just a quick history i guess from mid 2015 to late 2017 bitcoin went from 200 to 20 000. so did a 100x and two and a half years it then came down 85 percent over the course of the year to 3500 so now we're in another bull market it's close to around 60 000 so it's up 20 x off of that low roughly and we would expect this bull market to peak somewhere later this year but this volatility is occurring volatility itself it exists it's i've said that volatility is truth so we say the the universe is pervaded by entropy right it's everything's changing everything's tending towards increasing disorder with these little pockets of order here and there that is expressed as volatility price volatility in the marketplace bitcoin is the fastest growing asset in human history today it's gone from zero dollars in economic value 12 years ago to one trillion dollars in economic value today that path could not possibly be linear it's been driven by its having cycle so every four years the new supply issuance of bitcoin gets cut in half and if you just hold you know prices supply and demand so if you're holding demand constant and you cut supply in half what happens to price right price gets a lot of upward pressure and it tends to overshoot right it goes maybe it's actual value you could say which is say let's define price as an appraisal of value right so you say value is tracking some fundamental utility of of bitcoin as money whereas its price is just what it's trading for in the marketplace so as its value increases over time its price is overshooting and undershooting that value along the way that is the volatility of bitcoin and it does the other thing to that point is this is true of all assets this is not just bitcoin yeah but not not to the levels that we're seeing right amazon's more volatile been more volatile in bitcoin in its early years amazon drew down 94 on the dot-com bus it had double-digit drawdowns every single year the past 20 years it's up 45 000 off its lows so volatility and market cap are inversely proportionate and this also applies to bitcoin so the bigger bitcoin is becoming the less volatile it's becoming over time but this narrative by the way is being pumped so hard by mainstream media bitcoin is a ponzi scheme bitcoin is too volatile like it is blasting from every channel on mainstream media but it's just i would argue these these media channels that are controlled and serving the interest of central banking propagandizing against a technology that is disruptive to their business model yeah what's happening so here's the question so like here are a few questions that i've got when i when i when i when i'm hearing what you're saying and so there are two things that come to mind one is so so for example what is the problem of the internet and the problem of this this potentiality so one of the things that happens when something presents itself as a wild potentiality you know and the internet is an example of that where the internet presented itself at first and still a little bit now as infinite possibility right no borders no authority you know total almost anarchy of discussion anarchy of possibility anything can happen anything is possible and that was that that's kind of how it was presented to us right in the late 90s and now we could say the opposite of that we could say the internet is the system of control the most total system of control that has ever been invented in human history that that there are si that that social media these systems that are out there are able to read your thoughts are able to predict your movements know everything that you're going to do everything you're thinking and are trying to direct that ideologically in ways that has never happened in the entire history of humanity right and so what i'm trying to bring about is that the idea of like pure potentiality what it calls for it's almost like it's calling for a master and so it's it's like if you the real world is like a balance between potentiality and actuality like the real world is this this kind of this ebb and flow this like normal masculine feminine these the these this kind of relationship between opposites but when you present something which is like chaos then it's it's like it's asking it's not it's creating a tantalizing thing for order to kind of clamp down upon so it's kind of like a riot a riot what comes after a riot is police and not just regular police riot police that come with guns and with with things that they usually don't use right if if anarchy breaks out then more authority is put on it in order to clamp it down and so you could say you don't like that which whatever it doesn't matter it's still going to happen right because that's it's almost like it's part of the system and so when i look at what's going on with crypto it's weird like my intuition and i may be wrong because i don't understand the technical part of it but when i look at what's happening with crypto i see i intuit that there's also a movement towards a hyper-controlled world currency that will be a totalizing currency and that if you don't use that currency you won't actually be able to trade at all and so it's not right now it's not here it's not totally there but there is this it's like it's like there's an intuition that i have that i can see it on the horizon just like i could see in the internet you know even 10 years ago i could see that this is moving towards a system of control yeah first on the topic of free speech the internet promised to be this great democratizing force giving all of us the ability to just exchange ideas freely which in a lot of ways it's given us many tools to that effect but it's also been monopolized right these platforms are controlled that we have the emergence of data monopolies the fang stocks etc that monetize our data and our attention bitcoin there's a promise in bitcoin and this hasn't completely emerged yet but because bitcoin is an immutable protocol on the internet stack there is the possibility now and we're already seeing it at higher layers in both what's called the lightning network was which is a layer on top of bitcoin and applications built on the lightning network particularly one i'm thinking of called sphynx chat that enable unstoppable free speech and social media tools so you can actually anchor these tools into the bitcoin blockchain such that they cannot be censored so the the just let's just say on the horizon is this glimmering hope of an uncensorable internet built on top of bitcoin so that's one great feature that's still kind of on the horizon but but it's possibly emerging i would argue too that bitcoin it actually introduces a disciplinary force to the chaos of the internet that's really that's actually why proof of work was originally invented it was invented to inhibit email spam so instead of just spamming you know every email address in the world with you know countless solicitation or marketing or scam emails this system of proof-of-work created a mechanism by which each one of those would cost you just a little bit so that would really dis-incentivize spam so it would incentivize it gives people that want to communicate via the internet it gives them skin in the game there's a cost associated with their communication so therefore their communications become more authentic and honest so i think bitcoin can introduce that to the internet by actually forcing by making messages unsensible but also causing allowing people to be able to gate you know what they receive and then also force people that want to communicate to pay up basically reduces spam and then i would say that your intuition on the movement towards one world totalitarian or authoritarian currency is very likely i think that race has already begun between kind of china the us and the the extension of the us which are the imf and the world bank they are racing to have a counter measure against bitcoin because bitcoin is it's perfect i'll use perfect in quotation marks because nothing's perfect but it's perfected the properties of money it's disrupting gold and with it their institution of systemized time theft which is the central bank you know we hear about all this money in the world being printed very few of us understand that no new wealth is being created as a result of printing that money yeah we're just shifting the claims on capital from one set of hands to another so it's systemized theft at scale central banking is at best a misguided institution at worst it's the greatest criminal enterprise in human history yet no one's talking about it no one understands it it's above politics by the way it's it's politics is the puppet show that central banks put on to distract us from the truth and i would say that the counter measure that they do take against bitcoin whether it's the imf or the fed coin or whatever it may be there's going to be a money that's forced upon us they're going to cancel physical cash they're going to say you have to turn in all your physical cash to get us fed coin and you're going to l that money will live inside a walled garden and they can turn it off and they can turn it on they can choose what you spend it on if they don't like what you're saying online they could turn off your money completely we'll move into this world of something much more like a china social credit score system where if you're not playing friendly with the state's ideology they will dial up or dial down your ability to use money travel everything and in that world of this orwellian world of total censorship and control i think bitcoin is the only answer it's a money that no one can control no one can censor no one can weaponize right to steal from others so that's the big battle here it's about its own authoritarianism and the free market so so the image of bitcoin and the image of crypto i guess is a like it is in a way a stampless currency like it doesn't have the stamp of authority it's it really is this kind of it's dark in the good and bad sense right in the sense that you can't know like if you are if you have bitcoin and you have it like you said then you've got it that's it like no one can take it from you right unless they actually take the you know the number like your whatever code or whatever i don't know how it works but whatever it is that they would physically steal from you like once you once you've got it then you've got it so this is the so because it's dark it also has it it has a has a negative aspect in the sense that you don't know who owns the bitcoin right and so what happens what happens in 10 years when all of a sudden we discover that the chinese government and the central banks actually own 85 or 90 percent of bitcoin and we didn't know but now we find out because we don't know who owns it like couldn't the bitcoin itself because it's those who own it who will have power so what's being set up is like a secret elite of power that we don't know who it is like there's this massive amount of value that exists in the dark that we don't know who has it and so what happens when we discover that it's actually the same agents that we that we want to get away from that actually own the most of bitcoin i think it's pretty unlikely that they could ever own 85 to 95 i don't know like i'm just saying number one i mean the only way they could do that is you'd have to monetize all the central bank balance sheets into bitcoin so bitcoin's market cap would be 100 trillion dollars or more so in that event if you're holding bitcoin you're going to be wildly rich it would also again it although it's unlikely if that happened it's still a better outcome for humanity because the the core premise here is that the integrity of the money supply and the integrity of society are inexorably linked if the money supply can be violated and changed arbitrarily then social cohesion can collapse and the extreme example of that is just hyperinflation like look what's going on in venezuela today talk about having no meaning the money literally has no meaning it's in the gutters it's in the streets people are pushing it around in a wheelbarrow trying to buy a loaf of bread the money has been inflated into worthlessness so it's this concept of unexpected inflation that is positively correlated to a breakdown in social cooperation bitcoin's the only money in history this is again what it optimizes for a hard cap of 21 million it has zero percent unexpected inflation when you understand you get past the central bank euphemism that inflation is necessary for a healthy economy you realize that it's just purely theft integrated into the money this is the only way to optimize trust in a society so it's we're we're moving from trust and authority to trust and self-interest that's what bitcoin does it's you're trusting the self-interest of every other market actor and what else is there to trust in a darwinian world other than self-interest you have to trust that everyone's going to operate in their own self-interests yeah but like the free market that that paradoxically creates the these selfless outcomes from individual pursuit of self-interest bitcoin's the same it's a free market money that i by choosing to hold my bitcoin and secure my wealth independently and verify my wealth independently i'm actually voting against this system of time theft that the central bank represents and therefore voting for something more positive for humanity yeah i mean it how can i say this it's like i understand it because i also think that the monetary system the way it's been set up in modernity and the way that it's been completely taken away from a standard and it's just it's just total speculation i think that's an insane thing it's an it's an insane thing that is leading us to catastrophe but i nonetheless like the arbitrariness of bitcoin in the sense that okay so let's say i don't like the fact that states rule over me and that the states have this power but i would prefer that the states rule over me and have power than some shady person that i don't know who that person is and has massive amounts of bitcoin like imagine a world where bitcoin replaces money that means that all of a sudden these shadowy actors are going to start to appear as being the most powerful and it's going to be purely arbitrary it can be totally arbitrary it's not going to be someone who built a network or built you know like i can't hate jeff bezos all i want but he built a real thing like a company and he's got he built this thing i can i can't hate the the you know i can hate the government of a country but they run the roads and they they run this system whereas this is what i was trying to bring up before it's like in bitcoin what you have is a shadowy elite that is that is hidden we don't know who these people are and if it replaces money i'm not sure that would be the best outcome for humanity because all of a sudden they're going to start to appear like we don't see them now but at some point they're going to start to show themselves when they become the most powerful people in the world also one thing there is who do you think runs the central banks today there's already a shadow elite that runs yeah you're right but the trade one for another well here's the key difference the current shadowy elite yeah control the rules that govern money they want to steal more from everyone print more money they want to they want to de-authorize people they it is a totalitarian regime whereas even if you gave that those same individuals if you just switched out their current system for a bitcoin system they would no longer have control over the system they can't change the rules of bitcoin bitcoin is a game with unbreakable and unchangeable rules and therefore it incentivizes people to adopt long-term peaceful cooperation as the optimal strategy because you can't steal from one another right today a great strategy to get wealthy today in the us is to get as close to the fiat currency printing press as possible get a buddy in politics or get some favorable regulation or get a bailout or get a ppp loan or whatever it's a great way to get free money and steal from everyone else yeah none of that is possible on a bitcoin system you can't change it you can't bail it out you can't manipulate it in any way so it's i would argue and this is a tricky perspective shift is that we actually have to look at the systems we're pouring ourselves into i think the our personalities and our characters are emergent properties of the incentive structures we are operating within and right now we're operating within a flawed incentive structure which is like we can just print money and steal from everyone else that's forced to use the money and this perverts morality this this perverts social cohesion and it leads to civilizational collapse if you just look across history and create civilization there's ever been they break the money and then they collapse yeah yeah yeah the same pattern repeatedly so we need a money that cannot be corrupted and that's bitcoin is the only thing that exists that can't be corrupted i mean i i need to think about it i definitely need to think about it i think that you've you've helped me at least understand what it is like understand what's going on understand what it is i think i how can i say this i remain with the two questions not the questions but the two the two issues i have in terms of of actual value right and how actual value appears in terms of these extremes of of price and we'll see what's going to happen because like you said i think the issue the reason why i'm not i don't object to it completely let's say bitcoin is because i can see like like you said how insane our authorities are acting like just how mad the the the system is right now and how it does in fact seem to be heading towards some kind of collapse which will be recuperated into a more totalitarian system and so and so i but i'm not sure like you know in a real collapse like in a real in a real collapse like would bitcoin continue to have value well it all depends on first of all like we saw in march 2020 in the short run everyone runs to dollars and treasuries still that's still the safe haven asset in the world or gold even yeah but after that shock central banks respond by printing more money so what we see with bitcoin bitcoin collapsed march 2020 down to 3 800 and now it's grown 20 x roughly in the 14 months since so again it's all about this ratio of how many dollars the rate of production of dollars the ratio of that to the rate of production of bitcoin that's what drives the price of bitcoin so if we have these short-term economic shocks bitcoin can suffer but then on the back side of that bitcoin is going to expand a lot as we print more dollars and just to answer that the one last point of your question before was you know bezos is a great example of an amazing entrepreneur right he's created so much additional productivity for the world that's why he's rich like we can strip out some of the the arbitrage maybe where he kind of skirted state taxes and a few of these things right because he's operating with a digital network versus a physical network but overall that's what entrepreneurship is it's people going out into the world solving problems selling those solutions into the marketplace everyone benefits as a result we become more wealthy and more productive as a result on a bitcoin standard where i said earlier the fiat there's a lot of strategies related to getting near the fiat currency spigot to get wealthy on a bitcoin standard all you can do is be an entrepreneur that's the only way you can earn money you can invest intelligently or you can go out and solve problems for humanity so i think we'll just unleash the the the power of human ingenuity on all the unsolved problems specifically related to the environment and we didn't even get into energy which is a whole other very interesting topic with bitcoin if we want to decarbonize the atmosphere we have the technology for that today the problem is that it's too energy intensive bitcoin mining is a perpetual bounty program for entrepreneurs to seek out cheaper and stranded energy sources so we now have this global incentive to push energy costs lower right will in turn make decarbonization more economically viable and desalination right because water is another issue but hey if we can get desalination cheap enough we can drink ocean water so there's this whole again this vortex of incentives that i refer to as bitcoin as i don't know what else to call it it's a brand new game that's purely voluntary purely transparent and i would argue i mean i guess it's still out for debate but i would argue it's purely a net benefit for humanity like the trade-offs that it makes optimize for individual sovereignty individual optionality and individual freedom i think instilling those characteristics into market actors is what creates the best outcomes for all yeah look i will definitely i will definitely think about it i appreciate your time and you know like i would say people go go into the comment section like i'm learning about this and so i will definitely be paying more attention to the comment section seeing you know your thoughts about what robert is talking about you know your objections to my objections and we're gonna we're gonna keep this discussion going i'm gonna keep thinking and i probably will be talking about bitcoin a few more times to try to wrap my head around it as well so thanks for your time robert i really appreciate it yeah glad to be here and so where can we point people to in terms of seeing what you're working on yeah i'm on on twitter at breedlove22 it's b r double e d l o v e 2 2 and then the youtube the sorry the website for the podcast is what is moneypodcast.com and it's also on youtube and i encourage people that's why i again named it the what is money show it's like you don't have to trust me i know i speak emphatically about this i've been studying it for five years non-stop i feel strongly about it but trust yourself go out and ask the question what is money and i promise you if you follow that question deep enough you're gonna unveil a lot of very interesting truths about the world yeah especially now and i think it is definitely even in terms of symbolism understanding what is money what is credit what is interest all of these things are are subjects that i that i'm i definitely want to put more attention into because they're crucial to understand and to to see where we're going so thanks for thanks again for your time robert yeah thank you so much for having me all right
