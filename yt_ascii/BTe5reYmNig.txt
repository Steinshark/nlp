we're about to spend four thousand dollars in the next four minutes buy the most miniature tech you've ever seen i've already tried buying small tech last year this time around we're taking it to new extremes hey miniature tech that's so funny that's our last video it's bad it's hard to tell exactly how small it actually is but if it is world's smallest we're gonna have to try it that is ridiculous world's smallest full hd video camera it's 22 millimeters big there's an actually working lava lamp i don't know how exactly i found this website but we have just hit the jackpot smallest water gun that's a real jukebox world's smallest yo-yo an etch a sketch i used to love these so much world's tiniest remote control helicopter no way that's a computer mouse a dual powered vacuum cleaner the size of my finger it's a small stuff big fun i should remember that one world's smallest blower i'm not going to ask any questions fully adjustable desk lamp no way it's an actual boombox let's see what other mini tech we can find why are there so many knives in the search results okay mini gadgets oh that's actually cool sony has remade the original playstation in a miniature form factor but it still works see what other consoles we can find mini consoles there's a nintendo one too the sega mega drive mini that would be kind of insane i've never played the original you are kidding me that is so perfect it's got the classic console the iconic joystick and it's an actually working mini tv you can also get a micro handheld console and it looks like this one has a legitimate high resolution color screen what is a mini washing machine let's find out this is very weird it's a tiny pen that never needs refilling how can a pen last forever okay well i'm intrigued so you can get a nano 3d printer we can use it to manufacture mini accessories for our mini gadgets a tiny fully functional one microphone for your smart device oh you really don't want to hear me sing but we do have to test it that is my favorite thing i've seen so far it's a tiny tiny tiny but working blender for when you're just a little bit thirsty world's smallest dance revolution oh it's like those big arcade machines that you actually dance on but here you'd be dancing with your fingers the v13 smallest voice recorder with with an extra one percent off aliexpress you shouldn't have i didn't know there was a sphero mini i remember really wanting the full size version when that released and that was already pretty small but i think it's fair to say this is gonna top the last video the time has come some of these are even tinier than their photos so let's test them from pretty small to extremely small to absolutely minuscule starting with the nano 3d printer which is somehow the biggest product in this entire video so we can import basically any 3d model that we find online oh this is perfect okay so you click play there it'll start yeah that's gonna take a while we'll come back to it okay console time so here's the playstation mini this feels strange playstations aren't meant to be this small no way looks like a toy in fact let's just unbox all of our consoles and then test them together in one go so here's the sega mega drive what on earth the controllers take up two-thirds of the box and this is the console man it looks like something straight out of an 80s movie and then the snes which feels particularly unusual given that i just unboxed the full-size snes for my video on every nintendo console goodness okay the size differences versus the originals is absolutely insane and literally every single detail is preserved even these tiny little dots oh you can't eject discs like you used to that really was half the fun but the reason for that is that none of these consoles come with the original hardware because that's like 20 30 years old at this point and so you can't just stick a ps1 cd in it and expect it to work they're instead all running modern chips and then using software to emulate the originals the upside of this though is that they all come with games pre-loaded onto them the playstation has 20. the snes has 21 the sega has 40 and they're even upscaling the graphics to look sharper than they used to like it feels retro but it also kind of feels modern i mean this sega is every bit as sharp as a modern day console isn't it wild to think that one day there's going to be a playstation 5 this size okay moving down on the sizing ladder we have our washing machine ultrasonic turbine wash it definitely talks the talk aha but let's see if it walks the walk so tough so first we put the turbine part of this on the inside fill it with water a little cleaning tablet and now this is the towel that we used to clean milo when he's covered in dirt enjoy and now we just need some power wow it is absolutely going for it let's drop it in oh it's like i've got a live creature in my bath okay moment of truth that's actually quite impressive i'd say it's got rid of 80 to the dirt see how our printing is doing that is so intricate it's a really phenomenal resolution printing for a printer this small any idea what we're printing yet now what do you do if you ever make just a teeny tiny bit of a mess use world's smallest blower and world's smallest vacuum cleaner are you okay so excited to get inside you're trying to be careful because if you know this type of packaging you'll know that it can literally slice your finger off if you're not careful great for all those kids who'll be buying these so you need to make a little bit of a mess let's see if i can blow it off me oh hey not bad blow my simpson doesn't get rid of everything but it gets the surface level stuff come on it's moving i think hopefully this fare is better oh it does pretty much clear everything it can actually suck fine it just doesn't have enough room inside of the reservoir for all of this flour so right now i think some mines are about to be blown because it is time for our even tinier gaming gadgets this will also be the first time out of ever used a dance dance revolution machine just don't think i'm confident enough to whip those moves out in public that is bonkers we've got world's smallest space invaders handheld it's literally like the size of a credit card oh the controller is cool so it kind of looks like the buttons and the joystick are almost normal size they've just trimmed everything else oh gosh deadly plastic packaging strikes again i am pumped for this one though wait this isn't actually gonna work is it we're now getting so small but just being able to turn these gadgets on is starting to feel like a feat of engineering so surreal seeing all of this set up and ready to use so you scroll through and pick a song and then just tap the buttons in time for the rhythm hey i'm not bad at this it says i'm perfect oh it's booing me okay this controller is officially awesome there's no shoulder buttons there's no double joysticks but because most phone games are pretty simple anyways it works the buttons feel shockingly high quality plus you know it's smaller than a pack of mints this handheld is far too thin to have any right to be a working console since i have zero credit do i need to add credits these retro games are deceivingly difficult i would just love to be able to travel back back 40 years in time and hand this to someone who won't have played space invaders on anything smaller than them and then here is our atari 2600 this is a console that when it released back in 1978 it was this big and now just look at it i actually can't believe what i'm seeing right now this joystick is completely functional and it's letting me pick between nine full atari games this tiny little button works the screen is swivelable and even the resolution is shockingly high for the size i really want to give whoever made this a really big hug so i just realized the other day that we also just so happen to have ordered everything we need for a disc setup we've got a desk lamp you might have realized this already but i get really excited for light related gadgets so you can completely articulate the arm cool a lava lamp this reminds me so much of my time at university i remember trying to turn my room into this next level setup and being so proud of this lava lamp that i was using as the centerpiece or a wireless mouse my hand was going to engulf this entire thing the jukebox the idea of these normally is that you put a coin inside and then you pick a music track for it to play but i don't even think there's room for a coin in here and then the pista resistance the forever pen what is going on here based on the vox i thought it was going to be at least twice the size of that well i've done my homework so essentially the body of this is made up of titanium and the tip of a silver compound what this means is that when you write with it it's not using up any ink like a pen or graphite like a pencil you're actually creating a chemical reaction with the surface oxidizing it and therefore leaving behind the mark all right let's get some lights off okay desk lamp on hey not bad let's get the lava lamp going it's got a little button that you press at the bottom to push up the liquid it's not a bad recreation of the effect jukebox on so it's basically just a mini radio let's also bring in the tiny macbook and the tiny tiny iphone from our last video this is actually making me feel like a giant and it's time to use this forever pen kind of nervous about this i feel like it shouldn't work kind of got the rough texture of writing with a pencil but it's just knowing how it actually works makes it so fascinating to see it and this thing has quite a lot of advantages it can ride underwater on pretty much any surface it's smudge proof it's literally an inch in size and it attaches to your keys speaking of which we also ordered this voice recorder i don't know how i feel about this one that is not big it's apparently got a denoising algorithm built inside of it or should i say the noise and to be fair it is alarmingly effective like this thing has no lights it makes no noise there's no vibration and it can still hear me even if i put it down here in my pocket that is if we've actually managed to turn it on find out in the edit i'm actually getting really hungry i feel like i would do bad things for an ice cream right now i've got to say the size of everything here is absolutely delightful what the actual i have studied textbooks with less detail than this okay forget that i've got an idea okay double cream let's get that into a bottle that looks so nice would you look at that we just happen to also have a mini electric whisk is it going to be powerful enough though that's the question three two one that is not bad every time i touch the bottom it stops it's really struggling with the viscosity of the cream but we will make this work it's literally oh my god guys we have a problem i don't think this mini whisk is the one so we take one of these tiny little cones we grab our tiny little scoop now we get a tiny little scoop tell me that's not the cutest thing you've ever seen oh and you can record me eating it using our tiny camera okay you ready [music] is that what battery tastes like disgusting i think this is my favorite segment yet and it's not just that we're getting even smaller it's also that these are the toys these are the fun ones so for example there's the sparrow mini which is basically a smart programmable ball wow a really really tiny ball it's actually surprisingly pacey [applause] milo you got a new friend oh milo is your friend but there's more if i go into the settings tab here there's a whole load of different ways to steer it so there's tilt controls like a video game merged with real life so the ball actually came with these bowling skittles inside of it let's see if we can get a strike oh so close it's a cool feature though there's one here called screen drive touch and drag to steer make noise to accelerate what this is so bizarre i don't understand why would you ever want to do this this is a real water gun it doesn't seem like there's any trigger on it which kind of makes sense because the entire gun is the size of my finger so i guess you just pump let's try that again oh that was powerful did i hit you yeah haha oh i thought it was empty that's payback for the flower i can't believe the power that is aggressive i have to admit the yo-yo is not one of those playground toys that i ever quite mastered it's always more of a beyblade guy okay here goes nothing stick to beyblade i remember always wanting a proper remote control heli when i was younger this is a dream come true kind of so if you're wondering what on earth we've been building this entire time this is a helipad to land it on i don't think i've ever seen something this intricate made by a 3d printer considering the size of that i am blown away this is the model it's based off of if you look at this software you can see that the colored parts in the middle were actually the structure we were trying to build all of this blue stuff around is just scaffolding to stop it falling apart but it looks kind of nice so we're gonna use it anyway i actually can't believe we spent an entire day printing that so if it was worth it oh i have no control over this aircraft come on come on come on steady slow's ready yeah i'm just realizing now that there is no back button i think there's only one way to do this sorry i had to come to this all right rubik's cube and etch a sketch they only really outdone themselves here you know it's almost as if the normal size rubik's cube wasn't already hard enough my fat fingers can't even move one layer of a time and it's so torn between two conflicting emotions this entire video i mean on one hand i am in complete awe at these tiny but somehow still working products but also they're all so hard to use like who are they made for apart from one year olds and tech youtubers oh i remember watching these videos on youtube where someone interviews animals this mic would be perfect for that all right milo do you want to tell everyone about your recent mishap he won't tell you he's embarrassed i'll tell you so last week milo managed to compromise his email account because one of the sites that he'd signed into had had a data breach and his personal data alongside hundreds of thousands of others was ejected into public space now this could have been a problem if it weren't for the surfshark alert feature which literally monitors all the sites that you have accounts with and the moment it detects a breach it lets you know so you can do something about it by the way doesn't this mic sound shockingly good anyways alert is just one small part of the total surf shark package which gives you a high speed unlimited user vpn the simplest antivirus i've ever used and a secure internet search that's not just private but also ad free and the craziest part of this is that with the winter sale in place surf shop vpn is only one pound 63 a month which split between the seven people i share it with works out to literally 23 pens and if you have the link in the description and use the code boss you will get an extra three months for free on top of that fully refundable
