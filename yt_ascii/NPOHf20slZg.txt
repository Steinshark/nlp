the rabbit r1 is a tech product that has raised tens of millions inv venture capital promised the world and delivered on almost none of it worse though it's built on a scam that the founder is now trying to distance himself from but hey where are i manners i'm trying to be more positive in 2024 so let's let this company introduce themselves at least before we say anything negative about them hi everyone my name is jesse and i'm the founder and ceo of rabbit this is the rabbit r1 i can speak or type with r1 i can also use r1 to call a ride i can also use r1 to order food i can also make r1 to a set of more complex actions for example if i want to plan a trip to london i can just describe what i wish in full to r1 you can order the r1 now at rabbit. and we are shipping easter 2024 well there you go that's not so bad you got yourself a standard tech guy in a black shirt promising the world apple keynote backround what could go wrong oh and i guess it's past easter 2024 so the product should have shipped so before we talk about the scam angle let's briefly check in with tech youtube for how this ai assistant is assistan thing the thing that you get at the beginning is like borderline nonfunctional look in uber to lt labs the ride share status is currently unavailable get me a ride apologies the uber ride request couldn't be processed what is this you are holding a taco oh that's not good i could give them a few lessons on positivity turns out basically everyone in the tech sector tagged team this product for being non-functional or playing wrong about things that rabbit said the r1 could handle things just weren't working what if i told you that wasn't the the biggest scam that this company is built on something much worse and now that i've been so cheery and positive let's go down the rabbit hole and see what's under the hood yes it's a bunch of rabbit jokes so the first thing we need to do is go to their web page the r1 is created by something called rabbit incorporated but this company has a strange history it was originally registered under a different name cyber manufacturer co in fact they changed their name 2 months before their official announcement and it turns out that name change is pretty significant because cyber manufacture co wasn't just like a shell company or the same company under a different name they had separately raised venture capital for a completely different project not ai it was for nfts now before you laugh remember this is 2021 when people took nfts very seriously according to a press release the project was called gamma and it was at the intersection of gaming community ownership and web 3 buzzwords what does that have to do with ai well not really much conversely rabbit today also sort of wants nothing to do with crypto their founder jesse announces for rabbit let me be clear quote we will never touch crypto never okay well that's pretty strong but given their whole past is built on crypto nfts it's a little strange now when gamma is brought up jesse doesn't really deny that he ran the project he sort of makes it sound like it was no big deal just kind of a thing of the past quote gamma was a fun little project i was involved with during early co time my main work is to build a unreal engine 5 space station themed game that i later open sourced yes gamma released nfts and i bought a bunch myself just for fun never trade never released any token or crypto coins and i left that project once the game was open sourced well there you go haters case closed it was a fun little multi-million dollar project he did he just built it on unreal engine he may have sold a few nfts but he bought a few nfts so you know it's not a scam please don't look into this please please do not look into this is not a scam oh some people may have looked into it first emily shepard and then the writer and podcaster ed zitron jumped in the fray with a great article now i spoke to ed and he told me a very different story than jesse about this gamma project it's so weird and it's the same company and in 2021 they raised this 6 million and then jesse lou across several hours of clubhouse i subjected myself to promised the world and more now i have to say promise the world and more is slightly inconsistent with fun little covid project so i decided i needed to listen to these recordings of jesse talking about gamma myself back in the day and find out who was really telling the truth jesse or jesse i don't want to make gma or none of us want to make gma as a hyp and dump program this is a legit team with millions of dollars of fundings behind basically we're dumping millions of monies into it just to make sure that it will be a next level experiences okay i have to admit it definitely sounds like ed is right this is sold as whatever the opposite of a quick nft hype and dump project is and this is where things get much weirder so nft is only just the beginning the very beginning of this we probably think that the n part will only take you know no more than 20% of the entire weight of this entire bama project so after nft we have this huge groundbreaking ideas about gamma verse then after that we have this again huge groundbreaking ideas about the clean energy versus gamma coin and that you know the the chances that gamma coin become the first not only carbon neutral but actually carbon negative crypto 2.0 or bitcoin 2.0 i think that's complete the entire gamma story hopefully now you're starting to see why i think it's strange for jesse to claim that gamma was a fun little project where he never released these tokens or crypto coins when that's sort of what he promised he told people he was going to release a carbon negative bitcoin 2.0 and look i know it sounds stupid now but again 2021 was a different time and remember jesse had millions in backing it's not hard to see how people took him seriously he said it didn't matter how the nfts did he was going to execute cute but where are those millions you know the money raised from customers when the company changed to rabbit where did it go did it go to develop rabbit a completely different project i don't know i'd love to sit down with jesse and find out what i do know though is that so many of the promises of gamma didn't happen and this is relevant to the r1 not just because this project is built on the skeleton of that scam project it's also because the r1 was overhyped in a similar way as a do-it all device but this same company isn't some history lless company they have a history of abandoning investors like they did with gamma nfts i mean jesse even told people who were worried about the nfts don't pay attention to that you know it's all going to work out you just got to be a true supporter i would suggest for our true supporters do not pay too much detail about the current nft mechanisms because that doesn't matter you know like i i can safely say that even if the entire nft project completely failed which i don't think that's the case we're going to still push the gma verse and we can still push the the the clean energy and gamma coin happen using our fs i cannot emphasize enough that was a lie that never happened the clean energy gamma coin never got published or built or launched even though jesse said they were going to do it they had the money by the way we all know it's vaporware but i think it's important to really hear him sell it because this is the same guy who wants you to take him seriously when he sells you the future of ai take a listen to the whole vision really laid out gma coin which is basically bitcoin 2.0 that is 100% generated by clean energy and we did the mass we did the calculations to where if you own over 1,800 m of clean energy generation that means you will have extra generated electricity that you can donate back to city grade so the general concept is let's say if you own a gma nft that means you own the equal portion in valuation of your nfts at that moment of that clean energy grid that we started building in the real world that means you own that power that portion of the clean energy solar panels that generates that power and that means you own that power and that also means that you own that portion of that power and that power will be used to generate gamma coins that means you can earn your gamma coins out of this entire cle energy cycle all right let's try to suspend our disbelief for a second here and figure this out basically he's saying buying nfts somehow would build a clean energy grid which you would sort of co-own which would make clean tokens sort of the thing and and look i know that sounds a little insane but the funny thing is it's sort of the most sensible part of this project because as i learned that wasn't even close to the end of it they were saying there was going to be a storefront on i think fairfax avenue across from supreme in la they were going to do a comic book they claimed there's a discord comic book yeah they said a comic book a tv show an mmo rpg and at one point yes and then jesse lou at one point said that the future of this thing you would control using your brain logic it is insane am i the only one who doesn't know what brain logic control is look when i first heard this i thought this cannot be right this project is already crypto plus nfts plus clean energy plus comic books surely they aren't going to wrap in ai as well right the ultimate goal is that each npc will be powered by ai algorithms and then you will be interact directly with them using your natural language and your brain logic i think that will be the ultimate goal and when i say ultimate goal i don't think that's like a 10 years plan i think you know in next couple of years we might just have a very good chance to achieve it oh oh he did he promised it in two years okay well why not toss in ai to the buzzword salad in fact i guess it maybe relates it more to rabbit maybe we do have the connection right the brain logic interface is the connection i i mean why not just make it the matrix while you're at it i mean it surely is a matrix to my to my extent and to the original concept of of the matrix that you know you will be rebor reborned with your alter identity in this metaverse and whatever you do in the real world matches the exact consequences in the digital world okay did this man just do the if you die in the game you die in real life unironically while selling nfts the answer is yes and my only follow-up question is if you get scammed in the metaverse do you get scammed in real life in this world too look i'm not here to stump for the big wig venture capitalists who lost their faces on this at the end of the day these are both consumer facing businesses they got real people to invest real money into both the $200 rabbit r1 and into this gamma nft project both are overhyped one just already didn't deliver what they promised while the other is working on fixing it so what can be done here well for one the minimum is that the gamma nft holders should be refunded the money they spent i mean this isn't even my crazy wacky suggestion jesse suggested it himself in those clubhous calls and i better pay my money to collect your nft back if you think this is just an nft hype and dump project i have to say that so the communities will have my words anyone that is not envisioning the gama to the stage two or three just want to make a a coup of e out of stage one reach out to me i will buy your nfts okay i will buy your gamas and get out all right all right we'll take you up on that yes i got a haircut so i reached out again to jesse about these refunds but he didn't respond again the rabbit team did though they told me jesse would not refund investors the quote was out of context the project was never abandoned it was actually op sourced what does that mean well rabbit claims the gamma team delivered everything they promised in three stages the one problem is the three stages they gave me aren't the three stages they promised the metaverse by the way they said they created to is not a metaverse it's an unreal engine project file that i downloaded to play it's based on a starter game called lyra you can see the starter assets here and the things gamma did do made the game so buggy that it crashed every minute but it gets worse the rabbit team denied gamma ever promised the carbon negative coin which they repeatedly promised they said the coin you referred to never materialized nor was it ever promised or delivered now obviously i thought i had a stroke here i was listening to jesse promis it but also he even put it in a video saying explaining gamma with our road map ultimately our efforts will lead to the gma token the first ever carbon negative cryptocurrency powered by our son together we will create a sustainable future for all life on the planet we call home join the discord today and meet your fellow crew members g i don't know how they could have been more clear i think it's amazing to have them say now we never promised that only to find a road map video with you promising in big letters carbon negative cryptocurrency it's just gaslighting at this point to pretend otherwise what is funny is that rabbit also mentions clean energy initiatives they say they did like reducing gas fees but again that's not what they promised they promised a clean energy grid jesse also promised it on discord his post was in chinese but he's clearly talking about open sea transactions being used to buy land to build the clean energy grid which is going to help mine game of coins which is exactly what he said on clubhouse i mean these people are contradicting themselves in multiple languages so i'll let you decide at the end of the day if the rabbit team is being honest here towards the end they even tried to tell me that gamma in our opinion and as stated in the fact sheet has no connection with rabbit but the fact sheet they're talking about they sent me in a document called gamma project fact sheet you can't just declare your own facts when it's the same company who made both things the rabbit and the gamma project how can you say there's no connection but after realizing no accountability would be taken and no refunds would be given by this project i began to feel bad for gamma investors it made me wonder what else is this team hiding well i decided to find out [music]
