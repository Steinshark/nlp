who would pack sensitive computer hardware like this who would charge 57 us dollars for a 10 year old cpu and who i implore you would take nearly 15 weeks to deliver all my gear actually linus is 15 days days wow well wish has improved at least one thing about their processes since the last time we checked them out but if the rest of this is anything to go by what is dram does this remove the ram from my computer then i suspect this is going to be just as awful as last time like this awful segue to our sponsor ruggable rugs are a hassle to clean but ruggable is here to change that with their spill and stain resistant machine washable rugs that feature a non-slip mat use offer code linus tech tips 10 to get 10 off your next order the rules for the wish pc are simple number one every component must come from wish.com number two no matter how high the price no matter how low the spec no matter how obvious the scam every part must come from wish.com and we are off to a flying start here ladies and gentlemen because this cpu a middle of the road core i5 fourth gen a 4670k cost me 57 came with thermal compound goop all over it and this is the best part actually appears to come in a counterfeit clam shell look at this it has the same markings as a genuine intel one but the embossing isn't nearly as deep it's like they took an intel cpu holder and then made a reverse like a negative of it and then made their own mold out of that hilarious and it like barely clips together this is so wild let's move on to our motherboard which i'm going to assume is inside this nondescript white box i'm sure it's really well packed in there david okay this actually looks totally fine other than that there's no packing material in here whatsoever and it was just banging around in this box got our esd bag keeping things safe-ish and this is just your standard ass gigabyte b85m ds3h there are a couple of oddities about this one number one is it was advertised as brand new and i don't see a gigabyte retail box anywhere and number two is that it wasn't actually advertised as being from gigabyte this was just a listing for a generic b85 motherboard which in fairness i guess i got i'm not going to complain about getting a brand name one unless the price sucks oh that's actually not bad 55 bucks that's like what a board costs stickers are a little yellowed from age otherwise all right i think it's legitimately new just old the ios oh wow that dvi port's on kind of crooked that could just be a little qc issue though i don't think that's anything to do with wish get the cpu installed i just want to know what one of these goes for on ebay i'm just curious oh really i paid ten dollars more to get this on wish than if i'd just gone to ebay well at least it's brand new oh my god this is my cooler what is the rationale for this fits in the case it fits in the case oh my god the in the buffoon did you notice this david my case is called the buffoon i know that like chinese to english dictionaries are really really hard to come by but you should invest in one buffoon not a great brand wait it seems they even understood it they have a clown mask here let's focus on our ufox cpu cooler though cool life meet the future cool moon you know how i know that this design is extremely old it comes with native clips for amd's socket 939 this design is at least 15 years old and the way that they achieve compatibility like they did back then when amd was the top dog so your cooler came with amd clips by default is with a plastic mounting ring and oh good lord some plastic push pins well i don't know about you guys but i'm definitely going to be using this ah what the hell my fingers just went kind of tingly oh i got a sliver there's a metal shard in the packaging or on the cooler or something it's not often i get such a bad deal it physically hurts me you know how they say the smallest splinters are the ones that hurt the most goodness gracious is this one ever sharp shooting behind the scenes for floatplane that's what we're doing nice flowplane.com lots of behind the scenes and great extra content well i'm definitely using this hindsight thermal compound soft pack high grade boys dare me to follow this qr code yes david amplifies my worst instincts okay seems these guys make all manner of different thermal grease and they are going to be exhibiting at computex or they did that is some watery goop it's pretty grody these are some bold claims by the way cool moon hydraulic bearing super silent high performance and perhaps least believable 120 millimeter fan ah thank you very much for the actually 120 millimeter fan though to be clear i'm not hating on cheap products if you're on a budget you got to cut a couple corners you got to do what you got to do right it's just that when you're not actually saving any money it really sucks oh actually it was only 13 and 50 cents i mean looking at it i doubt it's gonna perform any better than a stock heatsink which you can literally get by the bucket for scrap metal cost but it's a separate conversation with all the wild stuff we've seen already in this build the big question for me here is why is there computer hardware on wish at all it means that people must be buying it right look at this is this even is this even gonna fit this is what we in the biz call an advanced maneuver you never do this to any hardware you can't afford to lose but i'm about to use the screwdriver to put a bunch of pressure on this clip so that it can reach the little hook that it's supposed to get on there we go confidence inspiring this is flippin hilarious from the packaging i have no idea what i'm about to find inside this box hilarious thing number one it doesn't know if it's ddr3 or ddr4 memory hilarious thing number two dram is d-r-a-m d-e-r-a-m would be more like removing your memory i'm about to dram my computer hilarious thing number three it comes with screws and a little tiny screwdriver whoever used screws and a screwdriver to install ram we're certainly going to try i mean the module itself seems totally fine you've even got like a matte black pcb it appears to be ddr3 memory so that answers that question and just a regular unbuffered dim these seem to be samsung chips or at least like well look okay david not all of us can afford genuine samsung chips over here okay i just need to put some screws in hey it came with screws and a screwdriver i know what you're thinking mine is it was probably an accident they didn't mean to ship screws and a screwdriver with that thing they did it twice we ordered two sticks of memory this one also comes oh crap i just broke this screwdriver in half it's a quality quality product right there as wild as this has been everything i've seen so far would indicate that this will actually be a fairly capable gaming pc oops oh no my rams gonna fall out oh no what was the price on the ram 35.88 for 16 gigs is wish's pricing not total crap now that actually seems not unreasonable i mean it's more than what we would have paid on ebay but not that much more why don't we change gears and open up our buffoon i have seen some lost in translation chinese branding in my day i don't think i have ever seen anyone knowingly and willingly call their company buffoon this is the 102 a portable small computer case not the portable big computer case the portable small one cpu eight centimeter maybe that indicates how much clearance there is off the motherboard to the side wow this is going to be a really skinny case then sfx power supply good lord you really didn't give yourself a lot of options for the rest of the hardware with this thing i'm surprised you even managed to find an sfx power supply on wish some quality packing material right there it served its purpose the case got here one piece yeah this is a very very skinny computer case we can't even fit a full height gpu in here how much did i pay for this mess where's the box that is not good that's in us dollars i can get a quartzer like 4 000 whatever airflow for that does this thing have an optical bay oh my god i had to remove the five and a quarter inch bay cover oh my god it has an optical drive bay i would like an optical drive it's got a filtered intake at least my motherboard came with an io shield that almost definitely actually fits on it nice and credit where it's due unlike the cooler all the sharp edges of this case appear to be folded over so i shouldn't slice myself open on it five stars it didn't cut me honestly manufacturing tolerances look pretty darn good on this thing every single standoff lines up perfectly before we screw this in though you can see there's a power lead for our power supply because it's going to be mounted internally over in the front of the case over here which is really weird it's got that optical bay but then sfx power supplies didn't really take off until much much later is this an old design or a new one i have no idea genuinely oh scythe i've heard of this isn't that bizarre hold on am i missing something here oh no they didn't just repurpose a scythe box did they what's in here these are not especially confidence inspiring cables is this how grounding is supposed to work what where in the world is that the standard hey andy i would like to know if this is a thing that you're familiar with no not i can tell what is this this is the ground pin what our mainland china consultant says what if you haven't won an award in that long i'd probably stop talking about them is this a current product on site's website i must know no released in 2014. look at this of the 300 watt total capacity only 192 watts are on the 12 volt rail this thing is freaking designed for like pentium 4 era systems wait but it was made in 2022. god it doesn't even have active pfc oh god how much did i pay for it i completely i can i keep forgetting 28 okay all right and the best we were able to do for oh my god i still overpaid crap not even that clear how this installs i guess whoa [applause] hey thanks david good catch yep you can slip your power supply in here which takes up wait are these also hard drive bays oh wait no oh order of operations ladies and gentlemen optical drive first which needs to be screwed in here then we can put the power supply in what are the odds this even comes with enough screws to build it that's it how the hell am i supposed to get a screwdriver in there see the problem here right yep play of the game crap it's too small it won't turn the screw but wait it came with its own screws oh my god this screwdriver barely turns its own screws that it came with look at this it's free spinning in there how the crap balls am i supposed to screw in the other side this panel doesn't come off oh okay there was a method to this madness all right okay we did not have to do that i still enjoyed it though this is not a good design for the power supply the intake is fine see that fan drawing in fresh air and then doing what with it our cable is just coiled up in here and this is a solid panel where is it supposed to exhaust to now before we put our optical drive in it's pretty clear that the ssd is gonna mount to the bottom of this plate so i'm gonna go ahead put this here and it's time to open up our ssd this is from vasiki i've actually heard of this brand before and it is a v800 with a total capacity of 240 gigs say to three six gigabit per second solid sata drive that's not what ssd stands for fun fact this is not my first vase key product this is the same drive we bought last time for the wish pc because evidently it's still the best deal let's open it up no tools required which is nice oh my god it's a small boy there's your controller there's your nand flash chips no branding on them whatsoever which means these ain't micron they ain't kyoccia they ain't anything i've ever heard of last time we paid 56 they can now be had in north america for as low as 24 we paid 21 did we get a bargain first bargain base key dram list crap tier ssd that i wouldn't put anything more important than a steam library on but darn it it was a deal any chances my ssd had of living a long and prosperous life ended the second that i installed it right above this power supply that vents the hot air here right next to the ssd brilliant genius love it if i paid more than three dollars a piece for these i got ripped 4.95 for both all right rock on we've got some hxs 80 millimeter dc brushless fans with some really quality quality plastics here look at how like textured this plastic is i'm a little mad about the false advertising these were supposed to be four pin pwm controlled fans clearly while they do use a 4-pin molex connector that's not how we would have interpreted it so they're just going to run full speed all the time but at 4.95 i guess i'm okay with it before i can decide how to install these though i want to take a look at my gpu because depending on the kind of cooler that's on it it could affect things who the hell is kuro toshiku graphics card all i know now is that if i game i need it uh-huh oh okay auto run driver very nice comes with both a half height and full height bracket stylish white pcb i mean it's a 1030 so it's not gonna have a particularly beefy cooler or anything like that but okay no display port either that's a bit of a drag with my gpu probably needing all the help that it can get i'm gonna go ahead and i'm gonna put an intake fan right here neither my fans nor my case came with screws so i had to cheat i shouldn't cheat should i should only be allowed to use whatever we got from wish.com i've got some ideas here there were some twist ties on my power supply cables we're gonna run this through here yeah look at that anti-vibration suspended mount nice i've got another twist tie all right i'm doing it again and this will be an exhaust the motherboard install went well but trying to hook it up things are getting a little bit interesting because our power supply is so old and is designed for motherboards with four pin cpu power connectors we're a few pins short of a load here we're just gonna have four of them not populated should be fine right fine everyone yeah great fine good and our 24 pin goes here and my goodness we are just about ready to fire this thing up aren't we it's a little bit of wishful thinking i think wishful thinking i get it hey i do say so myself that cable management looking not too bad but we've got a couple cables to add one sata cable for our ssd and a second sata cable wait where'd my screwdriver go was there a screwdriver inside one of these sata cable bags did i imagine it oh i was gonna laugh about how my sata cable came with a screwdriver well sorry i went and wasted everyone's time then let's go ahead just get this these sata cables installed what a bummer are you ready for the gpu now yeah oh yeah i just got to bend this metal out of the way got it oh awesome wait how much did i pay for the gpu 58 okay the thing is i actually buy the stuff for these builds wish doesn't send us review samples so that we can crap on them believe it or not and we all know that that's what's going to happen because like they don't carry anything good oh my gosh i don't care about the bad jeebies i'm closing this thing up oh i got a good feeling this is far far from the worst computer i've ever built while our monitor isn't from wish the rest of our peripherals are this wow quality did that just slip out i think i broke it this keyboard mouse and headset set me back 35 and 10 cents that is very cheap which is good oh it's a it's a mac style one imagine being the mac user who puts this in front of your mag one of the most fun things about this mac slash gaming combo was that it was basically a loot box there were three different images on the product page and oh god had basically no idea which one you're gonna get i guess i got the ow damn it bit me oh the mic's a little short oh the front panel audio jacks are not labeled so i'm gonna guess microphone these even go in oh yeah they do and i love this mouse pad it is much better than what you get on lttstore.com northern light style nice stitched edges non-slip natural rubber bottom no no i would choose this kind of lion oh this is not going to reach fortunately this doesn't weigh very much let's go it's going on this side good job computer okay wait no no no there is a third screwdriver i knew it because there's a broken one there was a screwdriver in with the sata cable why i don't know you don't use a screwdriver to install a cable it fell down moment of truth david you ready yeah let's go [music] whoa look at that rgb you can't control it but they've actually got like four different led colors in there which is kind of cool oh wow the fans the fans have red green and blue and also orange as oh it's the optical track okay yeah you are not supposed to do that like move an optical drive while it's spinning somehow this disc survived and can confirm this is the driver disc from the last wish pc that's fantastic we're gonna need a new one now though and it goes let's see if these headphones work boy are they ever uncomfortable the answer is no but it could be the wrong way around oh i heard some static there oh i heard some more static okay i'll try to try it the other way around again okay literal garbage perfect this is interesting in spite of us having the latest drivers oh wait hold on oh no yeah no it'll do 120 hertz oh heck yeah at 1080p apparently the keyboard has rgb function oh wow that yes red green and blue can confirm i kind of like it she looks pretty decent on camera yeah the mouse has rgb 20 24 for this whole bundle 35 35 oh well given the headset doesn't work that's not that competitive the headset does work i tested it it doesn't work anymore i'll try it in the rear i o yep by the way this keyboard is exactly as awful as it looks maybe more oh man i'm hearing a little bit of like popping and static yeah they must have broken when that was not my fault the thing just came out i'm sorry i just don't think these are worth the effort to try to repair i mean i can wear them just for decoration oh god without the padding they're even worse hey we can get some you know basic performance metrics here we got hardware info our cpu is at oh well it was at 40 usage downloading the game our ram is running at its rated 1 600 mega transfers per second oh my god i figured out why our cpu usage is so low installing this game the problem is that our ssd is horrible it is 100 utilized downloading a game at 28 30 megabytes a second this thing is atrocious the good news is everything was what it said it would be core i5 an actual gt 1030 gpu and is our ram running in dual channel it totally is at 1 600 mega transfers per second unknown ddr3 yet tell me about it i'd like to see how my cooler is holding up ah we're only at 70 usage but we're also only at 60 degrees not bad not bad moon cool or whatever you're called i'm expecting some ace tier 1080p gaming because this case was advertised as gaming ready gaming and dong sure wish i had sound whoa 200 fps here we go boys oh we're getting a little bit of stuttering oh wow oh this mouse oh look how this mouse tracks oh no it's definitely skipping i can't tell if it's the engine or if it's the mouse but it's bad oh wow see i wanted to turn and it just didn't when i die inevitably when i die i am 100 blaming this on my computer how much did i pay for this 530 canadian dollars that's like 400 us dollars 420 us dollars all right that's pretty nice just just just throw things it should be fine should be fine whoa oh see i'm trying to turn you see that yeah it's pretty bad i think it's just when i try to go too fast i'm getting the win i'm getting the win well what was that not getting the win no kills no win and
