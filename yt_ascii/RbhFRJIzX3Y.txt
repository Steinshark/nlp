and i just remember even when i was super young like 17 i went to this conference about the flood and i'm standing in front of this like you know it's like post-grad whatever student giving us a lecture on the flood and she said there's a version of the flood in every single culture and then she said that's the proof that it didn't happen and i was like what what was that jive together like how is it that this is a universal story but you're using it to tell me that the bible story isn't true and i'm like there's something missing here and so then i came to really understand symbolism just basically as the patterning of reality this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] hello everyone this is sarah from hamilton and i am very happy to say that today we have jonathan pegeot on the channel and we have him here to talk a little bit about his perspective on symbolism theology what the orthodox church uniquely has to contribute to the discussion about the role of symbolism and interpreting creation the way that relates to biblical theology and especially i want to talk about his perspective on universal history and the way in which symbolism frames our understanding not only of the history that we find in scripture but also the history of all nations and how they're brought into the community of christ so welcome jonathan to the channel thanks for being here it's great this has been a long people don't know this has been a long time in the making we started exchanging like a year so more than a year ago about a year it's good that this is happening i know yeah it's a real blessing so tell us about yourself your background how did you get into orthodoxy and this particular way of framing theology yeah so i grew up in you know in quebec which is a pretty secular place but i grew up in an evangelical world my father was a baptist minister who converted from catholicism kind of at the in the 70s so you know so it's interesting because my my i grew up in a very intellectually honest and curious home my father was always asking questions i was thinking so we kind of grew up in that that space and i think that's what fostered both my brother and i's you know when we reach our late teens and 20s we started asking a lot of questions and started wanting to understand scripture more deeply and that's what led us into our exploration of symbolism in my case more the affliction of art because i was studying to become an artist and just struggling to square that with my my evangelical faith but then also with the world of contemporary art and so discovering traditional christian art really was a revelation to me and then through that and through reading the church fathers especially certain fathers of course send gregor nissa and saint ephraim you know saying maximus the confessor really kind of discovering the idea and my brother was reading a lot of rabbinical texts at the time and so really discovering in some ways the bible as a as a world view rather than just as a text to be interpreted from you know rationalist point of view and so trying to see the bible as a pair of glasses you know rather than like i said something to interpret so so that's what kind of led me on this path to to to understand a biblical symbolism so did you ever have a crisis of faith where you know you weren't really sure whether christianity was true or was it a smoother process than that for you it's interesting it's like i wouldn't say it was a christ of faith i would say but it wasn't it was that was i guess in a way that that was the problems that i was in my 20s i was reading trying to i was had this intuition of mysticism and intuition of of a more mystical approach to to chris to the to religion let's say first and then but at first you end up reading gnostic texts right because that's what is shown to you you read buddhist attacks and sufi tax and then you're like what's going on like it's how is it because i knew i was a christian i was like how can i be a christian and then i find something that's interesting you know in the in these kind of strange texts and obviously after a while i discovered that no it's all there it's all there and the jewish father is like anything of value that you can find in these kind of more esoteric traditions is there in the church fathers and you know and then you don't have to deal with the weird stuff that comes with these kind of esoteric traditions so and so you converted to orthodoxy around that time so yeah i converted to orthodoxy in 2003 started going to an orthodox church around 2001. and yeah when i read so i read i read the a text called tradition and traditions by vladimir lawsky and it's weird because it's a pretty technical text but it that really nailed it for me it really encompassed you know my vision of what i how i saw revelation its relationship to art and to external you know how the internal the external fit together you know how silent and word into body and and space works and so it just was such a a revelation for me that that i read that text and i it's like i kind of knew already i was orthodox i was going to become orthodox and then it was just a question of playing it out and were you a big bible reader as a as a young person maybe not in the same way that protestants had kind of wished i was you know like how they want you to read like certain chapters a day or whatever i was never into that so much like i did have a deep love of of christ and a deep love of scripture and i also for some reason have a good memory and so it's like i kind of have a map of the old testament in my mind there are some places that are a little that are a little hazy but i have this map in my mind and so so i yeah i do read the bible but i'm not like even when i was young i wasn't one of those like it was interesting like i didn't like the idea that in some ways that the religion the reading of scripture was like the ritual that replaced whatever traditional ritual had been there in the catholic church and i found that weird but yeah okay so what is the big idea then behind symbolism what do you mean by symbolism and you know how does that actually play out concretely you know when we're just living our daily life our daily life yeah so i think and this is some i mean you probably totally we i'm sure we 100 agree on this it's like there's a problem that we had in i would say 19th century type christianity and then early 20th century christianity is because of because of materialism for some reason there's this tendency to emphasize the the this historicity aspect like it's like you know people go out into the desert they find these statuettes and they find these old tax and you know they're having all these technical arguments about whether or not something happened and how did it happen and and you know like is moses is that his actual name or is it like a name that was handed through tradition and all these type of arguments which i always found just so boring like i just found them so boring when i was when i was younger and didn't care much for that but then there was also this other strain up here which was kind of liberal protestantism which was trying to show these patterns in scripture and how there's literary patterns in scripture and they were even doing it in a way to discount the historicity of it right so it's like i can see a pattern in the story therefore it didn't happen and i just remember even when i was super young like 17 i went to this conference about the flood and i'm standing in front of this like you know it's like post-grad whatever student giving us a lecture on the flood and she said there's a version of the flood in every single culture and then she said that's the proof that it didn't happen and i was like what would how does that jive together like how is it that this is a universal story but you're using it to tell me that the bible story isn't true and i'm like there's something missing here and so then i came to really understand symbolism just basically as the patterning of reality it's that that you know we experience the world through patterns there's no way of around it you know if you want to tell the story there has to be a beginning and an end and therefore the way in which let's say the infinite details of the world condensed together has to be teleological and therefore it has to have a structure and that structure is not is the structure of your life it's the structure of everyday life now the difference between your everyday life and let's say a movie or a movie and a bible story is that there's a condensation which happens and there's also like a focusing on stories that are epically manifesting that truth right so so like the stories in scripture they're made out of the same stuff as your everyday life it's just that they point them you know you know it's like a burning shining light on on how god reveals himself in the world and so that's the way that i understand symbolism it's interesting that you mentioned that your brother was reading jewish texts when you were kind of working on this working through this stuff together because one of the things that really strikes me about certain trends within contemporary orthodox judaism is the way in which they emphasize the fact that the mundane is precisely where we should expect to find god most intensely right because if the world was really created in its entirety by god then we shouldn't expect to find him more so in the kind of obscure esoteric parts of the world but it's in the most common things in creation that we meet god most directly so yeah but this is being an example but there there has like i think that i think that that's probably true but there's also a reality to the reason for tabernacle worship for example is that the structure of tabernacle or temple worship is there to focus like it's there to kind of focus so that you can see it and so so the problem i think that's because i hear that a lot like you hear that in kind of in in kind of new agey circles right it's like god is everywhere and all that stuff and i think that's true but you know there's a reason why we have a kind of hierarchy of of of an order of of manifestation you could say so it's so that it's to help us encounter god you know even in in our daily lives so i think both are true it's like on the one hand you know tabernacle worship and temple worship and also let's say the the order of a church you know the hierarchical order of a church is in some way like a type of anchor that will help you engage with god's presence in the world in a more concentrated and and powerful way so that you can then in your everyday life you know have these moments of surprise where you know the grace of god just pops and just shines and you you have these these moments of of revelation in every day everyday experience yeah so it's a way of focusing your eyes to see the world as it really is what do you say something like yeah or focusing your attention in general and your body and everything and your your attention is a good way a good way to use that word yeah yeah so you've made a fair few videos on kind of biblical theology or whatever considering you know biblical theology how would you say that you know this project relates to some of the stuff that's been done by anthropologists like mary douglas on leviticus or stuff like that what's what is the relationship between biblical theology and what you're doing i mean i think the what i'm doing what i'm doing in some ways is just connecting like that's what i think i'm doing and so you know if you look at and i don't want to cast any stones or anything but like let's say you look at something like the bible project for example like what they're doing is great like they usually get it right like so many times they get it right but then once then you'll hear sometimes as if there's all they get it right in terms of the pattern and the story and the structure like the cosmic structure in which the old testament is written but then they all often will then express a confusion at like how our world isn't like that right it's like so here's the structure of the old testament here's how it works and it's like well you know we we understand it but now like we basically don't live in that world and i think what i'm trying to do is to tell people no you'll still live in that world you really do still live in that world and not only that but you if you just have if you're direct your attention in a certain way you will notice that you still you can still have the same the same experiences and insights that are that are described in the in those texts yeah and one of the things that's striking to me about what you said about the way in which people argue against the historicity of certain texts is that it seems to me that when you look outside of scripture if you look at you know just christian history there are certain moments in christian history which would lend themselves to being written in a typological or symbolic way so you know the battle of the novian bridge you know it has these analogies which are very strikingly parallel to what we read in exodus but it seems to me that the narrative itself lends itself to that kind of analysis yeah and then what happens which which is hilarious which you could imagine a historian saying well that must not have happened because it's too much like the flood story like it's too much like i'm not the foot but the crossing of the red sea yeah there's an interesting like there's something that happened about 10 years ago which is a good example of this so it's sad because it is related to our situation now and it's sad so when pope francis was first elected he had the ceremony and if you saw it he was standing there and he had on his right hand a boy dressed in blue and on his left hand a girl dressed in red and both of them they they they let go of these doves into the air and the reason was because they were praying for peace in the ukraine okay so they were praying for peace in the ukraine and they let these doves go out in the air and as soon as the doves were released a white bird and a blackbird attacked the doves within seconds and this is all like they're like pictures of this like it's just something that everybody experienced and so you could say really like if is that not like a actual mythological event i mean that's a mythological event and it and it not only is it mythological but it's showing itself to be truer and truer as time progresses and so would it would if you told that story to to a kind of 19th century historian today like in 10 years that they they just tell you no that didn't happen because it's way too mythological in its structure yeah if you read you know josephus's jewish war it's just filmed with these kind of narratives of all these omens which were happening and things and just recently you know in relation to ukraine i mean who knows what's actually going to happen but i saw people sharing these video of this huge murder of crows which was flying over kiev and people you know were kind of spooked by it but there's something in the wiring of the world which seems to actually create those correlations and but it's it's it's funny because people some people who'd listen to this would think okay now goku magic right and so but it's interesting to think like the people who say that what happens is because they think that human beings actually don't exist in the world right they think that human beings don't exist in the world and that the the structures of human meaning are not connected to the way the world actually reveals itself so because of that they can't they can't comprehend how there's a relationship between natural patterns and natural processes and things that happen and human consciousness and human meaning making right you don't think it's weird when like a bird knows when to fly south why do you think that's weird you don't think it's magic like he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't so if humans have a capacity to intuit patterns and to and they have ways of showing that like why is that so weird to you i don't know why it's so weird yeah i mean and people will often say things like well we are pattern seeking animals well of course we are because there are patterns in the world we have to be able to seek those patterns i mean it's just you know it's a non-statement really so i wanted to also ask you how you see what you're doing relating to something like idealism because i saw you had an interview with bernardo castro which i thought was so interesting because i've found him to be such an intriguing writer and i never really thought of you guys in the same you know context but it was great to see that you guys have connected or had a conversation what's the relationship here so it's interesting like a lot of people how can i say this a lot of people didn't totally understand what it was that i was trying to do in that conversation i get it it's fine it's like i'm not an idealist in the naive sense i'm just not like i do believe i believe that the structure that's described in the bible is actually the best way to describe it right the notion of heaven and earth you know and that you have you have a pattern of intelligibility and a pattern of a variability or chaos or whatever like i think that these these is the best way to describe the world now i think that what's interesting about castro's idealism is that he collapses everything into mine but the way he does it he does it in a way that actually doesn't preclude the existence of of what we but most people would consider matter or physical physical phenomena and so because of that i don't feel the need to argue with him on that i just want to see like in his in the way that because i do think that in some ways it's closer if you say something like all things exist in the mind of god like i mean that's a completely christian statement you know it's a completely there's nothing weird for a christian to say that all things exist in the mind of god and so if then after that like we the way that we discuss can be can be can be differentiated i mean we just have to see the categories he's using and if they if they create some kind of heresy or some kind of weirdness in them and i think there's some things obviously i don't agree with castro for sure but but i think there's enough to to connect with what he's what he's doing to to help people understand the inevitability at least of him of intelligence like that you cannot the world cannot exist without something like intelligence or consciousness yeah and and i think a lot of people take when they hear idealism they take that to me no matter is not real or matter is an illusion but you know the underlying presumption behind that interpretation would be that uh matter is something that's fundamentally you know opposed to or totally separate from mind whereas what i see that kind of argument is suggesting is that no matter is real but it's real in terms of the qualities that it has in those qualities are mental qualities that are all unders that can only really be given content in terms of mind in terms of consciousness yeah that's the problem the problem is that there's a there's an insidious notion about what we what we mean when we use the word matter which is this this idea of this existent existent stuff which has no qualities and it's like no no that is like that's out like this you know when it when when god does describes you know when there's the description of heaven and earth in the the first chapter of genesis it's like earth is emptiness and void right it's it's not it's not something that has no qualities it's it's a kind of potentiality to exist in which the the names or the identities you know come down from heaven onto but it's like so then matter doesn't properly exist at least not the way that not in a simple way yeah not a not in a simple-minded way that it's like this this mud right what do people talk about like this the pre-cosmogonic soup or whatever the way they describe is like no no sorry none of that so before we get to the universal history stuff i wanted also to ask you how you see your work as converging with and diverging from the stuff over at the theopolis institute because they have had a huge influence on just the way i read the bible when i read james jordan in 2014 it just kind of changed my life it really introduced me actually to really this kind of pattern of thinking and then when i found your work it was so interesting because it seemed like these ways of thinking had kind of been articulated independently from each other and now that you know there's some conversation going on i'm interested to see how you think of what they're doing yeah i didn't i think what they're doing is great and i've had i did interview someone from theopolis on my on my channel that alistair yeah alistair that's right and so i think that that what they're doing is great i would say that the difference and once again like i don't wanna like their scholarly work obviously is way deeper than anything i'm going to do like their attention to detail is i have nothing to do with that right so i need to be careful right i you know but i would say that i think that would differentiate me from them is that i don't think they fully grasp the consequences of their main nosh of their main vision so i think that that if they grasp the consequences of their their main perception about pattern and how how that works i think that there's some i would think that there are some protestant positions that could no longer be tenable and that's that's what i do believe and so i think that that although i love what they're doing is say like if you you can see it like make some if you want to like ask about mary right like ask about the mother of god and then it's like good all right and so i get it i understand but it but if you if you were if you were taking all these patterns that you see in scripture very seriously like there's some things at some point that it becomes almost impossible not to see anymore but i i still i celebrate what they're doing like i celebrate their the fact that they want to to bring protestants closer to liturgy like they want to have protestant celebrate the liturgical year and so they have this they i think a lot of the stuff they're doing is is positive but but i do think that's the big yeah yeah no it's interesting for me to see you know peter lightheart you know has i don't know if it's just recently that he started saying this but i've seen it put out some articles on the virgin mary as the new eve or things like this and so when you've when you're thinking in certain ways in scriptural ways and when you recognize something like eve is described on the analogy of the city of god she's built like the city is built in the next chapter and then that kind of explains why our liturgical tradition is calling the virgin mary the city of god and why she's associated with protecting cities like constance melbourne recklessly intervening on their behalf it all really rolls together in this beautiful way and i think perhaps despite themselves perhaps not the more that they've put out over the years yeah i've read some of their early work from just the 80s the less distinctly protestant it'd be interesting to watch because i think that so one of the things i've also noticed is that they hesitate to at least in my experience i haven't read that much of them but they hesitate to start to cite certain fathers and they they hesitate you know because of the allegorization let's say of scripture and and as if some of the typological readings the mit is arbitrary and it's like i get that but i think that so so a good example would be like saying gregory of nisa it's like when you read the life of moses and because i was reading it recently for some for an exodus thing i'm doing and so for as you read it he says things that look if you if you're not careful they look like he's just throwing it out there so he says this this and then it's like okay i trust sangria grenisa completely so so some of the things i'm doing is trying to like unpack the steps like i'll unpack the steps for you i'll show you like why the sandals that moses removes from his his feet at the burning bush are the garments of skin and i can show that to you in the text in ways that saying gregory doesn't doesn't go there he doesn't have to right he doesn't feel like it has to but it's like i i'll go far like if you can't understand the story of zipporah circumcising moses's son and putting the foreskin on the feet you know it's like all these images like they're all there it's just that saint gregory doesn't necessarily tell you but you can you can kind of point that out for people to help them kind of unpack some of the typology and show them that it is extremely coherent and very deeply set in the in the text it's interesting that you mentioned that text in particular because i remember reading life of moses years and years ago and coming across that passage where he talks about being deified by walking behind god in other words by following him and how that were and it was so compelling as an image but i had to kind of put it on the shelf as far as the text goes because like okay well i believe this but i'm not quite sure how to fit it all together and then you know one evening a couple of years ago i realized wait a second you know haha you know means to walk right and what does god say to abraham walk before me and be perfect and where is the walking being done it's being you're walking in the way of the lord and there's this theme of journeying behind god as he leads you through the wilderness and moses and all kinds of things about moses's orientation in relation to god and his orientation in relation to israel are happening in the text and as he pointed out defeat are so important and then god's feet are described in all over the biblical text and the way that that relates to just his activity and his pattern of life and yeah because the glory of like the pillar in exodus like we have to understand that the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire is the glory of god we see it later right when the tabernacle described and it says like the pillar descends on the tabernacle like that's the glory of god present in the tabernacle so israel is literally walking behind god into into into outside leaving egypt yeah yeah and the classic phrase for obedience to god's instruction is turned neither to the right side nor to the left side and then the chariot of god is moving in exact right angles and then it fills ezekiel and he's moving in exact right angles as well in the book of ezekiel and so all of these kind of steps as you put it are there in the biblical text and then the church fathers they just say the conclusions like ah i want to reconstruct all of this but i guess that's the benefit of having an unlimited amount of paper or writing space we can just say all these things now we don't have to just throw it out there and leave it for people to figure out so yeah that that's that's really exciting so moving from biblical theology biblical theology you're looking at the history mostly of one specific nation right the christ as he's embodied in the life of israel how does that expand outwards into universal history and what do you see the project of universal history as fundamentally being about yeah so as people know you know richard roland and i started this series which we call universal history and it really was interesting because i've been in interested in this idea of universal history for years like just really really interested in and then i met richard rowling who was like he's not just interested i mean he he's got it down like he just knows it right he's just such a he's he has all the skills i don't right so he so he has all the details and all the all the tags and everything all the references so the idea like let's say in terms of the for immediate understanding is to see how when people would convert to christianity in you know in the history of christianity one of the things they try to try to do was to connect themselves to the christian story usually and and also to rome it was like rome and the christian story so how can i connect my ancestry back to the the the trojan war and how can i connect it to the bible somehow either the flood or some some character in scripture and you know and when you look at for example jeffrey monmouth's text you know those first chapters that's what's going on but the problem is that all cultures kind of have that modern historians what they do when they read these chronicles is that they just chop out the first part ignore it as if it doesn't even matter and then start with like the real history and then see the rest as kind of mythical history but our contention is that no the mythical history will actually be the pattern by which you'll be able to understand the regular history right the connection that they give themselves to the ancient and the way in which they do it the characters even that they that they say they're related to will become a kind of first pattern which will then explain the rest of the of the stuff and so i think that that that's that's what we're trying to do in some ways is revive these actual existing universal histories so you have for example the apocalypse of pseudo methodius which is this kind of grand history of how all the peoples connect and you know there's the place of alexander the great and ethiopia and all these these nations but you see echoes of that for example like in the in the the history of great britain or scandinavian history different different countries will have their own version of it and so we're trying to some ways bring that out because one of the things that happens in these universal histories is that they will not they will not they won't have the tendency to completely deny their pagan sources so they will connect both to the christian source or try to reorient the pagan ancestry into a christian thread and i think that that's very useful for us to understand the way that christianity was even understood by people's that would converting it's like no we're not we're not trying to make you become something completely else than what you are what we're trying is to reorient what you are into the into something which is good into the good and so i think that all of that is you couldn't can be useful for us today to understand how they did that why they did that and and it can give us a key at understanding even why the west even exists you know so was there a particular nation or story which kind of stood out to you as a glaring example of this pattern of this phenomenon going on well i think so i think the most glaring example is alexander i think alexander is probably the one that is the most visible because what happens in the story of alexander the great is you know because he's this great conqueror and he kind of unifies the world together there are all these legends that end up spreading about alexander and then they start to be collated and collected together and one of them is of course they come from different countries but one of them is that alexander goes to jerusalem and he encounters the priest of god and when he encounters the priests of god he declares the unity of god like he makes a kind of declaration that god is one and this is a jewish legend probably i'm not sure they even know exactly where all the legends come from but what happened with that is that because of that alexander is in the quran like alexander is a character in the quran and so alexander then becomes this figure so there's another story for example of alexander who makes these he takes these four griffins and he wants to see what's in the heaven so he he he ties it like a rabbit i think to the end of a stick and he puts the stick up and then the griffins fly up to eat the the the the the the rabbit and and he ascends up in the heavens and then as he gets near the highest fears like towards this fear of saturn i think he hears a voice telling him this is high enough like a man should not go any higher and so then he obeys the voice and comes back down and so it's like this kind of mythological storytelling you know gets included in christian storytelling and so alexander becomes an image of the righteous king who knows who is ambitious who is who can manifest the the positive aspects of the political class but also knows his limit like knows where to stop that he shouldn't transgress the the boundaries of what it is to be human and so that's a great that's a good example and then his legends become some of the most popular stories told in the middle ages all across the world from from england to india basically wow in the india oh yeah yeah they're indian versions of the of the of the also it's also because of islam like there there's an islamic you know the because of the mogul empire you have these you have these these versions i went to see a show in london by the way a few like a month ago which had all these legends like all these these manuscripts from everywhere in the world and all these different versions of manuscripts like it was a it was an astounding show like i was so so happy to be able to see it and yeah there were versions from from basically all the way into persia because you know you took over the persian empires down into india there were virgins from from byzantine empire there's a whole massive one of the most eliminated manuscript of the alexandrian legend is this massive byzantine book that has the whole legends all illustrated very much like icons like they're it looks like icons but it's the story of alexander it's it's amazing one of the images that i found really intriguing in just looking at what the church is doing or has done in relation to specifically greek cultures that you know image in the prophecy of noah as god enlarging yaphath and bringing him into the tent of sham and it's really interesting to me that you know paul whose profession is a tent builder is the one who specifically sees himself not just as uniting jews and gentiles but he's always using that phrase jews and greeks and it seems to me that that's something that's really integral to the church's mission and that when they convert when people converts it's not just that their history is now kind of cut off and they start new at that point but they're actually bringing something in something which god has been growing in them for a long time and it's part of the church's mission to you know bring that into the body of christ and so i think i think that's exactly right and i think that that's in some ways representing that story and representing the reality of it in the legend right in the in all this this gathering in of the of the ancient stories you know is a way to also answer the the the secularists or answer the atheist who who says christianity is just just wiped out the old practices or or you know it's like that's just not it's interesting because you have both it's so fascinating on the one hand you have some people that are accusing christians of wiping out all the ancient practices of you know being these horrible you know controlling civilization bringers and then you have the other people saying ah christianity is just infected with all these pagan practices it's basically just a pagan religion with with the jewish veneer it's like okay well choose which one you know i don't know it seems like it's actually somewhere in the middle where it's it's exactly the way we're describing it and so what what does this mean then for you know an american right if you're an orthodox christian living in appalachia or southern california what is universal history have to say to you i mean it's interesting because you could actually see it you know in the very way that that orthodoxy manifests itself in america which is that america man this is people are not going to take this the right way please wait till i finish the argument before you react to this so america is something like the end of the world right america is the end of the world and because it's the end of the world it it manifests the extremes one of the extremes that america manifests is something like the the horror in revelation okay i said so this idea that america is a land of of excess a land of mixture a land of of lack of cohesive identity right is something which is true of the way in which america exists okay so you you it's hard to avoid that and so what happens it's it's negative but it's not just negative right it's just reality it's just a description of what is there and so the way in which orthodoxy manifests itself in america is like that it's it's it's a little confused right because it's a it's trying to preserve all these separate churches inside of america without having the capacity or will to join them together into the single church that they should be and so we have to be i think as christians as orthodox christians in america we have to not be naive about that and understand that that is the reality of orthodoxy at in the end of the world you could say right at the end of the world that's what happens and so there are although it's a problem there are some advantages to that as well there are some aspects of that which can be can be used to to or at least being aware of it can help us and so there is a possibility in america and i see it like as an artist i see it we also have the possibility of synthesis which other places don't have the possibility of so you can understand that so in let's say if i was a russian if i was as some people have described me a russian orthodox icon carver right then i would have this one tradition which would be the russian tradition and i would have to see myself in continuation of that but i'm not i'm an american or north american orthodox icon carver and because of that i actually have access to all these threads that are coming down and i have the possibility that other people don't of re-tying them together in a way that reveals something universal about the orthodox tradition so i think that that's the advantage of american orthodoxy but it it also it's also born of something which is clearly a disadvantage which is this problem of multiple jurisdictions kind of coexisting in this same space that's a really exciting image for me as a you know someone who's into biblical theology because it seems that you know the two kind of competing ends of the moral spectrum you could call it are two kinds of mixtures right so you can have like a mixture like an image of baphomet where it's just obscene you have all these different categories but you're kind of locked onto each other and it's diabolical but then the high priest's garment is just a mixed fabric from top to bottom or the tabernacle or the temple it's got all of these different kinds of things which are being brought together or you have the land of eden in the land of villa and you're bringing the resources of both of them together and it's integrated into something holy and that's the imagery of the restored zion and the prophets of the nations coming from the ends of the world to put all of this different stuff on one in the same altar yeah and relating it appropriately to each other so i think that and the image of the the of babylon is an interesting one because of course the inverse of that is the bride zion right yeah is a different kind of mixture yeah so that's a really intriguing i think productive way of framing both like the the challenge but also the opportunity of living in this wild weird place yeah well we the way that christians i mean we have something in christianity which we call union without mixture right the the sense that we have the possibility in christianity of joining things together without confusing them and so and i think that in revelation you have two images of that yeah you have two images of civilization you have one which is a riding a beast right that's a one image and that is the excess of both right the the excess of civilization which is controlling which is devouring which is naming right it's like i'm gonna give you a name that you can't that if you don't you don't use you will be eliminated and on writing that is licentiousness and chaos and mixture and all this stuff the the image of the heavenly jerusalem is a beautiful image of multiplicity and unity collaborating and then like it actually says that you know the the kings of the of the world or the kingdom of the world offer up their crowns to to the city and so it's as if this gathering in of all that is good from all the nations into one space that is that is all attentive to the lamb right that's all attentive to to the the to god ultimately and so it's like that's i think that's the image of kind of symphony that the church can become so what let's say that your missionary in the foreign country if you have to if you have something to say or if you don't have anything to say no no go for it if you if you're a missionary in a foreign country is there a way to kind of utilize this way of thinking in such a way that it's not arbitrary or you're not trying to tell a people their own story or is it something that just has to kind of arise organically yeah with a christianized culture yeah that's a tough one huh because one of the problems of the modern world is the acceleration of course and the hyper connectivity and so in some ways it's difficult i think that traditionally these things happen very organically you know it's so i think that you know i think that for example the evangelization of russia it was like i mean i mean the tremendous task of like creating a new language and and kind of giving that language to the the roof so that they could have some kind of cohesion was a very powerful thing and then what happened is that that inevitably became flavored or connected with the local culture so there's there's an interesting image that saint ephraim the syrian uses when he talks about the waters of paradise and he says the waters of paradise right when they start at the top of the mountain of paradise they're pure and as they move down the mountain they become more and more mitigated but none although they're mitigated they're nonetheless right the influence of the mountain down at the place where they are but they end up becoming mitigated and i think that that's probably the best way to understand how christianity should connect to local cultures is that it's like you establish the source and then the source flows down and starts to water the lower parts you know the the and and that happens in a way that the water become mitigated but they don't lose their completely lose their flavor but the problem today is that everything's so deliberate hard to so for example a good a good example would be let's say i'm i'm a greek missionary i go to russia and then i convert the tsar and i'm like yay all right so now i want to build a church so it's like i'll get maybe a few guys from thessaloniki or from from constantinople to come and build the church but i'm going to need the local materials i'm going to need the local people so the flavor of the church will become russian very fast but now you could just prop a church you could proper you can prop up an athenite church down anywhere in the world and it'll look like it just sprang it right out of the of the mountain so there's a way in which technology and and modernism makes it more difficult for that to happen naturally we might have to be more deliberate about it you know if we if we were doing that yeah and you can see perhaps you know divine providence in that and as you have to be more intentional about this kind of stuff that brings it more and more to your awareness which allows you to see the actual significance and what's going on there one of the images that i don't know if you have you ever read the book the patient ferment of the early church it's one of the images which was striking to me about that you know was that of fermentation and that it's a process which you know begins kind of invisibly but then as you get towards the end it speeds up very very rapidly and then soon you've got a fermented drink and it seems that you know as we've entered into the modern world with interconnectivity and all that kind of stuff a lot of these things which used to happen very slowly now just happened like that yeah and even though it looks less organic to us it's just it could be you could see it as the same sort of process but just going on at an incredibly quick speed yeah relative where it used to be you can see like the churches in africa like the churches in ghana and stuff like that you can see how now the church has been there for a few generations and so all of a sudden the tonalities will be different like you can still hear it it's connected it's still connected to to to let's say to byzantine culture but it has like you said it's fermented and so now the tonalities are different the rhythms are slightly different and so there's this slow embodiment you know within the the culture of the source but it it's it's hard because of political pressure today we would want to do it very fast but i think if we do it too fast we can also run the risk of making major mistakes so i don't like i in some ways i i have great mercy on the missionaries that are out there because how do you find the right that right balance you know how do you find it i don't know yeah yeah i know in when i was in kenya it was a number of years ago i remember at the cathedral one of the interesting things as you mentioned the tonality was different i know that the archbishop there was very intent on getting the liturgy translated not just swahili but also all the tribal languages and stuff but i remember during the eucharist and i'm not commenting one way or the other on this but i remember the eucharistic hymn was nothing but the blood of jesus which was so interesting to me just in terms of the way that actually you know catches i mean it's a good you know it's a good eucharistic hymn as far as it goes that's a bit yeah i wasn't so i lived in congo for four years and i i had the opportunity to be in the in the jungle like in the four we're almost in the forest when for pasca one year i was there doing all holy week and so and i didn't even know i was being able to go to church for for for the service but then someone i knew found a church for me drove me there saturday afternoon it's like there's this church like like i said this one was definitely had fallen out of heaven from thessaloniki and it was just like there and and i went in as like fresco's like greek frescoes everywhere and everything was so byzantine like and very well done like very well done byzantine but then it was only you know when we got to the the the when we started to kind of celebrate the resurrection we started saying christ has risen then it was like okay then africa started to appear and like women started utilating and like and everybody was like it was was making noise and i was like okay i'm back we're back you know so so i think that these things like yeah they'll break out like no matter what the missionaries try to do you know the the more the more connected pattern will break out ultimately you can't totally stop it yeah yeah so you have a i think you have a pretty substantial part of your audience which is not orthodox i mean i know just a lot of christians and just a lot of interested relatively secular people watch your content what do you think what what makes the orthodox church unique as kind of the air of this symbolic interpretation of the world and what what makes the the home of people who would see the world in this way well i think i mean i think that there's a more there's a practical way which is in some ways the orthodoxist to just preserve this language more i think that you know if you'd gone back a thousand years in the west you would have found similar structures like in terms of the the liturgy and the architecture and everything was all there and typological reading was all there but i think that ultimately there's a reason why orthodoxy was able to preserve this and it is the image of fiosis and i think that theosis is the is the key right it's the key to understanding that the world is full of his glory and we're not kidding like we're not joking about this we do believe that god you know upholds creation you know that his word is hidden in all manifestation and that that is not arbitrary that it that it looks like something it looks like love it looks like order it looks like a song and so it's like so so i think that that the the centrality of fiosis in orthodoxy i think is what has preserved the possibility of of helping people see this and encounter it and practice it you know and i and i don't think that because i do i think theosis is real so it's like so how can i say this so even though other christians don't necessarily emphasize it or sometimes don't believe it i still think that's what's keeping them together so so i do think that you can still encounter you know traces of that in other in other christian traditions but orthodoxy definitely has the the greatest symphony of it yeah yeah and i mean i think you see providentially i mean in the history of western theology in the 20th century some people i think people can miss just how deeply shaped a lot of western theology was by the fact that you had all these russian emigrant theologians coming over and in certain ways drawing out threads that were still there but were kind of dusty and now you have people in the west talking about theosis in terms which would be very intelligible to the church fathers and to to orthodox theology today and so i think that's really providential and i think you know that's to the extent that we can see what god is doing it's just intriguing to me that lots of people seem to be independently or relatively independently talking about symbolism in the way that you know the church talks about it in the way that you're talking about it and so it's just it's not that's not a coincidence i think that we are in a kairos moment i think that you know in some ways the ground had was prepared for a very long time and that you know you know 20 years ago my brother and i were talking about these symbolic ideas about patterns and everything and we could couldn't talk about it with anybody you just couldn't because not only did they not understand what we were saying they didn't understand the subject like what exactly we were talking about and so now we find ourselves in this moment where like you said independently in some ways these kind of fruits have grown up i don't know why i don't know exactly how that happened but it feels like like all of a sudden i can talk about things and you can talk about things and people know what you're talking about they understand it it and it's coherent and you know you can talk to bernata castro and you can say something like you could say something as crazy as you know the son of man sits at the right hand of the father and he'd be like yeah yeah you know i get it you know i get it and it's like how did this happen like how can i talk about logos and talk about you know this type of this type of imagery and then you know even a scientist will understand the structural relationship i'm trying to make and we'll we'll be able to at least cap at least understand that i'm not just spouting off woo-woo magic there's a structural reality here to what i'm talking about if you can see it so where do you see this going if you have any thoughts on that in the next 10 15 years yeah well yeah i think things are going to get a lot darker i'm sorry to say i don't think i think things are going to get a lot worse i think a good way to explain what's happening now is something like you know something like a there's a re-enchantment that's happening but that the re-enchantment is not just good news it just means that the barriers that materialism had placed around reality are breaking down right like the the materialist barriers that were kind of that work that held things together for a while that made us really proficient in creating machines and civilization and everything that that's starting to fray and crack and then you know narrative reality is is flooding back in and so i think we're going to see very dark things on the horizon but i do think that at the same time it is the ground in which you know a revival or whatever you want to call it of christianity will happen and so i do think what we'll see is we'll see the seeds grow in terms of a deep understanding of christianity but we'll also see the world around us becoming more and more hostile to it and more and more dangerous so sorry i see very i see light in the long term and a lot of darkness in the short term yeah well the c.s lewis you know he mentions how at different stages of the great conflict between christ and his enemies you know we fight that battle in different ways and so when people stop taking naturalism seriously i mean seems dirt and dark things no longer have a motivation to operate in a concealed way yeah what kind of direct conflict that's more visible and scarier yeah yeah so let's wrap up by talking about where you're going next what's what's on your horizon what projects are you working on so i mean one of the things that i'm mostly interested in doing now is telling better stories so i you know i wrote a graphic novel and i'm also writing fairy tales right now that's kind of what excites me because i i talk about we need better stories but then i also don't want to just be the guy analyzing and complain about how horrible culture is so so i think that's the thing that's really exciting that i'm part of there are a lot of things happening in the next in just in this year that are exciting in the sense that you know there are opportunities that so for example like this just this in the next few months i'm going to speak at princeton seminary i'm going to speak at at oxford possibly cambridge and it's like what right what's going on what's happening you know but it's like okay i mean let's go let's do this right i mean what why not you know it's it's like and and let's not you know let's not dance around it let's just let's just go so so in some ways i'm excited to see people understanding what it is we're talking about and being excited about it so so that's what that's what i i think that that's the thing that in some ways that that kind of drives me too because i'm like oh wow you know so yeah so that's what that's what that's what's happening in the next in the next year let's say wow that's really exciting dude did they reach out to you or yeah so different different people reach out to me for different reasons you know and it's of course let's be honest like it is in some part because of jordan peterson so jordan has you know has been this strange kind of intermediary character where he's not really a christian or kind of i don't know like it's not totally clear at least yet but he's pointing and he's kind of and and and so i always say it's kind of like king cyrus who says you know hey that temple of yours you know that's pretty cool you should go build it something like that and so so that's also how for sure to attract attention to what i'm doing and and ultimately hopefully to attract attention to this basic way of thinking and so so if that can happen and we can see that say bible scholars feel less because i'm not a bible scholar so it's obviously i'm not the one who's going to do the work but i think that if we can have bible scholars understand that this is a key way of seeing the world that that illuminates a lot of the of the biblical text then then we're going to see a lot more right we're going to see more of the scholarship and also like we talked about before i think ultimately and hopefully more of understanding the consequences of this way of seeing the world in terms of liturgy in terms of church in terms of what it means in practice so yeah well thank god and let's all pray for more light than darkness and the near future and the far future so so i have a question i have a question for you what about you like how do you see the role you're playing in terms of this because you're way more detailed than i am like like i've watched my videos i i love just how much you master the text and so what do you see that's in front of you like what do you see as the that which is calling you right now yeah i think i just have to focus in on biblical studies yeah i go through these periods where you know i'll be all in on like biblical studies and then it'll kind of expand outwards from there but i want to really kind of dive deep and systematically in some very specific books and god willing i'll be offering some stuff this year on something like exodus or isaiah just going line by line through the text and kind of doing the sort of thing we were talking about in terms of looking at the allegorical and symbolic meanings and kind of step by step showing okay this is why the text says this is how we can know that it says this and then kind of framing that in certain contexts in an apologetic way like this is how this is taught in the bible this is how we you know know that the church you know has an authoritative tradition but doing that in such a way that it's not just you know a series of proof texts or here's yeah reasons you shouldn't be protestant or whatever and doing it in a way that is that's beautiful you know yeah so that that they i mean for me i had a huge crisis of faith when i was in my early teens and then just struggled with doubts for many years afterwards but it was when i really started to study the bible in detail i perceived this kind of beauty in it and this just coherence that seemed like it came from you know another world and so i'm really excited about just showing that and showing how that works out and hoping other people can be drawn into the world of scripture yeah that's great and i think like you said i think it's a strange moment where that not only is possible but it's like people are strangely excited about it we did this it's we so we did this exodus seminar right you know about this like we did this exercise seminar for the daily wire yeah and so we get around we got like imagine pitching this to like a producer 10 years ago right we're gonna have seven people sitting around a table none of the people are actual theologians like none of the people are bible scholars and we're going to talk about exodus for 16 hours and we're not going to get through the book we're just gonna get through half the book and then like then we're gonna get back together i'm gonna do it again and we're going to talk about the last part for 16 hours it's like try selling that but turns out it's the most popular special on daily wire yeah it's like because it's like people are hungry they're like give me something give me some food man give me something good yeah and you know i think some of the most profound insights that i've heard on a given passage have been from people who really don't consider themselves much of a bible reader even i mean james jordan once described how like a five-year-old girl said hey if man turns to dust and the serpent eats dust doesn't that mean the serpent eats people and he goes wait a second satan is a roaring lion seeking can be made of our the idea of satan eating the dead giants or people eaters and things like that it's just a five-year-old girl who you know puts things together that we wouldn't usually put together and so it's super exciting not just to help people see that but you know to draw them in and help them produce insights of their own because yeah yeah it's an accelerating kind of compounding process that's great well ah man i'm happy to hope you find it'll be good to do some of the the more difficult books and some of those books yeah whoever has the guts to do judges you know let's do that oh yeah yeah but even like the the so i was interesting at the exodus seminar you know i with all my love for dennis prager so it's like you know i asked him like i even outside of the conversation outside of the film conversation i said and i said who's the figure in the book of of daniel like who is this figure that sits at the right hand of god you know and that has that looks like the son of man and he was just like well you know i don't know i don't know who that is and i was like it's interesting like it's like it's there right it's right there in the text so what is anyway so there's some definitely things to to elaborate on and if you look at the iconography you've probably seen this but the iconography of christ like the early images of christ are all mapped on to right the visions of the prophets in the old testament so if you see the image of the ascension in the rabulla gospels sixth century it's like crisis ascending into heaven and under him is like all these wings with eyes and and heads and wheels and it's like yeah that's because they knew that this is what was going on like the image divisions in the old testament yeah were revealing what christ was and his ascension into heaven is him returning in the same spot that is described in those in those prophetic visions yeah yeah and it's just thing about that vision in daniel is that you know daniel and ezekiel are in certain ways twin books they're yeah at the same time you're written i think in the same time ezekiel mentions daniel by name and that little phrase you know one like a son of man has one of its closest parallels in ezekiel one i saw one seated above the throne in the likeness of a man and so you know these i think your scripture has a very specific and precise theology of things like the angel of the lord you know it's not just this kind of vague thing which is hinting at you know something which is only becomes clear later there's really a lot of specificity to it and how it relates to the tabernacle system and all that kind of stuff so yeah that was something that i found really exciting when i was just starting to see the beauty of scripture i remember reading isaiah 2 and it said that the nations will cast away their idols when the lord rises to terrify the earth and he alone will be exalted in that day and i looked up those words i mean there's lots actually of resurrection puns i think in the old testament god rises and then things happen you're like oh wait that happened in the resurrection of christ but when it says the lord alone will be exalted in that day well you just go a few chapters later and you're to the end of the book and it says that the servant will be high and lifted up and he will be exalted and then he will sprinkle many nations that the nations are sanctified things like this so it all just rolls together in this way that you know makes an icon of christ and yeah inside the old testament on its own terms is really compelling i think in showing that there is actually a coherence to this statistics so father stephen deyoung on my channel recently you know he he he studied this quite a bit too and he was saying that it was so intense that in the in the early first second century judaism as it was burgeoning kind of being born that they they started writing commentaries about how that you know this image of the son of the son of man sitting you know next to god like that god punished him for it like you know you shouldn't sit you know you should stand like there's a mistake like you shouldn't be sitting at the the right hand of god right but it's like it shows you the deep the deep idea that the idea that this figure that daniel that daniel and ezekiel see right the fact that it's sitting means it's not an angel like it's at least not an angel in the regular way there's no way like it's not a servant servants don't sit and that's why we also like we just don't have that way of thinking anymore but like servants just don't sit the one who's sitting is the one who's being served and so it's not anyway it said it's it's it would be interesting to to go deeper into it but yeah there's definitely there's a lot to say about about that yeah i mean it's a book inspired by an infinite god so there's an infinite amount of things to say about it and that's what's so exciting is that you never run out of material that's right that's everything thanks for the conversation this is a lot of fun i enjoyed it yeah and i hope we can do it again sometime sure definitely all right thanks so much
