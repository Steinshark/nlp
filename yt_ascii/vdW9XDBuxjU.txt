you recently published the video of a lecture he gave at oxford presenting some aspects of a theory theory of everything called geometric unity so this was a work of 30 30 plus years this is his life's work let me ask her of the silly old question how do you feel as a human excited scared the experience of posting it you know it's funny one of the one of the things that you you learn to feel as an academic is the great sins you can commit in academics is to show yourself to be a non-serious person to show yourself to have delusions to avoid the standard practices which everyone has signed up for and you know it's weird because like you know that those people are gonna be angry he did what you know why would he do that and and what we're referring to for example there's traditions of sort of publishing incrementally certainly not trying to have a theory of everything perhaps working within the academic departments that all those things so this drew and so you're going outside of all that well i mean i was going inside of all of that and we did not come to terms when i was inside and what they did was so outside to me we're so weird so freakish like the most senior respectable people at the most senior respectable places were functionally insane as far as i could tell and again it's like being functionally stupid if you're the head of the cdc or something where you know you're giving recommendations out there aren't based on what you actually believe they're based on what you think you have to be doing well in some sense i think that that's a lot of how i saw the math and physics world as the physics world was really crazy and the math world was considerably less crazy just very strict and kind of dogmatic well psychoanalyze those folks but i really want to maybe linger on it a little bit longer of how you feel because yes is such a such a special moment in your life i really appreciate is a great question so that if we can pair off some of that other those other issues its new being able to say what the observer's is which is my attempt to replace space-time it's something that is both closely related to space time and not space time so i used to carry the number 14 as a closely guarded secret in my life and where 14 is really four dimensions of space and time plus ten extra dimensions of rulers and protractors or four the cool kids out there symmetric to tensors she had a geometric complicated beautiful geometric view of the world that you carry with you for a long time yeah did you did you have friends that you colleagues they essentially no talk no in fact part of these part of some of these stories are me coming out to my friends and i used the phrase coming out because i think that gays have monopolized the concept of the closet many of us are in closets having nothing to do with their sexual orientation yeah i didn't really feel comfortable talking to almost anyone so this was a closely guarded secret and i think that i let on in some ways that i was up to something and probably but it was a very weird life so i did write i have a series of things that i pretended to care about so that i could use that as the stalking horse for what i really cared about and to your point i never understood this whole thing about theories of everything like if you were gonna go into something like theoretical physics isn't that what you would normally pursue like wouldn't it be crazy to do something that difficult and that poorly paid if you were gonna try to do something other than figure out what this is all about now i have to reveal my cards my sort of weaknesses and lack and an understanding of the music of physics and math departments but there's an analogy here to artificial intelligence and often folks come in and say okay so there's a giant department working on quote-unquote artificial intelligence but why is nobody actually working on intelligence like it you're all just building little toys right you're not actually trying to understand and that breaks a lot of people and that they it confuses them it's like okay so i'm at mit i'm at stanford i'm at harvard i'm here i dreamed of being what kind of artificial intelligence why is everybody not actually working on intelligence and i have the same kind of sense that that's what working on the theory of everything is that's strangely you somehow become an outcast for even but we know why this is right why well it's because let's take the artificial let's play with agi for example yeah i think that the idea starts off with nobody really knows how to work on that and so if we don't know how to work on it we choose instead to work on a program that is tangentially related to it so we do a component of a program that is related to that big question because it's felt like at least i can make progress there and that wasn't where i was where i was in it's funny there was this book of called friedan uhlenbeck and it had this weird mysterious line in the beginning of it and i tried to get clarification of this weird mysterious line and everyone said wrong things and then i said okay well so i can tell that nobody's thinking properly because i just asked the entire department and nobody has a correct interpretation of this and so you know it's a little bit like you see a crime-scene photo and you have a different idea like there's a smoking gun and you figure that's actually a cigarette lighter i don't really believe that and then there's like a pack of cards then you think huh that looks like the blunt instrument that the person was beaten with you know so you have a very different idea about how things go and very quickly you realize that there's no one thinking about them there's a few human-sized to this and technical size both of which i'd love to try to get down to so the human side i can tell from my perspective i think it was before he prefer stand april fool's maybe the day before i forget but i was laying in bed in the middle of the night and somehow it popped up you know i my feed somewhere that your beautiful face is speaking live and i clicked and you know it's kind of weird how the universe just brings things together in this kind of way and all sudden i realized that there's something big happening in this particular moment and strange like any day on a day like any day and all of a sudden you were thinking of you had this somber tone like you were serious like you were going through some difficult decision and it seems strange i almost thought you were maybe joking but there's a serious decision being made and there's a wonderful experience to go through with you i really appreciate it was april 1st yeah it was it's kind of fascinating him he's just the whole experience and and and so that i want to ask i mean thank you for letting me be part of that kind of journey of decision-making that took 30 years but why now why did you think why did you struggle so long not to release it and decide to release it now anna while the whole world is on lockdown an april fool's is it just because you like the comedy of absurd ways that the universe comes together i don't think so i think that the cova epidemic is the end of the big nap and i think that i actually tried this 7 years earlier in oxford so i and it was too early which part was too is it the the platform because you're alive i'm not quite different now actually the internet i remember you i read several your brilliant answers that people should read for the edge one of them was related to the internet and it was the first one wasn't the first one and that's they called go virtual young man yeah yeah that seemed that's like forever ago now you all that was ten years ago and that's exactly what i did is i decamped to the internet which is where the portal lives the portal of the portal yeah once i told the theme that surah - the music was shit he just listened to forever i actually started recording tiny guitar licks for the audio portion not for the video portion you kind of inspired me with bringing your guitar into the story but keep going you see you thought so the oxford was like step one and you kind of you put your foot into the in the water to sample it but it was too cold at the time so you didn't want to step it was really disappointed what was disappointing about that experience very is it's a hard thing to talk about it has to do with the fact that and i can see this in this you know as mirrors a disappointment within myself there are two separate issues one is the issue of making sure that the idea is actually heard and explored and the other is the is the question about will i become disconnected from my work because it will be ridiculed it will it will be immediately improved it will be found to be derivative of something that occurred in some paper in 1957 when the community does not want you to gain a voice it's a little bit like a policeman deciding to weirdly and enforce all of these little-known regulations against you and you know sometimes nobody else and i think that's kind of you know this weird thing where i just don't believe that we can reach the final theory necessarily within the political economy of academics so if you think about how academics are tortured by each other and how they're paid and where they have freedom and where they don't i actually weirdly think that that system of selective pressures is going to eliminate anybody who's going to make real progress so that's interesting so if you look at the story of andrew wiles for example with from last last theorem hehe as far as i understand he pretty much isolated himself from the world of academics in terms of the big with the bulk of the work he did and it from my perspective is dramatic and fun to read about but it seemed exceptionally stressful the first step he took the first steps he took when actually making the work public that's him to me would be hell yeah but it's like so artificially dramatic you know he leads up to it at a series of lectures he doesn't want to say it and then he finally says it at the end because obviously this comes out of a body of work where i mean the funny part about for moz last theorem is that wasn't originally thought to be a deep and meaningful problem it was just an easy to state one that had gone unsolved but if you think about it it became attached to the body of regular theory so he built up this body of regular theory gets all the way up to the end announces and then like there's this whole drama about okay somebody's checking the proof i don't understand what's going on in line 37 you know and like i was a serious seems a little bit more serious than we knew i mean do you see parallels you share the concern that the year your experience might be something similar well in his case i think that if i recall correctly his original proof was unsalvageable he actually came up with a second proof with a colleague richard taylor and it was that second proof which carried the day so it was a little bit that he got put under incredible pressure and then had to succeed in a new way having failed the first time which is like even a weirder and stranger story has an incredible story in some sense but i mean a you i'm trying to get a sense of the kind of stress i think this is okay but i'm rejecting what i don't think people understand with me is the scale of the critique it's like i don't you people say well you must implicitly agree with this and implicitly agree it's like not try me ask before you you decide that i am mostly an agreement with the community about how these things should be handled or what these things mean keo keo and also just why this criticism matter so much here so you seem to dislike the burden of criticism that it will choke away all a lot of different kinds of criticism there's constructive criticism and there's destructive criticism and what i don't like is i don't like a community that can't first of all like if you take the physics community just the way we screwed up on masks in ppe just the way we screw it up in the financial crisis and mortgage-backed securities we screw it up on string theory can we just forget the string theory happened or sure but let if somebody should say that right somebody should say you know it didn't work out yeah but okay but you're asking this like why do you guys get to keep the prestige after failing for 35 years that's an interesting question you guys because to me where the profession look these things if there is a theory of everything to be had right it's going to be a relatively small group of people where this will be sorted out absolutely it's it's not tens of thousands it's probably hundreds at the top but within that within that community there's the assholes mm-hmm there's the i mean you have you always in this world have people who are kind open my mind is it's a question about okay let's imagine for example that you have a story where you believe that ulcers are definitely caused by stress and you've never questioned it or maybe you felt like the japanese came out of the blue and attacked us at pearl harbor right and now somebody introduces a new idea to you which is like what if it isn't stress at all or what if we actually tried to make resource start of japan attack us somewhere in the pacific so we could have cast a spell i to enter the asian theatre in persons original ideas like what what do you even say you know it's like two crazy well when dirac in 1963 talked about the importance of beauty as a guiding principle in physics and he wasn't talking about the scientific method that was crazy talk but he was actually making a great point and he was using schrodinger and i think it was schrodinger was standing in for him and he said that if your equations don't agree with experiment that's kind of a minor detail if they have true beauty in them you should explore them because very often the agreement with experiment is that it's an issue of fine tuning of your model of the instantiation and so it doesn't really tell you that your model is wrong and of course heisenberg told dirac that his model was wrong because that the proton and the electron should be the same mass if they are each other's antiparticles and that was a an irrelevant kind of silliness rather than a real threat to the dirac theory but okay so i'm amidst all this silliness hmm i'm hoping that we could talk about the journey that geometric unity has taken and will take as an idea and an idea that will see the light yeah that so first of all let's i'm thinking of writing a book called geometric unity for idiots okay and i need you as a consultant so can we first of all i hope i have the trademark on geometric unity you do good can you give a basic introduction of the goals of geometric unity the basic tools of mathematics use the viewpoints in general for idiots sharik me okay great fun so what's the goal of geometric unity the goal of geometric unity is to start with something so completely bland that you can simply say well that's a something that begins the game is as close to a mathematical nothing as possible in other words i can't answer the question why is there something rather than nothing but if there has to be a something that we begin from let it begin from something that's like a blank canvas that's even more basic so what is something what are we trying to describe okay right now we have a model of our world and it's got two sectors one of the sector's is called general relativity and the other is called the standard model so we'll call it gr for general relativity and sm for standard model what's the difference you need to what did the two describe so general relativity gives pride of place to gravity and everything else is acting is a sort of a backup singer gravity is the star of the show gravity is the star of general relativity and in the standard model the other three non-gravitational forces so if there are four forces that we know about three of the four non-gravitational that's where they get to shine great so tiny little particles and how they interact with each other so photons gluons and so-called intermediate vector bosons those are the things that the standard model showcases and general relativity showcases gravity and then you have matter which is accommodated in both theories but much more beautifully inside of the standard model so what what is a theory of everything do so about that so first of all i think that that's that that's the first place where we haven't talked enough we assume that we know what it means but we don't actually have any idea what it means and what i claim it is is that it's a theory where the questions beyond that theory are no longer of a mathematical nature in other words if i say let us take x to be a four dimensional manifold to a mathematician or a physicist i've said very little i've simply said there's some place for calculus and linear algebra to to dance together and to play and that's what manifolds are they're the most natural place where that where our two greatest math theories can really intertwine which are that you own the tacos the linear algebra okay now the question is beyond that so it's sort of like saying i'm an artist and i want to order a canvas now the question is does the canvas paint itself does the can't does the canvas come up with an artist and an in paint and ink which then paint the canvas like that's the that's the hard part about theories of everything which i don't think people talk enough about okay can we just you bring up a sure and then hand the drums itself as a the fire that lights itself or drawing hands the drawing hands yeah and every time i start to think about that my mind like shuts down no don't do that there's a spark and this is the most beautiful part we know it's beautiful but this robots brain sparks fly so can we try to say the same thing over and over in different ways about what what would you mean by that having to be a thing we have to contend with sure like why why do you think that understand creating a theory of everything as you call the source code our understanding our source code require a view like the hand the draws itself okay well here's what goes on in the regular physics picture we've got these two big main theories general relativity in the standard model right think of general relativity as more or less the theory of the canvas okay maybe you you have the canvas and a particularly rigid shape maybe you've measured it so it's got length and it's got angle but more or less it's just canvas and length and angle and that's all that there's really general relativity is but it allows the canvas to warp a bit then we have the second thing which is this import of foreign libraries where it which aren't tied to space and time so we've got this crazy set of symmetries called su 3 cross su 2 cross u 1 we've got this collection of 16 particles in a generation which are these sort of twisted spinners and we've got three copies of them then we've got this weird higgs field that comes in and like deus ex machina solves all the problems that have been created in the play that can't be resolved otherwise so that's the standard model of quantum field theory just plopped on top yes it's a problem of the the double origin story one origin story is about space and time the other origin story is about what we would call internal quantum numbers and internal symmetries and then there was an attempt to get one to follow from the other called kaluza klein theory which didn't work out and this is sort of in that vein so you said origins story so in the hand that draws itself what is it so it's it's as if you had the canvas and then you ordered up also give me paint brushes paints pigments pencils and artists but you're saying that's fucked like if you want to create a universe from scratch the canvas should be generating the paintbrushes and the paintbrush and they are turning the canvas yeah yeah right like usually who's the artist in this analogy well this is sorry then we're gonna get to do a religious thing i don't wanna do that okay well you know my shtick which is that we are the ai we have two great stories about the simulation and artificial general intelligence in one story man fears that some program we've given birth to will become self-aware smarter than us and will take over in another story there are genius simulators and we live in their simulation and we haven't realized that those two stories are the same story in one case we are the simulator and another case we are the simulated and if you buy those and you put them together we are the agi and whether or not we have simulators we may be trying to wake up by learning our own source code so this could be our skynet moment which is one of the reasons i have some issues around it i think we'll talk about that because i well that's the issue of the emergent artist within the story yeah just to get back to the point okay so so now the key point is the standard way we tell the story is is that einstein sets the canvas and then we order all the stuff that we want and then that paints the picture that is our universe so you order the the paint you order the artist you order the brushes and that then when you collide the two gives you two separate origin stories the canvas came from one place and everything else came from somewhere else so what are the mathematical tools required to to construct consistent geometric theory you know make this concrete well somehow you need to get three copies for example of generations with 16 particles each right and so the question would be like well there's a lot there's a lot of special personality in those symmetries where would they come from so for example you've got would would be called grand unified theories that sound like su5 the georgia a theory there's something that should be called spin 10 but physicists insist on calling it s oh 10 there's something called the petit salam theory that tends to be called su 4 across su 2 cross su 2 which would be called spin six cross pin four i can get into all of these but what are they all accomplishing they're all taking the known forces that we see and packaging them up to say we can't get rid of the second origin story but we can at least make that origin story more unified so they're trying-- grand unification is the attempt that's a mistake in your in you've got a mistake that the problem is it was born lifeless when when georgia in class how first came out with the su5 theory it was very exciting because it could be tested in a south dakota mind filled up with like a cleaning fluid or something like that and they looked for proton decay and didn't see it and then they gave up because in in that day when your experiment didn't work you gave up on the theory it didn't come to us born of a fusion between einstein and and and bohr you know and that was kind of the problems it had this weird parenting where it was just on the bohr side there was no einstein ian's contribution lex how can i help you most i'm gonna try to figure what questions you want to ask so that you get the most satisfying answers there's there's a there's a bunch there's a bunch of questions i want to ask i mean one and i'm trying to sneak up on you somehow to reveal in an accessible way then the nature of our universe so i can just give you a guess right like i we have to be very careful that we're not claiming that this has been accepted this is a speculation but i will i will make the speculation that what i think what you would want to ask me is how can the canvas generate all the stuff that usually has to be ordered separately all right should we do that let's go there okay so the first thing is is that you have a concept in computers called technical debt you're coding and you cut corners and you know you're gonna have to do it right before the thing is safe for the world but you're piling up some series of i/o used to yourself and your project as you're going along so the first thing is we can't figure out if you have only four degrees of freedom and that's what your canvas is how do you get at least in stan's world einstein says look it's not just four degrees of freedom but there need to be rulers and protractors to measure length and angle in the world you can't just have a flabby four degrees of freedom so the first thing you do is you create ten extra variables which is like if we can't choose any particular set of rulers and protractors to measure length and angle let's take the the set of all possible rulers and protractors and that would be called symmetric non-degenerate two tensors on the tangent space of the four manifold x four now because there are four degrees of freedom you start off with four dimensions then you need four rulers for each of those different directions so that's four that gets us up to eight variables and then between four original variables there are six possible angles so four plus four plus six is equal to 14 so now you've replaced x four with another space which in the lecture i think i called you 14 but i'm now calling y 14 this is one of the big problems of working on something in private is every time you pull it out you sort of can't remember it you name something something new okay so you've got a fourteen dimensional world which is the original four dimensional world plus a lot of extra gadgetry for measurement and because you're not in the four dimensional world you don't have the technical debt no now you've got a lot of technical debt because now you have to explain the way a fourteen dimensional world which is a big you're taking a huge advance on your pay day check alright but aren't more dimensions allow you more freedom says i mean maybe but you have to get rid of them somehow because we don't perceive them so eventually have to collapse it down to the thing that we procedure you have to sample a four dimensional filament within that fourteen dimensional world known as a section of a bundle ok so how do we get from the fourteen dimensional world where i imagine a lot of folks wait wait yeah you're cheating the first question was how do we get something from almost nothing like how do we get the if i've said that the who and the what in the newspaper story that is a theory of everything are bosons and fermions so let's make the who the fermions and the what the bosons think of as the players and the equipment for a game are we supposed to be thinking of actual physical things with mass or energy okay so they think about everything you see in this room so from chemistry you know it's all protons neutrons and electrons but from a little bit of nut these physics we know that the protons and neutrons are all made of up quarks and down quarks so everything in this room is basically up quarks down quarks and electrons stuck together with with the the what the equipment okay now the way we see it currently is we see that there are space-time indices which we would call spinners that correspond to the whoo that is the fermions the matter the stuff the up quarks the down quarks the electrons and there are also 16 degrees of freedom that come from this in the space of internal quantum numbers so in my theory in fourteen dimensions there's no internal quantum number space that figures in it's all just spin oriole so spinners in fourteen dimensions without any festooning with extra linear algebraic information there's a concept of a spinners which is natural if you have a manifold with length and angle and why 14 is almost a manifold with length and angle it's it's so close it's in other words because you're looking at the space of all rulers and protractors maybe it's not that surprising that a space of rulers and protractors might come very close to having rulers and protractors on it itself like can you measure the space of measurements and you almost can and in a space that has length and angle if it doesn't have a topological obstruction comes with these objects called spinners now the spinners are the stuff of of our world we are made of spinners they're the most important really deep object that i can tell you about they were very surprising what is this spinner so famously there are these weird things that require 720 degrees of rotation in order to come back to normal and that doesn't make sense and be the reason for this is that there's a knotted miss in our three-dimensional world that people don't observe and then you know you can famously see it by this dirac string trick so if you take a glass of water imagine that this was a tumbler and i didn't want to spill any of it and the question is if i rotate the cup without losing my grip on the base 360 degrees and i can't go backwards is there any way i can take a sip and the answer is this weird motion which is go over first and under second and that that's 720 degrees of rotation to come back to normal so that i can take a sip well that weird principle which sometimes is known as the philippine wineglass dance because waitresses in the philippines apparently learned how to do this that that move defines if you will this hidden space that nobody knew was there of spinors which dirac figured out when he took the square root of something called the klein-gordon equation which i think had earlier work incorporated from carton and killing and company in mathematics so the spinners are one of the most profound aspects of human existence let me forgive me for the perhaps dumb questions but what a spinner be the mathematical objects that's the basic unit of our universe when you when you start with a manifold which is just like something like a doughnut or a sphere circle or a mobius band a spinner is usually the first wildly surprising thing that you found was hidden in your original purchase so you you order a manifold and you didn't even realize it's like buying a house and finding a panic room inside that you hadn't counted on it's very surprising when you understand that spinners are running around on your spaces again perhaps a dumb question but we're talking about 14 dimensions and four dimensions what is the manifold or operating under in my case it's proto space-time it's before it's before einstein can slap rulers and protractors on space-time and when you mean by that sorry to interrupt is space-time is the 4d manifold space-time is a four dimensional manifold with extra structure most of the extra structure it's called a semi romanian or pseudo romani and metric in in essence there is something akin to a four by four symmetric matrix from which is equivalent to length and angle so when i talk about rulers and protractors or i talk about length and angle or i talk about romani and or pseudo-riemannian or semi romani and met manifolds i'm usually talking about the same thing can you measure how long something is and what the angle is between two different rays or vectors so that's what einstein gave us as his arena his place to play his his canvas there's a bunch of questions i can ask here but like i said i'm working on this book geometric unity for idiots and i think what would be really nice as your editor to have like beautiful maybe even visualizations that people could try to play with try to try to reveal small little beauties about the way you're thinking about this world i'll usually use the joe rogan program for that sometimes i have him doing the philippine wine glass dance i had the hopf fibration the part of the problem is is that most people don't know this language about spinners bundles metrics gauge fields and they're very curious about the theory of everything but they have no understanding of even what we know about our own world is it is it a hopeless pursuit so like even gauge theory right just this i mean it seems to be very inaccessible is there some aspect of it that could be made accessible i'm actually go to the board right there and give you a five lecture i engage theory that would be better than the official lecture engaged there you would know what gauge theory was so it is it is possible to make it accessible yeah but nobody does like in other words you're gonna watch over the next year lots of different discussions of a quantum entanglement or you know the multiverse where are we now right or you know many worlds are they all equally real yeah did that right i mean yeah that that's it but you're not gonna hear anything about the hopf fibration except if it's from me and i hate that why why can't you be the one but because i'm going a different path i think that we've made a huge mistake which is we have things we can show people about the actual models we can push out visualizations where they they're not listening my analogy they're watching the same thing that we're seeing and as i've said to you before this is like choosing to perform sheet music that hasn't been performed in a long time or you know the experts can't afford orchestras so they just trade beethoven symphonies and as sheet music and they oh wow that was beautiful but it's like nobody heard anything they just looked at the score well that's how mathematicians and physicists trade papers and ideas is that they they write down the things that represent stuff i want to at least close out the thought line that you started yes which is how does the canvas order all of this other stuff into being so i at least like i say some incomprehensible things about that and then we'll we'll have that much done all right and that just point does it have to be incomprehensible do you know what the schrodinger equation is yes do you know what the dirac equation is what does know mean well my point is you're gonna have some feeling that you know what the schrodinger equation yes as soon as we get to the dirac equation your eyes are gonna get a little bit glazed yeah right so now why is that well the answer to me this is that you you want to ask me about the theory of everything but haven't even digested the theory of everything as we've had it since 1928 when dirac came out with his equation so for whatever reason and this isn't a hit on you yeah you haven't been motivated enough in all the time that you've been on earth to at least get as far as the dirac equation and this was very interesting to me after i gave the talk in oxford new scientist who'd done kind of a hatchet job on me to begin with sent a reporter to come to the third version of the talk that i gave and that person had never heard of the dirac equation so you have a person who was completely professionally not qualified to ask these questions wanting to know well how does how does your theory solve new problems like well in the case of the dirac equation will tell me about that i don't know what that is so then the point is okay i got it you're not even caught up minimally to where we are now and that's not a knock on you almost nobody is yeah but how does it become my job to digest what has been available for like over 90 years well to me the open question is whether what's been available for over 90 years can be there could be a a blueprint of a journey that one takes to understand it not all i want to do that with you and i i one of the things i think i've been relatively successful at for example you know when you ask other people what gauge theory is you get these very confusing responses and my response is much simpler it's oh it's a theory of differentiation where when you calculate the instantaneous rise over run you measure the rise not from a flat horizontal but from a custom endogenous reference level what do you mean by that it's like okay and then i do this thing with mount everest which is mount everest is how high then they give the height i say above what then they say sea level and i say which sea is that in nepal like oh i guess there isn't a sea cuz it's landlocked it's like okay well what do you mean by sea level oh there's thing called the geoid i'd never heard of oh that's the reference level it's a custom reference level that we imported so you all sorts of people have remembered the exact height of mount everest without ever knowing what it's a height from well in this case in gauge theory there's a hidden reference level where you measure the rise and rise over run to give the slope on the line what if you have different concepts of what of where that rise should be measured from that vary within the theory that are endogenous to the theory that's what gauge theory is okay we have a video here right yeah okay i'm gonna use my phone if i want to measure my hand and its slope this is my attempt to measure it using standard calculus in other words the reference level is apparently flat and i measure the rise above that phone using my hand okay if i want to use gauge theory it means i can do this or i can do that or i can do this or i can do this or i could do it i did from the beginning okay at some level that's what gauge theory is now that is an act now i've never heard anyone describe it that way so while the community may say well who is this guy and why does he have the right to talk in public i'm waiting for somebody to jump out of the woodwork and say you know eric's whole shtick about rulers and protractors leading to a derivative derivatives are measured as rise over run above for reference level of reference level stuff it to get like i go through this whole shtick in order to make it accessible i've never heard anyone say it i'm trying to make the prometheus would like to discuss fire with everybody else all right i'm gonna just say one thing to close that the earlier line which is what i think we should have continued with when you take the naturally occurring spinners the unadorned spinners the naked spinners not on on this fourteen dimensional manifold but on something very closely tied to it which i've called the chimeric tangent bundle that is the the object which stands in for the thing that should have had length and angle on it but just missed okay when you take that object and you form spinners on that and you don't adorn them so you're still in the single origin story you get very large spin oriole objects upstairs on this fourteen dimensional world y 14 which is part of the observers when you pull that information back from y 14 down to x 4 it miraculously looks like the adorned spinners the festooned spinners the spinners that we play with in ordinary reality in other words the 14 dimensional world looks like a four dimensional world plus a 10 dimensional complement so 10 plus 4 equals 14 that 10 dimensional complement which is called a normal bundle generates spin properties internal quantum numbers that look like the things that give our particles personality then make let's say up quarks and down quarks charged by negative one-third or plus two thirds you know that kind of stuff or whether or not you know some quarks feel the weak force and other quarks do not so the x4 generates y 14 y 14 generates something called the chimeric tangent bundle chimeric tangent bundle generates unadorned spinners the unadorned spinners get pulled back from 14 down to 4 where they look like adorned spinners and we have the right number of them you thought you needed 3 you only got 2 but then something else that you've never seen before broke apart on this journey and it broke into another copy of the thing that you already have two copies of one piece of that thing broke off so now you have two generations plus an imposter third generation which is i don't know why we never talked about this possibility in regular physics and then you've got a bunch of stuff that we haven't seen which has descriptions so people always say does it make any falsifiable predictions yes it does it says that the matter that you should be seeing next has particular properties that can be read off like like we guys to spend weak hypercharge like the responsiveness to the strong force the one i can't tell you is what energy scale it would happen at say you would you can't say if those characteristics can be detected with current it may be that somebody else can i'm not a physicist i'm not a quantum field theories i can't i i don't know how you would do that the the hope for me is that there's some simple explanations for all of it like should we have a drink you're having fun no i'm trying to have fun with you you know there's a bunch of fun things to talk about here anyway that was how i got what i thought you wanted which is if you think about the fermions as the artists and the bosons as the brushes and the paint what i told you is that's how we get the artists what are the open questions for you in this what were the challenges so you're not done well there's the things that i would like to have in better order so a lot of people will say see the reason i hesitated on this is i just have a totally different view than the community so for example i believe that general relativity began in 1913 with einstein and grossman now that was the first of like four major papers in this line of thinking to most physicists general relativity happened when einstein produced a divergence free gradient which turned out to be the gradient of the of the so called hilbert or einstein hilbert action and from my perspective that wasn't true is is that it began when einstein said look this is about differential geometry and it's the final answer is going to look like a curvature tensor on one side and matter and energy on the other side and that was enough then he published a wrong version of it where it was the ricci tensor not the einstein tensor then he corrected the reach the ricci tensor to make it into the einstein tensor then he corrected that to add a cosmological constant i can't stand that the community thinks in those terms there's some things about which like that there's a question about which contraction do i use there's an einstein contraction there's a ricci contraction they both go between the same spaces i'm not sure what i should do i'm not sure which contraction i should choose this is called a shia operator for ship-in-a-bottle and my stuff you have this big platform in many ways that inspires people's curiosity about physics yeah automatics right now and i'm one of those people and great but then you start using a lot of words that i don't understand and like i might know them but i don't understand and what's unclear to me if i'm supposed to be listening to those words or if it's just if this is one of those technical things that's intended for a very small community or if i'm supposed to actually take those words and start you know a multi-year study not not a serious study but a the kind of study when you you're interested in learning about machine learning for example or any kind of discipline that's where i'm a little bit confused so you you speak beautifully about ideas you often reveal the beauty in mathematic and i'm unclear and what are the steps i should be taking i i'm curious how can i explore how can i play with something how can i play with these ideas well and and enjoy the beauty of not necessarily understanding the depth of what the theory that you're presenting but start to share in the beauty as opposed to sharing in and enjoying the beauty of just the way the passion with which you speak which is in itself fun too - but also starting to be able to understand some aspects of this theory that i can enjoy - and start to build an intuition what the heck we're even talking about because you're basically saying we need to throw a lot of our ideas of views of the universe out and i'm trying to find accessible ways in okay long not in this conversation no i appreciate that so one of the things that i've done is i've i've picked on one paragraph from edward wit and i said this is the paragraph if i could only take one paragraph with me this is the one i'd take and it's almost all in prose not an equation and he says look this is this is our knowledge of the universe at its deepest level and he was writing this during the 1980s and he has three separate points that constitute our deepest knowledge and those three points refer to equations one to the einstein field equation one to the dirac equation and one to the yang-mills maxwell equation now one thing i would do is take a look at that paragraph and say okay what do these three lines mean like it's a finite amount of verbiage you can write down every word that you don't know if you can say what do i think done now young man yes there's a beautiful wall in stoneybrook new york built by someone who i know you will interview named jim silence and jim simons and he's not the artist he's the guy who funded an world's greatest hedge fund manager and on that wall contained the three equations that witten refers to in that paragraph and so that is the transmission from the paragraph or graph to the wall now that wall needs an owner's manual which roger penrose has written called the road to reality let's call that the tome so this is the subject of the so called graph wall tome project that is going on in our discord server and our general group around the portal community which is how do you take something that purports in one paragraph to say what the deepest understanding man has of the universe in which he lives it's memorialized on a wall which nobody knows about which is an incredibly gorgeous piece of art and that was written up in a book which is has been written for no man right maybe if maybe it's for a woman i don't know but no no one should be able to read this book because either you're a professional and you know a lot of this book in which case it's kind of a refreshers to see how roger thinks about these things or you don't even know that this book is a self-contained invitation to understanding our deepest nature so i would say find yourself in the graph wall tome transmission sequence and join the graph wall tome project if that's of interest okay beautiful now just to linger on a little longer what kind of journey do you see geometric unity taking i don't know i mean that's the thing is that first of all the professional community has to get very angry and outraged and they have to work through their feelings this is nonsense this is bullshit or like no wait a minute this is really cool actually i need some clarification over here so there's going to be some sort of weird coming back together process are you already hearing murmurings of that it was very funny officially i've seen very little so it's perhaps happening quietly yeah you
