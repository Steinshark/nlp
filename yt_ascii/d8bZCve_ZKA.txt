what do you do when you're running a business that's hemorrhaging money with absolutely no end in sight if you go ltt 2.0 hardcore mode what are you guys doing still sleeping come on let's get a move on the labs team in logistics has been hard at work getting everything set up here at lab 2 and while i haven't given you guys an update in a while that's all the more exciting things for me to share with you today there's power to the psu tester our laser keyboard scanner is working we've got a metal 3d printer we've got our brand new rf chamber behind me on those four pallets and there is so much more for me to show you today i'm so so excited excited to tell you about our sponsor xsplit xplit is a software company that provides simple but effective broadcasting and video production tools for live streaming their programs work with your favorite platforms like twitch youtube and facebook and you can check them out today and use code linus for 69 off your first purchase or subscription nice [music] none of the cool stuff we're doing happens without the people so our tour begins in desk land the lab is already up to nine people and we've got room for up to a dozen more in spite of the fact that it has generated no revenue whatsoever but who needs revenue when you've got cool stuff like this you've already met our keyboard testing robot cave but cave has got a mustache i mean 3d laser profiler with this add-on cave cannot only find the exact location of every key on the keyboard in order to do is actuation testing but he can handle keyboards in all kinds of different sizes and shapes jake danes will show us so this is that keyboard over there yep that's right this is the drop control and this is the 3d point cloud that we generate with the laser profiler so cool so we've got exact height data for every part of this keyboard which allows us theoretically then to nail dead center every single key well it's not just the height data before we hit the camera system and that has lens distortion which meant on the edges of the keyboard we were a little out on either side with this we actually do a sweeper custom entire keyboard on a single axis so we have exact positional data it's not just the height it's also the x and y position cool i know you guys are eager for us to start publishing and it must feel like we're just not doing anything over here but that's not the case at all it's just way more important for us to find these edge cases where we might be out a little bit pun intended then for us to just start dumping data out into the world for another example of the importance of professionalism here is our totally legit ip testing chamber column don't make that face this was your idea oh well i mean he didn't have a way for me to lower the phone in so i had to improvise yes but the point is that this is how we are going to test manufacturers claims about the waterproofness of their phones i don't know if this one is actually ip68 rated you just dropped it six feet oh well let me pull it back up we should bring how about three feet yeah three feet three feet should be good yeah cool anywho can you explain why we did this instead of like the fancy professional one well if we got a custom tank made effectively what we need is six feet of depth right because pressure is all about the height of the water column above the device sure it would have been forty five hundred dollars five grand or eight hundred dollars this novelty children's light from aliexpress today it's not for aliexpress it's from amazon it's actually from a very reputable company in the uk it's a children's sensory toy what do you think of the odds this thing still works it depends on the ip rating and whether or not google's being truthful which is i guess what we're going to find out yeah i don't even know oh yeah okay it still turns on still works i mean that doesn't mean it will still work a little bit of distilled water is not going to immediately kill it still oh what's the plan then we put moisture sensors inside the phone and then we put it in and we monitor it it's a semi-destructive test manufacturers claim that you can submerge your device for x amount of time at a certain depth we're testing that pass fail and if it's pass fail if they're lying then i'd get to buy another phone four or more okay it's not my money did i mention there's no revenue yet the space in between the rows of test benches is a bit of a long story there's going to be the shelves here which is pretty much an inbox for these folks everything that is to be tested and then the actual width of this space was a miscommunication because they thought we needed a bunch of space for lighting in between but i actually want the lab to be all about testing testing testing so we're probably going to either shove this one in or shove that one over this way to make room for more people meanwhile hi nick here is sitting in desktop component testing land and he's working on something oh that we cannot talk about yet but i'm sure is really cool very cool very cool nick works on our internal benchmarking software called mark bench and it has evolved a lot since the last time you guys got to look at it what can i do now more games yep we we have some more games that we can cover that's a lot of games we can do not games most of the improvements are actually in our data visualization and prototyping of data analysis in the back end so there's not too much to show on the screen but you guys have complained about our graphs many many times over the years and one of nick's top priorities for the first couple of quarters this year is to help the rest of the team figure out how to make that whole process a more automated and b easier for you guys to read can i ask about this yeah that's gary's assignment while we wait for benchmarks to complete he says coloring inside the lines creates discipline well i obviously don't have any here at the end of desktop testing land is going to be our new rf chamber which as it turns out is not going to use any of the components from the original blue chamber at all so that is all just going to be stuffed into the walls of our acoustic chamber i think yeah right yeah and that's that's it so we're essentially going to shred it but that's fine because we have a brand new rf chamber that is worth somewhere on the order of two hundred thousand dollars oh no that's just the foam what that's just the foam oh yeah no it's it's about a half mil cool the foam is from tdk who i really only knew as like maker of blank dvds but apparently they do a lot of other stuff cost aside my understanding is that the new chamber is like way better than the old one because this is better film or something yeah so the frequencies that this is attenuated to yeah is much wider than the old foam it's brand new it's you know it's not in a heap of garbage so yeah the way that this is gonna work is we're actually gonna have to have walkway panels because this is going to coat the floor ceiling and walls so it's going to be fully anechoic within the rf spectrum that we're testing so raymond emc they're they're a canadian company they're they've been awesome they're working with us on this we should hopefully have a built by may okay and yeah they're they've been great to work with shout out raymond dmc actually everyone who's helped us get the lab set up has been so enthusiastic just about there being this testing for consumers it's been kind of whatever the opposite of disheartening is it's been heartening heartening yeah it's been it's been heartening to see how many people just want there to be independent testing for consumers that doesn't mean all this crappy blue foam is going to be wasted though the space that i'm standing in right now is going to be our audio isolation chamber where we'll be able to get accurate acoustic measurements of everything from graphics cards to laptops to freaking i don't know we could do an air conditioner if we really wanted to i guess right yeah we could basically anything and to beef up its design we're going to be using a dual shelled construction so we're going to have obviously good acoustic foam on the inside but in between the walls we need some kind of filler that's where you come in loser then next to the audio isolation room we're going to have what about second audio isolation room this is going to be a home theater so while we could use that chamber to test things like headphones and small consumer electronics if we want to test something big like tower speakers you need not only a properly isolated room but a large enough room that it will be an accurate representation of the kind of space that that product is intended to be used in this room will also be lighting controlled so we can test everything from projectors to tvs to i mean i guess we could do monitors in here in a pinch yep would we just do monitors in here all the time probably okay probably everything i've talked about so far is scheduled to be done either this quarter or in the next but as we move into the second half of the year we're obviously going to keep building and i'm standing now in what is going to be our camera testing room this is going to be a super cool space we don't need noise isolation here but we absolutely need lighting control and we're going to have all kinds of everything from test patterns to interesting things that move around to camera shake simulating rigs and all kinds of new stuff but that's going to take some time as you can tell there's clearly still a lot more to sort out in the move like this guy needs to be unpacked this is our metal 3d printer and i have to confess i actually don't know a ton about how these work that's exciting that's why tim's here we're going to learn we can't actually show you a whole lot of it because there's a lot of it as trade secrets and we have an agreement with rapidia that we can't show that however we can talk about how it works so this thing is going to take some really cool compressed metal particulate and it's going to heat it up and it's going to lay it in lines just like you would a normal 3d printer sure and it's going to just kind of halfway solidify it's going to harden a little bit and then we take that part and we put it in this guy the sintering oven and this evacuates all of the air and it adds a whole bunch of argon gas and then it basically pulls a vacuum so that the the heat the energy that the oven creates is not wasted it's at a much lower pressure it can get much hotter for the same amount of energy okay and i guess that that energy consumption is why we have this sitting next to the electrical panel here basically this is a temporary home while we renovate the workshop over at the other unit we have a project coming up soon the all metal pc alex and i are really stoked to see what this thing can do to try and make things like fan blades and and all sorts of water cooling equipment out of metal but stuff that we've designed this is nuts that is nuts yeah how does this handle overlays is it going to be like a standard 3d printer where you have to make supports or is it going to be like an sls where you could just have a cavity inside a part if you wanted you just like wash it away or so that's really interesting because of the fact that we're printing with metal you can't just take a set of pliers and like pull away at the supports after it's been through the center the fact is that we would have to actually cut those through with a drill or with a machine of some other sort so what you want to do is design your part in a different way there's a there's a different set of processes that you need to go through for checks and balances to make sure that you are not creating something that you can't use it needs a name we need a name what are we going to name it ash he's the champion okay we're gonna also fire or i guess that should be ash then that's ash and catch him ash and ketchum i don't know sure i'm not good at this now i'm standing in what is apparently the lounge where people lounge and have meetings i asked hey is this temporary because a bunch of couches in the middle of the warehouse doesn't really seem like the most efficient use in space and i was told no in fact this is permanent and they don't care that every square foot of this costs something to the tune of about 610 canadian dollars thankfully the usefulness per unit squared of other areas will be a little bit higher i'm standing in what's going to become an ltt filming set of some sort so that we don't have to truck everything over from the lab to the studio in order to make videos for in a hurry and then over here is our power supply tester which you've met before but is now finally actually wired up so chroma can come and train us on it and an environmental chamber which will do both temperature control and humidity control so being next to the power supply tester you guys can probably imagine that we are going to test power supplies in it but we could use it for just about anything like say for example if you wanted to know how the battery life of a phone changes depending on the environment that it's in this is exactly what you'd use or bulb but we'll be there right now it's just a broom and a squeegee and some poses you might have noticed our oscilloscope is still missing but i assure you we've ordered one now finally and we've spoken with johnny of corsair formerly of johnny guru about the best methodologies for testing the newest power supplies and you can expect a really solid update on this in the near future here we'll have camera supplies and long-term storage which wait storage yeah what's the deal with all the storage at this place i thought this is supposed to be a lab well in talking to the logistics team we determined that if the lab is going to have the vast majority of the in and out for products if they're not here it is going to be a gigantic hassle so we decided to move our entire logistics department and all of our storage here to the lab to make things simpler to give you some idea what i'm talking about this is all the keyboards that antoine has checked out right now for testing thanks a lot antoine and this is a fraction of what we're going to be going through as new products continue to be released so these shelves are for the lab and then this is all our own internal inventory which is currently being organized by the one and only jamie row number one is going to be peripheral land then so you got your keyboards mice headphones headsets all that good stuff then as we round this corner the veneer of organization falls away to reveal complete and utter chaos we have some moving vlogs actually up on floatplane.com they're exclusive over there if you guys want to check them out we'll have that linked in the video description but for now hey let's talk to the one and only dan what the devil are you working on and why is it important you're not testing that motherboard are you no wait what is this so excel was running a little bit slow so i thought i'd built myself oh shut up this is like a dual socket workstation thing what is it actually seen on gold this is part of our new windshield 100 uptime system so serve a great no down time ever again ultra stable raid one on some ssds a4000 for the video card because i need the video memory a little bit of respect we'll see if how this performs maybe it's overkill i don't know dan space is one part diagnostic workstation one part cinematic workstation how the devil did you end up with that monitor it's the only one we had i used to use a single 1080p monitor and one part electronics rework station anytime that something goes terribly terribly wrong it ends up on this desk and then either goes back to the manufacturer or dan attempts to fix it after which it gets sent to e-waste no i mean if he fails it goes to e-waste sometimes he wins this is pretty phenomenal too these bamboo labs printers are amazing two of them are just hooked up to like gigantic spools and they're for printing things in bulk like all the self-congratulatory trophies that dan is apparently making with my filament and this middle one is hooked up to four of these multi-filament spool units here so it can actually print in 16 different materials and the whole thing gets changed over automatically and they are all accessible over the network you can call it when you think these three over here are just kind of standard filaments this one here actually has three spools of carbon fiber reinforced pa which is super strong and basically indestructible and then this one here is a washable support material so you add sports and then you dunk it underwater and it all melts away this aisle is going to be for pc diy this aisle is going to be for systems and consumer electronics and then the aisle over there is going to be for bulky stuff like tvs along the bottom and then anything that we put into our standard workstations so any inventory we keep for click cases and stuff like that it's just gonna be all piled up there you're probably wondering why we don't have another shelf above that and the answer is very simple that's as high as we're allowed to go with the sprinkler system in this building unless we completely redesign the sprinkler system which would cost a fortune wait something's happening this is our receiving bay and what did we get it looks like foam it actually just looks like foam probably 20 grand right there is it what no shut up there's this can't be expensive foam this is expensive foam yeah what's inside protection for the expensive phone oh this is the protection those are our walkway caps walkway cats so because the foam is on the floor yeah we have to be able to walk on something so these have been air freighted from japan that's where they're manufactured so this is what we're gonna be walking on have the desk set up on in the 4g 5g network next to the day we've got angus from accounting's couches that he didn't have anywhere to store but he's definitely going to be taking away very soon and what will go here is the procurement department right now they're upstairs completely separate from logistics and having those departments together is hopefully going to smooth out a lot of communication challenges you've already met four key here wow that's solid and then we've also got our own cherry picker now so we'll be able to take that down the aisles here and grab things and put them down and all that good stuff up here is we don't know land maybe stuff that's to be sold but i kind of said gee if we know we're getting rid of it should we really be dragging it upstairs only so we can drag it back down and they were like yeah that's a good point we just don't know what else to put there so cool some plans haven't changed in here for example is going to be the development team for the lab's website and then i oh hey tim is gary's desk out there now i don't think gary has one gary doesn't have a desk i don't think it's been approved yet okay the plan here has changed though this is now going to be a lunchroom slash lounge which really raises the question of why they need another lounge out there but i don't know realistically at some point we're probably going to end up putting desks in here you know you know how these things go and then this is going to be for the mac address team which is a team now and not just jonathan horst this is still the server room jake has been trying to figure out how to deal with the noise isolation problems that we're having in this room basically we don't have a solution unless oh it looks like you're going to propose something awful we're going to try to rebuild the wall if that's even possible there's no insulation in that wall and it doesn't even go all the way up so if we have servers running in here the poor social media team who's going to be on the other side is going to end up with tinnitus a little bit less social here's the room for the aforementioned social team though with that transformer that sounds like it's mounted above the ceiling tile i think the server might be the least of their concerns in here this is the worst room in the building bar none i'm sure if you told you know the labs team in procurement and logistics hey you guys don't have to work at a warehouse anymore you get to come into this room they'd be like nah dog i'm gonna keep my warehouse up here the only real change is that instead of doing the desks like we painstakingly mapped out on the floor with masking tape we have completely reconjiggered the layout and it's going to be like elves that face each other like for linus tech tips else actually that's a t all that's up here right now is some leftover stuff that labs hasn't moved down into their workspace yet like you know just casual rtx 3090s and 4090s sitting around the amount of gear in this place it's like gear heaven this is going to be my office a couple call rooms luke's office and that's it oh no it isn't unfortunately sam's not here today so i can't give you guys an exact rundown of everything you're looking at but the important thing is our head and torso simulator is oh my god that's heavy okay i'm not gonna move it is finally here so we can actually headphones to have yours you've probably seen some of those results in our videos recently this is going to be luke's office and sam is going to do all his work in one of the acoustically isolated chambers and then we've got a brilliant plan for out here now because of the building code something something sorry andy we can't wall this in and we can't turn it into office space this is technically warehouse mezzanine but what we can do is we can get those little meeting pod self-contained things and just plonk a bunch of them down here and after some rough measurements that we actually did today because that's an idea we came up with while i was here credit to jake is that your idea i think so good idea we think we can get two six-person meeting rooms and like two more single or dual person meeting rooms now you guys are probably wondering how on earth are we doing the networking for all this massive shout out ubiquity i think we've got a total of four access points in the office and then another eight out in the warehouse giving us full wi-fi six gigahertz so wi-fi 60 coverage absolutely everywhere in this building it is ripping fast which you guys will have seen in the most recent upgrade video that i did for the wi-fi at my house we're obviously going to have to do some small renaults here just make it look kind of decent before we plunk those media rooms down and you put a bunch of foam here maybe some improvements to the lighting oh shout out eaton2 for all the like the cable channel that they're providing for the the white wiring that we're doing yeah that's enough of it to go from over here all the way to the end in like out four times yeah proper networking and stuff i know right even the outside networking is done properly we've got these unify access reader things jake always changes my name to stuff it says the tech tips guy himself and then we've also got their what are these unifi 6lr yeah yeah so these long range access points out here are so we can have great wi-fi in the parking lot no just kidding there because our car chargers which are there there there and there can all be controlled so that they can be turned off at a certain time at night so we don't have people just like rolling into our parking lot in the middle of the night charging their car on our electricity and then leaving this is a park for employees and only employees minus media group.com jobs can we take a moment with all the good today to acknowledge what is terrible about this what were they thinking with this color scheme you've got brown brown other brown and faded brown yeah the fading isn't really doing it any favors i freaking hate it just like i hate not telling you about our sponsor snooze having trouble sleeping snooze might be able to help you out did you know because your brain keeps processing sounds when you're
