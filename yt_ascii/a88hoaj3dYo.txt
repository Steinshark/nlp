it's time i share with you the craziest thing about living in denmark in most countries when you're buying bananas they sell it to you by the kilo in denmark they sell it to you by the piece so it can cost maybe 25 cents for a banana and it doesn't matter how small a big the banana is it's always going to be 25 cents so long story short recently they had some sort of importation of extra big bananas so my house is filled with bananas now since i got 10 kilos for only 2 euros and yeah i think it's crazy that they do it by the piece but you know what else is crazy the new ui in pycharm and this video just aims to show you exactly what it is as you can see i'm in the preferences and in preferences you have this new setting called new ui which is currently in beta so i just clicked on that to apply it to my pycharm and restarted pycharm so practically the new ui is a work in progress effort to reduce the visual complexity of the ide and help users focus on their work and i just read that from here because it was a lot easier than saying that by myself so you might have noticed the contrast is a bit higher we have this weird blue button at the top right hand corner we now have the current folder at the bottom so right now i'm in main.pi in my folder here so all the directories are at the bottom and the sidebar has some special icons so if we click on something such as semicolon you're going to notice at the bottom that it's going to give you the directories at the bottom here so scheduled shorts and semicolon now according to the docs it's only recommended that you use the default light and dark modes not other themes because that's currently what they are trying to work on and they also mentioned that there are a lot of new icons that are supposed to give us some more distinguishable shapes and colors and now it's using a font called inta and what was most important to me when i heard this is does it work with ligatures which it does so i don't care at all but if we go to settings and we click on appearance here just says i'm using apple system ui font but if we find the font for the editor so we go editor font i'm still using jetbrain's mono so let's find out exactly what this inter font is can i find it and yeah here it is so let's look at what intel looks like because apparently it was not enabled by default and so far just looks like a compacted version of what i had earlier but my ligatures are not so happy i mean a lot of you probably prefer that i do not use ligatures i absolutely love ligatures ah so that ligature worked let's try one more time let's say x is equal to or more than one and we now have new ligatures this is even worse for you guys after all the complaining i got now i have new symbols to play around with so a lot of the ligatures aren't really working it seems like if i go to settings and open up the font and go down here we'll see that actually a lot of these ligatures do not work and if i turn that off and turn it on again only by coincidence did that right arrow work another thing you probably noticed is that the tool window over here has the icons on the bottom and on the top the top ones are quite usual but the ones on the bottom where we have terminal and the python console feel a bit different then we have a project finder in the top left hand corner and we have our version control here and on windows this is supposed to look different you might even have a hamburger icon which allows you to have more context options and another interesting design choice they introduced is having the debug or the breakpoint symbol over the actual number instead of on the side of it and that was supposedly an effort to reduce the amount of horizontal space it occupied previously all in all it does look quite nice i do appreciate the elevated contrast that is something i personally love usually when i'm programming in pycharm i have this this theme called darkula darker and it's supposed to be darker than the original dark theme which i appreciate a lot because i love that contrast but let's go back to the font and i'm a big fan of jetbrain's mono so i will remain inside jetbrain's mono because i get my ligatures back so i will apply that and click on ok so it looks relatively good it might take you a moment to adjust from the previous version and let's see if we go to appearance and behavior and we disable it and click on apply and ok you'll see immediately that there will be some changes but we had to restart it to get this fully updated version so it's just something fun to try out in case you're curious i mean the previous version was fine and i think a lot of people are not going to change because this just is so much more familiar for a lot of developers but i think i will change and give it a go for the next few months and if i don't like it i'll just go back to this until we're forced to adapt the new ui but anyway that was a quick preview on the new ui that they introduced in pycharm i know a lot of you use visual studio code so this might actually be irrelevant but for those of you who do use pycharm give it a go tell me what you think in the comment section down below i'm curious to hear about it and as always with that being said thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next video i mean seriously look how big this banana is and it only costs 25 cents
