hello everyone and welcome i previously made a video claiming that tesla's model s plaid wouldn't actually have a 0 to 60 of under 2 seconds and about 6 weeks later motor trend actually got their hands on a model s plaid and they were able to test it out upon which many of you came back to my video and commented basically saying i have no idea what i'm talking about which is unfortunate because if you read motor trends article you would read that they said we can confirm the 2.0 second 0-60 barrier remains unbroken so in other words motor trends data shows that what i predicted previously was correct and actually my predictions were better than what tesla did tesla did worse than i thought they would in this zero to 60 with the model s plaid so the premise of the previous video was that tesla shadily hides the fact that the only way the model s plaid goes from 0 to 60 in under 2 seconds is if you delete the first foot of acceleration which makes it more realistically a six to sixty mile per hour test not a zero to sixty time which is nonsense and not only that tesla only deletes the first foot of acceleration on their fastest models not the base models so it's not only misleading but it's also inconsistent so i made this helpful chart here so that we can make sense of motor trends tested 0 to 60 times so if you take a model s plaid and you drive it on a drag strip which is covered in a vht track bite which is basically glue for a drag strip so a prepared drag strip and you delete that first foot of roll out then your 0 to 60 time is 1.98 seconds so if you believe that cars drive on glue which most do not and you believe that 0 is equal to 6 which i don't think it is then the 0 to 60 time was actually 1.98 seconds great if you believe that cars drive on roads and that it's okay to delete that one first foot of acceleration well motor trends tested time is 2.07 seconds so this is the time that motor trend would say it did 0 to 60 in which again is greater than 2 seconds now if you believe 0 is equal to zero but cars drive on glue and not on roads well we don't know what that number is yet motor trend hasn't given it out yet but it'll probably be somewhere in about the 2.2 second range and then if you do believe that cars drive on roads and you do believe that zero equals zero then the actual zero to sixty time that this tesla model s plan achieved was 2.28 seconds now in my previous video when i was saying that tesla wouldn't hit that 0 to 60 in under 2 seconds the number i came up with was 2.19 seconds and in reality it's 0.09 seconds slower than that so 2.28 seconds so again you can choose you know which one of these do you want to believe but in my head there is only one that's remotely accurate motor trend took the car they tested it on you know typical asphalt and they started the timer at zero miles per hour instead of six miles per hour and they got a zero to 60 acceleration of 2.28 seconds which by the way is the fastest production car they have ever tested from 0-60 so it's super exciting it's just it wasn't done in under two seconds so let's get into a little bit this prepped surface and talk about you know why this doesn't make sense to do well first of all most cars drive on roads they don't drive on glue so this stuff this stuff that's called vht track bite it's basically glue for a you know to prepare a drag surface and motor trend says they use quite a bit of it if you look at images of this stuff on google you'll see the like glue attaching to the tires as it's driving shoes will get stuck in fact motor trains said their shoes were almost getting stuck to the surface there was so much of this stuff put down so the thing is it's not impressive for a race car to hit 0-60 in under 2 seconds plenty of them do it and they've done it for a long time so that's not what's exciting here right what's exciting is the potential of a production car doing it in production car environment right on a road with street legal tires that's what's cool if it were to do it race cars have been doing it for a long time so who cares if you can do it on a prepared drag strip also tesla says according to motor tran tesla says that they believe most of their customers will be driving these on the drag strip well the ironic thing is unfortunately that's probably not going to happen because nrha tracks don't allow you to drive cars without a full roll cage that have a quarter mile time of less than 10 seconds which this absolutely does and tesla's not going to offer the options all of the things required in order for this thing to actually legally go down an nhra track so that's a bit silly right now one final point on this prepped surface debate because no one actually tests this way so i actually messaged the journalists who wrote this article for motor trend and said is it safe to assume that when motor trend does 0-60 tests they're not doing any track prep vht and that you typically wouldn't report numbers with vht hence being so open about it in this article and then christian wrote back yeah that's a very safe assumption like we mentioned in the story as far as our records show we've tested on vht twice in the last 72 years both with drag prepped cars we always test on plain old asphalt like you find on any roadway in an effort to deliver numbers that consumers can replicate in the real world so what does that mean well if you want to believe motor trends standard for how they test 0 to 60 times that number is 2.07 seconds now i don't agree with their standard we'll get into that and so if you don't agree with that standard well then the actual 0-60 time is 2.28 but either way whichever one you pick the 0 to 60 is not under 2 seconds okay so now let's talk about this standard because everyone says it's okay to say the 0 to 60 is under 2 seconds because of this standard of deleting that first foot of roll out well first of all not every auto magazine does this it's mostly a north american trend because we do zero to 60 miles per hour not zero to 100 kilometers per hour but math is the universal standard like saying something like starting at six miles per hour is not a universal standard if you tell someone in another country hey do this test from zero they're gonna think you actually mean zero math is universal zero means zero it doesn't mean six so that's why it makes no sense to say it's the standard to say that you have to delete that first foot of movement makes no sense to do second of all not all the manufacturers do this a lot of people say this is what all the manufacturers do if you look at porsche 0 to 60 numbers they're very conservative when dodge came out with the dodge demon which they were claiming was going to have the fastest 0-60 of 2.3 seconds they were not deleting that first foot of rollout in fact the current ceo of dodge brands who wasn't the ceo at the time but was very high up within the dodge world said rollouts aren't a fair way to do 0-60 honestly a real 0-60 is from a dead stop and i think that's just such a simple thing to agree with that zero means zero it's like why are we debating what zero means it means zero that's very easy great now on top of that as if that wasn't enough tesla isn't even consistent in their own materials so for their performance miles they delete that first foot of rollout for their non-performance models they don't so they're not even consistent they're not even going by a standard as everyone likes to call it now in my previous video i did say something that was wrong i was wrong it's not that hard to say people get over it it's not a big deal you just say it you move on feels great so i was wrong i thought no car could accelerate faster from zero to 60 then it could stop from 60 to zero and this tesla proves that theory wrong so very cool 0 to 60 in 2.28 seconds if you do the math it's able to accelerate at 1.199 g's on average from true zero to true 60 miles per hour motor trend tested at 60 to zero and it was able to stop in just 104 feet which means its average deceleration was 1.156 gs so that's pretty wild because if you think about it you've got air resistance when you're coming to a stop you've got abs which is pretty tricky and it's working to make sure you stay at peak friction as you come to a stop and yet it's able to accelerate faster than that rate that is very cool this is the only car i know of that does that and that's super exciting now some people have said well you know it's on ps4s tires might it be able to do a better 0-60 on better tires of course yes if you put on drag tires it's going to improve its time maybe even some street tires out there the thing to keep in mind with this is that these are going to be a unique tire to the car right so like tesla model 3 performance that comes with unique special michelins for that exact car same with the model s so they can tweak the compound they can tweak the construction so you don't know if it's actually any worse than some of the like theoretical best tires out there it could be really good a good example of this is the pilot super sports on the 2014 corvette this is an old generation tire they were able to hit 60 to zero in 90 feet they were beating tires that were better than them but it was a unique compound for the corvette and that's the same case here with the tesla we don't know what this unique compound is so it could be that this actually is the best for the car for accelerating and for decelerating now one final point to close this out you don't have to lie to be cool so tesla can say one of two things in this scenario they can say we have the only production car that's capable of going from zero to 60 in 1.99 seconds and that's a lie and it really doesn't mean that much right if you're not in the automotive world and obsessed with these 0 to 60 numbers what does 1.99 seconds mean doesn't mean anything right or they could actually tell the truth and say we have the quickest accelerating production car motor trend has ever tested period boom we beat everybody that's exciting that's actually true and yet that's not what they choose to say they choose to say this nonsense about under two seconds so that's what irritates me about it i think it's very cool what they did it's incredible how fast this car is thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments please feel free to leave them below
