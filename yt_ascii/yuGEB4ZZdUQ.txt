- i've been having a really
crazy problem recently. watch, when i tie this
shoe, it does not stay tied. look, see, look, i just tied
it and it's not staying tied, and i think i know why. this is a map of america. this is where we currently are. i think our state just isn't good for tying shoes, all right. so here's what we're gonna do. chris, take this shoe. so you have that shoe, you're gonna go, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom, and tie it in all those states. i'm gonna drive and go, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, tie it in those states, and we're gonna find which state it works for tying shoes. - i'm not sure that's how that works. - i don't care, go. - okay, bye. - bye. damn it, this state doesn't work either. onto the next one. we're coming up on georgia, we're like seven hours in. stay posted, jake paul-ers. we are right on the border of georgia, we're basically in georgia, right here, drove through south carolina. and you know what that means? i think this one might actually work. i'm pretty excited, i think it worked. not again. what's the next state? alabama. - we're over florida right now. - devices must remain in airplane mode until after we land. - just gonna go ahead. we seriously cannot move our leg. boom.
- wait, wait, i think, oh, what? where's the sign? oh, hey. hey, that says tennessee. hell yeah, boys. i think i got it. - hey jimmy, where are we man? - chattanooga. - stopping at a hotel. - hell yeah. all right. - what do you mean who is this? - all right, boys,
hopefully this state works. i feel pretty good about this state, i think it might actually work. not again. - we just landed here in
louisiana, now it's time. currently we are flying over the arkansas and tennessee border, so imma tie this shoe twice. there's one. there's two. - chris is asleep. we're over kentucky now. boom. so that is for kentucky. apparently you can't tie your shoe and keep it tied in kentucky. chris is still sleeping. as you can see, we are
now coming into wisconsin. - here we are in michigan. - why does your shoe keep coming untied? - i don't know. maybe one day we'll figure it out. - all right, guys, we
