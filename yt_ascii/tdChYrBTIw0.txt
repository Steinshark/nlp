in this video i'm going to be showing you one of the new features we got in python 3.12 in the ita tools module and this is called batched so let's create an example so we can see how it actually works and to do so i'm going to first create some sample data and the data is going to be a list of type integer from the range of 1 to n then we can actually create the batch by creating a variable called batch of type batched and that's going to equal the batched method with the data passed in and we need to decide how many batches we want to create from this data and in this example i'm going to create four and let's see what happens when we print this batch right now if we run the code as is we're going to get back and it tools. batched object but that doesn't really tell us what this looks like so we have two options here we can either loop through this batch which is essentially just a generator or we can convert it to some sort of iterable such as a list or a tuple and in this example i'm first going to convert it to a list so you can see exactly what the batch method does so right now if we convert it to a list and print the result you'll see that we're going to get back a list of tupal and each tuple contains a batch of four elements or at least it attempts to create a batch of four elements until it's exhausted as you can see for number nine we didn't have four elements so it was only able to insert one if we were to add a 10th element such as number 10 we would have n9 and 10 in that batch and you can choose what kind of batches you want you can even say it can be in batches of three and it will end up looking like this now we have two pools that contain batches of three elements until the data is exhausted and don't worry about these inlay hints i think they're actually quite funny especially the abcd efg it's a ridiculous inlay hint but pycharm shows it by default for me so i'm going to leave it there if you don't have inlay hints enabled it's just going to look like data and three which probably looks much better than what my code editor is showing you but anyway that's actually all i wanted to cover in today's video do let me know what you think about this new feature in the comment section down below but otherwise as always thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next video
