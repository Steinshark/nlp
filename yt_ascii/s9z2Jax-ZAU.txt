has tik tok programming like culture improved let's find out hey how are you i'm good i'm good that's great yeah so overall you're performing well your reviews have been positive no complaints that's great to hear do you have anything else you want to discuss today no not really okay sounds good yeah i don't have anything else either we'll circle back in a few months okay sounds good talk soon yeah i've had those meetings yeah hey how are you everything's good can't complain nice just give me one second okay sure hello hi look i don't have good news for you today you know i think there is nothing worse in life when you get a meeting that also has hr on it okay like i actually feel for this video i genuinely feel for this video the moment hr appears in a meeting i'm like we're it's so over it's so over every time yeah so i'll just get straight to the point after for careful consideration and discussion we have decided to not move forward with your employment here is this really happening with some organizational shifts happening we feel like you're just not ready to move on with us you said i was good is there anything we can do about this what do you mean like can this be fixed in any way oh no do you have anything else you want to talk about i guess not all right then we'll have someone reach out to you about your exit instructions goodbye good luck with everything good luck yeah i mean i guess we just watched a video of someone pretending to be fired all right tick tock tick tock programming let's go okay here we go next one hardest code to [music] understand welcome to costco i love you i forgot to turn off alerts forget your ears i'm gonna say that i just cringed i cringed hard i'm cringing i i can feel it it's i i'm having i don't know what to do with what i feel okay like do do i need to talk to somebody do i need to go somewhere and talk to a professional okay i don't know what this guy's doing but this motion this not programming okay whatever this motion is with the screen in the darkness and everything this isn't programming people to [music] stay my face cry i [music] just [music] i don't i i get the joke you start off you're happy right you're happy things are great and you're just programming stupid stuff and then as time goes on you feel horrible you look horrible and you're programming complicated things okay when the code actually works i'm pretty sure my thing is wrong but it passed what the [ __ ] why is it working it should have am i a genius what h okay let's let's put a different example yo like this shouldn't work this should not work like why is it working bro wake up you should why is this you know the thing that mostly gets me is not when something does or does not work like that but when i put in a print statement and it starts working that's truly a moment of pure wtf like that is emotional pain it is it is it is awful i absolutely hate it i sit there and wonder am i even a programmer how have i done this the quantum physics of programming absolutely and it happened to me recently where i put in two print statements and things started working again and then i just and then and then i just i i become emotionally bruised can we stop doing this no we're going to do one more we're going to do one more okay here we go time out time time out time out time out first off what what's in there why does it look so creamy why does it look so thick okay so i got to ask when you were learning to program and you got some sort of elgato stream deck what's going on here if you have to press a button on a stream deck to open up the thing you want maybe you got to find a better optimization here okay i feel like you could we could get this better i i'm positive we can get this better we got to figure out something a little bit you know a little nicer way let's use the computer let's get you know i think what we're missing here is a good window manager i could fix her i could fix her i could get her a window manager and t-u i could fix her okay if you just give me the chance i could do it you know i think i realize why tik tok hates me i think i understand it now all right one we're going to do one more realistic day of an engineer yeah so for me yesterday i did what i was supposed to do yesterday and today i'm going to do what i'm supposed to do today and that's pretty much it from my side this literally makes no sense how's it again i i i actually understand why tik tok hates me i like to i like to work hard and study and and think of new things i did like his daily standup though i did stuff that i did yesterday and today i'll be doing stuff i did today i love that that was beautiful because you know what most daily standups are they're just people like oh yeah so yesterday you know what was funny my dog rufus and then it's just like oh shut up just say what you got to say no one wants to be here shut up no one cares about your dog rufus it's just the worst i don't want to do any of that i don't want to do any of it [ __ ] rufus i don't want any of it okay well i think that after watching a total of seven tik toks i have relearned why i don't like tik tock the name is i still don't even get i don't even get tik tok yet okay i don't get it i i i didn't get it before i still don't get it today okay i'm too old or too young i'm one of the two and i don't know which one it is but i'm not the correct age for whatever this is whatever just happened on my screen i'm either a boomer or a zoomer one of the two a jen
