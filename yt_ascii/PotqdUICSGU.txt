digital eye strain is something that affects about 65 percent of the connected population and today i've partnered up with invisible shield to show you a solution that i don't think you saw coming i'll spare you the lecture but essentially there are three things to bear in mind number one a big part of the problem comes from blue light which is emitted from your phone screens in large quantities to create the bright whites you see number two because this light is high-energy it's waves scatter and your eyes have to strain to focus them and over three this continuous strain can lead to dry irritated eyes sleep loss as well as reduced attention spans and so with this in mind there are three options option a is you can stick it out and enjoy your phone's screen as it is b is to use a software-based blue light filter which is a feature we're seeing baked into more and more small phones and it's not a bad solution but in trying to remove the harmful light it ends up cutting off almost the entire blue portion of the light spectrum which makes your screen go from something like this to something closer to this and then that we've got c which is sitting inside this box and it's a solution that i hadn't heard about until three weeks ago so scary open okay inside this press kit there's a whole bunch of different items first of all a booklet showing you how the technology works and why it's important and then underneath that we've got a products themselves the slogan here is love your eyes and the idea of this item is that it protects not just your smartphone from you but also you from your smartphone inside the packaging we've got the product itself which feels like a heavy duty glass screen protector there's a sticky pad to remove dirt a screen cleaning cloth and a manual also an alcohol wipe and a mounting bracket which is going to make installation easier speaking of which that's all there is left to do so we clean up the phone remove any dirt and place it on i didn't actually end up using the bracket but it can help you to line up the protector okay so this is the glass plus vision guard and you might be thinking it looks an awful lot like a screen protector and it is but one with a twist you're getting the standard impact turn scratch resistance because this is tempered glass and there's a smudge resistant layer on top here but more importantly or the company calls vision guard there is a layer here called the isafe layer which like a blue light filter removes harmful blue light from the spectrum but it does so by targeting filtration of only the highest intensity blue light not all of it and so within natural colors of your display are maintained it is also tuv rheinland certified which is like an official seal of approval when it comes to blue light filtration kind of in the same way that an ip rating gives you peace of mind for water and dust resistance so that's the protector and now it's time to see if it works so what i've set up now other three scenarios we've talked about on the far left you've got the blue light filter on in the middle the glass plus vision guard and on the far right the normal display without any protection and i'm sure most people will agree that the screens just look better in the latter two scenarios but the crazy thing here is that while this protector is removing harmful blue light it does so without making the screen have that yellowish tone if anything it's actually got a cooler tone than the normal screen or wouldn't know protector on so that's the product what do you guys think to it i'll leave a link in the description below and it's available for all the latest iphone and pixel devices as always thank you so much for watching my name is aaron this is mr. who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
