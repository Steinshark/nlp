hello, everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be discussing what happens when an engine has no oil as a demonstration will be viewing an engine with and without oil running this is the exact same engine on the left and the right on the left with oil and on the right without both engines will start at the exact same time, but the video on the right was filmed 24 hours after the video on the left allowing for the engine to completely cool. this is a 212 cc. air-cooled single-cylinder harbor freight engine i'll be keeping the oil equally classy using not just any oil but high performance premium motor oil from the grocery store my whole point for this is to [show] what even the cheapest engine oil can do versus nothing at all. it's api certified, but i wouldn't personally use this in my cars there are five points we're monitoring on each engine point one is the crankcase below the level at which oil will rest point two is on top of the crankcase where they're obviously won't be any oil resting near point 3 is the air-cooled cylinder bore? point 4 is the exhaust pipe exiting the cylinder before entering the muffler and point five is the valve cover this is a push rod style valve train with overhead valves so at this point. you're wondering wait a minute why is the engine with oil so much hotter than the engine without? well, it's because i'm an idiot and left to choke clothes on the engine without oil for over two minutes even still after about seven minutes the engine without oil catch up and exhaust temperature one thing i did want to make sure of is that there was no reason other than the oil that the engine on the right would have higher temperatures than the engine on the left as a result its throttle is just slightly lower the choke was closed for far longer and it is in about one degree cooler ambient air any temperature that's higher on the right engine is purely a result of extra heat from not having lubrication now as you can see the surface of the engine is highly reflective of thermal imaging as a result calibrating for the material is challenging however if you see the frame freeze this is the camera calibrating and immediately after a frozen image the temperature values will be the most accurate ambient air temperature is about 15 to 16 degrees celsius though the engine was stored in my garage before filming which kept its temperature slightly cooler let's go ahead [and] fast-forward to [8] minutes where now the engines are operating at similar conditions to be honest. i was surprised how trouble-free it seeing the engine was up until this point it sounds fine and temperatures are no higher than the engine with oil as proof that the engine has no oil in it look at points 1 and 2 you can see a large temperature differential as the warm oil resting at the bottom is hotter than the crankcase on the right? points 1 and 2 are the same as there's only air on the other side of the crankcase for each point i'll admit watching the temperatures side-by-side i was a bit disappointed how much cooler the engine without oil managed to be it goes against my intuition but then again if i knew what would happen from the start there'd be no point in doing this so it's cool [to] see my best explanation is that the oil acts as a heat sink for the engine helping the engine with oil remain at higher temperatures than without without the oil the amount of energy stored internally is less than the amount of energy emitted through the air so it's cooler that said combustion temperatures are obviously a bit higher as the exhaust temperatures remains high on the right? after 15 minutes the only temperature that's actually hotter for the no oil engine is the exhaust and just slightly so what's my recommendation here if you want your engine to run cool? you should remove all the oil no no absolutely not fun pleased with what i've seen so far i decided to open up the crankcase and have a look inside here's where it became obvious permanent damage had occurred first of all look at the small amount of oil but didn't [quite] make it out while draining it's quite dark and this is after a 15 minute run with oil and 15 minutes without in a brand new engine i kept the oil which i drained out after the first test and you can see it here on the left on the right the oil which remained in the drained engine clearly quite dirty and actually it has quite a bit of metal content in it as you can see reflecting as i move around the towel significant where of the engine occurred whereas the oil on the left is perfectly clean and clear examining further i remove the connecting rod caps from the crankshaft. this is the bearing the crank rotates on on the [left] we can see a brand new cap and on the right after 30 or so minutes of running with half of that time in an engine without oil you can see the smooth shiny surface on the left versus the scored less reflective surface on the right indeed you can see the scratches on the crankshaft as well i would also expect to see similar issues with the camshaft in cylinder bore admittedly this is a bit more of a scientific approach and didn't have the explosive ending many of us we're hoping for but don't fret as the folks at car throttle have driven a mercedes c180 without oil on a track until it's inevitable depth i won't give it all away but just know [that] the engine doesn't leave the track with all its original parts if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below. thanks for watching
