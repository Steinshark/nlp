all right sup guys mkbhd here and welcome to dope tech of ces 2018 part two so if you missed part one i'll link it up here in the corner that's clickable in case we got missed in the flood that is your so box right now but i did go back to show floor with your suggestions from twitter and reddit to find the things mostly i guess the more newsworthy things of ces that people wanted to know more about so right off the bat actually there were a couple of things that i wanted to see that i couldn't so synaptics for example they were demoing a fingerprint reader underneath the display glass i'll link this video that i'm watching below but i think this is actually gonna have some pretty sweet implications in smartphones as early as this year so i'm looking forward to that but i didn't get to see it in person myself or try it out i hope i do soon though and i also wanted to see but they weren't showing it in their booth lg's rollable tv probably the most hype thing of all of ces i'd say this whole year so they had this rollable oled tv basically it looks like a normal tv when it's out of the box but it has these motors and it's flexible and it rolls into this box that they had when it's not in use so i guess it's really modern to be able to completely hide your tv like that but the other use would be partially rolling it down to make it this 21 by 9 ultra wide aspect ratio for watching those videos or movies with no black bars or even rolling it almost all the way down for this mega wide ui they built in that just displays the weather and stuff so i thought that was really cool i wish i got to see it in person but they took it out the booth or wherever it was pretty quickly trust me i asked about it but from what i've heard this may actually come to market and be a product we can buy sooner than we think like this year but for stuff i did see a ces it was kind of your classics it's it's your cars and your tvs they could probably name this the cars and electronics show and nobody would even bat an eye most of the dopest tvs i saw were pushing the envelope with resolution and size so you know anyone can make a 45 inch oled tv at this point that's relatively thin and beautiful but some of the insane ones at ces were things like samsung's 146 inch modular oled display sony had a massive 85 inch 8k hdr display blast 10,000 nits of peak brightness into our eyes which was really impressive stuff like this again is crazy cool to see and of course we hope it will show up in much lower prices in real products in stores in the future and then in the car department there's always lots of cars at ces and then at the height of those it's a lot of what i guess i would say like the thyroid a future concept eevee autonomous type of thing going on like take buyten for example brand new probably the number one most hyped new electric car at ces and it checked all those boxes that faraday future and others have checked in the past as well we had that single fully working prototype in their booth check a massive potentially distracting that's still really cool display behind the steering wheel replacing the traditional dashboard check they have the lack of door handles of course check a lack of side mirrors but with cameras instead check and of course they want a best of ces award without announcing a price or a release date check i mean that's not to say this isn't a super cool idea this concept is fun to see this type of stuff at ces but i would avoid giving these i guess too much hype like i have in the past where they're not actually a real product yet but on the surface they're awesome and they're everywhere but basically the important thing to remember with them is that word concept that you'll probably see on it somewhere if you look up the word concept it's literally just like a physical representation of an idea so a concept car is not a real product yet i don't think we have a price we have a target price but we don't have a release date you can't buy it yet so it's more of a we'll see but what i did see that you can buy right now and i'll link it below is the mattias keyboards what they're doing is basically what we wanted apple to do right now you can't buy a space gray wireless apple keyboard unless you also buy an imac pro so mattias is basically making that keyboard that anyone can buy plus there's some other colors so i'm pretty pumped about that and then on top of that they're also making a wired and wireless backlit version of that keyboard so the wireless backlit version is just on or off with white light only but the wired version has a literal physical wheel on the back for changing through whatever colors you want at any time in my opinion that is dope tech i also saw this one of a cine motion controlled arm in an icon booth so i've seen sort of stuff like this before but in person this one was called the mark roberts motion control bolt and the bolt jr. two different sized robots and i kind of want one it's essentially a robot arm that's computer-controlled that you can program camera moves into and you can do all kinds of crazy fast moving super study stuff that human hands could never do with a camera of this weight so it was giving me all kinds of ideas for tech videos but i'll i'll just leave it at that panasonic kept up their tradition of having a tesla in their booth which was probably pretty useful during that power outage yes there was a power outage at ces the biggest electronics show in the world lost power it's got a love aigis and there are also robots everywhere robots to clean your house robots to help you out with stuff robots to dance for you robots to keep you company robots to play scrabble against and robots to beat you at ping-pong or if you're decent to actually help you get better at ping-pong i got to play against it it's it's really uncanny seeing it like toss the ball up and serve it that was probably the most human-like part but for real it's using ai and it's essentially getting better as i get better i mean i'd say i'm pretty decent at ping pong i'm not great but when i had good longer rallies and started hitting back a little faster the robot started putting a little more heat on its returns too so that number it's projecting on the net while you're playing is like a sort of a player rating of how good you are based on how fast you're hitting back and your spin and how hard it is but that also means the robot as it's playing you is gonna play you at that level too so for the record i got up to about a 93 out of a hundred i'm not bragging but i thought that was pretty sick and then once i took the lead i had to quit there also huawei mate 10 pro may have overtaken red hydrogen 1 as the most hyped phone of 2018 at least from what i saw on my timeline i think you know what i'm talking about it's been kind of everywhere so i think i'll have a little review slash rant about this phone coming up if you're interested in that also the us postal service had a booth at ces where they were showing off mail innovation mail innovation me anyway that's pretty much it that was my ces 2018 obviously it's a huge show you can't possibly see everything but i hope these dopes tech videos gave you a good idea of what it was like to be there and some of the stuff we saw i had a lot of fun and i guess the weight is on now for seeing if the things we saw there actually come to fruition i mean i'm sure 75% of the things that were there won't like the electric cars tough to say project linda from razer i would almost bet money it'll never actually happen but we'll see but you know that rollable tv yet might actually come sooner than we think so until then thanks for watching talk to guys the next one peace
