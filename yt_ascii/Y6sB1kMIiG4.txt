if you google youtube best practices pretty much every expert out there will tell you not to post on christmas day the views are going to be low everyone will be busy with their families and it's much better they say to skip it all together but i see things a little bit differently and for me making this video and posting it on christmas is maybe one of the most important things i can do this year as a filmmaker and in this video i'm going to get into why it's also important for you to you're probably wondering what i'm talking about and why after 115 days in the arctic and one of the busiest professional years of my life why do i care about posting a video on a day when most people won't be watching and that's a fair question but in this video i'm going to tell you why this is exactly when it matters the most and more importantly what this means for you on your own creative [music] journeys so before i dive into this let me just say merry christmas to everyone who celebrates it and even if you don't i hope you and your families are all doing great out there wherever you are in the world i'm shutting down my calendar for the next few weeks and taking some much needed time off shooting after one of the longest projects of my career but not releasing this video was never really an option in my mind and i'll get into why in a second and then what that means for you looking back on this year i've been beyond fortunate in my career the restrictive co years finally seem to have ended and for the first time since 2020 there's an energy in the air and people are making projects happen i've already gotten a few really exciting things lined up for 2024 and there's every indication that this could be my best year in a long time maybe ever on top of that this youtube channel has grown so much faster than i ever would have imagined and it's starting to seriously change my life in terms of the opportunities it's opening up when i first started posting weekly videos in february 2022 my goal was to reach 1,000 subscribers within a year and 10,000 by the end of my second year flash forward to now and we're about 6 weeks away from that 2-year anniversary and we're over 60,000 way way higher than my most optimistic projections and i'm not saying any of this as a humble brag or to tell you why you need to start your own youtube channel though i do think most filmmakers should think about it now the reason that i'm here isn't that i'm exceptional in any way it's that when you apply consistent effort over a long period of time good things happen when i posted the first of these weekly videos in 2022 i think the channel had around 250 subscribers and the average video i made was getting less than 50 views 100 views was a major success and there was no indication that anyone out there cared what i had to say or if they'd noticed at all if i just stopped because honestly no one was watching and no one would have cared it was the same for the second video and the third and the 10th almost no impact and a massive commitment of time and energy most sane people would have stopped i was paying an editor which was a huge financial strain and it was pretty embarrassing to have 10 years of professional experience under my belt but still feel like i was talking to an empty room but somewhere around the 40th video i think the algorithm gods picked me up and i shot up to a few thousand subs [music] overnight the growth since then has been up and down with lots of plateaus but since that day i've never missed a single week's post no matter what was going on in my life in fact that first surge in numbers happened while i was in the boreal forest working on my first feature dock as a director and living in a tent without any wi-fi at all it would have been very understandable not to keep up the posting schedule considering how busy i was but if i stopped then odds are that nothing would have happened i also didn't miss a single upload even though i was away in the arctic for a third of this year and shooting full-time and i had to get up at 5: am every day to make videos before the production started now i'm not here to tell you about how i grew my youtube channel or talk about productivity hacks what i'm trying to get across is that success in anything whether that's youtube or film making or photography or building a dog groming business for that matter it's all built off the back of consistent effort over time a very small group of people out there will go viral or have massic success right out of the gate but those are not the examples to emulate because it's really hard to get repeated results like that now the people that i've modeled my myself on over my career have succeeded through consistency on a long timeline not like flash in the pan virality so when i looked at my calendar and realized that the video release day fell on christmas i didn't even think about skipping it because the only reason i've gotten to where i am both in film making and youtube is because i've held myself accountable and stayed consistent and that's why this is the most important video i've made this year or maybe ever and why you should think about what that looks like for you whatever you're doing this isn't about being work aol or sitting on my laptop on christmas morning because i recorded this video in advance knowing that i wouldn't want to work on the day hey that's cheating it's about taking a good look at your goals and where you want to be and then applying effort over time and not making [music] excuses one of my favorite books is the book of five rings by mamoto musashi it's this old epic samurai story about a lone swordsman in feudal japan who's like singularly focused on being the best sword fighter whoever lived on his quest he stops fighting for a long time and he just goes off to learn like farming and calligraphy and a bunch of other seemingly non-related things all of which he masters before going back to fighting it seems a bit strange but then he explains his whole philosophy as when you see the way broadly you see the way in all things meaning that if you can master one thing you can master anything and that's because the way to mastery isn't to be a prodigy or be blessed with exceptional talent it's to work hard at something over time mastering calligraphy is the same process as mastering sword fighting which is the same process as getting good at film making effort over time equals success and if you're trying to succeed as a filmmaker or anything else for that matter these are words to live by because it's the only thing that works that's why posting this video is important to me and why it should mean everything to you as well we're about to head into the new year a time of all sorts of resolutions and promises you make to yourself about what you're going to accomplish in the year to come my suggestion is that instead of hoping for some major success or one massive project that's going to change your life overnight instead your goal should be to make progress through consistent effort i already made a career planning email guide that i'll email you over the course of 5 days for free if you need help setting goals but once you know what you're aiming at then commit to chipping away at it gradually but steadily like a river eroding rocks or uma thurman's 1-in punch and kill bill wishing for overnight success is for amateurs professionals sit down at their desks every day and work so who knows how many of you are going to click on this video but for those of you who do my biggest hope for you this year is that like moushi you'll start to see the way broadly and then apply it to whatever it is you want to achieve with your film making effort and consistency over time equals results and that's the only equation that you can count on so merry christmas and happy holidays and may 2024 be your most consistent year ever see [music] you [music]
