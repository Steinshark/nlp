she is the embodiment like she's the source of body is the guy i don't know how to say it and so because of that she's the one who gave body to christ maybe that's the best way to to think of that if you understand it's like christ's body doesn't come from anywhere else besides her like that's out of which his body is it comes and so she becomes a stand-in for the church for all of us she's a stand-in for all of us that is she is that which gathers us she's the one who gathers us toward gathers us in worship towards christ is a good way to understand it right and so and so because of that that's why also she can appear in in let's say she will appear in visions as well because she is that so a good example is of course i don't know if you know the she often appears in images of protections for example famous orthodox images the the veil of protection so there's this in the constantinople someone had a vision of her you know above the church and hold putting her veil as a protection around the church and so there are versions of that in catholic art where you've seen you've probably seen these images where you see the mother of god standing up and then she has her cloak open and then in her cloak is like standing all the people right they're all gathered together in her and so that's a good way to understand it it's like she is that she's the the gathering of the body and so she she stands in for the church itself this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] let me begin my name is margarita mooney clayton i am the founder and director of scala foundation which is based in princeton new jersey where i'm an assistant professor of practical theology scala's mission is to renew culture through bringing beauty into art and education and our faith communities i'm delighted today to host jonathan peggio who is an artist based in montreal quebec canada he's also the founder and director of the symbolic world project which hosts blogs and youtube videos and i first encountered him in fact as perhaps many of you did through one of his many youtube videos then i began to look at his website and saw a beautiful carvings of the virgin mary different images icons and i began to read and listen to his videos and i thought this guy should be speaking at scala's next conference which is april 21 in 22 in princeton new jersey this coming year 2023 and the topic is art the sacred and the common good if you haven't heard about that conference we'd love to see you there in person it will also be live streamed so jonathan welcome thank you for being here yeah thanks for having me it's great to see all these people i put it in you know the mosaic mode or whatever looking at everybody actually a few faces people that i know so that's also wonderful so it's nice to nice to be here thanks great yeah so the title of our conversation today right i picked the image of mary and the burning bush the exodus but before i started in that i wanted to just kind of say the reason i wanted to have you here is that i want to speak through scala foundation to artists who are trying to live out this vision of art as contributing to community and memory and identity one of my favorite writers on culture is a philosopher named joseph peeper i don't know if you've ever read him but in his book leisure the basis of culture i didn't realize it until i was preparing to speak to you that some of those essays sorry some of the essays and only the lover sings pardon me were talks he gave at a sculptor's studio so he was friends with artists and one of the things he says is that art flowering from contemplation does not so much attempt to copy reality as rather to capture the archetypes of all that is such art does not want to depict what everybody sees but to make visible what not everybody sees so when i listened to you jonathan talking about the meaning of the mystery of of the story of the burning bush and how the burning bush is actually a marian prototype a lot of questions emerged into my mind but i think one of the things that you said that i wanted you to say a little bit more about in your video is you said that reality comes to us veiled and needs to be unveiled and in this process of unveiling we have mediators can you tell us a little bit more what you mean that reality comes to us veiled and needs to be unveiled through through mediators and is the art that you make supposed to is it actually claiming to help unveil reality for us so i would say well first of all it's important to understand in some ways the mystery of unveiling or the mystery of revelation but even the term revelation is very ambiguous because on the one hand it seems to be showing you but then it's it's actually veiling so it's like the showing unveiling is it sounds like it's complicated it's not that complicated the way to understand it is that let's say unity or identity manifest itself by several characteristics we often don't have access directly to to the one we have access to the many right that's the body that represents itself like you you see the different aspects of something and those aspects both veil and unveil like they show you they point towards identity but at the same time because they're a particularization of that one they act as something like a veil now this is of course represented in sacred space very clearly if you look at the the pattern of the tabernacle in scripture this is what's going on so what you have at the at the outset is you have the very presence of god that that manifests itself in the holy of holies right the very source of all reality which descends and connects with the earth but it's as if that unity is too much like it's just too much to handle in some ways it's almost like you couldn't even see it it's too simple maybe as a good way to understand it and so then it has to be mediated think of it as a seed for example if i showed you a seed and i said like you know this is a tree and you're like well that's not a tree right that's just a point it's just a dot it's a you can't see the implications so the veiling will then will then add the implications of the revelation and the particularization of the revelation so that's why you need veils in order to help you see something like you need you need mediation and of course in the tabernacle that appears as the actual veils in the temple that you have different layers of veils that are thickening from a from a a linen veil all the way to like these shaggy garments of skin that are dyed red you know on the outside of the tabernacle and that's kind of the way to understand how mediation function but it's it's there and everything a good another another an example is for example moses goes up to the mountain moses goes up to meet god and then god will set up mediation between him and the people you'll set up you know leaders of a thousand leaders of a hundred leaders of ten etc so these are mediations to to exemplify the aspect of what is revealed at the top of the mountain the law itself is that the law is like god just says i am it's like okay i don't know what that means like i don't know what that implies and so then the i am becomes you know you will have no other god before me you will make no idols you will you will you will cycle the the time with meaning you will like then it's like oh so that's what i am means and then it keeps filtering down into practices and laws and purification rituals and all these things but it's ultimately all rooted in the i am so those are the mediations that appear you know the problem of identity and mediation is the best way to understand it is that through these let's say specification of of the revelation well well i find this so exciting because as i think you know my background is in sociology and there's a long history of a study of ritual and art but what i often found missing in sociology was the word that you began by mentioning which was revelation and i wonder beyond the work that you do as an artist what led you to found the symbolic world project like who are you arguing with when you're saying that reality comes to us veiled that there's an element of revelation because i hear who you're arguing with right and you're arguing with on the one hand a kind of really radical human human empiricism that all of reality is contained in the movement like a billiard balls hitting each other like that's all this kind of crass empiricism and then on the other hand i think maybe you're arguing also with people who think that the meaning of symbols is in relation to other symbols right that symbol this symbol you know signifies something but there's no signifier behind any of those symbols right so just what led you to found a whole project dedicating to helping people understand the meaning of symbols and who's who's arguing with you i was arguing with me so i think that you know for those who who haven't followed my work this this project is done very much in collaboration with my brother matthew pejo who wrote a book called the language of creation just plugging that it's an amazing book by the way and i think that it in our 20s you know we grew up in a very we grew up in a protestant world a kind of evangelical christianity which was very zealous and had a lot of energy to it but was also quite materialistic in its suppositions and so then when we came to university and came to higher learning we kind hit a wall and had to account for these crazy stories in scripture you know and then diving back into tradition diving back into the church fathers you know into rabbinical thinking into medieval thinking in general iconography we started to notice that in fact you know what these stories are what these images are are just revealing us the patterning of reality so the problem with empiric is and the problem even with like realist artists is that they don't under they seem to not realize that you always have to frame you can't avoid the frame so if you're an artist you know that right it's like when you're looking at something even if you're representing it with the most immediacy that you can you still have to reduce it you still have to frame it you still have to contain it within a limit and it's like so that frame is something like attention it's something like what's important so you know contemporary artists try to play with that try to break it as much as possible right they try to represent things which usually don't gather your attention or that are that are broken and fragmentary you know ironic there's all these ways of contemporary trying to frame it but it's still calling back to the problem of framing to the problem of attention so once you understand that it's like okay well then what makes us care about things and you realize that there's an actual pattern to that it's not arbitrary and what makes what what appears as the center of attention what appears as distraction you could say so that's one way of framing it but then you realize that it ends up being honestly just the pattern of everything that there basically is a pattern of how reality let's say reveals itself to us and and that you can you can coherently see it and you can help people understand it so that they no longer think that you know religious rituals are arbitrary or that religious images and stories or just ridiculous arbitrary stories but rather they are patterning like ritual for example it's so important to understand that action is the same as perception it's like you have to frame actions you can't you don't just act in the world you act in a directed way in the directed way in which you act implies an order of action and so brushing your teeth is a ritual right it has to be a ritual it has to be in order so anything you do as a human that has purpose is ritualized so once you understand that and you think like well then then i can explain religious rituals to you in a way that you should understand because you know everything you do is ritualized you just cannot avoid of of action that that it implies to do anything with meaning right well now let me you know so what i hear you saying is that i actually didn't realize that you had grown up in a kind of evangelical protestant world with this kind of strong emphasis probably on you know the heart and devotion and knowing scripture but then trying to then later on grapple with strange stories in the bible especially in the old testament trying to grapple with the persistence of certain kinds of rituals or you know the meaning of the eucharist and the really symbolic structure of the christian faith right and that christian faith itself is not purely rationalistic or law based there's a kind of attraction to a mystery as well that's there but then if there's an attraction to the mystery i've often wondered how do i know that that mystery is real versus made up right you said that it's really important for people to understand that religious rituals aren't arbitrary that there are patterns of reality that are unveiled through those and we can approach that mystery maybe never fully but we can approach it with trust that we're going to discover more about our own memory our own identity and not just a kind of arbitrarily assigned meaning of signs is that a good way no you're you're absolutely right and i think that most people today can access that it's not that hard so for example you can i always try to go as low as possible you don't like it's hard to talk about the eucharist in a materialist world because like what it's too far it's like so high that it becomes people can't see it but if you talk about shaking hands with someone and you say shaking hands has a pattern it has a reality to it and it's not there's variability like it wouldn't have to necessarily be shaking hands but it could be something like slapping each other in the face like slapping each other in the face could not re we could not be a let's say a ritual of communion because it has a certain form it has a certain way of of acting on on each other that is objectively true i could also not turn my back to the person like if i wanted to talk to someone and meet them and i said well my ritual for that is turning my back to them well it's like no that's a universally universally unacceptable way of encountering someone so there are actual parameters by which we engage with each other these are not arbitrary doesn't mean that they're all the same there's flexibility and so if you can scale that up and you can realize that a family meal needs to have a certain structure you can't have anything happen at the family meal and i tell people if you don't think that just try stepping up standing up on the table just once see what happens right it's like family meals have a ritualized dance that functions and so do feasts and you know anything we do together and it's like that scales up into a church and into a into the eucharist and i i mean i could go through all the steps to show you how the eucharist is in some ways the source or the highest version of eating together but you can at least see see that it's not arbitrary like these these rituals that we engage with are are based on the way our attention works the way that you know our human interaction works the way that we bind together as society is that we can't bind in a society around anything you can like you can but it will have effects like you can bind as a group around smoking crack like you can do that and people do like people do will bind in groups around smoking crack but the the fruits of that will be coherent with the purpose for which they're binding together and it's like so it's like the idea that we're binding together right in the incarnation under the god of love that's there's it's like it's not arbitrary why we're doing that these are coherent images and rituals we participate in all right that was fantastic listen you know to build on that i think you're right sometimes the modern world talking about the eucharist of people who've not encountered it sounds like really woo-woo what are you doing there well one way that i one other topic that i have struggled to talk about in the modern world is mary the mother of god the blessed virgin mary i was i was raised catholic my mother is here on this call i went to catholic school we had devotion to the rosary in the home i never really thought much about this may processions and those kinds of things but i also really didn't know how to explain mary in faith or marry an art and you know fast forward many years and i've now encountered popular devotions to marry in haiti which was what my first book was about in you know fatima portugal these pilgrimage sites and there was something about this enduring popular devotion to mary that that's super interesting and then i get to princeton theological seminary and it turns out that you know i was actually really afraid when i taught robert orsi's book the madonna of 115th street which is about popular devotion to mary amongst italian americans i was afraid that my protestant students were going to be like this is all really out of touch with modern world and it's not true christianity it was actually more like can you can you tell me more about mary can you and so i ended up teaching an entire course on the virgin mary here at princeton theological seminary i'm teaching it again starting tomorrow some of my students in that class are here with us today and what kind of hook that maybe will make all of this stuff we're talking about identity memory community you know why is the virgin mary and the symbolism around the virgin mary so powerful in revelation and so for me what aha moment listening to you and then i went back and studied this a little bit in aiden hart's book on the festival icons and in one of the books i teach in my class which is on the development of marian doctrine and all of these names for mary so one of the recurring images of marian art is mary and the burning bush right the burning bush is a story i believe well you know why don't you tell us like what is the story of the burning bush and how is this old testament story of god and the burning bush related to to mary the mother of god like right so so the start of the burning bush is that moses when he left egypt the first time he kills an egyptian and has to flee into into the the wilderness you know he becomes a shepherd and then on the mountain of god as he sees on the on the mountain of god he notices this this burning bush and so what it is it's a it's a thorn bush that is burning but is not being consumed and so moses approaches the bush and then he hears a voice which tells him to remove his sandals for this place is a holy ground this ground is a holy ground and so he removed his sandal and approaches the burning bush and it is in the burning bush or through the burning bush that he receives the name of god and it is in the in the bible it is the first time that god reveals his name to the people and so you know the god of abraham abraham knew of god and had different appellations for god different names for god but here god reveals his name as the one who is right as the i am and so why is it a burning bush and why is it not being consumed so there's a there's a problem in the problem of mediation which is that there's a sense you see that in scripture right the idea that god would consume the world like if god was in the world he would consume it because the infinite cannot fit in the finite it's just pretty simple equation you try to fit the infinite in the finite you blow it apart right you just explode it and so if you try to like and and it's not like it how can i say this if you try to fit the essence of basketball in just dribbling just dribbling can't hold the essence of basketball you need all these other things to mediate basketball and you can't fit the identity of something in one of its elements it's not a it's not like a magical thing it's just like that's how reality works you can't you just can't do it right and so and so the problem so much of the problem with the bible then how do we encounter god how does god mediate into the world if the origin of reality can't fit in reality so you have this problem which is that you need mediations those mediations kind of show you god but they're also distance from god so how do we deal with this so what happens in the burning bush is this mysterious moment because it's a thorn bush it's it is multiplicity itself right that's what the thorn bush is it's like a bunch of spikes it's all these multiple multiple spikes and it's actually in in scripture the thorn bush is the consequence of the fall so when adam falls god says the earth will produce thorns and so it's like you fell from unity and now you will be lost in multiplicity yeah right you'll be lost in this and all these spiky spiky points let's say instead of one point you've got spiky points so and so now this mystery of god appearing in the multiplicity right in creation itself and not consuming it so what is going on like how is this possible and there is this like this call for a mystery of how the world can contain the presence of god and it's not totally answered right in the burning bush like why is this how is this possible what is happening you know but there is this kind of call to mystery and so the sense of why then the burning bush represents the virgin is to understand the question of space and the question of place for the revelation so every time you'll see a revelation in scripture every time they'll be the revelation and they'll be the container or the space in which the revelation manifests itself and that space is important and it's mysterious because of the problem of god blowing up reality because the problem of that which is above not being able to fit in that which is below and so what happens is this image of the burning bush becomes you know one of the one of the early images of what it means the possibility of god being in the world without consuming it that in some ways god has made the world in a way that he can manifest himself in creation without consuming it and that is represented as you know there are different ways of represent it it's purity it's it's something like you know if you have this first image in in the bible as you know the spirit of god and the waters below so it can be like the waters or this idea of purity or this idea of you know something that is reflective sometimes you have this image of like the god is under his feet there's a there's a sea of glass or a sea of of precious stones that reflects his glory back up so there's all these images and it's like that's what mary will ultimately become as the container as the ark of the covenant as you know the tabernacle as the burning bush as the mountain as the latter and it's like all these images that we use about mary is to talk about the way in which the world ultimately mysteriously the is capable god has made it in a way that is capable to become a vehicle for his presence all right so the idea if i understood you correctly idea that to the extent there is something that's infinite it would make sense that the infinite can't fit into the finite right so we need some kind of mediation in order to see the to perceive to encounter in some way the infinite and so the burning bush something in nature that's burned but not consumed is kind of pointing to this infinity and then mary now walk us through this a little bit more mary as the burning bush why she's the bush she's she's the space so mary is always the space of revelation so she's not the revelation herself it's really important by the way to make the distinction it's like that's why in orthodox theology we will always represent the mother of god with the child right so it's like the space and the glory so she's the ark of the covenant and the glory of god descends on on the ark so in in any revelation there are those two aspects you could say something like the masculine and feminine aspects of the revelation one which is that which comes from heaven and then that which receives it or manifests it below and so mary is that she's the throne that's why she's represented as the the throne of wisdom so these early images of mary represent her has as a throne with christ sitting on her and with his head over her heart and you see that in the images of the panagia where she's you know in the the orthodox churches for example she has her arms out like this and then in her center she'll have the divine logo shining through her right appearing out of her and so that's that's in that image he's an image of the burning bush as well right it's like so you imagine the burning bush and then the glory of god you know let's say revealing itself through that space through that divine that holy space well since you mentioned also the virgin kind of with her with her arms open yeah what are some other i mean the burning bush is one what are some other prototypes of marian art what by which i mean some kind of recurring images of mary in christian art so the the first image images that we know of mary is an image called the horogetria which is the image of the mother holding christ on her and showing us christ with her right hand and so usually you'll see it it's actually one of the most famous images and so she she holds christ and she she's showing us and sometimes she's she's usually bowing her head slightly you know and so it's like it's the one who's showing the way and you can understand that right you can understand it as mary herself but then also at the possibility of outward signs or of holy places or of prayers or whatever it is that's external pointing inwards like pointing towards the revelation and so she becomes in a way in a way an image of the church itself which which is pointing to christ right it's like that's the whole point of why we're christians we're we're pointing to christ we're little we're like specifications of of the revelation in our own lives was supposed to embody some aspect of christ and so you can understand that like i said as as her of course directly doing that but then ultimately i mean she's the one who says at the winning of kana listen to what my son says that's her role she she points people towards her son and and so and so like i said it is also in some ways an image the proper relationship of understanding the outward with the inner like the the outward aspect of anything and the inner aspect of anything you know okay okay so the the inward and the outward you know jonathan when i started to do the research to teach this class in the virgin mary well first of all i discovered going to the princeton theological seminary there are two thousand years of books about mary so there's a lot of mariology and then i went over to the index of christian art or the index of medieval art here at princeton university and discovered similarly there's really two thousand years of art of and you know what struck me going into the index that there's not that much art about other women in the bible although other women appear in the bible i'm not saying there isn't any but there's not that much so this leads me to my other question just do you have any idea i mean when we talk about the virgin mary you know that well that's the word i was always taught to call her you know the virgin mary right purity virginity these are not really culturally you know popular words right now one might say but my question is what explains the enduring devotion to marry the mother of god above and beyond other women in the bible like why why is there two thousand years of art about marriage why does mary appear in all of these different countries speaking to people in in their own tongues what is the enduring presence of mary across culture what does that tell us or she how can i say this she is the embodiment like she's the source of body is the guy i don't know who else to say it and so because of that she's the one who gave body to christ maybe that's the best way to think of that if if you understand it's like christ's body doesn't come from anywhere else besides her like that's out of which his body is it comes and so she becomes a stand-in for the church for all of us she's a stand-in for all of us that is she is that which gathers us she's the one who gathers us toward gathers us in worship towards christ is a good way to understand it right and so and so because of that that's why also she can appear in in let's say she will appear in visions as well because she is that so a good example is of course i don't know if you know the she often appears in images of protections for example a famous orthodox images the the veil of protection so there's this in the constantinople someone had a vision of her you know above the church and hold putting her veil as a protection around the church and so there are versions of that in catholic art where you've seen you've probably seen these images where you see the mother of god standing up and then she has her cloak open and then in her cloak is like standing all the people right they're all gathered together in her and so that's a good way to understand it it's like she is that she's the the gathering of the body and so she she stands in for the church itself well so you know one of the things that i learned in teaching this class so mary is similar to what you said there are lots of people and prophets men and women who have important roles in the bible but maybe part of what i heard you say what explains the enduring significance of mary and popular devotion and art is that the church the body of christ has to continuously be recreated across space and time and culture and to the extent what i heard you say is that because mary gave body to christ she also gathers the church together in worship right she's there at pentecost she's there at the birth of the church right and so the church has to be continuously recreated through a connection to this feminine presence is that correct oh that's a good way to understand it and it's important to understand that in some ways she is very much a mystery of the church and we should be careful like i mean it's okay to talk about her but we have to be very cautious in talking about her because she is something which belongs to the church in some ways she's interfacing she's inward facing because she is that which gathers the church together and so the mystery of the holy place and the mystery of sacred space is something which is very intimate and is very and is very it's a almost secretive and and that's important to understand because if we don't understand that you know because she's hidden in the new testament you know in some ways you actually have to have certain keys in order to understand her importance in the new testament you have to have some intuition about you know some inkling about the role of the church and what's being set up in the new testament to see her importance in the new testament but at first glance you know she's not that present in the new testament but i do think she's she's def every everything said about her in the new testament hides a thousand mysteries but you have to you have to have you know the the the intuition and the gathering in the church to be able to to see those mysteries and to pierce them hmm right so i i guess another question i don't know if you've talked about this in other spaces but one of the things that often comes up in my class is that the presence of a feminine authority in the church right one of the things about today is that people don't really want to talk about roles associated with masculinity or femininity or male or female right you're you're smiling here so what i mean i don't have a problem talking about it it's fine well then let's talk about it okay what is it about you know so in the book that my students love robert orsi is madonna of 115th street people do really relate to the italian-american grandmother yeah as a kind of moral authority of the family that's distinct from the public authority of the man but what the students find so interesting is that when it comes down to it the most important questions are the moral questions and the woman has this kind of reverence amongst the rest of the family like decisions about the family and marriage have to go through the italian grandmother right maybe i sound like i'm stereotyping masculine and feminine male and female but what are your thoughts like what is the femininity of mary and how does that relate to femininity and culture or should it no i think that that say the role and the power of the feminine is represented very much so in the story of mary in ways that sometimes people fail to see the wedding arcana is probably one of the best examples if you want to kind of understand the power of the feminine it's one of those things where i guess in some ways we have to talk about it now because the world is so the world is kind of off tilt off kilter a little bit so we kind of have to talk about it but it's the type of things which probably should be left implicit but anyways so in the winning of kana there's an interesting moment you know because there's this problem and the virgin comes up to christ and she says to christ she says there's no wine and what's christ's answer it's the craziest answer right he says my time has not yet come it's like what what so she's saying there's no why and he's saying i am not ready to die yet it seems like there's a problem of communication but there's not a problem of communication it's like she is open she is showing him the door towards revelation she is framing his his coming public and she's giving him the space in which to make his first miracle and so she is she's acting as a mother right there she's saying it's now here's the moment here's the place this is the question and now christ has to answer the question and so if you want to understand the relationship between a question and an answer you know which one has more power it's like think of think of think of the question frames the answer the question provides the space provides the direction for the answer to come right that's why we pray that's why we think and so there's a deep deep mysterious power in the capacity to ask a question and if we didn't think that we would we wouldn't pray right and so i can't ex i won't explain it to you but there's a very very deep revelation of the role of the feminine and the role that that framing and a question can can play in in revelation i don't know if you ever you probably have all seen my big fat greek wedding but there's a very very wise thing that said in that movie you know there's a scene where the mother is talking to her daughter and she says to her daughter she says you know the man is the head of the household but the woman is the neck and she can make the head look in any direction she wants and it's like that's what mary do is that's what mary is doing at the wedding of connor she's doing exactly that she's saying here look at this problem what are you going to say now and if you think of the relationship between men and women you'll notice that it actually seeps into so many aspects of it's like the question of like would men do anything if there weren't women well so i love that scene from my big fat greek wedding it gives everyone i think an image who's seen it to think on but i think part of what linking back this question to what you said earlier that reality comes to us failed and it needs to be unveiled that the masculine and the feminine in complementing each other kind of point to this unity but also a mystery right that there's we cannot equate masculine and feminist being exactly the same without eradicating the mystery of who we are right so this this difference between masculine and feminine or masculine and feminine authority or forms of influence reveals that at the end humans aren't in charge we are responsible to god that this this difference points to the mystery is what yeah but mystery so it's like we have a it's important to understand what a mystery is in terms of because we we have these words that we use in religious discourse it's like a mystery is a puzzle that's what a mystery is a mystery is a question that's why i i i'm trying to help you understand that the feminine is appears as a question that's it's that's its role and that's what it does it's like here the space like the if you how can i say this like if you build it they will come right this idea that if you create the frame if you have the frame and the question and the mystery then the revelation appears on the mystery this is something that you know like in the very architecture of the tabernacle that's what you have the glory of god descends on what descends on these cherubs these cherubs are like are like sphinxes they they have mixture of different animal parts or whatever it's the it's the question which frames the answer and so it's important to understand like i would say like when you talk about unveiling i would definitely be careful and i would say that the virgin is that is the one whose veil can never be removed like you cannot remove her veil her veil is the kind of like the eternal veil i don't know what else to say she she represents like the the very deep deep mystery of revelation and it's shown in her story like more apocryphal aspects of her story that in the story of the in the the the pro evangelium you have this this story of when the mother of god gives birth to christ she has these two these two women helping her one whose name is salome and salome can't believe the virgin birth right and so in the text if you read it she checked she tries to check if she's a virgin and her hand burns off like your hand could it's very dramatic as an image but there's a sense in which in in which she cannot even see if the veil is there like it's like the veil or the veil of the virgin is not something to be trifled with like it'll it is and so so anyways it's hard because i'm taught using very kind of cryptic language i don't want to that's not i tried to make things as when i explain things i try to make them as simple and as accessible as possible but but talking about mary is difficult because she she has very deep mysteries assigned to her let's say mm-hmm well look i agree with you talking about mary is difficult having taught a class on it and doing it again it's and looking in the library of the books and the images but would you recommend are there any books that you recommend are there any images that you think is right i mean you make images and images often express things in a way that it's difficult to capture in words do you have a couple of prototypes of marion art that you think are really important to to have in the house or to pray with or to meditate prey on i mean i think the image of the of the panagia you know this image that we talked about the the image of the of the mother of god who has her hands out and she's forming something like a cup she she she's a rich she's a container right for that which comes above and then you have christ appearing in her heart or let's say manifesting himself in her heart i think it's it's one of the deepest images that that that christians have because in some ways you know like i said in some ways mary is a stand-in for us you know it's like it's the hope that we have right the hope that we have that we can have christ descend into our heart when i that christ can become the the the the the heart the the center of who we are you know and of course liturgically that is true it's true through the sacraments it's through through the eucharist but you know we know that we have always have more that we could access that we could have more of that and that we could become even more trans apparent to the glory of god and and she was you know perfectly transparent and i think to me that image is really one of the most powerful images that we have i agree with you jonathan it's hard to put these things in words because it feels like you're reducing this great complex mystery to you know it goes beyond words but yet words and images as you say try to help us approach that mystery but i'll be honest no other class that i've taught is quite like the virgin teaching about the virgin mary and i've more explicitly this time around included an aspect of okay how does reading this theology and looking at these images how does this impact your devotion to the mother of god because at the end these ideas and the images are supposed to help us on our on our personal journey which is a journey that we share with other people but i don't want to over intellectualize it or overturn it into the cultural study of of art so you know in terms of the proto-evangelium since you brought that up and a lot of the images from marion are come from that i know one person wanted to ask and i've seen this in many churches as well the significance of what is the significance of of mary of mary with the with the yarn with sort of sewing yeah well that's it yeah it was a suggestion that she weaves the temple veil herself yeah exactly and so that's exactly it's it really is to connect her with the notion of the of the veil of that mystery of the mystery and the revelation and so that's what that's what she that's why she's shown as let's say weaving the the temple veil so when you see her with a piece of yarn that's what it's it's signifying that she is that she is mending the temple veil yeah and that's what she she that's what she is in some ways can you say a little bit more she is the temple veil or she's mentioned she's she yeah that's so how can i say this it's like it's it's a fractal thing so it's hard to it's hard it's hard to explain but so she is she is she is the the mystery in which or out of which the revelation comes and so that mystery has different aspects to it right it can be the the let's say the the ark of the covenant right that's this box and the glory of god descends on the box you know and so her womb plays that role directly it's very direct but then there's also every level has these two aspects together right every level of revelation has in some ways of veil and an unveiling or a veil and the manner in which the veil also reveals that which is behind it and she always plays the role of the mystery at every at every level and so she's the veils of the the temple she's the you know she's the untouched mountain you have this this type of or the uncut mountain for example the space out of which things happen and so it happens at many levels and that's why she's also veiled herself it's important to understand that's why like for example if you look at an image of the deus which is the basic image of christian iconography you have christ in the center as representing the king you know the son of man all of that type of imagery and then to his right there's the virgin who is veiled and then to his left there's saint john the baptist who is wild crazy hair you know wearing garments of skin and and you can almost understand that she it's like she represents that the veil let's say or the hidden the secret all of that type of stuff and he represents like the guy out in the desert screaming like repent repent you know he there's nothing secret about saint john the baptist and and he has a kind of directness you know he's willing he's talking about cutting the tree down like repent or you're gonna get thrown into the fire like that kind of language but mary she's she has this she has the secretive aspect to herself the mystery the mysterious aspect of it let's say okay so you know we've got about 10 minutes left and i hope to get back to some of the questions about symbolic meaning in mary if we have time but a number of people on the call today are artists right and so some if we could get some questions about your vocation as an artist or your how you understand your your work as an artist so for example one person wants to know like well how is it that an artist in a way unveils or acts as a mediator is it appropriate for an artist to think that that's what they're doing i mean are there aspects of artistic style that emerge through partial abstraction like or deviation from strict national appearance natural appearances as through the content of an image yeah well the the first thing to get out of your mind is the idea that you can represent what's out there you can't no one can there's that that's that's a that's a joke like anybody who thinks they're being naturalistic is just it's ridiculous you're not being naturalistic even even by the simple fact of framing anything you are contracting it reducing it there's no way and you're pointing attention towards it so now levels of abstraction can have a role you know in directing attention is the best way to understand it so if you if you look at something that is highly abstract not in the modern sense but let's say in terms of representing a cross as an ornament or representing an ornamental or or highly typified image of an anchor like the old ancient christians would be these are abstracted in the sense that they are they are pointing your attention more like the more you abstract something the more you're capable of pointing attention and it's different from the type modern abstraction i'm almost on purpose doing this to you which is that the the level that which you show in an image should be related to what it's doing and what it should be related to what it is you want to do in terms of attention and in terms of participation and some images have some images levels of abstraction have always existed in art this is not a modern phenomena they've existed from time immemorial and they still exist today but the the difficulty with contemporary art and modern art is that they don't they don't necessarily ask themselves what function is this image playing in order for me to engage in this level of abstraction and like i said you know abstract art or geometric art for example is abstract but it all it has a function so i would say that the artist is i say what what's important what's interesting about the artists is i think the artist can become more than others aware of mediation and veiling you can't avoid it but you when you're making something you become so you can become very aware that you are acting as a mediator between things that you are contracting that you're gathering aspects of reality together right you're taking color paint you're taking wood or stone and you're bringing it together in order to gather people's attention towards it it's like that's something that we should be very careful about and it's a it's in some ways it's a right it's almost a magical position that we're in and so we have to be we have to be very careful because it's very powerful most people aren't aware of the things that i'm talking about most people aren't aware that reality has to be framed that things have to be brought together in order for you to notice them artists just inevitably become aware of it because they're doing it all the time right you're constantly framing things and constantly mediating them and contracting them and deciding what to leave in what to leave out you know all of this type of work that you're doing is is the experience of mediation itself so it's impossible to be purely naturalistic mediating and you have to be extremely careful about it because as an artist what i hear you saying is that the very act of making art is an active mediation of reality and that can impact people based on based on what you create so to approach this with with a sense of real responsibility and another question that some of the artists have asked is how do aspiring artists who want to do work in the kind of vein that that you do where do you find community how do you find the human relationships the the formation to persevere in this kind of career for someone who feels this calling to be the kind of person you're talking about how did you do it i mean where we're in a strange situation you know it's like i i see a few people in here i saw david is here david clayton you know we're in this we were in a strange situation we kind of came out of contemporary art and in some ways we were in a highly irregular world and so you know it's like the idea of becoming an iconographer was so difficult and so strange that that we almost had to jump start something which was almost dead maybe that's the best way to explain it like aiden hart is a good example of that too it's like we came in a world where these practices had been almost forgotten and had been cast aside and so us and maybe a few people that came just before us in some ways we're we're restarting something that that was lost so i think that we're in a better position right now i think there's at least now you have people that you can recognize as as masters that can at least show the way you know that you can learn from either take seminars with or that you can at least look at the writings they've done like aiden has written a wonderful book like his book on icon painting is a masterful book to help anybody along that that path but i would say that ultimately it's important to also be connected to to the church you don't if you want to make sacred art there's you shouldn't just be on your own making sacred art like you really should be you should be sacramentally connected to to the church you should be involved and you should be doing it to some extent with the blessing of your spiritual authority you know that's a little tricky at least at least when you start you know it's i think it's fine to take classes without the blessing of your priests some priests might disagree with me but if you want to start doing it professionally or doing it publicly then you need to kind of insert yourself into that that family and participate in that family because you also need checks and balances like you need people to be able to to tell you that know that image no like it's just not we're not it's not acceptable so yeah you know we were speaking last night david clayton who's my husband he and i were speaking last night to peter carter we'll also be at the scholar conference in april who he'll be leading the the music the liturgical music the praying of the liturgy of the hours and he started a group called the catholic sacred music project and he was also saying hey look things are a lot better than they used to be and i said you know if we're going to compare now to the 70s yeah it is better so but i think your point is well taken i think people like you people like david clayton peter carter aiden hart all of us will be together at the scholar conference represent that there there is a rebirth of interest in liturgical arts sacred art sacred music and scala hopes to be able to provide some of the connections amongst people who are doing this kind of work that's why we host these online events that's why we publish the books we have we have blogs we're trying to share the wonderful work that you're doing jonathan i wanted to introduce people to you i encourage people to just listen to your videos subscribe to your to your youtube channel read your blog it is maybe not you know yet spreading wildly but there are a lot more artists doing this kind of work than when you and david and aiden started there's more ways to get trained but your point about staying connected to the church and staying connected to prayer is just such good life advice for anybody who feels that they have a vocation from god it doesn't mean it's going to be easy and staying connected to the sacraments into the church and to a community of faith i just want to say one last thing just to maybe wrap up like the the connection to the mother of god also is that you know there's a there's a there's a reason why often the first icon that was made the tradition that the first icon that was made was an image of the mother of god painted by saint luke and you know these are of course deeply kind of traditional legendary stories but they the fact that this is that's the structure of the story it's important to help us understand the role of the mother god in liturgical art because in some ways we are exteriorizing something hidden or something secret we are giving body to the tradition of the church when we are making images when we're building churches all these things we're giving body to to the to the church and to the tradition of the church and so that's why there is a deep relationship between the artist and the making of these things and the participation and embodiment that with the with with mary herself and so i think it's not at all arbitrary that that she was the first one represented in an icon when you're talking about your vocation as an artist and the sort of the calling to mediate reality to represent people to do that in a way where you're connecting also your own spiritual walk to the mother of god is that what i was here well that she in some ways is an image of the art of the art itself like she's an image of the the practice of this gathering of things together like when you're when you're taking you're gathering elements together and you're bringing there's a beautiful image of of one of the most i think powerful the most powerful secrets in scripture is when mary she sees the wise men come to to to see her and you know she has all these experiences and it says she says mary gathered all these things in her heart and it's like that's it like that's what she does she gathers these elements she gathers stories she gathers elements of the world together to give body and that's what we do as artists right we gather we gather color and and stuff together into bodies so so that's why i think that that she's so important for the she was so important in the the stories about how sacred art was born in the church that's fantastic i didn't know that jonathan i had not made that connection i will bring that up with my students thank you to all of you who have pasted these wonderful links in the chat button this was a very active chat i'm really sorry that we can't get into everybody's questions because we're out of time but i will invite you once again to the scala conference april 21 and 22 in princeton new jersey register to come in person or if you can't come in person please do register online jonathan's talk is going to be on memory and the role of art and identity and then he'll have a follow-up conversation with david clayton and also with paul courier of the common sense society aiden hart will also be speaking and he's going to be focusing his talk on the role of of art in upholding human dignity and showing the face of the person as created in the image of god and why that matters so much for the modern world we'll also have peter carter as i mentioned we'll also have anna bond who's a graphic designer and the co-founder with her husband of rifle paper company which some of you might have seen some of their stationery so she's going to talk about the vision behind her her brand in art so thank you jonathan for your time thank you everybody for being here and i hope everybody leaves inspired to both to really ponder and gather and create and i have great admiration for your work as an artist jonathan and for the incredible work you're doing to spread this vision of art as enabling humanity mediating reality while really standing i think in awe in front of the mystery of god's revelation which is bigger than our awards or our art could ever fully capture so thank you yeah thanks to you this has been wonderful and i'm looking forward to to meeting all of you or some of you at the conference so thanks everyone
