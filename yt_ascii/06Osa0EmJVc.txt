jonathan it's a real pleasure to get the chance to speak to you i've been absorbing a lot of your work over the last week and i've gotten a lot out of it it's been really interesting so i wanted to start with this question of what does it mean to say that the world is becoming re-enchanted well first of all it's great to it's great to meet you i understand that we haven't met before slightly so it's good to it's good to kind of meet you again and i have also been interested in the kind of stuff you're doing in terms of parkour and everything my son is really into parkour so that's kind of what prompted me to say oh yeah i should talk to this guy because i do find i always find if i'd been younger i would have definitely been into parkour like you know just a little younger anyway so we can totally get you into it yeah we'll talk about that after this yeah i'm a little older i'm getting that getting that permanent little belly it's not a big belly it's like a little anyways all right so let's go for it so what do i mean the idea is that the you could say something like the the enlightenment or not just enlightenment the whole process historical process of of development created the possibility for what we kind of call you know materialism or rational rationalism rational materialism today and it's it's basically been a desire to see the stability of the world in in phenomena or manifestation and things that you can quantify right you can you can calculate you can quantify you can count and my contention is that the reason why it was able to kind of last is because it was it was trying to remove let's say the mythological aspects of christianity but it was still surfing on that and so there were still remainders of it or things taken for granted which made it possible for people to pretend as if that wasn't there and then kind of look at the world just as phenomena and calculate and quantify but as they were kind of chopping the tree that was holding them up at some point things started to break down and there really started to be like a breakdown in terms of epistemology which led to something like post-modernism to to this kind of this this instability of of interpretation but there's also another breakdown which is mirroring it which is a breakdown in value and a breakdown in society where we see society fragment and we don't have things to kind of hold them together and so it's so what you feel is that this rational materialism is kind of running its course it's becoming impossible to hold at every level of reality because society is kind of breaking down honestly because of the type of thinking which led to to this this this approach now it's being replaced by other weird mythologies and so the the new atheists without even realizing it are being replaced by the woke and and they almost like opened the door for the without totally i don't think they did it on purpose but they they kind of set the stage for kind of this woke new mythology which is which is coming in so what my contention is it but it also has to do with the the these new the fact that science is trying to deal with consciousness in a way that they haven't before because they reached the edge in terms of the problem of of the quantum the observer in the quantum realm and the problem of understanding the the what john vervicky calls uh what is it combinatorial explosion and the problem of combinatorial explosion and so now they have to have to deal with things which until now i've just been ignored taken for granted right it's like you don't see the glasses you're wearing you don't notice them until things start to get really weird and really wacky and then you have to say wait wait a minute why are things so wacky then you start looking at the lens through which you're looking at the world and that's where we are now and in that movement what we're seeing is that meaning is kind of coming back in and storytelling image making all the tropes ritual all of these things are going to return because of the the crisis the crisis of understanding that the world actually has to be framed somehow even even scientists are starting to understand that and so what is that frame going to be and so it's so so what i'm perceiving is that this is happening in all kinds of ways it's not just once like the it's happening in in very strange ways in terms of the return of religion and this these all these kind of weird fragmented new paganisms this this desire to be all these california buddhists like there's just all these ways in which this is pushing itself back into the world for good and for ill in my opinion but it's to me it's definitely happening it almost there's no that's one of the reasons why i think jordan peterson was so effective is because he was it he was scratching at something which was already like an itch that had been there for even a few decades now and now is everything's kind of coming together so let me restate that not i mean i think that i'm largely in agreement with you in what you've described but i want to see if my model kind of is is the same as yours but it seems to me and you know following vervice work that that we have this this drive towards rationality that maybe starts with with the kindness and and we see it playing out into descartes and newton and all these people and it it it it plays back and forth with the enlightenment the counter enlightenment you know empiricism romanticism and and so these these two things are it's not a linear trajectory but in a certain way like the late 90s and early aughts seemed like a period where you had you had the you had a an upwelling of religious sentiment right and the moral majority in america and then you had the counter reaction to it with the new atheists and and science was was delivering right we had the tech revolution we had all of these things that were that were sort of making the world seem like like a rational approach was was gonna win and i was part of this like i grew up in the counter culture so i grew up surrounded by people who were into mysticism and astrology and they were they were part of this break from the rationalism of the west that happened in the 1960s and i self-selected into to basically being you know a new atheist type myself and i remember all the discussions that were happening on the forums and have you read a an essay called the godlessness that failed by scott alexander i highly recommend it i think you get a lot out of it but i mean he tracks exactly what you're saying and how much it happened like you can look at peop if you if you dig below the surface of the new atheist there's this whole there's this whole phenomena of people arguing for atheism from that perspective online yeah and these whole battles with it and there were all these figures who who were major figures even if they weren't writing books that were new york times bestsellers but who are figures in that culture war yeah and there's a point at which new atheist in which atheist forums and sub forums and platforms basically start adopting something called atheism plus and atheism plus is atheism plus social justice it's not yeah there's this realization that atheism isn't an ethical platform isn't it isn't it it's in nothing right and people needed something yeah and but it's interesting like you can look at the moment in the late 90s when this happened and you can actually see the you can see how it was going to fail from the very outset because the the new atheists were in in a large part reacting ultimately not just in the late 90s but like the big thing that made them really react was was 9 11 like that was kind of the their high moment where it's like here's this religious thing that's coming back and it's and it's going to destroy us right it's it's attacking us it's violent and it's all these things and so the new atheists tried to counter that with their kind of rational atheism but they could never account they were never able to account to why destroying the the two towers was going to destroy america like they didn't they could never understand why it would do that because the reason why those two towers would become the break the beginning of the breakdown of american culture was a mythological one it wasn't a material one like the it's that it was the symbol of these two towers what they were how high they were what they represented in terms of the god of america in terms of business and in terms of money all of this stuff was being attacked and what what happened what happened was a massive ritual like it was it was then it ended up being a ritual event which led to many things and so the answer which is which is that the atheists gave couldn't they could never answer that because it happened like what the terrorists wanted is happening this is what they wanted right they wanted the world to to to to realize they wanted to watch the story of america break down and they knew that by attacking their highest symbol right basically by by an act of desacralization for the god of america that they would succeed and they're succeeding because the the this this now back and forth between totalitarian security and desire for freedom has has now it's just moving back and forth and there's no way there's no way to stop it anymore because there's nothing to answer and also because that god the the the god of economy is not a sufficient god it's it can't hold the society together that's one of the things we're realizing trade is not enough to hold the society together so anyways go ahead with the with the 80s and plus but i just wanted to kind of interject that and to see why it it was they they never understood what they were dealing with and i don't agree with the terrorists obviously i don't agree with them but i can understand what they were doing yeah i mean i'm i'm reminded of of listening to dan carlin talk about the history of the syrian empire and how when they conquered a new people like one of the first things they did was take down all the statues of their gods and basically take them back to their their own city and put them in subservience to their overarching god right there's a there's a symbolic power to this act and i think the idea of of capitalism as a god is actually a really profound one but let's let's dig into that a little bit more as we go through see how to finish the thought that i was on is basically atheism as a sort of cultural trend was gobbled from within by social justice and the people who were supporting this kind of militant atheism ended up almost a mass going over and really kind of particular figure you can look at is pz myers pz meyer spent all of his time arguing against creationists up until i think 2011 2012 and then all of a sudden it switches over and now it's about the racists and the misogynists the the homophobes and the transphobes right and all of his writing is now there and and so i share the sense that that religion keeps popping up right like her i remember i was i was involved in crossfit in the early days of crossfit and there was the sense all of a sudden that like crossfit's a cult right like it's many things right and it can be a great form of exercise i'm not i'm not sort of smashing down on all the all the crossfitters but but like people start treating it as their place to have an experience of the sacred right and i remember identify with it yeah like they make it they're part of their large part of their identity you can see it when you see someone does crossfit you can usually recognize them pretty fast not so much anymore but when it was like at that point you could just like be like oh yeah that guy yeah i mean you know the joke was like you know how do you know someone's a crossfitter like don't worry they'll tell you right the joke also works with vegans right and yeah yeah yeah that's the other the other experience that i had of like of like okay wait like religion's popping up all over because i remember sitting down with this guy and and talking about veganism and he was trying to sort of like he he was a new zealand veganism and he was moving through the parkour community in in england and and he he's like okay i'm a sustainability vegan right he i choose veganism because it's better for the planet and i was like well here's why that's not probably the case right and then he's like well i'm i'm a health vegan and i was like well here's why that's probably not the healthiest for you and then he was like well i'm an ethical vegan laid out i laid out why why it's possible and maybe i'm wrong like i'm not claiming i'm wrong but i made an argument why why you know there are more animals that are destroyed through farming you know for soybean and corn than would otherwise be and you have to utilize more land if you're not utilizing mixed farming system and it just hit a wall and then it was like well i'm just a vegan because right yeah and i was like oh there's there's no rational argument that will convince you out of this because this is your sacred value this is what you you worship right but the ethical vegan is the greatest vegan because the ethical vegan is reinstating the human sacred without even realizing is saying that we do not participate we are above natural processes and we kind of stand above them and then we look at them from above kind of like from this this high mountain and then we we we choose not to participate in the in the violence because obviously animals eat each other like animals you know that the fate of an animal in the in the wild is is is pretty bleak like in terms of how it's going to end its life and so the idea that the idea that someone would think that it's ethical to not kill animals means that they stand above like angels above the world and they kind of look at it from a spiritual place so it's just interesting because veganism exists in religious traditions but it's specifically like monks are they're not vegan but they're definitely vegetarian in the christian tradition and i think in buddhism and in many other you know and the jains are like they're they're basically he should have just said i'm a jane like that's what he should have said like i'm really i what i really am is a kind of a religious person but anyways all right keep going sorry yeah so this one's a touchy one but you you already mentioned wokism but i mean not like it was really striking to see this come up after george floyd right and the washing of the feet and the like i was walking through seattle and i saw this altar that someone had created in their front yard with like martin luther king's name and george floyd's name and tawanna bradley and and and and trayvon martin and all of these all of these slogans and all of this artwork right like like like pieces of glass and mirrors and feathers and like i said i actually sent a picture of it to john and said like this is an altar right like is there any other way to interpret this but as an altar and he's like yeah it's an altar it's clearly an altar and so it was like i had this sense that you know i described this to him so if i'll tell you a little story a friend of mine who's a gay black man he you know after the george floyd protests you know he had all of these people calling him and asking him about you know is he okay is he okay is he okay right and he's like this has been my experience of america like i've had this expectation of the police the whole time right like nothing's changed for me but all of a sudden this one thing happens and everyone's concerned about me and then and then he had this sense that like well he felt at first like all these people loved him and were his friends and then he had this disillusionment where his sense was actually they were just calling him to basically be shriven of their sins right and i told him that i think that basically this movement the blm movement is a kind of it's a it's a kind of reflection of christianity where the suffering of christ on the cross has been replaced by the suffering of the african-american right and and and the thing about that that's really terrifying to me is that african-americans are actually then forced into a priestly class right where their role is instrumental for white americans to be able to release their sins by checking their privilege because checking your privilege is just confessing your sins that's what it yeah that's a it's exactly what it is and it's and it's different from christianity because christianity has a universal form where there there is an absolution and also the priest himself like if you watch if you listen to look at a christian liturgy there's a moment in the liturgy where the priest will turn to the people and will say forgive me brothers and sisters and there's an understanding that this is not a one just a one way thing where we all participate in this in this this desire to forgive each other and to kind of cover each other's sins so that we can come together and be one right it's the point the point of like the point of asking forgiveness for your sins is to then be in communion with people it's not just a moral finger wagging or some kind of getting rid of a feeling of guilt it actually is supposed to bind you but if it doesn't then like you said it becomes a very very dangerous situation where you have one group of people that has ultimate authority and then another group of people that just need to get that get their forgiveness from those and that's it and so and and there it doesn't even seem to be a way to fully be absolved in that in that movement like a perpetual guilt yeah there's no there's no redemption right no it's a dark it's a dark enlightenment right and there's another great book that i like called um oh professing professing feminism or no i'm sorry i forgot it's by daphne corgi and our daphne patel and corgi but they basically talk about the rise of gender critical theory in women's studies and they talk about it as like there's eventually this this realization that that the young women mostly who are entering this are having a conversion experience like a christian conversion experience except there's no hope right what they're being told is that patriarchy is is in every every ounce of every moment of everything that is done and that it's always going to be there and it means that everything is everything is essentially dependent on the creation of their suffering yeah and that's that's actually an extraordinarily psychologically destructive way to view the world yeah yeah and that's why you see like the the image of the critical this this kind of radical feminist is is a sad one like in just in terms of you know how they they how they present themselves like their mimicry their faces you can feel like this deep anger and despair which rules over them you know like they just live in a world of anger and despair yeah so so if if somebody what should we do yeah so so if we if we identify that that religion is popping up everywhere right what is what is the symbolic world why why is it necessary to understand at this point in order to to move forward through the breakdown well so the idea what so when we look at this what we see is something which is is a kind of disease version of religion or a kind of completely whack whack version of religion but what we can help us understand is that it's manifesting something which is inherent to the human person and cannot be gotten rid of that is the desire to participate in in common purposes those that's what being a human is and in order for that to happen like in order for us to be able to participate together to recognize each other as being part of a group there has to be a totem which appears above it there has to be something which is beyond the group which will bind it together you know and so i often use the image of a of a sports team like a sports team is a religious venture yeah you know and and everything about it is is religious and there are certain sacred things you have to be careful even it becomes superstitious like you know so many sports people are engaged in actions which for a rational materialist would be considered superstitious but it's really just all these token behaviors which are there to manifest the unity of the group and there's a sense in which the unity even of the fans for example will participate in the winning of the team and this is true like it's true it will actually work which is why teams lose yeah you know will lose at in another city but will win on in their own city because the coherence of the the fans and their participation will participate in the winning of the team and so all of it is really this kind of coming together but i also want to point to is that this is actually completely inevitable we this is what makes us human and so now that we realize this we have to be able to deal with it appropriately so if we pretend if we try to ignore or suppress this reality of either we'll be doing it without realizing it we'll participate in it unconsciously or it'll actually come back almost like a like a hydra it'll come back in a very dark dark and dangerous way because these desires they also they also have a very dangerous and dark undertone if we're not careful you know because this desire to join together it means you exclude necessarily that's what it is and so inclusion and exclusion is is a is is a dangerous it's a dangerous thing and it can lead to violence and war and all of this and so if we need to so the idea is this is inevitable and the kind of the weird like the weird globalist desire to to create this like one world thing or whatever to avoid it is not going to avoid it it's going to fragment at lower levels that's what the story of babel is the story babel is this desire to to say oh like if we just create one thing if we just like have one massive group and then we're all in the group then it'll then it'll work but that's not how it works if you don't have intermediary groups if it doesn't manifest itself fractally is what i try to talk about it's like you need you need layers of unity so it's like you your family your city your group and then your religious unity and you know you have all these layers of unity if you try to remove those so that we're all in just one thing we're gonna we're gonna rip each other apart we're gonna rip each other's eyes out at some point we're going to start to fear the your neighbor you're going to start to to create weird groups of unity and then there's going to be a civil basically civil war is what's going to happen it's sort of happening right i mean yeah exactly i mean that's why i can say it without flinching because it's already happening and it can get a lot worse because we're not even it's not even started it's it's going to get worse yeah there's a you know there's i think there's survey data that shows that like you know the the sense of how good race relationships in this country are is is is going down very fast and and then obviously the polarization between left and right has reached a level that's that's really absurd and it's interesting because let's say when people talk like let's say you think of the civil war the u.s civil war or you think of other civil wars in history usually what it is it's like there are competing groups within the unity right so there are two tribes that are that are together in war two families two big families that are together in one one unity and then the tension between these two tribes you know becomes so strong that the unity can't hold anymore and then one has to defeat the other or they have to split or they have to do something like that but now it's it's all across the system so it's not like the north and the south yeah right it's it's everywhere and it's it's your neighbor and it's in the cities and it's in the it's in the it's the cities versus the the outside it's the it's the it's it's not even even just parts of the country it's like within the country it's happening at every level so that kind of civil war it's is my goodness you have no idea what could come we've got white versus people of color we've got asian versus black we've got you know the whole thing that's going on with the jews right now is really scary and and then you have rural urban you have low income high income you've got men versus women you've got unmarried women versus married women totally different perception of things right now so there's lots of there's lots of fragmentation there's a one thing that's ironic and i just wanted to bring this up quickly another essay by slate star codex worth worth reading is called i can tolerate everything but the out group and it's about this idea that that the the sacralization of tolerance is actually allowing a sense of intolerance of anyone who doesn't hold that value as most sacred that is paradoxically extremely intolerant yeah i mean it's it's it's so funny when you encounter it it's like you just want to laugh it just so you don't cry like i remember meeting a really kind of woke person at an event where i was talking about jordan peterson and he came to me he was kind like because we were talking about jack davida and the idea of hospitality of like radical hospitality which did not talk about this like absolute openness and i was trying to argue with him how impossible that is but he was saying like this is the way we need to go then he then he says this little thing he says well obviously we're not going to be radically hospitable to fascists but then he keeps going i'm like oh okay what just happened great what just happened yes not everyone but the the person that i've decided is my enemy yeah exactly right yeah which is where christianity is brilliant well that's the idea right it's it's it's it's like it be it turns gets turned inwards and then it becomes about self-sacrifice like that becomes the mode of of let's say the mode of of and the person that was killed and and brought out of the city is is god himself and then that plays itself in your own self where it's like i need to i need to sacrifice myself instead of sacrificing the the neighbor or the other yeah the scapegoat that's very good the self so i want to go back to the religion as a team sport idea or team sport as a religion idea because i another another resource that i really i'm getting a lot from is a book called the righteous mind by jonathan height have you have you read that yeah well i haven't read the whole thing but i haven't i've read parts and listened to many of his lectures yeah so i mean you know it's really resonant with what we're talking about because you know he has a chapter in there i mean basically it's about understanding the out group right and it's about understanding what what the telos of different groups actually is like one of the things i told you before the call that i wanted to have this call with you really in particular once i heard you with rationality rules and adam printed because i felt like i was able to operate the conceptual framework that they were playing in but i was more open to the conceptual framework that you're playing in and i wanted to be able to to produce that right but i think from a rational materialist mindset like this chat the chapter you're right it's called religion as a team sport really helps understand because he's essentially saying that biologically and culturally we've evolved we've evolved this capacity to act in groups and the research shows that that having a religious system improves that and religions are probably selected over time for their ability to help people act in groups right and there's always the thing about a group is that it has an out group and this is part of your you know i think what you talk about a lot which is really brilliant is in order to define a group you have to have an out group and the default human tendency towards the treatment of the outgroup is complete alienation this is something that people i think it would be really useful for people to read the anthropological literature a lot more closely and not with a sort of noble savage gloss on it because i feel like sometimes i like people will read it an anthropological thing and they'll be like oh man their lives are so amazing i'm like i read the same book as you and i don't know if you read the part where the the man just kills a child for no reason or or the woman is beaten by multiple husbands because that that's part of this tribe that you've just told me is like the perfect example of egalitarianism but but one of the things that you find is that the that very often in tribal cultures the name for people outside the tribe is just not people yeah they're not human they're not human and they don't have any there's no sense of moral obligation to them yeah and i think yeah which is why like the type of torture that they conflict on someone which is from outside the group is like no there's no limits you saw that in native culture here in canada where it's like they if they caught someone from the other tribe they could do anything to them yeah yeah absolutely and it wasn't like it actually wasn't it was interesting because it wasn't a racial thing it was a ritual reality and so they could ultimately adopt someone from another tribe and once they were adopted then they were like oh they're they're they in the end group but unless that happened then they were they were inhuman and they were just basically something to be acted upon so yeah yeah i mean i think there's definitely a truce to the idea that that the way that we perceive race or the way that race was perceived say in the late 19th century early 20th century has this massive social construction and it's un using this underlying group competition psychology and it's mapping it to to certain physiological differences in order to you know for for a variety of reasons right historically but it's it's not a default setting to to automatically treat those physical characteristics as the most most important aspect of someone's identity yeah yeah and also i mean the the racism itself is a modern concept like it is a scientific it's a scientific take on the on the ancient perception of difference but it but now we've made it into these scientific defendable categories so scientific racism is is most the nazis were more like scientific racists than they were like the ancient people and how they understood difference or understood stranger and that kind of stuff yeah so so i wanted i wanted to get into your idea of the the cosmological frame like i think the conversation we've had so far well maybe i can just into what you're talking about about jonathan height and let's say the difference between what jonathan height is saying and let's say a proper religious understanding is that jonathan height perceives that there are these axes you know that people will elevate something a virtue or someone or something and then they will process around that that reality right they will they'll circumambulate around a common point and then that will create cohesion in the group but jonathan heights seems to treat that as almost like arbitrary as if as if like whatever it is you decide is gonna is going to be up there then that's going to be the thing that's going to join together it's going to play out but this is in terms of a religious understanding you could understand that it is perceiving this which led to something like the what we call the monotheistic religions which is actually that if you if you follow like i was actually just reading i was reading fidris recently plato's feeders and in in it socrates talks about how the followers of certain gods will seduce their lover in a way that resembles the god and so it's like if you follow zeus then the way you will approach your lover will be like zeus if you follow you know if you follow this god then then you will kind of approach your lover in that way and this is this you're going to be yeah exactly and just aggression if you're pan let's go to the woods so there were different so you just but it's mostly the idea to understand that like whatever it is that you follow you subject yourself to that right so if you like you say when we talked about the idea of crossfitters it's like people who who follow crossfit or worship crossfit they become crossfitters it's not arbitrary they actually they actually embody the thing that they're worshiping yeah so so right they become the body of the thing they're worshiping and so this is the movement let's say towards monotheism which is that okay we realize that there are aspects of reality that are fragmented and if we if we worship those as the highest thing then we we embody something but it ends up being in conflict with something else because it's it's a fragmented aspect of reality which is why like so the greek cities would just fight all the time and even though they went to the olympics or whatever they would fight every year there would always be wars between the greek cities because they were subject to different principalities and those principalities they didn't necessarily elevate above there was like a competition between them whereas the idea of like a monotheistic thing is like let how do these all these things come together higher up can we have something which unites them in a higher way and then you have the kind of neoplatonic idea being itself and then love right because love is the manner in which multiplicity exists as one so you can have both multiple and one and so then you kind of go you keep going and then you have this idea like let's say in christianity the revelation of the trinity which is the notion that there's in you there's a mult thing that's both infinitely multiple and infinitely one at the same time it seems like a total contradiction but you realize actually no if we worship that then we can both have multiple and one because if you if you if you're too much in unity you have a problem which is that difference starts to get sucked into the unity people become like carbon copies of each other like in communist countries but if you just worship multiplicity then all of a sudden things start to break down like like we're seeing now and then fault lines start to appear people start to fight amongst each other so what's the highest thing we can worship it's something which is both at the same time i want to try to ground this in biology right like my frame often is going to go back to evolutionary biology but but i think like when you talk about multiplicity and immunity that's the right words right yeah like that ends up having a very sort of mythological frame sounding to it and i think it's hard for a rational materialist to grasp it like i literally feel like i didn't get what you were actually saying until last night okay and then i was like oh this is exactly what verveiki is saying right verveiki describes that as the process of of of diversification and integration yes so every process that that complexifies has to both diversify functions while uniting them under some overarching talos right yeah so simultaneously like it has to be constantly happening at the same time yeah and and then this is what with what height talks about in the righteous mind is the idea that that cooperation always suffers a a free rider problem right but we've we've actually been able to move up through these levels of cooperation right the single cells first you have like mitochondria that go into cells right and they are they're two different things and then all of a sudden they learn to cooperate and not default off of each other and then single cells become multiple cells and then those become organs and so like that's that's your developmental process you started as a single cell and then then what can happen there's two things that can happen one one sort of cell can just start start replicating itself and trying to turn everything into itself that's cancer and you die the other thing that can happen is your your systems can go to war with each other that's autoimmune disease that can also kill you yeah right and so we have these these two directions that you're talking about the direction of of of of sort of collapse into a single thing which destroys the overarching thing yeah which is what they tried to do in the matrix with agent smith like that's what agent smith was supposed to be he's supposed to be like this this like the tyranny of of of a specific thing that tries to to make everything into itself yeah cancer basically cancer yes it takes everything over so so i think that it's really helpful to be able to look at that from these two different frames right now i think that part of what makes your world be your your world view and not say jordan peterson like i think a lot of people are just mapped the way that you think to jordan peterson yeah like that was something that came up in those two conversations it was like wait you're actually a religious person who believes in god yeah i'm not jordan peterson that's for sure is is that you think that there's a reason why framing it as in that mythological realm rather than in the biological analogy actually works better but it's not just that it's it's that you can one of the difficulties people seem to for one of you can see it top down and bottom up you're seeing it top bottom bottom up let's say and that's fine with me like i'm fine with bottom up but the thing is that you have to keep going that's the that's the point it's like can you keep going that is there a way to start bottom up from like let's say quantum possibility field of possibility and then move all the way to being itself that is how all this multiplicity joins together towards unity but then it also continues in the human person but it continues across human persons that's what a city is right a city is the same as a cell it's a it's a trans-personal being that that is is is engaging in those rules of complexity that you mentioned you know constantly diversifying constantly unifying and it's a it's a it's a messy process like it it's not always totally clean but it's happening or else cities wouldn't exist and then countries etc etc and so the idea is that there there has to be a way for it to continue to scale up and then if you scale that up to its limit that's what you you get to you you end you inevitably get to something like love or infinite love or or the divine trinity that's what you will get to because one of the problems that i see is that people see it in biologically but then they stop at some level some reason it's like keep going man it keeps going like keep going up and at some point it also becomes true in the world of intelligence so it's like it's not it doesn't it's not only biological you'll notice that ideas also have that same pattern where ideas have have places where they unify in places where they they complexify so if you think just any any concept or any any let's say abstract notion will also have that in it it'll have it it'll have an aspect of complexification and unification then you can keep going in that world sure so like just to to to throw an example for people right you could look at parkour and you could you could divide it into a series of of sub disciplines the different people practice so there's like rail flow and there's bar swinging and then there's like all the tree jumping in the wood right nike and you could see those things as essentially separate and they could they could even like separate like someone might decide they're just gonna go be a railflow guy and they're not gonna mess with the rest of parkour and then you can be like well okay well parkour is a movement art and now you see that it's unified with other movement arts right so now now you see that it's in some overlapping category that contains also martial arts and dance yeah yeah skateboarding like all these kind of movement arts and then they move like you said it moves into something which is even higher and then you could then that could keep going like it could keep going up if you were if you were capable of perceiving how everything moves into being let's say so that's exactly what i'm talking about yeah yeah so so i had this so growing up in the community that i did i the word spirituality makes the hairs on the back of my neck right like when when someone says spirituality i feel like they're about to try to sell me yeah right like they're gonna i understand no i see what you i know what you mean they're gonna tell me like spirituality to me is telling me that it's really important to i'll give you a really precise example when i was growing up there was a certain people within my community who would say you create your own reality yeah there's this idea that that like and those people would then turn around and do heinous  and say that the reason that you felt their was heinous was because you were creating your own reality yeah that's horrible right that that that just drove me crazy and so i've always like at a certain point the the stuff that i was teaching started being like well parkour has some kind of profound transformational impact on you well how do i understand that how do i help people get that how do we get more of that and someone's like well you're a spiritual teacher it's like well no because those are are are full of yeah and i'm trying not to be yeah and but then i had this i was reading two books one is a book called the spell of the census by david abram and that's about phenomenology that's very much inspired by merlot ponte and the other one is a book called what the robin knows and it's about it's about bird languages and i had the sense of exactly what you're describing i believe which is that when you walk through the woods you hear birds singing and you can tune into a bird or you can turn into the birds and all of the birds together actually contain an intelligence that's more than the single bird okay so if all the birds go quiet you know there's a predator in the area yeah right and so there's a neural net and you can you can pay attention to where the quiet is and where the noise is and you can pay attention to where the alarm calls are and all of these birds are like they're they're little neural nets that are communicating to other neural nets through sound that are that are giving you information about the environment yeah and hunter foragers are extraordinarily attuned to this and they will be like okay i know where these animals are because i'm listening to the signals from the forest and i'll say well that the easiest way to conceptualize that is that's the spirit of the bird it's the spirit of the birds and then you could understand that the spirit of the birds is is a sub-segment of the spirit of the forest but there's all this other information between the trees and the other animals and all of that kind of rises up to something above that yeah and i believe that that's what you are referring to when you talk to something about something like powers and principalities and then we could we could understand facebook and google and social media as as all of these things right yeah especially now it seems like we're building something like we're building some kind of of a body of a god that's for sure it seems pretty obvious by now so interesting we're building we're building new gods right it's really hard like but this is not new this is what pagans did all the time like this is what that's what making they would make statues of a god and then they would they would open its nostrils so that it could become the center of a community and then people would embody the god like they would they would become worshipers and like i told you about in the how socrates describes the followers of certain gods as embodying but the statue would be like the would be like the place where our attention would go like all our attention kind of moved towards that that embodiment and and that's would be part of the how we would how we would manifest the god and so it's like the google is is definitely acting that way and what's interesting about google and facebook too what's interesting about them is that they they're pretending they're they're all there are there's like a priestly cast that's whispering there's like a priesty class whispering the will of god and we and we can't they don't want it to know that it's there but it's there and so it's like the google searches are obviously tainted towards whatever that priestly cast wants us to to believe and so all the actually all the really negative stuff about about religion that people caricature like this idea of this like greasy cassidy wants to control everybody it's like this is what's happening right now if you want to know like this is a and and they don't have they don't have something above them which is supposed to be their judge if there's nothing above them which is there isn't a tradition or something before them or above them which is telling them like so like let's say a priest abuses his power he can do it in in the catholic church let's say but everybody knows that he's wrong even if you know he can do it and it's going to happen all the time but everybody recognizes that it's wrong whereas now there is no there is no ultimate there is nothing above to kind of well there is i believe but like at least in their perception like they're the arbiters of reality really so that's scary stuff and we you know we could say that there's a telos to social media oh yeah there's a there's a there's a goal which it is serving and at a first approximation maybe that is is capturing of attention but that yeah that's but that's it's also understanding how reality works it's it's really in a way we're in a good place because because social media and and google is showing us that the world is in many ways functions through attention that it's actually made of attention and now once you realize that the world is made of attention to a certain extent then again ancient religious rituals will become less arbitrary to you you know the idea that to attend to something which is beyond you to do it together right to stand together and then to attend to something which is beyond you is actually has a actually has a a causative function like a causative role it actually causes unity in that group it's a different kind of causality it's hard because materialists understand that there are causalities of like billiard balls hitting each other but there's a type of causality which is a causality of of of unity right this is the formal cause that that that aristotle talked about like there's a there's something which brings you together yeah so in my conversations with verveiki and vander clay we've talked about your perspective and in particular talked about your perspective also in relationship with with david abrams perspective and the the place where i get hung up is i find what you have to say extremely insightful right but there's a point at which you assert that a pattern of being exists right this is just the pattern right the pattern is heaven and earth the pattern is there's the unstructured potential outside of heaven and earth masculine is this feminine it is associated with this and it's annoying huh that's annoying and and my question is always how do you es what's the epistemology that allows you to assert that right like i think that in your conversation with with with stephen winford you you basically i think make it i wish i could replay what you said exactly but you made a case that essentially that he has no way of establishing the good that his frame doesn't allow him to establish the good and that he's not fully conscious of that right that i think was a key part of your argument so it's like you're telling me that my thing doesn't doesn't serve the good but you don't you don't know how to describe your own good and like you know based on on on heights book i would say that harm reduction is actually the good that he's talking about right it's the closest to to the god that he's worshiping but he couldn't actually tell you that but i would say that reciprocally i still don't understand how you establish the true sorry you broke down could you repeat that i said reciprocally i would say i don't know how you establish the true like i i sort of like you you asked him where do you stand right and i would say that i don't have the same certainty about where i stand it that you do like i feel like i stand within scientific epistemology right as a rational materialist and that i recognize that that frame that set of axioms doesn't give me everything that i need and i suspect based on what that frame tells me that a lot of what i'm relying on is actually christian but it's that it's this ghost of christianity or the bones of christianity that i'm standing on yeah i don't know that i can that i can say that with 100 clarity right i don't know i think that's a quite difficult question to answer really well yeah but but that's where i would say that i'm standing but i would say that that i that i that i believe that we have a good way of asserting a truth claim within scientific epistemology and that we have to be able to understand and utilize that system because it's what allows this technology that we're speaking on to work and if we if we allow if we allow sort of participatory mystical phenomenological thing to colonize all the way down into the propositional level that runs a risk of collapsing it and it's already happening right science is already like all of these all of these little religions that are popping up they're trying to colonize and crush science yeah social justice does not want science to operate in science it wants it to operate fully in service it's lysynchoism right so but then you'll realize that science at least the kind of the the image of science that people think has never really manifested right that it has always been serving goals like other goals and and what social and what the social justice people want is only that science serves their goals and and and by doing that it appears to us like a clash because we're like not in the same world and so like it's a different world and they're saying we want these technical physical descriptions to serve our our goals let's say but it that i think has pretty much always been the the case like it's always kind of been there so i've made the argument to verveiki that that i think that if we're going to kind of survive the western that if western civilization and what has given rise to the world system that it's given rise to is going to survive probably the best thing that we can do is in some sense recover christianity because it's the only religious system that has a history of allowing science to fully develop within its under its eaves right and his counter argument is that the islamic golden age and you know i don't think i have an answer to that but but but i do think there's something there and i think you know there's a claim that that really that that science is sort of necessarily nested within a religious frame yeah that's definitely what i what i what i believe but maybe i can maybe i can how can i say this so maybe i can help you with the the problem of when i say heaven and earth and all these things yeah the the first thing that the first thing that we need to notice is that the terms that are used when i talk about it are always analogical they're always and so you can even hear it often in my voice so i'll say i say you can say something like and then i'll say something because the pattern is a is a pure intuition and and i don't know what to say besides that and that's going to be annoying for a lot of kind of materialist but there is a sense and it's a some it's a universal sense it's not just in christianity it's an almost in every religious system that humans have a capacity to intuit the the reality to intuit the real pattern and that intuition is not reason it reason flows from that intuition and so so it's it's a direct grasping of of the of the pattern but then you can't you can't when you when you bring it back down into the world of manifestation you have to translate that or you have to you have to embody it you have to give it form and then you can talk about different patterns and the only way to help people see or to intuit the the actual pattern is to i mean there are different ways like zen cohen's or like the different ways to kind of provoke that in people the way that i try to do it is to give you a bunch of analogies that you don't think that you don't think fit together but like all these examples of things you don't think actually have something in common and then all of a sudden you see that they have something in common and it gives you a little glimpse and it appears to you like an insight like a spark you have this like scent that it's coming together and often you can't hold on to that it'll it'll kind of get it and then it'll go away but but that insight is described in every single religious system that ever existed it's like this kind of this glimpse of reality and then then this kind of fade away and so it's going to be annoying what i'm going to say but it's like that's what my truth claim is grounded in i don't know what to tell you your tooth correct your truth claim is grounded in a in a personal intuition it's grounded in an intuition which then becomes verified as you can see the intuition embodied in different levels of reality but so that's how you that's how you verify right so you you so you have the intuition and then you have to then you have to see if it finds body so if it works at the personal level at this at the civilizational level at the family level if if it works in stories if you find it in stories you can find it in ritual if you find if you're able to see how this intuition embodies itself then you're close like you're closer to a real pattern than if it's just this weird like freak thing that you that you kind of you can people can have intuitions but often they don't they're not right like they don't actually verify when you try to embody them and so so there is a there's almost like there is a kind of scientific it's close to actually how science work because people don't realize that scientists often don't find things by digging in the dirt they have intuitions yes absolutely and then they verify whether or not by digging in the dirt it'll it'll pan out and that's exactly the way that i that i work it's like i have an intuition and then i try to verify it at different levels so but it's a little different than it's a little different than the the scientific way but it's nonetheless trying to find the pattern embodied let's say yeah so i heard two things there one was kind of an appeal to pragmatism right sorry you have to repeat that i keep breaking down so you said you heard two things yeah one is an appeal to pragmatism right and basically this very it really sounds a lot like peterson's argument and there's two aspects to peterson's argument one is is is you kind of know that a pattern is true when it works for you but it works well enough but but the the corollary to that claim would be that he would say that that we only ever get there we only ever get to true enough we never have the full truth and then the second claim is basically like in maps of meaning peterson you know basically makes a claim that that his his his cosmological view that he's putting forth there is verified through multi-factor you know multi-method verification right that's that's the term that's the scientific term for it so he's he's saying okay if this pattern shows up in the neurobiology and in the cognitive science and in the anthropology and in the evolutionary biology then then i'm gonna take that as as true right in the same sense that you know if i see something and it's surprising to me if i can then smell it and hear it and touch it then i'll accept that it's real in a way that that my eyes alone won't tell me that something's real yeah so those are the two things that i that that i hear as sort of your your system starts with intuition and then moves into into multi-factor multi-method and then is grounded at grounds out in pragmatism it's something like that the difference maybe between me jordan and i is that i ground it above and he seems to grounded below it's like i think that so so it's like what is this the the the word of christ who says blessed are those who did not see and and and believe like that is that if you have the pure intuition that's where reality lays not in the embodied pragmatic thing because the embodimatic thing is messy and it's kind of it's it has variability and it's sometimes it's it's a little off but then the pattern is pure like it has it it's a it's almost mathematical and so you need both and i agree and you totally need both but i ground i let's say you could say something like you just is going to be annoying to the secular to the secular people but i think i ground my life in in my faith in christ sure rather than in the multiplicity and in the in the like the variability of existence and so it's it's it's a so that maybe that's the difference between jordan and i so i think solidity comes from above doesn't come from below i i'd like to dig into that i i mean i'm i that one i struggle with right i understand that you struggle with i because so to go back to the beginning of the conversation we're talking about how sort of modernity reaches a point it's like you you break all the molecules down into atoms and then you break the atoms down into subatomic particles and then you reach this point at which it's just uncertainty right and that's not what you expected at all yeah aristotle's potential is waiting for you yeah so you end up you you expect clockwork at the bottom of reality and you end up with quantum fields and then and then you spend the last like 60 years basically unable to get anything that creates new technological opportunities out of trying to figure out what's at the bottom of reality and you know i don't understand quantum physics i don't think anyone understands quantum physics so if i butchered it and what i say makes no sense because of it you know forgive me but but so we so we end up there right and essentially so much of science is is powered by reductionism and then there's a point at which that doesn't work anymore and now we have complexity right we have combinatorial explosion we have complexity sciences systems thinking and all of this gives us a way to understand emergence right so we know that things emerge right that that you know the way i understand we notice it i don't think people understand it okay but david bentley heart had a great term he said he said he said rationalist use the word emergence like you would use the word magic it's like your magic happens they just found another word for it so so a lot of people people who talk about complexity that's exactly what it sounds like to me and what really helped me was understanding that you can understand a dynamical system as a system with two cost functions right and that when you put these two cost functions in opposition to each other across an equation that they generate a random walk right so the the classic one the one that that's you know really important all of science is evolution right you have mutation and sexual reproduction which produces variation and then you have selection which selects from above among that and then all these crazy things emerge from it right so so i get that right that makes sense to me and i feel like i have really really epistemologically sound ways of getting there right so but then like when i listen to you or jp marcel or someone else you talk about this idea of emanation right so i wanna i wanna look at an example right one of the things that the problem is going to be easier to see emanation at a human scale because it's it has to do with intelligence it's going to be harder to see it at a biological like low level it's there but it's harder to see it's easier to see at a human level like so if you deal with humans okay so let's say i i found a a city who i talked about this on my channel recently it's like i'm constantine and i'm the king i'm the emperor and then i found a city and so i come and i do a sacred ritual i will take a lance and i will like walk behind an angel to like mark the limit of the city and and and so so i actually give it a name i found it i give it a name and then it from that will a city will will appear like people will start to congregate around that center and we'll start to to to to do the things people in cities do around that sacred gesture that i did okay so in the in the let's say there's a there is right nearby where i live there's a town that the first thing in the town that was built was a church and so they built a church which is a common place a place of unity where everybody congregates and worships the same thing and then you know a few decades later there was an entire town built around the church so that's a form you could say like that's a form of understanding causality from above which is you found you name you you know you create a a coherence and then the world kind of comes in and manifests manifest from from you know so founding a company founding anything that is almost human needs to have an aspect of eminence that you can easily perceive for it to free to exist like for a group to exist it has to have a name you have to name it right and so it's like you have a band you get a bunch of guys together but it's like okay so if we're going to exist we need a name and so then you name the band and the name of the band like if you name the band the na a name that sounds like like a pop band or if you name the band the the a name that sounds like a like a death metal band because those actually can be recognized in the name yeah it will affect so you couldn't have like a death metal name and then make pop songs because it'll be so incoherent that it's going to break apart so you need to have so in the name and in the image and in this kind of founding you need it you need a type of coherence so that's a form of that's a form of a form of eminence but i mean there are so many but they're a lot easier to see for sure in human in the human sphere but i mean can't you see that that that emanation itself is derived from an emergence it's a it's a it's both happening at the same time right but you can't only see it as as as emergent like you can't it doesn't like at least to me like the founding of especially the idea of like the the idea of the founding of something because there's a whole idea that we remember the founding it's like why do we remember the founding if it's just emergence like we we re tell ourselves the story of the founding of the united states we tell ourselves the story of these these sacred moments that are the origin of a community because it actually binds the community together that's why we remembered it and we tell the stories and so like companies that have like companies that have good founding stories will it'll actually affect like how how much it how much it lasts like you know yeah so it's but it but the thing is that you can't only see it as emerg as as as top down it has to be both at the same time that's the that's the bond of love you could say like that's the communion of love there's a great quote by sam maximus the confessor that i always like to to quote but people have heard it a thousand times but it's he says that as the as a person let's say a mystic kind of raises above phenomena and then starts to see the spiritual essences kind of rise up from the multiplicity he'll he notices that there's no contradiction like there's no contradiction between those essences and the way they exist embodied below those that's actually that's actually how it works so it's like it's it's that's why reality is often described as the meeting of lovers right as a sexual union which is that you need you need the desire of both like you need the man to you need the man to give and need the woman to be to to to give herself as well in the different way that she does like she has to be able to receive what the man is giving and so that is the that is the union of heaven and earth which is both eminence and emergence happening at the same time and that's how you have a child that's how you have the fruit of the you know the next the another that's how an identity is formed you could say but i understand that it's harder for you to see for me it's very easy to see it's actually a lot easier to think that way than to think the other way yeah i mean i'm i'm very much grounded in in sort of a rational materialist epistemology and and i'm i'm i feel like i'm going to need to watch this part back and mull on it to try to understand it because you know we're sort of obviously this is this is tapping into the idea of the forms and and and this this idea that like give me let me give you one little more example like this is actually a pretty good example so so like imagine you have you have something like you have something like punk music right so punk music appears right and so actually music is just rock music right yeah so why is it that why is it why is there pump and so what do we name punk but that keeps going right so you all of a sudden because there there's always variability it's obviously no punk band is the same but at some point you name that you name the variability and so you're like that's emo but then once you name the variability it has a causal function you're going to have way more emo bands once you've named emo than before for sure i mean it was just this variable thing that was kind of and then people start to perceive that there's something different and then they give it a name and then once they name it then it takes body and it starts to actually manifest as a as a coherent whole yeah so the analogy that pops into my mind or the the the example that pops into my mind is of course parkour right so when i started parkour i was teaching gymnastics and the guy who there was a guy in my in the gymnastics sort of adult class that i attended who they warned me was a crazy guy and he was always doing like weird off like fringe stuff to gymnastics he was die rolling over vault boxes and swinging between you know uneven bar setups and swinging on the rings and all the stuff that like gymnasts don't do and and so i discovered parkour and i was like okay dean that's his name like you should try this because it seemed like the stuff he was already doing and he he then like pulls me into doing parkour with him and then we go out and he takes me to all these places that he's already been jumping and climbing around the city that he didn't have a name for and he had friends who he was doing this with for years right and the same thing happens daniel bach is one of those famous parkour athletes like he he sees a guy doing a wall flip because he's a caporista and then he starts jumping around and on the roofs in his city because he's just intuits that somehow wall flips mean you can jump off roofs and then and then oleg vorslav in in lithuania does the same thing and so then like all over the world the as the parkour community sort of scaffold itself up it finds all these people who are already doing it but they didn't have a name for it right so kids have always run jump and climb and then some people don't stop right or stop less than other people and so it's like the potential was always there but then there you go that's a good way to understand it it was it was it was in a potential form yeah and then when it received a name then that name became a causal relationship that is now people are people who weren't doing that before now start doing it because they can they see in that name and in that communion they notice a bee they see a being that wasn't there before there was just a scattered potentiality within gymnastics within military training within all these different fields and fit with under those fields somehow we're a little strange maybe that's why they kind of appeared as this odd thing and then they're rebound in a body with a name and now here you go it has a causal causal causal relationship yeah so now you know what emanation but the emanation emerges right it's both at the same time right right like it's but it's a reality like it's a pattern in reality parkour right no of course not it it it was it was all these implicit things happening in this one specific place and then somehow it got enough momentum from this bubbling potentiality that it catalyzed into something and then it then it received a name and once it had a name then it could spread right so that this is how god creates adam right so god takes the dust of the earth right and also he doesn't and he gathers it into one place if it becomes a body that's the that's the emanation part that's right that's the emergent part of immersion and then he blows the spirit into adam blows the breath into adam and then that's the logos that that would be the you could see it as a logo so you could see it just as the pattern right that's what spirit ultimately is the invisible part like it's the invisible part of that body the name is not visible and the identity is not visible the thing that binds it basically and so it blows that invisible part into atom and then adam exists and so it's so so what you're describing is the same like you you have you see all these possibilities that are there and then someone somehow starts to gather them they start to gather to accumulate and but they're still not something they're they're kind of and then all of a sudden something comes like you someone something names it from above and now that being has causal it can now reproduce itself and and gather it more into its body okay so that starts to feel like something interesting to me right because because because here's the problem with the way that science has described things or one of the problems that i see is that is that it's hard to represent how a thing that that comes from emergence or from reduced pieces becomes agentic or causal right so when we when we run through the scientific story eventually we run out of human agency or anything having agency we we and i think this is a like i think someone arguing that free will doesn't exist is a performative contradiction yeah because by arguing with me that free will doesn't exist you are you're assuming that i have the capacity to change and that your action can change me or that i can choose to believe or not believe it's people who don't believe that free will exist they don't maybe they don't realize that they're the most dangerous people in the world like they're so dangerous because if you go to the end of their argumentation it's a scary thing because you can make people change and the only agent is some kind of force whether it's con it's it's convincing or contriving that's what ends up being it's like you recognize the good and now i'm going to because people don't aren't free i'm going to make them follow the good it's going to be inevitable so okay so you sorry i take you on a tangent there yeah maybe we'll touch that i don't know i wanted to go back to this idea though that that that within within our understanding of reality we have to have something that allows us to grok how something that emerges then becomes a causal factor in itself right yeah that parkour emerges and then emanates right but in this in this sense emergence precedes emanation right it precedes it as possibility yeah and and then it but then it does not identity is what binds it together and so you're right like saying gregor nissa says basically he says this the physical comes first and the spiritual comes after let's say and so it's like it's almost like it's it's like desire comes first you could call it that a question it's a question comes first what is this yeah there's something which is appearing on my horizon a puzzle and i'm like what is this and then it gets an answer a name an identity and once it has an identity then it has causal causal factor and so like you can imagine it like that like you have you have a bunch of parkour people that aren't yet parkour guys who are noticing like you're noticing these a puzzle it's like what is this like there's something going on like there there's something calling like what is there's there's something calling from the ground right like asking to be asking for a master like asking to be to be contained and then once it is contained then it then like you said it then it starts to have causal factor so you can understand like that like a question and an answer you need both and the question obviously comes first or else why would you speak right like why would you speak and you can see it like even like in the way that christian theology developed it's always like that it's like that there was always a problem first like christian theology never developed as just straightforward giving giving like teaching like there's a problem and now there has to be an answer and that answer becomes becomes the the the road or the way but the problem always happens first like the question the puzzle let's say i'm going to back up a second because this just what you described it hit this so many times and this is i just really think the fir the first stanza of the dao de ching is so profound right the way that can be spoken is not the eternal way the nameless is the mother of all things the name gives rise to the ten thousand things i think a lot of people from the west they pay attention to the first two stanzas in that versus in that stanza and they forget the name yeah right which is the logos really yes yeah yeah i think i think it is right so you so you start with undifferentiated potential or you start with mystery right what we can describe what we can model is always an insufficient description of reality and then there's undifferentiated potential and that's everything comes out of that it has to come out of that and then in order for it to come out of it though it has to become named in order for parkour to not just be in order for our core to grow and spread and become a causal factor in the world it has to be named it has to become a defined characteristic of the know yeah so in so in the bible it's in christianity there's a sense that the undifferentiated gets separated into two so you have the waters below and the waters above right and so the waters below act like let's say the undifferentiated in the sense of chaos and potential yeah the waters above act as the undifferentiated in the sense of something which is beyond beyond causa beyond causality or transrational and then comes down into the name or into into causality and so so you can under so it's important to it's a little important to distinguish those two because they're not they don't function exactly the same but they they say ultimately infinitely they end up being the same but in terms of our experience they end up being different and so there's a there's a space of intuition from which the names come from and there's a space of potential or or chaos out of which let's say potential is is brought out of and so then the name comes down and then comes down from heaven and then manifests itself on the potential and then you have then you have a b but that that's already there like in the in the dow you have a sense you do have a sense in which they don't totally differentiate those two like at least in that first out that first setting where it's like there's undifferentiated and then but there has to be anyways i don't want to go to metaphysics too much let's continue on this would be too complicated but but just understand at least like in christian metaphysics you have a sense in which there's there's this separation and then the world kind of exists in this space which is created by the separating of two differentiations let's say like yeah chaos and like supra rational and then that comes down into the world so in in the mesopotamian myths you have tiamat and absolute right yep the waters above and the water is below right yeah this is water in the clear water and then and then in the in in genesis i believe my camera died i have to move to my other webcam [music] it says god separates the waters right that's like this one of the first few things he does yeah and then the idea is that the the joining of the waters becomes the place of life like the place of life and that goes all the way through scripture it goes all the way even into jesus talking to the samaritan woman and she's next to a well which is the lower waters and he says i will give you a fountain that springs into eternity so he's saying i'm going to give you the living water and you're going to be the the lower water and then that's how the the that's how the world exists like those two joining together like i find this kind of mythological frame to be very useful and and i feel like it it i hit the end of rational materialism i feel like right i don't perhaps that sounds egotistical but like when i listen to to sam harris i'm like i get everything you say it it's all it's all coherent within a certain system but it's like you have decided not to look at this thing that says that you have to step outside of that right and i think essentially like once you really think about godall's incompleteness theorem and heisenberg's uncertainty principle it's like you're you're stuck it's like that that doesn't work and and yeah i think hume's odd and his distinction is true right and we we need something else and so these stories and like when i listen to you and i listen to peterson i'm like that that there is insight there that i'm not getting from from reading evolutionary biology right or physics and and and i've you know i've crafted this idea within my own work of like what is the heroic archetype what are we what are we seeking so like through peterson i got really into the idea of the heroic archetype i was like what are we doing when we do parkour we go out and we confront chaotic potential and extract our own character out of it basically go do a jump that we've never done before that's potential right yeah and through confronting the fear and the challenge and everything that goes along with that there's something beautiful some gold some that we take away from that confrontation with gas so then i started asking like what is a hero right a hero is is someone who and it kind of like through some of peterson's ideas and other stuff i came up with this idea that like well first to here has to be able to recognize that there's a problem like the first thing you do the first problem that a parkour athlete has is actually being able to see where the problems are right yeah how do i go and find places to do jumps right so the first thing is is being able to see the problem and then the second is like articulation of it right how do i how do i recognize what's going to allow me to accomplish this and then the next you have to or not only it's like you have to be able to recognize a holy place like a place that is capable of rece because if i mean obviously if you're standing in front of a field it's like that place is not does not have the right potential for me to engage in what in what i want to accomplish so you need to find like a a sacred i people are going to be angry that i use that but relatively at a lower level something akin to a sacred space that when you see it you recognize it has the potentiality you need in order to embody something particular yeah i mean the the way that i react the way that i interact with the trees and the nature that i train in is a relationship of sacredness for me for sure it has this sense of of helping me transcend and connecting with me to something that's beyond right so i have no problem with that but and i don't think my audience will maybe the the some of the christians will but yeah that's hilarious it's like it's like here's the christians using that you're saying christians will react to this so it's so so so first is is vision right horus second is is articulation right say socrates or something like that then the next is is emotional wherewithal to be able to confront the problem right to have the equanimity to stand in front of our challenge and then the next is the physical strength to accomplish and the last is is the physical skills to to have those embodied capacities right and build all that it's like and then as i looked at that i was like this describes a human being who's achieved greatness who's achieved virtue but it says nothing about goodness and in fact you could apply all of these capacities to being evil the genghis khan is probably really good at all of these things right yeah exactly and so then i asked well what what is what what brings us into the good and and for vicky vicki's episode 16 of awakening from the meaning crisis agape is the answer it's the only answer that i've come up with that works i can't i can't get below that right the only way that i can define the good is is being in relationship to reality such that i am acting from love that wants to bring good into being right it's like that's that's the highest principle so then i've like almost got down to this set of axioms so basically like you're fundamentally you have to respect the mystery you have to accept that there's always going to be things outside of your own capacity to understand and then you have to be in service of love right and then you have to to do that through truth and the cultivation of virtue so that's that's what i've derived from this but here's my hesitation and here here's where i'm trying to imagine myself especially in the audience perspective the woman at the well she represents the lower jesus represents the higher here's a relationship of hierarchy between male and female right and for so you have an intuition let's say that chaos that chaos maps to the feminine but for many people that that intuition runs maybe the opposite way or that that that that creates a reaction of the higher waters also map on the famine okay there you go that well that's that's actually in a way not exactly but there's a way in which this is this is the these are the mysteries that we're not supposed to talk about but let's say that saying ephraim the syrian talks of the womb of god he talks about he talks of the divine womb out of which the the divine persons emerge which is the divine essence and there's a very mysterious thing going on there but anyways yeah so go ahead continue what you're going to say so if we take this intuitive approach and then some sort of pragmatism and some sort of of a multi-multi-factor we still run into the reality that people have different intuitions or different orientations symbolic systems that they operate within and there's not necessarily i one there's conflict there that's what it feels like right yeah and and one one reaction to that is sort of i think the verve key response which is let's step outside of the narratives and treat them as instrumental rather than existing within them right and then we can have the religion that is not a religion and then we don't have to deal with the fact that that that that that the islamic description the muslim description of of the of of christ is is not congruent with the christian description of christ right like he he he's respected there but but the meaning of what he did isn't possible to glean from the the description that they give and so so there there's inherently a potential for conflict and i don't know if that's the same in buddhism and taoism versus christianity i tend to think that they're more potentially congruent but but whatever there there are going to be places where that's not where the where the the two systems are going to be in conflict right and how do we how do we navigate those waters with without a clear epistemology sorry you broke down how do you said how do we navigate those waters without a clearer epistemology yeah so obviously okay so there are many things to say one is that we can only perceive the pure pattern from an embodied place and and to pretend that you can or to pretend that you are leaving that is to delude yourself this is what i think and so i think that the position or the universalist position of saying i'm going to step outside of these narratives in order to be able to see them all is is a delusion it's still a narrative it's just that you don't you don't see it it's the it's the narrative the tower of babel it's the narrative of you know and it and it doesn't and what it leads to is it actually will lead to to fragmentation it'll lead to a breakdown the desire to kind of lead to not having a common not having a real common narrative and so therefore it'll be like a competition that's where it's going to be even more so a competition of narratives because you have to embody something like you have to you have to be in the in a path like you have to be on on a road going somewhere and you say like i'm gonna stand above all these roads and i'm gonna say well actually i noticed that all these roads lead to the same place but you're not you're not doing it you're not on the you're not actually doing it so that's one thing like that's one thing in terms of the of of the of that of that problem is i think that the idea of saying that someone is going to not engage or kind of rise above is it's it's similar to brett weinstein when he says it's similar to sam harris or brett weinstein when they when they say something like don't you see like when when brett weinstein just says don't you see that this is obviously moral and you're like what you don't see your own story like you always are you're in a story to me it's just inevitable unless you're like in the mystical vision like once you like if you enter into a mystical vision and you enter into let's say kind of this this moment of pure transcendence where you're completely united with god and completely united with the infinite in every way then yes but then when you when you talk about it when you come back down you still you now have to give it flesh and body and story it has to retake body and flesh for it to exist so where where i get really caught in this in all these discussions is again is it comes back to scientific epistemology works and delivers truth in a certain way but it doesn't deliver all the truths that we need right but if we adopt any other system that collapses that then then it's really a problem right so so we have to we have to do that and what what where i get hung up is like i i've said that i think i'm a non-theistic christian and the the i think part is a really important qualifier and i can i can go a little deeper there but but when i listen to to a lot of christians describe their relationship to the resurrection what i hear them doing is trying to operate a a logical coherent system that looks something like science where they're making all of these exceptions to how they would treat a actual scientific question right and so so in terms of the resurrection of christ yes yeah yeah what i tend to think is that's it but that's also because like look i i don't deny the sad state of christianity like i really do not deny that i think that christianity has become you know which one of the reasons why it has led to where it is i think it's part of the bigger story i've talked about this many times before but none it's nonetheless happening like christianity is dying and it's and and in part of that is has been christians embracing of a really strange materialism and a kind of scientism as their worldview and so the idea of of understanding the resurrection is you have to understand the resurrection as okay as a something something like strong emergence you could say like something as something as a a phenomena which is which actually gives you the key to all phenomena and so it doesn't it does it can't completely act on the same level as the phenomena that it's that it's that it's giving the unity to and all miracles are like that miracles are not just weird are not just like weird exceptional things that happen that's never the case it's not just like something unexplainable happens and that's a miracle miracles are not that's not what they are miracles are always higher up on the level of pattern that is they're actually embodying the pattern of reality at a level beyond the normal usual levels of causality and so what it looks like is actually looks like it's it looks like it's it's like it's like it's pulling in the multiplicity into itself in a way that doesn't seem to make sense at the lower level just like qualities of of certain beings you if you try to look at just the the lower elements when you you're like well this doesn't make sense like why is water wet oxygen and hydrogen are neither of those you know and so how is it that i get to wet you can't find it there it's immersion right it's like a but it's a strong emergency because it but it's more than that it's not arbitrary because that looks arbitrary like the the miracles of christ and especially the resurrection is like once you realize that that let's say once you you see resurrection then you're like actually you know what that's how that's how reality works resurrection is something that i see every day i see resurrection all the time i get that symbolically right i do i mean like when you describe it it makes total sense to me but it doesn't it doesn't establish to me in any sense that that that i could that i could believe that christ died and was resurrected in the same way that i believe that my dog is scratching itself behind me or that or even that that that evolution happened right because i can verify aspects of evolution in a way that i can't verify that story and you're you're you're making an argument from a sort of it makes sense of things right it's like the cs lewis argument like it's a key to actually comprehending so therefore there's a truth to it but like you're not a biblical literalist right you don't believe that that the description of genesis is true in the sense that it falsifies the existence of dinosaurs i don't think that i don't think that the description in genesis is a scientific description okay if that's what you expect so but but i think it's transcription my goodness the best way to describe the world is is the death and resurrection of christ true as a scientific fact well you mean in a scientific fact in the sense that you could prove it scientifically how could you prove it scientifically it happened 2000 years ago exactly so so here here's my perspective on this i feel like a lot of christians feel like that has to be asserted with certainty within and then they they're they're within that materialist frame and i don't exactly know your relationship to this i haven't i don't i don't know but i believe the resurrection is real i believe that it happened i believe that the description that are in scripture are the best way to describe what happened so let me let me ask you if this would make sense because the way that i could imagine myself relating to this and i don't precisely relate to it this way is something like i need to have access to scientific epistemology and if i operate that system and i ask the question of christ's death and resurrection the answer i get is probably not right but i know that that system itself is incomplete and it cannot tell me for certain what's happening now there is a broader ontology that i exist within that i think within and in order to to make my ontology work the resurrection actually is key so so my question so let's let me ask you a question like have you ever experienced a miracle no okay so have you ever experienced a hiding experience where the world around you the causality around you which was not related to your experience all of a sudden merged with your experience i like like like like that doesn't that doesn't i don't know what would you call synchronicity if that ever happened to you where the inside and the outside like join together i mean i have had moments where it seemed like so i interviewed paul vander clay recently right and paul had been talking about superhero stories right and he published a superhero story the day that jordan peterson was satired as red skull by ac coats right the day that that came out it's like well that's a strange coincidence right and i've had those strange coincidences happen in my life now as someone who's trying to operate within rational materialism i just think coincidences happen right so when people talk about synchronicity that feels like they're operating some kind of epistemology that doesn't make any sense to me all right well i guess it's hard because if you haven't like i mean you've had little experiences like that but there are moments in your life like i think most people have these moments where the the outside world and the the inside world seems to come together where all of a sudden the world outside seems to be wanting you to see something oh yeah i mean i have those experiences why don't you believe them because what i understand about the way the human mind works from an evolutionary perspective makes me skeptical of our story making and pattern making behavior right we know that this can mislead us in important ways right and and when i see people and this is the other the flip side of that like the background that i've talked about when i see people who become who fall in love with this story that they have in their mind of how reality is laying itself out and making them giving them some sense of transcendence those people become very dangerous to me and very likely to be full of yeah well that's also because usually they're not embedded in like a bigger pattern like they they usually don't have some they don't they're not a part of a normal but what i'm trying to what i'm trying to try to get you to see is that there are moments where there's a causality of meaning which happens and that the the the multiplicity of the world in its mechanical causalities doesn't account for the causality of meaning doesn't account for the fact that you know all of a sudden like i have to deal with certain problem and all of a sudden everything around me is screaming at me like everything i see is screaming at me to deal with this problem like it all these weird accidents all these weird things as there's like this this moment where all of this kind of comes together and i can only see that as having it can only be reasonable if i understand that it's it's it's joined together as a body right it's it's joy all these multiple elements are joined together as a body and they're they're waiting to be they're waiting to find a name let's say and so that's that's actually it's kind of like that's how at least that's how so so i mean a good example like let me find another let me give you an example from what i gave you before it's like constantine founds the the city right and then all of a sudden it becomes a city but the mechanical causality like the guy the cart with the with the wheels and the guy driving the cart like that mechanical causality has nothing to do like he's his card is going to constantinople to become part of that city but the the the mechanic all the mechanical causation has nothing to do you can't find it in the mechanical causality the reason why he's going to constantinople the reason why it's going to constantinople is in the meaning i'm not sure that's true i mean i think so so that's a little part but like the thing is that sometimes that becomes bigger like it actually becomes bigger and it starts to it starts to grow into and to accumulate in ways that can only be described as miracles and so it's like if you've never experienced that i don't know like i've experienced it quite a bit and but but i don't know like and so so what i would tell you that the resurrection is like the the the is the keystone of that process is like the top version of that because it actually reveals how death can come together and become alive like how something dead things that don't have any coherence with each other can join into a body and that they can find life like that's what that's basically what resurrection is and so yeah anyways there's no way that i'm gonna i'm gonna like convince you in this discussion and we've already been going for two hours anyways i should probably go okay one thing i verbally says that i really like is people have mystical experiences say on psilocybin or whatever and they come back and they have the sense that they have the most profound meaning that they've had in their life and they have a lesson but those lessons can be completely incongruent with each other and the positive impact on somebody's life is is the same whether they come back and say god is definitely real or god is definitely not real so this this sense of the miraculous like i don't maybe it's just broken in me all right like like like so you know the cognitive anthropologists say that that the the origin of religious belief is overactive agency detection and that's an evolutionary feature and that's reasonable to me and and maybe i have less of that than other people i used to think listen to what they say it's hallel look at listen to the terms they use overactive agency detection like on what ground do they stand to to to tell us what the limit of agency is like do they even know what agency is like how are they even saying that i mean so seeing a face in a cloud is there an actual face in the cloud or does your from an evolutionary standpoint is there an actual face in front of you like if i look at your face is there a face there there's pixels on the screen right have you ever have you ever have you ever had the experience of not recognizing someone you know and then all of a sudden you recognize them they become the person like is that is that scientifically materially is that real like a face is not a is not a it's not a scientific concept a face is meaning and so the idea of seeing a face in the cloud why an evolutionary biologist would be bothered why would see that as less real than seeing the face in front of you to me is mind-boggling like why is it seeing a face in a cloud less real in terms of pure biological like understanding like because there is no reason for for for these like in terms of evolution pragmatically pragmatically me interpreting your face as a face allows me to interface and interact with you whereas if i try to do the same thing with the cloud usually that's considered craziness i mean you never see the face in the cloud well i've seen their face in the cloud but i don't talk to it and i don't hear it talking back to me but let's say that that would happen like let's say that that could happen sure that might have a causal it might have a causal function especially in a world that is totally coherent like in a world that's completely coherent that might have a causal function that you might struggle to understand like seeing a cosmic face or seeing a bigger face and that face informing you of some meaning that could i think that i think that biologically just in terms of evolutionary thinking i think that could happen and that it could it could it could be a way for a group to cohere it could be a way for it could do all kinds of things well yes and it could be real like it could be it could be really you're really seeing your face in the cloud i don't know about that part as real as seeing your face like like i'm saying a face doesn't exist in the material world well it doesn't face is a is a meaning is that is there is a it's a way right because because like my face or your face they're made up of muscles and bone and blood and nerves and they exist through an evolutionary process to give us the capacity to to see and smell and eat and now to express to each other like human faces are way more variable than say wolf faces and it's because we need the ability to to easily recognize each other through vision and the ability to then communicate effectively through faces right okay so i know i've got it i've got it i've got it listen to this listen to this okay so can an emoji have a causal effect yes is there a face there no there's a symbol there but we recognize it as a face and it has causal effect like you can actually change the way you act change the way you feel change the way you interact with with the with what you're seeing yes and so the same for a face in a cloud like you see a face in a cloud it can have a causal effect and it's a real causal effect yeah no but it's not a real face an emoji has a real causal effect but it's not a real face right so i just find that funny that you're saying that like as a as a materialist i find it funny that you would say that an emoji isn't a real face but this like sack of flesh in front of me that's a real face well the the emoji contains aspects of what a face is because it's a symbol it's a faces a face is a pattern that's what a face is and so the face is a pattern that has that has it embodies itself in the people around me so that i can recognize them but it's a pattern and so if i draw a face on a piece of paper i'm i'm also manifesting the pattern you're representing at least and i recognize it and it can have causal and it can have causal effect sure like if i yeah so to go back to just just to go back to our active agency detection the idea is that you hear a bear in the woods if it's possible that there's a bear in the woods whether it's there or not and that this is was important to our survival and that is this the way that that that that mind was built then inclines us to this capacity for for religious belief i used to have a sense that that aspect of me was just not as turned up as some other people right yeah i think that may just be hubris right another way to to to interpret my particular world view is just that i've trained myself very intensely to view the world from a specifically rational materialist frame for whatever reasons right as a reaction to all the crazy hippies around me but but but the thing is that when you talk about the the pattern sort of boom synchronicity all that stuff i don't have any way i don't have any way to to sort that from hearing the same thing from my hippie friend who just went on a deal yeah i understand but the emoji the emoji example i gave you is probably a really good one in the sense that that emoji has it's just a bunch of pixels or ink or something on a piece of paper but because it participates in a pattern it can have a causal effect on and so so it's actually doing that like it's doing it's a little miracle like a very little one yeah very very small one well this is then the ques well this is where we get into the question and we're gonna prob i'm gonna rep i'm gonna save the problem and then we'll just gonna let it go because we can't we can't go in but the problem is is the pattern just emergent from the human mind or is it something more and that i mean that that question to me doesn't mean anything like it well because it's like is it just what's the every time someone use the words just to me it's like i it's like a little it's like a little itch that i have it's like what does that mean just emerging from the the human mind is part of reality it's like it it's so there is no just emerging from the human mind it has to it has to be the human mind is there it ha it came about and so it's part of the world like so so it's not it can't be just there's no there's no there's no just so hopefully this works we'll see we'll see it'll be interesting ivan and alyosha karamazov right yeah they're not real human beings we're not real human beings they represent things that are real and powerful and important and they have causal of impact on the world but they were never flesh and blood human beings right they're not the same they're not the same level of they don't have the same level they don't have the the same level of existence as you do they have they have so so they are characters let's say that are that whose meaning is utterly collapsible to human psychology on one level maybe i mean the reason why we recognize them as having value is because they're embodying things they're embodying patterns in a way that that resonate with us right so it's not just it's not they're not just collapsible to human psychology is that they they're they're embodying patterns that we want to attend to yeah right and there's a reason why we attend to things attention is not arbitrary like it's not just it's not just reducible to human psychology it has to do with a whole level of things that make us exist in the world or not exist and there's you know there's a bunch of stuff involved so so so i have this you know i would say i'm a non-theist right in the sense that i don't think that the objective the question of the objective existence of god is answerable or particularly fruitful right but i would say that i feel fairly certain within a rational materialist frame that god is a psychological reality of human beings but within that same frame i can't claim that it's a object outside of me like i believe that if i walk by a tree today and i leave and walk somewhere else and i'm it's no longer in my field of attention or or awareness the tree doesn't disappear right it's not simply a psychological aspect of my existence it is obviously a lot of what it is to me is psychological and symbolic but the tree's still there and that's that's materialism right yeah yeah but god is not there like god is not outside of your frame god is not god is not a thing yeah that god is not a thing and this is like this is a totally orthodox like i always tell people if you think god is a thing then i'm i'm i feel better telling you that god doesn't exist like if that's what you're thinking if you think existence limits itself to things that can be identified and quantified and and all that then i would say god doesn't exist because even in that very traditional christian theology god is as the source of all being god is beyond name beyond characteristics beyond that's what god is god is the source of characteristic and being and and and all names and all essences you know come from that infinite non being and non-being joined together like same action says god is being a non-being do you think do you believe or do you believe that god has self-awareness in a sense that we would recognize i how can i say this like the best way to understand that would be to say that i believe that god has what you would call something like infinite awareness and our awareness is actually a participation in that infinite awareness like our intelligence comes from god and so so so it's like because we can't that's how that's actually the best way to to me to explain consciousness like because it's very difficult to explain consciousness like consciousness emanates from an infinite consciousness and that we are we are sparks let's say that our personhood is a spark of the divine so i don't think google has a consciousness right or self-awareness google does not does not think about being google but there's no there's no inside of the google experience it's an intelligence and it is causal and it is an agent that that that we interact with but it's not self-aware but you also can't verify that in any no i can't i cannot verify that i don't know that that's true i can't verify that in you like i can't verify exactly right i could be a philosophical zombie rape i need to go man i'm sorry no this is this is i think we should we should like i loved i really enjoyed it i enjoy our conversation but should probably we should probably set up another one because i think because i think we we there are more places to go but i actually i need there are the things i need to do i also need to go i'm glad that you you enjoyed it i felt like this was really fruitful i it stayed pretty close to what i

because i do feel like you if you do feel like you're making like a real genuine like effort to to to to understand what i was talking about and i and i feel like you're i feel like you get it at least most of it let's say yeah and so so that that's that brings me joy i guess awesome i'm glad that we could provide some joy and hopefully a better bridge because it didn't feel like it was getting built and and i think i i'm genuinely really impressed by the power of your insights and i want people to be able to absorb them and not get tripped upon the the language yeah yeah yeah so i
