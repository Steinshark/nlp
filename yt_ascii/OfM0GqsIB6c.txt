i've been having a very strange problem i've been collecting every single samsung flagship since 2010. i was just about to make a video about all of them together until i noticed that my galaxy note 8 from 2017 had blown up the battery had expanded so much that it's actually cracked the glass on the back and it literally split the phone in two so i was just like oh for goodness sake what are the chances delayed the video and then ordered another one brand new not quite realizing how huge this issue was about to become because no joke by the time that you wanted arrived i realized that two more of my samsung phones had done the exact same thing a galaxy s6 from 2015 and a galaxy s10 from 2019. i'm not exactly sure if these are just blown in the last couple of weeks or if they'd actually blown before that and i just hadn't noticed but the point is three of my samsung phones had just disintegrated i need to find out why and it wasn't immediately obvious the phones in question had been powered down they hadn't been used heavily at all literally just for a few weeks in the year of their release and then a couple of times afterwards when i compared them to subsequent devices and more importantly it hadn't happened to any other brand this smartphone shelf that i use has given me the very unique opportunity to be able to store every single phone in the exact same environment with the exact same space constraints the same clipping mechanism the same temperature and so i double triple check the other phones and every iphone was working every asus phone was working every google phone was working the only conclusion that i could come to was that the uk had recently just had a heat wave at the time perhaps the room temperature got a little too high and the samsung phones just happened to be a little more susceptible to changes in temperature i put out a tweet to summarize my findings and i thought that would be the end of it but it was actually about to get a whole lot worse i mean for starters samsung responded immediately they sent me an email basically saying hey we saw your tweet we would like to collect the phones from you to which i was basically like nah i'm good i'll figure it out myself mostly because i didn't want to get involved in some really long drawn out process with lots of back and forth and also i thought i might want to investigate these phones myself i should probably keep them but then she pressed further kind of saying we take inquiries like these extremely seriously we are going to collect those all right fine come and tape them then but i was also curious will he be sending these back afterwards will you be replacing them what's the protocol here which was basically ignored she just said the devices have reached samsung labs we will let you know when we have an update so i asked again only to get we will update you on your devices as soon as we have news okay sure maybe i'm pushing too much i'll leave you to it i thought samsung takes this stuff extremely seriously so even though i was a little miffed that all the phones are broken in the first place and that they've then taken them off me with no promise of a repair or replacement at least they're gonna have an update in like three days they're gonna tell me exactly what happened why it's not really a problem and that i was the one who'd been doing something wrong i was kind of hoping that that's what would happen this conversation occurred on august 1st it's been over 50 days since the devices were collected and i haven't a single follower and so this whole time it's just been sitting in the back of my mind should i make a video about it or is the entire thing my fault the ideally dormant for a long time until a week ago when i was casually browsing twitter and came across this this is matt host of the this is channel with austin evans saying that within their collection of phones they have noticed the exact same thing but even worse he's gone as far as to say that every three plus year old samsung device we've had in storage has had their batteries expand like this and i mean every single phone i followed up with him about it afterwards and in no uncertain terms he said every model that we've had pre-galaxy s20 all the way back to the galaxy s4 and even including phones that were stored in their original box and again all of our other brand phones are stored in the same place and none of them expanded this is when the ball dropped this is where it gets serious i literally legged it back upstairs to check the rest of my phones should i see my face when i found out that as well as the three casualties we'd already had that my galaxy s8 had blown up my galaxy s10e had blown up my one of a kind galaxy s10 5g which samsung had engraved mr who's the boss onto that too had blown up which i was devastated by this phone was genuinely special to me i wanted to show it to my future kids but then the most shocking of all was when i realized that it also applies to samsung's foldables my galaxy z42 which has had a total use of about 3 weeks and is only two years old and its entirety is very clearly just about to do the exact same thing so i rushed to my computer to jump on a call with marquez from mkbhd what's been your finding we always find like one or maybe two phones where the battery is falling up and we have to get rid of it and every single time it's been a samsung phone it's never been any other brand of phone and i didn't really think too hard about but it is weird that it has only ever been a samsung phone there is zero doubt in my mind at this point that something is happening with samsung phones multiple people with multiple separate large collections of smartphones stored in multiple different conditions from different parts of the world all experiencing the same thing and then it dawned on me samsung has a verified history of battery stability issues the company's galaxy note 7 was infamous for multiple explosion reports it was banned on airlines and in public places and the film was fully recalled and so even though it does look like they did fix some things in future phones the later devices have definitely had fewer reports it's equally not out of the realms a possibility that some of those same dangerous elements that cause the note 7 fiasco are actually still present it was becoming pretty clear to me what was happening i just needed to find out why so i jumped on a call with zach from jerry rig everything who disassembles phones for a living and is funnily enough also noticed his samsung phones expanding and what he's saying is that it's the electrolyte the liquid that ions move within inside the battery that allows it to function and to be stable that's decomposing and releasing a gaseous substance if that electrolyte is gone i think thermal runaway and damage to the battery is way more likely to happen if it ever is charged up again or try to be used again now zach being a braver man than i ever will be went as far as to try and puncture some of his own swollen samsung batteries and they seem like they have lots of protection mechanisms designed to stop them exploding what do you think would happen if you then charge them up see that one i would be very nervous about the electrolyte is what facilitates the energy transfer between the positive and negative internals of the battery and if that is d decomposing and has evaporated inside the battery there's not an easy way to facilitate that energy transfer and i imagine it would just get really hot really fast something is reacting with the electrolyte that makes it want to change states into gas do you think this has anything to do with what we saw with the note 7. i think they would probably be different situations but either way since it's samsung in both instances something's wrong with their quality control now also around the time of this call i'd incredibly noticed yet another swelling phone this time the galaxy s20 fe but this one was different it's really hard to tell i only noticed this one on the kind of like my fourth time scanning through my samsung phone where i had to double take like wait a second is it isn't it but it is like for sure that feels like the hidden danger here is like you're not actually realizing your batteries is gone and you're continuing to use your phone and then right at the end zach finished off with one more nugget on batteries and you'll find this really interesting he explained that there's a label you can find on them that tells you for how many years they should have no mutations or hazardous chemicals leaking so of course i galaxy s20 fe to check for myself sure enough when i got inside it was pretty clear that this was yet another victim but an especially alarming one given how this phone was only released two years ago it only got delivered to me about' months ago and it's been stored at room temperature this whole time even the battery on the back says that it should be good to go for five years this should not be taken lightly the ifixit.com article about swollen batteries literally has this text written in bold capital letters a swollen lithium-ion battery may catch fire or explode proceed with extreme caution and also at your own risk when removing a swollen battery from an electronic device let's be very clear about something if your phone actually explodes this is no exaggeration you can die this is real it's happened and it's a pretty tragic way to go it's risky enough that i can't even just throw these in a bin now i've literally had to buy myself fireproof sleeves so that i can dispose of them in a way that i'm not at risk of setting my own house on fire and as for why it's taken this long for someone to realize well i mean clearly many separate people are aware that this is an issue you but if you just had the odd phone that breaks down every now and again maybe you just assume that it was moisture in the air or the way that you'd specifically store the phone it's only when you have a shelf like this where you can keep tabs on every single brand in exactly the same environment that you can actually identify a systemic issue with one brand in particular but at the same time as i'm becoming more and more sure that this is a legitimate issue with samsung phones i'm also becoming more aware of the implication that that would have to think samsung sold almost 300 million phones just last year there are probably a billion current samsung phone users at any given point and based on my small sample size up to 25 percent of them could well blow at some point so i thought let me do one final check so i sent out one big round of messages to a whole series of tech journalists and tech youtubers and there was a slightly more mixed finding there were about 40 who said well yeah but i've had it with other brands too but then there were also 60 who are more like yes i've definitely noticed the exact same trend with samsung's in particular for the only ones that i can remember are samsungs so this is a bit of an evolving situation and i want to wait to hear if any brands decide to weigh in any content creators or your experiences in the comments before i say something conclusive but so far there's a few key takeaways one the batteries expanding like this can be an issue on any phone but at the same time between my own sample size and the sample size are taken from other people it seems like at the very least the problem is worse on samsungs but then two is that i don't think you need to panic yet this problem can be very serious but it's much more likely to occur when you leave your phone for long periods of time and you can also somewhat mitigate it by storing it at closer to 50 as opposed to letting it drain entirely and storing it while the battery's flat shout out to all the creators involved to marquez and especially to zach who actually risked himself for the cause and also diy perks who built the shelf that allowed me to see the issue in the first place
