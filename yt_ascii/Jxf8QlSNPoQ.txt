hello everyone and welcome! in this video we are talking about my s2000 and some dyno numbers. now first a big thank you to autottempest.com for sponsoring this video. nathan, a fellow yellow mellow s2000 owner he's got a 2006 ap2 honda s2000 super cool. so thanks to him for sponsoring this video i'll include that website in the video description. and we're filming in my garage because i have the honda civic type r in for the week as a press car and i thought it looked cool side by side with the s2000 perhaps a bit better than just staring at me with a whiteboard behind me so we're filming in the garage. now the topic at hand is how much horsepower does my car make it's a stock ap1 s2000 2002 with 106,000 miles on it the only performance upgrade so to speak is a rear differential no performance upgrades to the engine so bone-stock i just wanted to know how much horsepower does it make so i took it to a dyno. now i thought the question was that simple. it's definitely not that simple i have not worked with dynos before. this is my first time putting a car on one and it was a learning experience for sure. okay, so we ended up doing a total of four runs. and i'll put the numbers on the screen so you can see what they are but basically it runs one through three you can see horsepower remained relatively consistent. the lowest at'1.1, the highest at'3.6 it's only about you know 1.4 percent degree of difference there and not a big deal. torque however ranged quite a bit for the first three runs from 125 to 144 almost pound-feet. and then the fourth run 221.8 horsepower 144.4 lb-ft of torque that wasn't magical tuning that's literally just some calibration changes with the equipment so why was there so much variance in the torque number between runs one through three and really this comes down to the mustang dyno that we were using to measure power and so on this dyno there are dynos where you can just plug in with an obd 2 read the engine rpm in this dyno we're using roll speed to calculate engine rpm so you're looking at the speed of the actual rolling dyno and then looking at the engine speed and trying to make those two match for the calibration so in this case for the first run it thought that this revved much lower than it does it's a 9000 rpm engine, but you know it, maybe had us peaking at around 6500 7000 rpm something like that so it thinks the engine isn't revving as high as it is and so because torque and rpm are inversely proportional if it thinks the rpm is lower, but it's still getting the same amount of power then torque is higher versus if it knows the engine rpm is much higher the torque number is going to be lower with the same amount of power the car is doing the exact same amount of work which is why you don't see the horsepower number changing the car is doing the same amount of work just where it thinks that engine rpm differs so by the third run where it's mostly dialed in it was probably off by about 100 rpm or so for the third run, but not a major deal as far as how much of a difference it's going to make for these numbers so peak horsepower'4 peak torque 125 pound-feet now the fourth run. this is the case where it differs from dyno to dyno so this was running on a mustang dyno which is an electric dyno a lot of people out there will run there's on dyno jets which are inertia based dynamometer and basically the difference is is that the dynojet, doesn't account for quite as many variables this mustang dyno will account for for example the weight of the car aerodynamic drag things like that and build that into a brake on that drum versus the dyno jet just purely uses inertia to spin up a drum to measure the horsepower the difference is the dyno jet will read higher versus the mustang dyno pretty much across the board and so what mustang told this shop throttle works, which i was very grateful they let me in check out their shop and had me out on their dyno so big thanks to throttle works mustang told them that if they want to compare directly to dyno jet numbers basically to put in this parasitic multiplier of 2.2 rather than 1.0. so this is a simple little parameter that you plug in into the dynamometer until it hey the per citic multiplier which is basically saying? this is how much horsepower the dyno is using up just to run the multiplier goes up to a 2.2 and that will make you comparable so you have comparable readings to a dyno jet dynamometer if you've been using another and then came to this and wanted to know you know where are you at, so obviously those numbers are a huge difference 222 horsepower versus'4 horsepower i would assume that you know realistically. it's probably much closer to the'3.6 because you know it's it's an old car. it's 15 years old. it's gonna have some losses with time, and then also you know just 222 horsepower would mean only an' horsepower loss from the engine very low less than 10% to the wheels i just don't believe that would be all that possible with a car. especially given its age so is it'4 horsepower, or is it 222 horsepower? well, honestly it's probably neither it's probably somewhere in the middle or perhaps towards that lower end either way the thing that you need to learn from this is is that first run of just getting the baseline in isn't all that important it tells you a number yes, but it's not a number that's worth going out and showing your buddies and say hey, this is how much power i make instead it's a number that you use to see if modifications that you make to the car actually make improvements so now i can go in to that same shop with the same conditions and say, okay i've changed this on the car and ideally you would do the changes on the same day and measure it before and after but you know realistically, that's not always going to happen, so good enough to at least just go back to the exact same dyno so you put the car on there again you put in the same calibration settings, and you see did we actually make an improvement by putting this on and so i'm going to be doing two different tests i'm going to be putting on a titanium catback which i'm super excited about and also a supercharger which i am also very excited about! yes it is eventually going to happen hopefully it doesn't start snowing too soon here so i can actually get some things done with the car before the weather gets really crappy. it's getting cold though so you know i'm gonna have to play with weather, and we'll see how it goes so the question when is a dyno not useful and really this is about ego. so if you're going to a dyno, and you're deciding you know what i want to find out how much horsepower my car makes that's probably the wrong reason to go to a dyno because you could go to ten different dynos and you're gonna get a different number every single time if you want to see how much you're going to improve, then great you do the modification you run it before and after you see exactly how much power you've gained from doing it now when you are testing your vehicle for modifications before and after doing dyno runs what you want to look at is the entire curve itself rather than just the peak number is the curve itself is your entire torque curve lifting up or is it only lifting up in certain sections of things like that one of the things that's cool to look at on the graph of my s2000 is that 6000 rpm when the vtec kicks in...yo! you actually get an increase of about 15 lb.ft of torque, so it's pretty neat to see that in the dyno plot and it's actually a relatively flat torque curve you know going from about 4,000 to 6,000 then it bumps up another about 10 to 15 lb.ft and then stays a bit flat until you start getting well over 8,000 rpm and then it starts to taper down again so cool to look at and see you know the actual benefits of something like vtec you know simple technology, it's just a higher cam profile, but neat to see in the dyno plot it's not a number that you can go your buddies and be like "hey dude my car makes way more horsepower than yours" it's like well if you put them both on the same dyno on the same day with the same settings than perhaps yeah, you make more horsepower than your buddy, but if you did them at different shops it's like basically meaningless so use it as a tool for learning if your modifications have helped you for tuning for things like that don't use it as a bragging rights tool because honestly that tuner can just go in there they can you know type some stuff into the keyboard with the settings of that dyno and this car can say that it has 800 horsepower when clearly it doesn't have 800 horsepower, so my goal certainly wasn't to say that dynos are useless they are very useful but for specific scenarios and probably not the one that a lot of people use them for which is like bragging rights of this is how much horsepower my car makes so the next steps for me are putting a cat back on this measuring the horsepower again see if there's any difference and then slapping on a supercharger and seeing how much horsepower we can gain with that supercharger kit and again a huge thank you to autotempest.com for sponsoring this video if you haven't yet checked it out it's a pretty cool website that compiles a bunch of different listings local listings for cars so you can find so of course we'll just do a quick search basically everywhere for honda s2000s my goodness this 2004 22,000 that's almost double what i paid for mine which is a 2002. but not many miles on it 45,000 let's see there's a yellow one. there's another, hey! we've got a yellow one in boise pretty cool 2001 and selling for',000 now the reason i think you should go 2002 or later. it's because they start to put the glass the glass window in the back rather than this clear plastic that's kind of crappy and fades and you can't see through so 2002 and later are the years to buy great car cool website thank you all for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below!
