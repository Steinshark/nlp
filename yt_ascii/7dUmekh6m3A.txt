you might have heard of an application called i am ridge originally developed by a guy called armin heinrich for $999 it was kind of a stroke of genius because essentially it did nothing well and being a little harsh here it did have this cool little inspirational quote with a slight spelling mistake and amazingly eight people downloaded it so you know on one hand it's no angry birds but on the other hand that's $8,000 and so it's probably no surprise that apple took the app down after this even though technically he wasn't breaking any rules anyways i am rich sparked a bit of a trend with all sorts of developers trying to make a quick buck from selling people an app just based on the premise of it being expensive and that led me to a guy named abu moo who might have just made the most expensive app ever now probably for this very reason apple's app store has a price limit of $1,000 and google play limits you to a mere 400 but this clearly didn't dishearten abou because he decided to split his application into six sections each priced at a very reasonable four hundred dollars or three hundred pounds in the uk and we're gonna download them the one saving grace here and there really is only one saving grace is the fact that google has the option to get a refund within two hours for most apps if something goes wrong here if for some reason these applications aren't eligible this is gonna be probably the most expensive video i've ever made so what are they well if we go to abu musa play page you can see all six applications neatly lined up here essentially gemstones virtual gemstones so from what i can see each application is a separate widget that looks like a certain gemstone and according to him the goal is to collect them all one line actually says maybe you want to impress your poor friends show them widget that they do not own and never will and another one says why buy flowers when you can buy virtual jewelry an excellent solution i genuinely can't tell if this is joking or not but i think / hope that they're gonna do something once you've placed them on your home screen maybe there's even a special feature once you actually do collect them all ok let's start with sapphire this is probably out of all of them the least hideous looking so one tap to buy 300 pounds do i want to look payment successful okay so we're installing the application now and it's done it's only a few kilobytes thankfully there is the option for refund there i just hope it stays so let's go to a new page there it is okay sapphire widget okay so we've dropped it on the home page that is hideous i don't think it's even quite 1080p so it doesn't you can tell it's not as sharp as the icons around it that is awful and it doesn't even do anything when you click on it quite disappointed to be honest so i think the only thing left to do is to start a new page and fill it with all the different gemstones and i'm hoping that something's gonna happen but honestly i've got no idea i don't think anyone's done this before we got to say i don't feel very successful right now i just kind of feel like a bit of an idiot alright so all six are now downloaded so if you top that all out that's 300 pound times 6 or $400 times 6 which is 1 point 8 k pounds or 2.4 k dollars so yeah that refund couldn't come sooner so let's go on to the home page and start adding these in and fist okay there we go black diamond they don't even align properly i don't like the look of emerald we've not done ruby where's the last stone copying conned that is it humbly that's probably the most expensive home screen setup you've ever seen and quite possibly also the worst looking on yeah this is see weirdly if we go onto the page this thing actually has five star reviews from oh a google user that's that's reassuring if you enjoyed this video i've got a ton more app content so i'm gonna leave that linked to this video and also if you could subscribe that would mean a lot to me maybe would help me here recuperate this 2 point 4 k i've just dropped anyways thanks for watching and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
