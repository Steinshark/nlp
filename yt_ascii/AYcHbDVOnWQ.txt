and can you tell me how this feels good i feel like we need to get one of these for the office like it's legitimately really cool hey guys this is austin this is a toyota highlander and recently i got the opportunity to see something i've always wanted to check out how a car is actually built so our friends at toyota sponsored our trip out to their team mi plan in indiana to see exactly how it all comes together one of my favorite parts is the exoskeleton so as you can see not only is it incredibly stylish but the cool part about it is it gives you a lot of extra lips so say if you are working on like wiring harnesses or painting you kind of have your arms lifted above your head for a significant chunk of the day it actually gives you a lot of lift in fact i've got about six pounds of lift right now which doesn't sound like a lot but it's actually a fair bit and especially with ken with the ten pound you can imagine if you were kind of like working with say dude that makes a real difference like even just a few extra pounds like especially if you're doing this all day long your arms you can get really tired so either this just helps like 20 30 % with like a little bit less fatigue at the end of the day it's totally worth it - right through the plant it's hard not to be struck by just how big everything is between the massive robots the odd may little carts that are moving parts around - just the sheer size of the factory its kind of overwhelming we start a tour by entering the paint shop and this place is really hardcore even just a little bit of dirt or dust could totally ruin a car so i donned my super stylish suit walks through the decontamination room and got to enter what actually a lot of people don't even get to see now even though it's just called the paint shop there's a lot more than that going on so when my favorite parts is right here so you'll see their series of four robots applying sealant to the underside of these vehicles now that's super cool cuz obviously robots are incredibly precise you can see they literally i mean spin wide probably less than a minute per vehicle applying all the sealant however if you go one station down you'll see that people are a huge part of this process so now later they spar checking everything to make sure it looks fine but they're also brushing it to make sure it's an even coat there's nothing that's missed i think it's a really cool example of just how much the sort of blend of people and technology really does make all this possible for sir tasks robots absolutely make sense but a lot of other tasks the people are going to do a much better job of course be much more thorough about like you know thinking about things or just going [music] spiritual robots to the scale the operation really makes sense when you consider this is a factory which is constantly churning out vehicles everything they can do they have done to optimize efficiency so whether that means the cars are flying overhead they're being welded on one side and glued and bonded and painted i mean there's just stuff going on all the time it makes sense because in a matter of just a few hours you have a bunch of raw materials come in one side of the factory and a fully completed vehicle come out the other side and this happens non-stop needs ridiculously cool to watch so every vehicle goes through an inspection to make sure of course things like the lights work and the horn and all that kind of stuff then they also go through a water chamber to make sure that there are no leaks they go on the dyno to make sure the powertrain and everything is working correctly but then a few vehicles go into further review aka and fun stuff so the first thing we saw was a massive room which can simulate basically hurricane level experiences so it can absolutely pour water on a vehicle and this is to make sure that not only it continues to work but things like the windows and the seals are all working correctly and they don't pull every vehicle through here but they do grab a handful of vehicles every day to make sure that nothing is sort of underperforming as they expect the same thing goes for the track so they have a series of different road surfaces that are rough that are trying to test for not only any suspension issues but there's any like weird squeaks or rattles or anything going on and then last but not least now that they take it over a giant hill to make sure that everything is working but they give it a full speed pass on their private road which i may or may not have got to ride along with the entire experience wrapped up with a sneak peek at the 2020 highlander which should be going on sale roughly about the time that you're watching this video now the interesting part of this is that not only were these some of the very first vehicles that come off the assembly line but you have to consider that when there's a new vehicle the entire plan has to kind of start from scratch sure obviously some things can be reused but generally speaking you've got a new exterior you've got a new interior you've got tons and tons and tons of new parts you know they have to work on the development of these and to kind of to design them to work in the vehicle but also the factory has to figure out how are we going to put them together and what order should we do this they have to work out all the kinks and they still have to continue making the old one at the same time it is an incredible logistical challenge but something that i was super excited to check out that is just a little look at what goes into building a vehicle i'm gonna give a huge shout to toyota for giving us the amazing factory tour and the next time you see a highlander or well pretty much any toyota on the road think for just a second about how much work goes into these vehicles it really is incredible next time i know i'm gonna even appreciate it i'm gonna go look that was a lot of work cars just don't grow on trees you know the built-in factories buy lots and lots and lots and lots of people
