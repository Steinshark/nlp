hello everyone and welcome this video we're going to be talking about wet sump versus dry sump oil systems and a huge thank you to pennzoil for sponsoring this video now if you haven't yet checked out my video on how engine oil systems work you may want to check that out before watching this because it dives into much more detail about how the oil actually circulates around the engine and it could help with understanding these two different systems that said let's dive right into what are the differences between a wet sump which we have here on the left versus a dry sump which we have here on the right now the biggest difference really is that the dry sump is going to add a few components in so here on the left you can see the wet sump system you've got your oil pan right here you've got your pickup tube right here which is going to be pulling in oil to the pump it's the pumps going to send that oil through a filter and then circulate it through the engine where it will then fall back down into your oil pan now on a dry sump system what you'll have is a much shorter much shallower oil pan right there you'll have a pickup feed right there down at the bottom you could have multiple of these and dry sump systems that's going to go to that first pump just like in our original one the difference is now it's going to send that oil into a reservoir so you've got this tall cylindrical reservoir right here which that oil accumulates in and then you've got a secondary pump which then picks up from that secondary reservoir sends that then through the filter and then circulates through the engine so why would you add in this reservoir right here well one of the reasons you do this is because you can use a shallower oil pan as you can see right here so because this reservoir is located externally somewhere else you don't have to have that deep shallow that deep oil pan in order to accumulate all that oil and use however much oil you have in your engine so that's one benefit this allows you to place the engine lower and then you're going to have a lower cg as a result of lowering that engine it also gives you a fully flexible capacity for how much oil you want to have in the engine so here you're restricted by the size of your oil pan if you want a really large oil pan you can do that but then you're going to get closer to the ground and you're going to make sacrifices where here externally you can locate it wherever you want and choose exactly how much oil you want now if you use a large reservoir this is deal for racing applications because you have more capacity oil and that means it's going to take longer for that oil to be saturated with heat which means you're going to have better cooling so ideal for trek scenarios from a cooling perspective to have a larger oil capacity it also allows you to reclip relocate the oil reservoir for weight balance so if you need you know a specific amount of weight located somewhere on the vehicle you can do that by placing your oil reservoir there gives you some flexibility and also probably one of the biggest benefits of a dry sump system is that the system won't run dry while you're cornering so you can imagine here if you're taking this car around a really heavy corner that oil could slosh up to the side here and then your pickup tube could have some air and then you're going to have air go circulate through your engine now if you sustain that corner for long enough that means your engine's going to be burning up because it's not going to have any oil lubricating it versus in this oil this dry sump system you're gonna have that oil come down but you've got this oil reservoir that's ultimately feeding that engine with oil so in a high g turn you may have all the oil sloshing up here but you've still got all this oil in your reservoir and you can have different pickup feeds located throughout the engine if you'd like to have further protection but essentially what's going to happen is it's going to slosh up you're going to be able to use this reservoir for a good while when that corner comes back down then you're loading that oil back into the reservoir and so you can sustain long high g corners with this without worrying about your engine losing lubrication there's also a horsepower small horsepower benefit of using a dry sump system where you're not going to have this oil sloshing on the crankshaft and so that's going to be taking away power as that crankshaft flushes through the oil if it indeed does do that so here we have a few examples of some different vehicles which use either dry or wet sump what sump is by far the most common most vehicles have this and then more truck friendly vehicles i end up using dry sump ferrari 488 gtb bmw m6 is some examples with dry some examples with wet dodge charger srt hellcat and mini cooper s now what all these companies have to do with pennzoil well these either use pennzoil for their genuine engine oil or they are factory filled or they recommend using it so all ferraris come from the factory with pennzoil platinum for bmw and mini cooper pennzoil supplies their genuine oil for their vehicles and for the bmw actually they also recommend all the em vehicles recommend using a shell v-power nitro+ and for the dodge charger srt all srt vehicles are factory filled with pennzoil platinum so just kind of a fun fact there up some different vehicles which systems they use and they all actually use pennzoil platinum so thank you guys for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to
