hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be talking about two-step rev limiters what they are and how they work now a two-step rev limiter very simply is just having two different stages of having a rev limiter so you're gonna have one at a lower rpm and one at a higher rpm the lower one is typically going to be used for launch control so when the car is stationary and then you're going to have a second final rev limiter which is going to be at your red line or just slightly past your red line and that's going to try and prevent you know excessive vibration valve float from occurring anything that could damage your engine if it were to exceed redline and so you've got two different set rpms at which you're going to have these rev limiters and so that's what two-step is so you know lots of modern cars come with launch control these are all a form of a two-step rev limiter any modern car out there and it's becoming increasingly common which is a cool feature to have and so you know why do you need this at a lower rpm well for launch control when you are launching to get the optimal launch you don't need all of that power you don't need to be all the way at 7000 rpm or whatever your red line may be you're going to get away with lower rpm as far as not having those wheels just sit there and spin and so you know you want a little bit of slip but not too much and so that's generally going to occur at a lower rpm especially if it's a two-wheel drive vehicle and so you'll set that first rev limiter something like 3000 maybe 2000 if it's rear-wheel drive something like that depending on the engine all kinds of different characteristics but you're going to have that earlier rpm and that's purely going to be used for launch control and then once you're moving your only rev limiter is going to be that second one which will prevent your engine from getting damaged so how do these rev limiters work well there's really two major methods that you can use in order to create a rev limiter you can adjust the fuel or you can adjust the ignition and so speaking of adjusting the fuel this is more commonly used in oem solutions so cars that you buy from the dealer wherever they're going to be using these because it's a safer thing to do and also because it's better for emissions so when you have a fuel adjustment there's two different ways this could work you could run a lean air fuel mixture so once you start to get to redline there and you want to stop the engine from increasing you can lean out the air fuel ratio and that's going to be less fuel which means you're going to make less power so it's going to prevent it it's going to start to slow it down from increasing in rpm then you can finally just shut off fuel completely and by shutting off fuel completely obviously it's not going to increase in rpm and you know you're going to sit there and you can adjust that so you inject fuel just to keep it enough to keep it at that set rpm so it'll be on off on off on off and you're going to be keeping it there at that set rpm now like i said the reason why this will be common for as an oem solution is because you're not going to be injecting fuel into the exhaust when you're not when you don't have the engine running so this is going to differ with ignition control so this is kind of an aftermarket solution which you may commonly see there are two different methods which you can use for ignition control you can cut ignition completely so you're killing your spark no spark of course in a gasoline engine you're not going to have any combustion occurring but you're going to be sending that fuel out your exhaust so as that fuel goes out the exhaust the exhaust is hot it mixes with oxygen once it leaves the exhaust crackles pops you know makes a little bang and that's why two step can be associated with seeing you know fire coming out the back of an exhaust that as well as the retarding method where it retards timing so another method to reduce the engine from increasing in rpm so while you have your piston coming up there's an ideal time that you want that spark to ignite so that you get the maximum amount of work useful work pushing that cylinder back down pushing that piston back down so when the piston is on its way down if you the timing and ignite that spark later then you're not going to get all of that useful work and so the engine is not going to be able to continue to rev higher so you can the timing and in doing that your engine will just float there at that set rpm now this is where two-step rev limiters start to get confused with anti-lag systems two-step rev limiters by design are not anti-lag systems but they operate in a very similar fashion and they can have that as a result of the way that they operate so you know there's two different ways we're going to look at this but basically when you're returning the timing that means when your piston has reached bottom dead center you're still going to have a high amount of pressure and a high amount of temperature that's all that wasted work because you didn't optimize when you ignited that spark and so when you open your exhaust you're going to have this high pressure and high temperature gas that's going to move out and if you do have a turbocharged vehicle then that high pressure and high pressure high temperature high pressure gas is going to spool up that turbo and keep it spooled up and can act as an anti-lag system while you're sitting there you know keeping your engine at that rev limiter before you launch now if you heavily the timing meaning you know you're waiting really late to ignite that air fuel mixture so that you can keep the engine running but you don't want it to increase in whatever rpm you've set that rev limiter at well then when you open your exhaust you may still have combustion occurring so that air fuel mixture is still burning while it's going out and then it's going to be spooling up that turbo and then of course you know it can be spinning flames out the exhaust things like that so this is how you know two-step rav limiters got associated with anti-lag systems and spitting flames out the exhaust because if they do heavily the timing you can be sending combustion you can still have combustion occurring in your exhaust manifold and in your turbocharger so clearly you know you want to have a system that's built properly for it because you are going to be putting a huge strain on your exhaust system here which you typically wouldn't be doing by doing something like the fuel adjustment wouldn't be quite as harsh or if you were to not return the timing too much so that you didn't have combustion occurring in the you know exhaust manifold and beyond so thank you guys for watching and if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below you
