another crypto company just declared bankruptcy this time it's celsius which if you're thinking sounds like deja vu i'm sorry you're not in a denzel washington movie this is unfortunately the actual cursed timeline where for some reason the summer trend isn't socks and crocs it's billion dollar crypto companies going bust in the worst financial recession of the decade now some of you guys might remember just days ago i reported on voyager declaring chapter 11 bankruptcy and today the story is that celsius said i'll have what he's having but with a twist instead of a chapter 11 bankruptcy which sounds bad celsi has filed for chapter 11 protection and financial restructuring which just means that they're bankrupt it means the same thing it's kind of like when i was in high school working fast food i told people i'm not a fry cook i'm a thermal food engineer but it didn't change the fact that i was serving fries you know now that i think about it me in high school and celsius the billion dollar company have more uncommon than i thought we both are broke and don't want to admit it boom roasted and the point that i'm trying to make is that celsius is doing the same thing that voyager did in fact they're doing it down to the t they actually hired the exact same lawyer that voyager did according to their filings that's right susberg is back and honestly he's kind of becoming my mortal enemy at this point it's like his bat signal is whenever people lose money and his superpower is arguing that they never owned it in the first place i mean this is honestly what these companies are doing what these lawyers are arguing that the customers never owned the crypto that they bought in the first place they were just lending it out for some reason and i would love to talk you through chapter 11 bankruptcy and why celsius does not qualify because they clearly sold securities according to state regulators but that's not really the point of this video as i said we've done that before and i don't want to do it again instead i want to focus on the uniqueness of this case and the unique ways that celsius has screwed over investors so with that in mind let's talk about hoddle you might have heard this term before actually crypto bros say it a lot and it means hold on for dear life it's a way of encouraging people not to sell their crypto at a loss and it turns out celsius loved this and they leaned into it they had something called huddle mode in their app basically it was a way for investors to put a child lock on their accounts basically freeze it for at least 24 hours and celsius pushed this a lot to customers not just early on but after they suspended withdrawals too that's right after they froze people's assets they asked people to freeze their own assets according to reports they were pushing engage aging huddle mode as a sign of support for celsius during these dark times now to be clear this is a bit like asking a guy you just put in jail to voluntarily handcuff themselves to the bed right afterwards i mean nobody's getting out anyways but celsius's argument was hey we can unfreeze withdrawals if you guys just all freeze your accounts voluntarily i mean this really was their logic we can't go bankrupt if you guys never withdraw your money and maybe this is just a testament to how desperate their community was that a lot of people even bought into this although some sought for what it was but the ironic thing is despite pushing huddle mode all the time you know someone who didn't actually practice what they preached alex machinski the ceo of celsius that's right guys and a move that no one saw coming the c-suite turned out to be hypocrites it turns out that according to a report by arkham intelligence which yes is a batman reference but is no less a made-up name than coffeezilla so i'm not gonna make fun of it at least it's not susberg or something but anyway arkham intelligence released a report about alex machinski and they showed that he had a pattern of pumping and dumping celsius tokens while telling people publicly that he was huddling them in fact alex tweeted about this in october of 2021 lots to celebrate here in london busy week with lots of deals and events it pays to huddle now it turns out that same day alex sold 69 000 worth of crypto whoops two months later more of the same quote all celsius network founders have made purchases of cell and are not sellers of the token now mysteriously this non-seller of the token alex this hodler managed to sell 16 million dollars worth of celsius all while telling his fans that he wasn't selling but maybe even worse than alex profiting from what may have been a profitable company was the revelation that celsius may never have been profitable at all turns out according to insider leaks they were actually really bad at making any money at all which gives more credence to the ponzi scheme claim that we've been hearing a lot and i know sometimes you guys accuse me of being the one to say ponzi scheme this ponzi scheme that and crypto which you know recently i have been saying a little bit because there's been a lot of ponzi schemes but this time it's not me saying it okay this is the head of defy staking at celsius that just accused celsius of being a ponzi scheme he just got revealed his name is jason stone and the reason he revealed his identity is because he just sued celsius like i said in his court filings he calls them directly a ponzi scheme and guys this is the head of defy snaking there's no one bigger than this guy who could like give a more insider take than the head of defy staking he's the guy saying hey they're not actually making the money now look i'm not going to say jason stone is some altruistic guy here in the lawsuit he's clearly looking to be paid not to mention it does appear that he got some like nfts from celsius in the form of like a paycheck so his judgment must be questioned on that account alone but his story does kind of makes sense which is basically the argument that celsius was not profitable which is something we've heard time and time again and it's the argument that even when they knew they weren't profitable they continued to market high rates of return as a way of getting more investments into their system to pay out the first investors and then they told these new investors to lock up their money in the celsius system with this huddle mode all the while the founder sold off for millions so for all of those reasons i'm out and the lesson of the story today is that well sometimes it doesn't pay to hoddle
