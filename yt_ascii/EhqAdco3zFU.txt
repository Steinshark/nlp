all right well maybe the best way to start would be since i'm sure many people watching this won't know you are if not most of them just kind of introduce yourself to give everyone an idea of who you are and what you do so my name is jonathan pedro and i am mostly an artist i'm an icon carver which means that i make images based in the tradition of the church on for churches for individuals following really kind of the canons we would call it the the standards of iconography and you know respecting the way that saints or that christ or that stories have been represented in the past and trying to see in that a wisdom that's been passed down and so and so one of the things that i'm doing as an icon carver is i also study traditional symbolism and try to see you know try to understand it try to see what it means for us today and also try to apply it to the to the world today so that we can we can understand these stories as being as giving us patterns which explain reality and explain our interactions with the world rather than just these arbitrary kind of strange fanciful stories that are from the past right and that's it's it's really kind of great that with you know looking at pre-modern literature particularly but especially things you know involving saints and these other kind of mythological characters to kind of be able to approach it from that kind of symbolic and artistic standpoint so that it doesn't you know just gloss over and say oh that's really weird i understand what's going on but actually try to work out you know what's happening and like what's you know because literally these stories have meaning beyond just you know you know people believe you know really weird things the most important thing to understand is that there are innumerable ways of this of describing reality we somehow still have this idea that a kind of matter of fact very let's say kind of forensic way of describing reality let's say the way that you would describe reality to a police officer officer if there is a crime we have this idea that this is the standard of how to describe reality but that is absolutely not the case most of the time you never you don't describe reality as if you're describing a crime to a police officer we use all kinds of imagery all kinds of shortcuts all kinds of compressions in order to compress large amounts of time into very short short stories and so this is something which the ancients understood very well and so the idea that you would have strange stories that somehow sometimes have strange elements to them we it's better not to understand them just as literary tropes or literary metaphors but rather methods of compression and methods of telling stories which encompass things that are difficult to describe in forensic terms and contain more information it's like if i describe a let's say describe a boxing match and i say that guy whooped this guy's ass like that's way more descriptive than if i spend an hour describing every punch and at what centimeter from what muscle and what damage it did to how many blood vessels like one of them is more forensic but the other is more real because it connects to all the emotional all the meaning and all the the deeper aspects of why you would watch a boxing match in the first place right yeah and you get that interesting thing where i think often modern people find things like saints lives really hard to kind of process especially and not popular at all like usually it's like oh that's you know these weird religious stories would ever want to read those it's like these were the super popular literature of the day in the middle ages and beyond and there's and they straddle that line and so far as you you'll have some which do seem to kind of they fit with our modern understanding of that kind of historical reports like there would be some that have no particularly fantastic elements in them and they're you seem to be fairly sober and then you get other ones where you know the saints being swallowed by a dre that's right and especially the earlier it's like the further you go in the past and also the more the story tends to go down into the popular sphere the more it will have fantastical elements in it because those fantastical elements actually point to some deeper patterns in us that that tend to manifest in in ways that even though they look idiosyncratic are actually the best way to represent certain realities right i mean it's the the the story of the hero and the dragon right is so kind of universal or even just even broader than that just the hero and the monster or you know whatever it happens to be is is just in every form of storytelling in some fashion so it's not like it's yeah some kind of arbitrary creation yeah and even the fantastical virgins that we have now like there's a reason why things like lord of the rings or harry potter or fantastical novels are so popular not just because they're flights of fancy but because the the storytelling tropes that they use connect to some very very deep you know patterns that we have inside us and that kind of frame our reality right i think one of the things that i think is useful about looking at literature like like st slice these you know just kind of pre-modern ones is that it it kind of removes hopefully a little bit of that gap between oh yeah there's these things we watch for entertainment like lord of the rings and harry potter that we like and they're you know we like fantasy right and then there's real life and which is you know not like that at all yeah which is boring and not colorful at all it's just like that's that's such a such a modern understanding like a pre-modern culture just would not understand what you're talking about if you put it in those terms exactly yeah and the story of saying margaret is obviously a shining example of a story that has some very wild elements in it and that it's it's important to kind of look at to and to help us understand you know what it says about her and what it says about why it was so popular like why people cared about the story right and i think one of the things that is interesting is to kind of understand how in in pre-christian culture you had what you might expect as that kind of heroic stories that were popular i mean obviously homer and virgil right you have the story of you know gods and demigods and these you know very martial masculine heroes and then you have this interesting flip that happens with christian culture where it's not that those things don't still exist and they exist in christianized forms but that you also have explicitly kind of christian stories which could not have existed before that period of people who die incredibly you know shameful in the eyes of the world right deaths of slaves that also may very well have been slaves themselves and that but they're raised up and this has a kind of laudable or admirable you know example of right action so i know basically as a hero and it's very much often framed in terms of overcoming right some kind of foe even though that overcoming results and usually be killed it's just it's such a it's such an interesting kind of reversal in a way it's kind it's partially reversal but it's partially participating in that same pattern of overcoming the foe it's just the method of the overcoming has shifted is different and so in the story of saint margaret there are a lot of things in her story would really point to the things you're talking about within the story itself you know in the the version at least that i read i don't know if this is in every version say margaret is actually born of pagan parents who expose her to die and so this was a practice which was in rome in greece you know in different pagan cultures which is that especially if a girl was born because a girl was seen as trouble then the girl would be left out to die like you know when the father would see that it's a girl and he would just leave her out to die or if it was someone who was slightly deformed or just in in a in a wrong time or there was you know it just wasn't the time for a child then there was no moral they didn't see a moral problem in killing the child or exposing the child for it to die and so in the story what you have is margaret is saved by a christian person who raises her up in the faith to become you know a person who's very strong in the christian faith and is willing to stand up and to speak out against the evils of the pagan world so already interestingly enough you find you find a a contradiction in the simplistic way people first of all view christianity and the way that they view you know ancient civilization in general where one of the aspects that christianity brought to the world was a value like a giving value to the feminine and giving value to the lower aspects of reality the slaves the you know it gave a way for people who were marginalized in society before to now to have a way to to have a kind of power a kind of power which is a spiritual power and so in her very story you actually see what christianity did to the pagan empire which is to to take that which was thrown out by the pagan empire take also women who were viewed as simply property in the pagan empire and bring it into christianity where although people for some reason don't can't see that this was what happened that they they became fully human and they were also for example like you couldn't in the pagan world you could marry a woman by just taking her whereas in the christian world consent became the rule for christianity is that a woman had to give consent in order to be married and so the story of saint margaret has her being raised by christian and being very beautiful and very attractive and so she attracts the interest of a a kind of pagan king or some kind of pagan authority and the pagan authority wants to have her and the deal is he wants to have her and he wants her to submit to his god and and so those two things seem to function together which is he wants her to submit to his authority and to the authority of his world the authority which he represents which is this ancient pagan world so saint margaret refuses and for that she is tortured she's imprisoned all these things happen to her and and so he's torturing her in order to convince her to let go of her pride to give in to him to to finally you know just just give up this futile fight that she's that she's putting up and to marry him and so this is where the story gets very particular because when margaret is put in prison then she encounters this dragon and the dragon comes to eat her and so in the virgin that i read the virgin that that that mar gave me she doesn't get eaten by the dragon but the more ancient version she does she gets eaten by the dragon and then in the dragon she pierces out of the dragon with a cross that she has with her and so that kind of uses this cross to kind of break out of the dragon and to be freed from the dragon and this is kind of it's like it's connected with her fight to resist the temptation of giving in to this guy right giving in to this guy and giving in to his god giving into his authority structure and then ultimately then because she after she she freeze frees herself from the dragon then the man comes back and then the torture continues until she is finally killed and there's a strange element too like this is harder to understand like i struggle to understand it there's a the element of this this character this christian soldier which works for the king yeah it's a very strange element it'd be worth thinking about more because there is a there is a christian who works for the king and he's the one who's actually told to kill margaret and and and at first he doesn't want to do it and then she says you should you have to do this this is this is just how it's going to be and so finally he kills her and then he sue kills himself he likes suicide and their people die in in that moment and so that's like a really intense intense i think i can kind of see what it's trying to bring about in terms of storytelling maybe we can get into it after but first we need to talk about the the dragon that's the most that's the most interesting thing and so the dragon in usually the dragon is a manifestation of chaos you would say or a manifestation of these lower aspects which kind of rise up you know and and try to devour the world and so usually the way it's represented of course saint george is the ultimate version of this we're not just saying george but also the image of saint michael killing the dragon or saint george killing the dragon is usually the idea that through through light through word through meaning then the dragon is pierced and is and is fixed right so imagine like a slithering chaos of of things that you don't understand that don't make sense it could be your desires it can be it could be a foreign a foreign army that's on the border that's going to attack you there's all these different versions of what that dragon is manifesting which is just this kind of chaos which is pressing in and is going to it's going to going to devour you from underneath you know imagine you have all these bills that you haven't paid or all these problems all these things that come up from below and then through a through will through truth through light all these things from above then the demon the chaos is pressed back down and you know order is re-established and so that's usually the way that it manifests itself but a kind of more interesting oh not this story on saint margaret shows us another aspect of the dragon which is the dragon is really mostly the notion of extremes you would say of extreme something so here's the opposite it's like the dragon is something like a tyrannical hierarchy like a corrupt tyrannical hierarchy and so instead of it coming from below let's say it ends up actually devouring her and it becoming like a prison so you can imagine that for for for someone who is a marginal person who is on the edge or or doesn't have power then this this order becomes like a prison that's what and that's what she's in she's in a prison she has this king who wants her to give in to his authority to give into his god right to give into the thing which manages his world and she refuses so the dragon the prison this call from the authority is all the same image right right the the dragon is just one version of the prison in which he is and the idea of course is that through her through her dedication to christ just something higher to something more true then she's freed from that prison she ends up being freed from the from the prison and so that's exactly what's going on so you can see it at all these different levels and you can see it as a personal level too because for example the dragon of of saint george is often represented to people as the passions right so this all these desires that contradict each other that rise up you know you can have all these these contradictory desires in you that are ripping you apart that are devouring you imagine the drug addict or a sex addict or anything that that you could be kind of addicted to and and so usually that's what it that that's that's the thing that it represents but here it's kind of like the the opposite of of those desires it's more this corrupt oppression that comes from above that is holding her in and that is imprisoning her that she has to free herself from and so it's it's fascinating to see how the dragon is almost used in an opposite way but inside her it's also the desire to give in like her own personal desire to give in to this man who is pressuring her and is saying you could just if you just gave in to my authority to this corrupt false authority then all your problems would go away right and so she has this temptation which is different because it's not like she's attracted to him right it's not like like like a like the image rather of a seductress who would come towards someone and then the you know the man has to resist his temptation her temptation is just the temptation to give in and to give in to the authority in order to stop the suffering that she's going through so it's a different temptation but it's a temptation nonetheless right and there's this interesting aspect too in that we have this victory in so far as she overcomes the dragon neither by bursting out of it with the cross or like in the 12th century middle english prose version where she just kind of makes a sign of the cross and he disintegrates into dust but she's still in the prison and she's not i mean she only gets that when she's led out to execution and dies but that's that's the thing is that it ultimately ends up being a form of self-sacrifice which is what saves her and of course in in the christian vision the this is also the idea in general the idea of self-sacrifice ends up being the way you solve a lot of the problems right in the in the sense in this sense as well which is that the the the capacity to accept to suffer you know and so to not give in to something you know which is false and to not give in to something which you know which is a lie you know and this is this is something which you see happen in the image of gandhi or of of different characters who or even like nelson mandela for example who accepted to suffer you know so to not give in to a corrupt authority and not you know mandela's maybe not the best example but but rather like the the the person who just who doesn't submit but then doesn't necessarily fight back but just becomes a an image of someone who is strong and is holding in holding on and doesn't want to submit and then that has a transformational aspect for them but then also for the world as well ultimately it's the whole image of peaceful protest like that's what peaceful protest believes is that you you can transform reality through not giving in but not also rebelling at the same time right and there's an interesting i think idea of the kind of i don't know passive hero if you want to put it that way if like someone like say thomas more which is narrative narratorized in a man for all seasons by robert bolt it was turned into a movie in the 60s of this idea of all he does in that story is keep silent and then they imprison them and they kill him like that's the story and he's held up even you know even in kind of contemporary secular 20th century west as this kind of figure to as a heroic figure even though he really did the whole point is in fact that he doesn't do anything in that he's just refusing to sign a document and staying in prison but he's still there's a kind of there's an activeness to that facility though yeah and it's also you could call it something like the secret of inaction like the secret of the pillar right the secret of the axis of a wheel the and it's something about the cross which is also showing this mystery of the cross which is this idea that at the center of something is the sacrifice like at the center of things this is something that ancient people understood very much right it's something that people understood that's why they sacrificed animals that's why they sacrifice people because they understood that at the center of a world is sacrifice and this is something that for example in a in just a basic way it sounds all weird when you say it that way but if i say something like in order for your family to strive as a parent you understand that the that the core of that is self-sacrifice like if you sacrifice yourself for your children then you're then your family will will thrive and you will thrive right through that self-sacrifice but rather if you don't if you act in just based on your own will and your own passions and your own desires then then you won't be surprised that after your second divorce and your kids moving from one house to the other that your kids are going to start to not like you and are going to are going to go in all kinds of weird directions and i mean it's like don't be surprised because you didn't self-sacrifice in order for your the cohesion of your group or you're the people that are with you to stay together right and there seems to be kind of separation i think it seems like in pre-modern societies whether that's kind of hunter gatherer societies or even agricultural societies because those kinds of cultures the sacrifice is really present you know you need to sacrifice in order to you know work the land you know you need to sacrifice obviously in terms of hunting to a degree and so there's there's a kind of experience where you're living it you're kind of living that pattern of sacrifice whereas if you're living in a modern industrial society where you can just kind of you know go to the store and get your pre-made food and kind of you know you you become detached in this idea that like something had to be sacrificed at some point along the way in order for that to actually function yeah exactly but for us at least it's easier to see it psychologically because maybe that's the that's the crux of our existence because our our physical needs are so you know you know are so taken care of that it's easier to see than the need for psychological for self-sacrifice in in a psychological manner or in a personal manner and understand that you know that's the same for any relationship like you can't if you go into a relationship just trying to get what you can get from it it's not gonna be a fruitful relationship you also there is a there is this kind of mutual self-sacrifice which needs to happen for any relationship to be fruitful so i think that that's what that's what you're seeing in in in the idea of the martyr is that the martyr becomes a mythical image of what christianity is at a lower level and so it's sometimes it's hard to understand why these people would admire these martyrs because you know like what is going on like what is this why is it so impressive to them it's because it's like an extreme version of something which they experience at a lower more common level and so that's why it was like their shining examples were these people who who were willing to suffer torture and all these insane things in order to stay true to something higher were willing to sacrifice themselves for a higher ideal and they would experience it at a lower level right it would be just like okay so you know instead of when i get my money instead of buying you know some beer i'm gonna buy food for my kids right and so it's like that's the that's the level of still sacrifice that most people would have had to deal with right i think this is a really important point because i feel like already on the level of dealing with murder stories right the modern reader can really easily just be like i'd never do like who would ever do that like who would suffer these horrible tortures just to not say like these words like what why would you even do that and if you go the next step up and and go to visualizing it and being swallowed or almost swallowed by a dragon then it's just like well all connections reality has been lost it seems and it's like what is this i can't interpret this at all but when you put it in those terms you realize like oh one yes like maybe you're not martyring yourself i mean martyr means witness right in that case it's a kind of you know in the christian context it's witnessing for the faith but there but it is even this kind of pattern like you said of of you know you you're with maybe like a witness for your family or something like that right and then you did the dragon in this case as a kind of tyrannical authority but that dragons are usually symbolic of you know all manner of kind of you know like you said chaos and passions and these kind of lower things and when you put it in those terms and the story like this doesn't just become detached from something that's you know more historical seemingly but it's actually it's doing the same thing it's just yeah like you mentioned doing it in terms which we're not familiar with usually yeah well in terms of authority there are some interesting examples that that that can help you to understand what this could mean like i'll give you an example i forget the name of the saint horribly it's a russian saint in the orthodox church where this it was a an aristocrat who in her city the the priest was known to to have affairs with women and had prostitutes and whatever in his home and she and she knew about it right and so this yeah so you have a problem which is you have this authority which is corrupt and so on the one hand it's like you don't you don't want to rebel against the authority to kind of destabilize society but at the other hand the recognition of this corrupt authority and so you'd also don't want to give in to the corruption that this authority represents so the story has her going into the room with the priest and the woman while they're actually doing it and and taking the woman out of the bed throwing her out of the room then turning to the priest getting down on her ease and saying father i need to confess my sins and so there are other versions of that like you know we talk about saint francis of assisi there are images of him doing similar things where someone says what about this priest who's living with a woman openly and he says he goes down and he says i'm not even worthy to kiss this man's feet and so he's like shoveling ash he's shoveling like you know burning coals on this head where all of a sudden it's like if he doesn't change his ways he's going to hate himself and burn inside for the rest of his life you know so is these images of of how to deal with corrupt authority that can then show this how self-sacrifice can actually transform reality right it's interesting because in the story she's actually she has less been vective against all these guys she's used you know saying you know that you know you're all gonna you know go to hell because like yeah your gods are false and what happened but she at no point is trying to like i don't know incite a rebellion and we see that coming back to that weird thing with the her christian executioner at the end of she says basically they do your duty and kill me and even he i mean there's again there's a weird suicide at the end but the whole point is that it wouldn't have fit with the pattern of the story for either her to lead a rebellion certainly not but even for him to have kind of yeah and and i think that the reason if maybe this is why i think that she was killed by this christian soldier is because the whole story is about not giving in to the the corrupt authority and so about a way to resist the corrupt authority and so obviously the the the the image of the sword obviously has does have some sexual connotation you can't avoid those connotations when you read kind of chivalrous stories and this and the idea even that there there is this relationship and so in being killed by the christian soldier it's as if even in her death she never gives in to the to the corrupt pagan authority even though she has to die it you know the story leads to a point where she actually never submits to this this pagan authority who's trying to dominate her in a in a corrupt way right i think that's probably why they have the christian the christian killing her right and her telling him to do it so she accepts it it's not yeah and she accepts that this is her fate and this is how the story has to has to go you know right well it's it's interesting because see so in a lot of ways she seems to be a really good example of the feminine hero right the the way that that kind of character approaches the battle with the dragon in a way that someone like saint george or you know in a more secular context beowulf or what have you is not going to do but at the same time there are these kind of interesting markers of of a still that's still active sense like there's a part where she takes it's not so she's visited by multiple demons the first one that looks like the dragon then another one shows up and she throws him to the ground and puts her foot on his on his neck and like dins in there which is so that's you know kind of violent and active but i but i think even that is participating ultimately it's still a kind of symbolism of the feminine even though it's a little bit more no you're right and there is but it's not just that there is a sense in which sometimes these these stories when it's like when when it's relating to the also to the kind of foreign king let's say there is there is a place for a a interesting active element of the feminine you know which is like the idea of rejecting the foreign suitor or rejecting the the foreign authority so like that image of her pressing down her neck on the demon is in the bible there's a version of that which is the story of jail and so jail is this prophetess and this foreign king who's trying to invade israel comes to her comes to her tent and she receives them in her tent and then she acts like a kind of a mother lover to him she she gives him a blanket and she like gives him milk to drink and so she has him she puts her in this like comfortable situation and when the king is asleep she nails his head down on the ground with a spike you've seen this story before yes that's well i had actually forgotten about it because i was thinking about judith and the holy furnace where it's kind of similar she seems like she's gonna you know yeah and then she cuts his head off i had forgotten that it has this almost the same pattern in that one too with this but with the snakes to the temple that's right yeah and so there is something about the idea of the rejecting the foreign suitor in the sense of the the the one that isn't your husband or that isn't isn't your authority or isn't your husband or whatever that all of a sudden there's this activation that happens and it's like you know anything goes and there's even like a reversal where she's acting in a like she's penetrating the the character she's penetrating the the foreign king in a very violent and disturbing way but i guess getting to come back what you say before is like before you have the societal shift in terms of you know the the relationship between masculine feminine being based in kind of consent of in a lot of pre-christian cultures the woman had to fight off the suitor right otherwise he's his wife so there's that kind of like you said this activation of you know if if he comes to take you by force you have to violently fight him off that's kind of the way that you express your you know your proper nature i guess yeah and it's possibly like one of the reasons why they have it because it would have probably it the one of the reasons why it's the dragon that she that she ends up physically fighting off is also to to solve the problem of like you know the problem of the the let's say the christian martyr facing his or her you know persecutor how it isn't proper for them to turn around and and and be violent towards the the persecutor so there's all of that kind of going on in the story which definitely makes it a very fascinating a very fascinating story right well it's funny because like you said yeah she can't she can fight against the dragon she can fight against the demons but she can't physically fight against the actual physical foes and yet you know centuries later you have you know probably the most famous uh you know female saint for a lot of people in the kind of the secular world joan of arc hearing voices from various female saints one of which is say margaret but there you have a very different kind of manifestation where you have i mean she's dressing as a man she's leading armies she's physically fighting against the english yeah but but then when it comes to her own version of her own martyrdom then she seems to kind of take a closer to you know kind of say margaret role where she's not yeah because she she's doing it also the idea of of joan of arc is that she's also doing it completely in submission to her king like everything she's doing is in order to save the king and this is also the the power of joan of arc is that she saves the king despite how he basically you know ends up selling or selling her away to to the english and and the reason one of the reasons why she dies in the hands of the english is because the french king never bothered to to lift a hand to save her and so there's a tragedy in that in that story but definitely like there's there is there's like i said there's room for these feminine exceptions that you see in the in the story it's like the story of joan of arc is definitely one of them where kind of she she joins these extremes together in a way that she's also a virgin it's important that she's a virgin in the story it's like she's this virgin warrior you know she's almost she's almost an amazon like in terms of the symbolism like she really is close to an amazon but it's like a holy amazon something like that right well it's interesting because usually if you're looking at you know things that are trying to find the kind of pre-modern manifestation of the the heroic feminine usually the amazons is where you turn but if you read you know if you look at how they actually appear in the greek sources they're really something heroic about them they're monsters they're monsters the amazons are monsters yeah that's right so you can see john of arc as a saving of that monstrosity like a feeling of the just like christianity always ends up including all the strange elements of paganism back into itself but transforming it in a way that is that makes it also different at the same time right so what you can kind of conceive of then if we're trying to think of okay what is the feminine hero or what is the kind of feminine manifestation of the heroic would it really kind of be something that while it's participating in some of the same patterns as the masculine version in so far as it it's some kind of overcoming and it couldn't involve a physical aspect that there's still an interiority maybe to it that's kind of more emphasized i think it just i think there are different versions of the feminine hero and i think that the virgin that we get in saint margaret is the let's say the people resisting a corrupt authority right and so that which and and so you could see it in all kinds of guises you know and the you know the woman resisting a corrupt authority without without herself let's say betraying herself or becoming the monster that she's resisting you know and so that's always the problem of resisting authority and you see it in any revolution which is the revolutionary becomes the monster they were trying to fight against so how how does the christianity deal with that problem and stories like the story of saint margaret help us to see a christian answer to that problem and so that's one version of the of the female of the feminine hero the other version of the feminine hero is of course the secret influence like the secret influence is one of the most powerful versions of the christian hero of the the feminine hero in christianity which is the one who moves things outside of the story in a secret manner and so if you look at how every single nation converted to christianity every early christian nation there's always a woman behind that conversion and you know whether it's the constantine's mother whether it's vladimir kiev's mother whether it's you know the the the wife of different of the northern kings in in western europe it's there's always a woman who converts first and then you don't hear about the discussions you don't hear about them but then her son her husband you know augustine the cappadocians in basel and saint gregory it was their sister and so it's just like it's a universal christian story of this this kind of secret hero that that is actually turning the world without you know in a in a in a kind of silent way by creating i can always say it's like by creating a space by opening up a space for then then her male counterpart to act in something like that right it's interesting because even in the germanic tradition you have this sense of often queens or princesses being con they'd use the term peace weavers it is that they weave peace so because behind the scenes you know whether it's through council through marriages or what have you that that they're actually bringing kind of boring sides together but you you don't they don't talk about it in a kind of explicit way yeah but it's also it's important because it's an important aspect of reality and it's an aspect of reality which because we are so we have value the masculine so much that we can't see it right we have destroyed the private sphere we've made everything public everything is like this you know that there is we we're reducing the private to the the minimum and so that was also in tradition that was also the the space of transformation that happened in the in in a feminine let's say in the feminine guys you could say you know that the type of transformation that happens the forming of the world that happens in the womb with something which manifests itself also at different levels of reality this kind of secret change that happens and so by overvaluing the masculine now we think that that's the only thing that matters like we think that that's the only thing that counts that in order for for example a woman to have value then she needs to act like a man she needs to to to to to do all these masculine things and the other aspect this powerful aspect of reality is discounted as being stupid and and irrelevant and it's not it's super important without it the world doesn't work right yeah well that's and that's kind of why i really wanted to kind of look at say margaret because i thought well you could look at st jennifer and that's also a really interesting as we've already touched on but it could be easy to just look at examples of the feminine hero that are very close to the masculine as opposed to looking at one that isn't following that i mean it is a little bit again we have the overcoming of the monster but but again like from if you're looking at it from a material historical point of view it's like well she resisted the advances of this guy and then was executed yeah it's not it's not like you know going out and leading an army and overcoming the villain and you know it's not like that at all and because i do think it does seem that we don't it seems like society doesn't consider that heroic in the same way or like of the same value as the masculine traits of going out in the world and kind of doing something actively as opposed to kind of privately resisting something and even to the point of of death in the end yeah because most of the time in terms of dealing with corrupt authority it's that's a problem most of us will have way more than conquering some other like something it's like where all of us in terms of in terms of the people we have a feminine role and you know compared to our authorities compared to the police compared to to you know to to the hierarchy that that's above us like most of the people you'll meet in your life all have a kind of relatively feminine role to play in the social sphere so we need to understand how transformation can happen in different ways besides conquest and all these kind of more let's say the images of these more masculine actions so it's useful to understand this or else or else you know then we will just be bitter and we won't be able to function in reality right well is is interesting at this at this time period you know kind of moving from the you know the eleven hundreds into the twelve hundreds kind of the late middle ages of how there starts to be a little bit of a reframing about how these kinds of traditional stories often originally oral stories are received in terms of their kind of utility for the you know whether that's the polis or the other kind of the community at large in so far as like there's a time when these kinds of stories are massively popular in england and particularly say margaret i mean amongst the laity so clearly they realize this has like they're not just reading it for entertainment although you know maybe that's an aspect but they clearly can feel like they can get something out of it but then as the more kind of intellectual elite type you know literate society starts in feeling like these kinds of stories don't actually reflect reality right because there's not dragons in reality and they don't burst into you know dust and you make this onto the cross with them they start taking them out to the point where in this this already in this 1100 story is like well the demon looks looks like a dragon but it's not really a dragon and he doesn't swallow her he just wants to swallow her and then she makes the sound of the cross and it goes away and then eventually they just start telling stop telling her story all together and to the point where she's you know kind of forgotten forgotten yeah but i think that it's a this move towards it's kind of like the beginning of the pendulum swing you could say of modernity already in the 12th century you see it starting you know how this this kind of this kind of move from hyper rationalism to irrationality that navy finds its highest its highest easiest way easiest version to see in something like classicism and romanticism you know in the in the modern age these two these two extremes which start to manifest themselves because the problem is that this is why these stories are so important because they actually are a space of participation in which the more irrational fantastical elements of our psyche are integrated with the story in which you can participate in right because saint margaret was seen as a person that existed that you could look up to that you could follow whereas now we have these weird extremes which is like i said the on the one hand the kind of critical historical forensic version of of factuality and then harry potter and so then we have harry potter and this and and we have these two things that completely have nothing in relationship with each other and the same person that loves harry potter will make fun of a story like say margaret you know and so it's like in the ancient world these there were spaces in which these two extremes of of of participation were joined together in these more legendary stories you could say right i think it's a really important point because even though you can read a story like say margaret as literature and you could read it like you would read it you know harry potter novel at least in theory there's a difference in terms of what it was meant for and what it was used for for the certainly for the whole period of its popularity throughout the middle ages is that you're it's not just a story that you read for entertainment not only because you can get something out of it of kind of greater value than simply being entertained but also like you said this is considered to be a person who lived and this is considered to be yeah there's a reality to the story even if we don't see it that way that is participative that you're actually you can enter kind of into her story in to a degree she would have had a feast and people would have celebrated and there would have been church's name after her and city's name after her and so it's like there there would have been a way to participate in her story and to celebrate her story that wasn't like the kind of weird the weird geeky cosplay stuff that you see like that what that isn't something that is kind of so weird and removed from reality that it's it's just like it it doesn't participate in life whereas celebrating saint margaret and and you know and celebrating her feast and maybe having a procession or whatever it is that people would have done for her feast to to celebrate her was something which was integrated into their into their let's say yearly yearly cycle right there's there is a sense where a story like this what it produces is something like you know an icon that you it might carve that's going to have a different function than a story of a dragon like you know smog and bilbo or something from the hobbit right that might produce art but it's not it's not the same because it's connection to reality is at a different level yeah like i did carve an icon of say margaret and and that icon it was for someone whose daughter is named margaret and and that is going you know and it's going to go into a room and she'll be told the story and you know it's her patron saint maybe you know that she'll she'll she'll have a special prayer to say margaret in you know in her daily life and so that's a participative thing and so it becomes a model for her it becomes a you know like it's not like you said it's not just something you buy toys for and like that that that is just this kind of fictional world that you can't really live in right and that's actually the idea of naming i think it's kind of interesting i would assume that this story of st margaret is one of the i think she's really probably the main source of most you know people naming their children margaret is probably generally would be after her yeah historically speaking and just how that's that is a different process than the kind of thing now where it's becoming more popular to name children after characters from fictional things you know like oh i'm gonna name my trying to candle yeah the first time i met an anakin i was like dude what are you doing did you do it did you watch the movies didn't you exactly this doesn't end well oh boy yeah but indeed there is like this is some one of the points that i've been making for a few years is that there's a strange moment now in history where on the one hand churches are trying to be as close to entertainment as possible right and have taken up the concert model and using advertising tropes and you know popular music and all that but on this in the same at the same time entertainment is trying to be more participative and so you have people who like i said dress up as their characters have cosplay events there's something called the church of harry i think it's called the harry potter and the sacred text which is like an organization they meet every week and they have liturgical readings of harry potter books together and they meditate on the meaning of harry potter so it's like a harry potter church you know but you can't live in the world of harry potter like you can pretend and you can you can have you can wear little hats and you can you know but but in the end it's it's it's it's there's it's factitious and it's schizophrenic to try to live in a world like that right well that's funny that you mentioned that because one of the things i think that is really hard to often get across especially if you're trying to kind of introduce people the concept of kind of literary study is try and make it clear that literature is not the same thing as entertainment there's crossover for sure it's not like they're completely separate spheres but the idea that we have there's a reason why historically we have a distinction between literature as a kind of manifestation of culture in a kind of higher sense and entertainment it's just that that thing that we go to kind of you know have fun and yeah just forget about steam off and to rest it's like it's not necessarily a it's not necessarily the idea of resting which most entertainment seems to to be part of yeah right yeah so i think that's i think that's really really helpful to kind of put put the story in in all of these various contexts we've kind of gone through a lot of a lot of stuff but i think i think all of it is you know hopefully kind of illuminating of of why why a story like this isn't just you know a relic of kind of the past that you can kind of you know forget it's just silly or you know not relevant or you know it doesn't have any kind of you know we don't tell stories like that today so how does it how does it relate to kind of you know the modern conception of heroism or happens to be but i think if you take all of these things into account then it really does form a pattern throughout i mean it's really explicit in the west i think in the western literary canon but even beyond that this this is kind of a structure of the story you know how it lays itself out and these symbols reappear and that if we understand how these symbols work then we can hopefully apply it to other things that if you then go on and read beowulf only different kind of hero totally different kind of story but the dragon is going to be somewhat similar in terms of what he means yeah exactly it's going to be it's going to be similar and it's also going to be something which can help you when you meet your dragon see the thing about the thing about the dragon is that it's it's if you give a specific thing like if you give a specific thing which appears to you as a manifest itself as a dragon it doesn't when you retell the story it doesn't have the same power right because it's not universal and so a lot of times what happens in these ancient stories is that is that categories tend to con contract right and so they contract to a point where it they become understandable for a very long time and so if if you give something which is too detailed or too particular then it it has a limited lifespan right so but if you give something that has that is a contracted category then it has a much longer lifespan because it can it can kind of cross through the the ages and so you know there are certain images like a dragon is of course the one of the ultimate images that is a contraction of all kinds of categories of experience into this very powerful image but you can encounter a dragon it can happen to you and then when you tell the story you know you can give the the details of it but sometimes it's probably better to to use a mythical image because it's the one that reflects your experience of it the most right right it doesn't just kind of make you wonder how many of the stories that you know have maybe currency or popularity now like how many of those are going to last if they're not participating in those kinds of patterns as opposed to these more ancient stories which last for millennia yeah like for that's one of the reasons why movies might not last very long because movies are so tight like they're so the type of the movie is so set like if if you have a story about drug dealers and all these different things and and you know in a few hundred years from now they those just might not be even understandable to anybody no one would even know what it is that the movie is referring to whereas the stories which embody more universal patterns and are using tropes which can span through time then those will just naturally survive in the long run because because they're not so idiosyncratic right i guess that's kind of what the the purpose of the canon used to be insofar as like the texts which didn't have that got weeded out over time because they weren't copied down and then the ones that were copied down were the ones that lasted or the ones that had some kind of significance that transcended so like homer is you know relevant in all ages not just in ancient greece whereas now we have this weird thing because we preserve everything and you know and and also a lot of these hierarchies are broken down so the idea is like well you should teach something as relevant in this political and this is you know it's going to speak to some kind of current issue but like is that going to is that does that happen it's not going to last forever because one of the problems we're having now and it's a it's a uni it's a big problem everybody's seen it it's the problem of the hierarchy of information is that we've created a world where information is a near infinite but attention is not infinite and so there is a natural way in which the the information will lay itself out in a hierarchy to you and that hierarchy will end up looking in look like a mythical structure you know it it can be especially now like with the social networks and google and search engines it can be manipulated and it can be manipulated politically which is happening but nonetheless the problem of a hierarchy of attention is something that you can't avoid and it'll make it that you know the the the you know the third series of some random sitcom that no one ever cared about like the third season is just it's just not going to be easily in your attention span because it's so far it's there's so much to attend to that it's just gonna vanish even though it might exist physically on some server somewhere it's still not going to it's still going to be on the on the fringe of people's attention right right exactly and i guess it's kind of interesting that something like this you know like i say morgan has been in the fringe probably a lot of places for a long time now but through you know forums like this i guess i don't know bring it back into people's attention i guess well it's it's relevant it's relevant today and also the reason why it was it was eliminated was maybe not the right reason and so i think that as i think that as post-modernism has its way and kind of modernistic thinking has its way it's going to have a surprising effect which is going to be restoring some of these old stories that people discounted as silly you know just just a few decades ago because a lot of the level of that story is no different than the level of the stories in the bible it's like if you're bothered by the story of saint margaret you know why aren't you bothered by the story of tobit and why aren't you bothered by by you know the leviathan described in job or the behemoth or all these monsters and the fact that god says in the first in the first chapters of genesis that he created sea monsters it's like you're gonna have to deal with that stuff you can't just you can't just toss it off to the side it's coming back yeah exactly but it's so much easier too like when you know you so you can look at the north stuff and you see the the mid guard serpent circling the world and instead of that being like oh that's just like a cool viking thing he's like no that's like it's in the bible too it's in that's pretty universal my friend it's pretty universal exactly it's all over the place we have our own we have our own serpent encircling the world don't worry it's out there somewhere it's great all right well i think this was a really good conversation i have to say well i hope it's useful and yeah and to and i hope it will also be useful to your students
