what's up fam squad today we're going to be buying the most expensive apps in the entire world not clickbait because i don't value money intro the first app is called only for the richest and apparently it's just an app to show off how much money you have honestly it sounds perfect for me all right we got it fixed let's see it says it's only for the richest are you one of the richest i'm a jake pauler then you better do it i'm gonna use all those merch sales to buy it yeah buy my merch we're not gonna get sued like logan paul for stealing another company's brand all right guys moment of truth let's open up the app it is i bought this app for 150 yay five percent goes to charity we just gave seven dollars to charity security hell yeah wait why didn't we just give 150 dollars to charity scam we needed the app for the video just kidding it's literally 150 app that just says i bought this out for 150 dds gp this app actually looks kind of interesting i like the graphics they got going on here check out the reviews ibm close to developers no one gives a crap all right let's buy it this app is 400 but dentists make six figures dude this is a no-brainer bye just call me mr dentist [music] all right here we go boys we're loading her up sorry about that glare why is that glare sexually harassing you guys that is very decay okay there's real images too oh nope not add to my favorite you sure no no i do not wish you were my favorite [ __ ] off oh oh that two said [ __ ] oh you and the teeth that two said evolution is wrong i'm the big tooth all right did i get 400 worth the content out of it i think so i don't think so up next we have the vuvuz whalea world cup horn plus plus premium you know this looks like a top quality app it's rated two and a half stars with two reviews payments successful hell yeah install i'm ready for my vuvuzuela horn all right so far it looks like you paid 200 for that dude honestly that should be like 400 why is it so cheap i want to make this my car like the horn on my car now so it's not for nothing what wait what i can see why it's so expensive this is advanced technology right here oh it closed wow my new iphone x is awesome and it only costs a thousand but can it do this why would i want it to do that i'm secretly jealous of the boogers all right i got a notification from the app oh my god somebody bought my 200 app what a [ __ ] idiot yep that's me someone make that a meme the next app is called i am rich it is 400 and somehow it has 4 000 reviews to be honest i thought every review of this app was exaggerated and only for laughs even so i still bought this app because i had money left to burn in the amazon sale for 400. i don't understand how this app has a hundred thousand downloads and it's number four trending and finance it doesn't really make sense so let's figure it out maybe this is the secret to bitcoin thank god it's finally dying now we don't have to hear about bitcoin anymore but wait jimmy you were the guy making us hear about bitcoin oh yeah i was the annoying one whoops my bad by my merch to be fair i really want to make a video where i give a homeless man a hundred thousand dollars because i think that would go hella viral so if you guys buy enough merch we can definitely do that video next week just say it you have zero diamonds watch video ads to get more diamonds you bought a four hundred dollar app and you have to watch chats what now show this app to your buddies that you purchased the most expensive app from play store this isn't the most expensive app it's one of them but watch video ads to get more diamonds honestly it makes perfect sense i paid 400 to watch ads get the right answer and get real money wait you will lose your reward i don't get a reward if i skip it what resume i'm watching an ad also i have a hundred diamonds boys you can mine diamonds hell yeah only in america do people pay 400 to watch ads honestly youtube you should take some notes we don't want to buy youtube red to get rid of ads we want to pay 400 for more ads come on youtube what are you doing on a serious note i just paid 400 for an app just to get 50 seconds worth of content in my video and you know this is basically the peak of evolution top of the morning to you ladies the next app we're going to be trying is a game it's called super color runner that honestly looks like a gay pride flag i'm from north carolina and i'm supposed to be home i'm just kidding i'm just kidding i don't care what you do with your genitals put in whoever's mouth you want to let's buy this app underrated oh [ __ ] this is unrated we better watch out boys so right there is the speedrunner app and for some reason it's not opening up so i actually went to the store and we bought another tablet and we just downloaded it right there as you can see we downloaded it again and it's not working on this tablet either so apparently this is just a broken app it doesn't work on any tablets that's another 200 down the drain let me just remind you the merch links at the top of the description all right word on the street is this diamond app is way different than the other one the other one was just ads apparently this one's better right right that's what i hear what they're telling me all right let's see all right 3.99 why do i hear a baby crying in the background be quiet while it gosh payment unsuccessful card declined my bank's like no one's stupid enough to buy all these apps like this has to be fraudulent has my bank learned nothing let's try paypal let's see how that goes doesn't care if i spend all my money paypal lets me give thirty thousand dollars to random people they'll let me buy this app honestly i'm surprised paypal hasn't like contacted the fbi and just been like you should investigate this kid oh hey it downloaded i hit open yep let's see it i bought this for four hundred dollars giving a hundred and twenty dollars to charity yes more charity money yeah that other app only gave five percent to charity this gave 30 dude this was amazing that's way worth it look at the tax write-off these apps are great i mean look at all the charity they're doing they may be pocketing 280 doing nothing but so so far i think we spent like three thousand dollars and like 150 went to charity pretty successful day if you know not gonna lie just so you know i'm not messing around like this is literally the app that's it just says i bought this for 400 and they're giving money to charity but good for them these other apps they're only giving five percent to charity yeah i love how like bland that is we're giving it to charity like what charities they're like i don't know i need a new couch the charity for my butt or something all right guys so i did some digging and apparently i am rich premium is a thing now we bought i am rich but we've yet to buy i'm rich premium and i think i'm rich premium is just leaps and bounds ahead of the other two it has 153 one star ratings and we all know the better you are the more haters you have that's why you got to keep dabbing payment successful whoa yes all right let's tell you for this bad boy to install it's just the wallpaper i paid 400 for this wallpaper jimmy our bills haven't been paid in three months you're behind i have this wallpaper they're not going to accept that as a payment jimmy i hey don't disrespect my wallpaper now leave me please buy that merch so i can get paid app review app review app review app review to be fair everyone else is copying me so i can copy other people you know a little bit so the next app is ivip black i don't know what it is but my monkey he's going to explain it to you go ahead hi i'm paul ivip black is an app to where you get it's pretty much like a exclusive social media for rich people you get certain so apparently it's like social media for rich people is what he told me so as you can see right here it's about a thousand dollars i won in i want to be with the other parlors your payment method was declined i heard you you didn't knock on wood you just want my vip blog all right guys look look it actually oh my why look that glare every time that glare is just like no no no you're not allowed to see the phone as you can see it actually downloaded the app dude i'm actually kind of stoked all right guys it's my first time ever on here priority pass is the world's largest independent airport vip lounge program with more than 600 lounges in over 300 cities security boston blah blah blah i don't know basically this ivip thing looks like a complete ripoff that no one uses all right guys it finished downloading this app is called wheel burner like i said it was four hundred dollars three two one whoa you're a fast boy oh a turning boy over another turning boy oh my goodness wait it says 0 3 out of 32. what happens when we hit 32 you beat the next level that's next-gen graphics man dude this is pretty realistic it's almost like they use google earth i can see why it's worth 400 like the engineering team on this dang it's kind of laggy honestly for a 400 dollar app i would expect better frame rates for this type of money we finished what do i get nothing [music] was it worth it worth it well four dollar app versus 400 app 400 app takes the cake we bought this tablet for the video and it was a 50 tablet and now it has 350 dollars worth of apps on it that's i feel like this tablet deserves a medal like i should return this 50 tablet and demand they give me a thousand dollars because of all the apps on it it's no longer worth 50 these are premium apps those my friends are the most expensive apps in the world you're not really missing much and make sure you subscribe and turn on notifications first comment on all my
