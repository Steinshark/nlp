[music] thank you this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world thank you yeah like i was saying too because in australia the restrictions are very very harsh and i think at the start of it wasn't that i was happy but i kind of took advantage because i'm like you know what i'm gonna have a lot of time to do my own thing learn a new skill spend time with my my fiance and all this kind of stuff but i think a year and a half later it's like okay i think this is enough it's good it's getting to me now i'm gonna admit it yeah i believe it you know i think we have all had the same reaction the same for me when first when it started it was kind of like okay we'll have some time together as a family and we'll also you know i'll be able to kind of let's say because i wasn't traveling anymore so i was able to invest in different venues that i i hadn't you know different things that i knew that i need to put some time in but i hadn't and so it was actually pretty fruitful but by now i mean it's not as bad here as it is there but right now you know with these passports and the scapegoating and all of these kind of weird political measures that are coming to the fore it's becoming yeah it's becoming more and more frightening let's say because it's also at the same time they keep telling us that it doesn't matter if you're vaccinating yourself to wear your mask yourself to social distance and there's going to be boosters and there's new variants and so it's as if they're gonna have it all we'll have we'll have quarantines we'll have vaccines and social distancing and masks and infinite boosters so it's very yeah and for a disease that kills like point one percent of the population i don't know i mean i feels like it's a little bit of a stretch and to destroy our democracies and to completely change the very the very mechanisms by which our societies function so it seems to me like there's something else that's going on that it's not just about a disease that there are other that there are other things at play in this so official and like i laugh because it's like i don't know what else to do at this point you know what i mean it's getting so it's getting so ridiculous and i think now more than ever it's like so much divisiveness you know what i mean like if you have a certain opinion it's like you're a piece of crap how dare you and it's very black or white communities breaking down this kind of thing so i wanted to ask you what is the symbolism behind all this like especially what's going on right now is this related to revelations or is that a stretch what's going on here i think it depends how you look at it you know i think that it's not a stretch if you understand the book of revelation as as a series of patterns you could say a series of social patterns they kind of manifest themselves and the idea of revelation is that it's the final version let's say the most complete version of this pattern but if you understand it more as these kind of symbolic patterns that exist exist in the world then it's then in revelation you can actually see these types of moves that happen in culture you know the example the example i like to give is for example in scripture there's an image of a writing a beast and this horror is all about mixture and about trade and about kind of consuming and this whole vision of of a you know that that's what a is right it's it's just just about pleasure and it's just about consuming it's just and it's all about mixture and lack of identity and all these things and so and then it's sitting on a beast which is interesting and this beast is actually an image of of control of civilization because the beast is is is a algaation an amalgamation of all the ancient empires in scripture there's these beasts that have that represent different empires so you see like this amalgamation of empire with the on it and and then in scripture it says that the beast kills the at some point and there's this whole sense that the beast sets up an image of itself and that this image rings about a kind of state of control and the idea of marking with an identity and that when you mark the idea of marking with an identity in a way that you can't escape hmm the idea that there is no remainder there's nothing outside of the system the system tries to be total and tries to be complete and if the only thing you can do basically is if you refuse to participate in the system then you're completely excluded right you can't buy you can't sell you can't exist but you don't have an existence basically and so if you understand it that way then you can kind of see these these these movements towards towards ident let's say the idea identification and the idea of tracking and control and the relationship you know it seems like the vaccine is maybe just a door into these systems of control which are possible because of technology and as we see this kind of coming through then we see exactly what we see similar things to what we see in scripture which is that right now i was just watching a video of some minister nigeria saying that if you're not vaccinated and you can't show proof of vaccination you won't be able to go to a bank you won't be able to go to church and so this is the next kind of the next step where they're like inching towards the idea that you can't participate in society at all if you haven't received this this this kind of sacrament of participation in at the same time as they're telling us that the sacrament of participation isn't as good as you thought and you're gonna have to keep getting it every three four months for for the rest of your life like i we i don't know like it's all very vague but so it does it does kind of bring about we don't have to freak out necessarily and think like this is it you know but it does the the so the story scripture can help you understand these patterns and understand this relationship between systems of control how they take over after too much freedom you could say something is too chaotic and too too much goes too much in that direction then after that system of control comes and tries to clamp it down yeah it's very like like lately it's been so inverted i feel like these times because at one stage at least in australia it's completely illegal for you to go to church but you can pay a prostitute to have sex like that's fine you know what i mean it's like wait wait wait wait i thought this was all about like social distancing all this kind of stuff but i don't think that it's about that no there's something else definitely something else going on and people often it's funny because people wonder what is it and people don't understand that power is its own motivation there is no other secret motivation except for power and you see that it's like the capacity for and let's say the capacity for power which comes into a kind of unholy union with people's desire to feel safe and you know desire to to not to not be in danger these two things kind of go together and they they go together surprisingly well because the more say the safer you are the more afraid you are and the more you feel like you're unsafe this is really true you know it was interesting because you know i lived in in congo for four years and my my wife and i and my my son and i our son and us we we actually lived in local neighborhoods with congolese people you know in the city of kinshasa you know there were no other westerners around it was just you know so so we were we were kind of in the life and we lived through the rhythms of the life and the west like the kind of westerners north americans and europeans lived in these gated compounds that had guards and had had all this and they were far more afraid than we were because they were so safe and they felt like the safety now all of a sudden every little danger becomes like an like this crazy thing it's like no you're not supposed to ever be in danger you're not supposed to ever get sick you're not supposed to ever die basically and this is just that that's not true it's just a lie it's just a basic lie about how we exist in the world and how risk is just an integral part of being human and the less risk we take the more we're afraid of them yeah i think that's why i really enjoy traveling especially to third world countries and kind of just getting thrown into the unknown you know what i mean i think it's what i've noticed today those who are like the most strict about you know like getting the jab and lock down all this kind of stuff it's usually those who haven't really stepped outside their bubble their whole life you know what i mean and i find that very interesting like like you said like when you feel so safe and comfortable that's when you kind of get more afraid of getting hurt and taking risks and these kind of things yeah exactly and it's and it really is a you know it just it kind of it's kind of a mode of being in which people embark and there's something about the mother like something about this kind of devouring mother that that says you know it's like i'm going to protect you from all danger i'm gonna make sure that nothing happens to you that you're not gonna die you're not gonna get sick you're not going to hurt yourself and you're not also going to be in danger there'll be no hate speech no one's gonna insult you nobody's gonna hurt you no one's gonna hurt your feelings it reminds me of my mother she's like a latina spanish moms are very overprotective she's overprotected i rebelled in my teenage years kind of had the opposite effect of what she intended but oh yeah you were like okay i need to break free from this yeah but imagine that now i just assist at a level of systems where you know and people struggle to understand that there's a relationship let's say with the kind of rise in social justice mentality that was there several years ago and this desire for safe spaces this desire to not to not be triggered that they know that that we're fragile and that we need to be preserved in from all kind of danger and now this this situation with kobit is an extension like a physical extension of something which has been a social phenomenon for quite a quite a while now so is this like a start of a new age do you think coming back you know i hope it's not a start of new age i mean for sure it does feel like something similar happened in weimar really you know because weimar was a wild place like it was a wild crazy place and there were all this kind of let's say fluidity in identity and fluidity and and roles and fluidity in terms of taboos and all of this was all kind of mixed up and at some point when there was a crisis then the only thing to do was to overcompensate and to kind of clamp down and create massive systems of control and i think that this is what we're kind of seeing is that this little crisis is just becoming an opportunity for systems of control to clamp down but you know i mean it's hard not to also see that there seems to be something that is transnational about what's happening there seems to be patterns which are not just about our own government but that seem to be kind of moving across government's ways of speaking even types of words people use you know for example like this phrase that's now popular the pandemic of the unvaccinated you know it's being used by different governments by different authorities in different countries and you realize that okay this it's not just you know it's like if justin trudeau says it and then you hear it in england and then you hear it in other countries and you realize okay i've also heard them say similar phrases like build back better and all these phrases that we're using they have this kind of weird vocabulary that is transnational and so that's also kind of frightening it is frightening to imagine that that there are patterns which are even beyond our politics and that and that are just gonna happen there's nothing we can do about it like here the the covet passport in quebec where i am i mean it didn't it didn't get debated in parliament it again didn't get debated legally it was just said like this is it it was just mandated completely in a like a directly tyrannical way and there was no possible way to discuss it with anybody there was nothing to say it was just like this is we're gonna do and everybody just says okay it's like we're not a democracy anymore it's like everybody's just forgotten that we're supposed to be a democracy protesting is illegal so you can't even like voice your opinion on this stuff so they shut you down yeah well here at least yet right now they don't shut us down they just don't cover it we're not allowed to leave the country we haven't since march last year yeah you guys it's crazy like you're not allowed to protest at all not we're not allowed to leave i can't leave the city i can't leave five kilometers within my own house i think now they did like only one person per household can go for a walk around the block playgrounds shut down like it's yeah it's pretty i don't even know what to say about it because it's like i think it's going to end but then it just gets extended again and again and again and it's like i don't know man but i guess a positive out of this whole thing is that it actually led me to read revelations and go inwards and kind of explore christianity because i've discovered your working many years ago and i didn't even know what orthodoxy really was and it's been very mind-blowing and i'd i'd really been delving deep into symbolism and i love your pop culture videos breaking down the patterns of movies and why we're so like obsessed with pop culture and stuff like this for those listening at home maybe for those who aren't very well versed in symbolism what is symbolism and how do you distinguish that from let's say jungian archetypes well it's a little bit related i'm not a huge follower of jung but it's it's not completely unrelated the way to the best way to understand symbolism i think in a modern world is to understand the the problem of complexity which is that when you look out at the world we see things we see the world kind of that they appear to us in a certain way but if we're attentive and we think about it we realize that every aspect of the world that we see is an infinitely complex right from the glass that i'm drinking of you know to the table in front of me to the sounds that i hear they they like the glass that i have in my hand is is as complex as you like there's an infinite amount of complexity in the glass like it's made of multiple multiple parts and multiple aspects right your chair is made out of multiple parts and so but there's a way in which we are able to perceive unities in this multiplicity right and so there's a way in which unity kind of comes out of multiplicity and appears to us as a pattern right and so reality is necessarily patterned for us to be able to even engage with it we have to kind of our consciousness has to engage with it in its patterns and so that would be maybe the first way to understand what symbolism is which is that there's an inevitability of patterns in the way we encounter things now this is true for objects it's true for sounds it's true for everything but it's ultimately true for the way in which we engage with each other that is we string a bunch of of words together a bunch of facts together to create narratives to create stories and those stories need to have a pattern and that pattern isn't arbitrary right it's a it's a it's an objective pattern that you can discern and it's the same for images it's the same for the way we remember things so for us to remember something we have to condense all this multiplicity into images that we can remember so those images will also be patterned and so the way we represent things ends up being pattern so that's really the basis of symbolism and the idea is that you can study that and you can understand it and there's also a process by which you could say this way that the symbolism is the pattern of attention right it's the way that we attend to the world and those things would grab our attention the most and for the longest period of time will remain and the things that we that don't get grab our attention and that we don't remember will kind of fade away just like if someone tells you what happened during their day and it's really boring and no and it's just a bunch of things that don't relate to each other you're just gonna forget it but if someone tell you this crazy thing that happened to him and he almost fell up a cliff and then something happened and he came up and then you're going to remember it because it's going to have something which gathers your attention so in the same way all the stories we've been telling each other for the millennia that we've been around those have almost like a like a natural selection process by which those that end up being preserved are the ones that gather our attention the most so that's why you can look at fairy tales and religious stories and myths as containing more of these condensed patterns than let's say just the common reality in which we exist but the common reality in which you exist is also pattern it's just not as distilled as these patterns and so in the same manner the way we interact with each other is also patterned right you speak i speak we kind of have a way to listen to the other person to show them we're listening and we have to follow that pattern or else communication breaks down but then that also scales up into rituals like handshakes like saying hello you know like smiling and then ultimately that scales up into something like religious rituals where we all gather together we act in communion we act together towards something which transcends us and then that binds us as a community so we can understand everything from fairy tales to let's say to to to liturgy to christian liturgy or to architecture with these patterns of this kind of symbolic patterning hmm and these patterns or symbolism is it religious in nature like well it's not it's i would say you could say yes and no that is it isn't religious in nature if you it's just reality it's just the way the reality lays itself out but you could say that at the at a most basic level reality does present itself in a religious manner that is even if you understand what religion the word religion religion means means bringing together means binding together that's what really connecting things together that's what religion is and so it ends up being the ultimate types of of patterns move towards religion because they end up being that's a recognizing how these patterns bind us together and then looking up towards them you could say consciousnesses it's not just even pattern even consciousness has this pattern and so you have something which binds the community together they recognize it they celebrate it together they sing songs about it you know they they they end up giving things to it you know and so then you have the image of the king or the image of a god and the image of of of these heroes that we venerate from antiquity and so it ends up it does end up looking religious in its kind of ultimate sphere but it it scales all the way down to like i said a handshake or yeah or just kind of simple social rituals so so these patterns something that we recognize in our own minds or is the pattern a more fundamental reality well this is where it becomes tricky because there's a there's a even today like in modern physics right now you know they have this whole observer problem and they have they have this sense a lot of scientists even now are coming to the sense that some how consciousness is necessary for reality to kind of present itself because or else without that we have something like quantum fields or just just this kind of possibility of existence and so you can't completely disassociate mind from the manner in which reality becomes patterned because it is kind of an invisible pattern which manifests itself in in in reality so you can't completely distinguish it the problem we have is that since let's say since romanticism and since you know kind of modern philosophy we tend to somehow think that mind is subjective in the sense of idiosyncratic and like you know relative to you like relative to your opinion let's say yes that's not that's not true they say there's something objective about mind and the wow the way in which these patterns present themselves to us and in that in that objectivity then we can kind of recognize them we don't just recognize them we participate in though and that's really important to see the difference also between a kind of symbolic understanding and a more modern rationalistic abstract way of understanding the modern rationalist tends to abstract themselves from the world and think they're they don't exist or they're just this like floating being that's looking at the world and then they analyze it whereas in when you understand this patterning you realize that no you're in the world and you're kind of recognizing and participating and celebrating these patterns rather than this kind of cold cold cynical not cynical but like just cold analysis of of science let's say do you think it's possible to step outside the patterns no and the world no a lot of yeah so i think so like oh you could say that yes but how do you so so but it would be something like a spiritual like a spiritual experience i think that you can have a kind of transcendent spiritual experience but that transcended spiritual experience will then when he comes back down right so let's say you have a a theophany and you see something you should like you start see with your eye but like you have an intuition it's pure intuition of something which is beyond multiplicity like as soon as you turn back and you even think about it or even represented in your mind or you even talk about it or you frame it then it comes back into the world of patterns hmm does that make sense like it immediately comes back into the world of patterns and so so that's why you can recognize like this i think you can recognize a a fake spiritual person from a real spiritual person when the fake spiritual person tends to want to destroy the world and so they go they say they had this kind of spiritual experience and then what they do is they say then they try to relativize everything it's like i had the spiritual experience it and then everything else is crap like nothing all of this is nothing right whereas i think the real kind of spiritual insight is able to see that this is the source of the patterns this invisible transcendent point is the source of the patterns and so is able to kind of gather them into their experience there's a there's a beautiful image in the in a mystical christian mystical book called the the life of moses by saint gregory of nissa okay gregory of nisa describes moses ascending the mountain in order to encounter god in the in the divine darkness like even beyond light into this kind of ultimate ultimate transcendent space where even let's say even vision disappears and you you enter in this kind of pure being like there are pure beyond being and so as he goes up the mountain he removes all these layers you know like his sandals and he kind of removes this quantity and because becomes purified as he enters into this kind of transcendent space but then when he gets there he's given the pattern of the tabernacle he's given the pattern of the space of worship and so and in that pattern he sees all the things he dropped as he was going up right he sees these layers he sees these garments of skin he sees these actions and so that's the idea is that if you really attend attain these kind of high spiritual states then you you should be able to gather into them the multiplicity and see multiplicity as an expression of these high spiritual states i don't know if that makes sense to you no that definitely does i think it's important to reconcile these worlds because i i fell into the kind of new age non-dual track and it's not even real non-duality really because what i've found out is that orthodox christianity is a form of non-duality because non-duality just means none not too but yeah i did find this kind of this path that a lot of people go down in spirituality where they basically try to dissolve the world you know what i mean they call it out illusory it's all relativistic but what i've experienced is absolute truth so it's like this dialectical tension like you're saying one thing but then you're acting in a way that's not really congruent to what you're actually speaking so you can't really live and act in the world that you're you're speaking about and what are your thoughts about this like this kind of the the blind leading the blind false prophets new age spirituality why is this so popular and i understand it because i went full force into it as well and got a business well let's say first of all i have to give you know as we say to give the devil's do or to kind of understand what happened is that yes christianity became extremely superficial oh yeah no from the time of the enlightenment as it slowly moved let's say towards the 20th century there was this there was an extremely kind of superficial and almost materialistic version of christianity what do you mean by that how did it turn materialistic well it became very moralistic first of all it tended to discount mystical experience it tended to be legalistic right into this kind of protestant idea that you're declared saved and it's just kind of it's kind of it's almost like a legal declaration of your salvation and it doesn't change anything really but it's like when you die you go to heaven the god is kind of nonsense you know so if you believe in jesus you're done you don't have to exactly that's when spirituality is to you it's like you just believe in jesus and you're saved and that's it that's it like i don't know what that is no so i get it right i understand and then also the this this one this desire to kind of embrace scientism let's say in christianity and then trying to kind of defend scripture in a scientific way and defend genesis as a scientific narrative and defend all these stories in this in the historical scientific way and the basic them so much that they just people didn't understand the spiritual significance of these stories anymore they would argue about some stupid statuette that they found the desert in palestine but then they didn't understand what it even meant for moses to go up the mountain and encounter this divine transcendent experience and then come down with his face shining in glory like do you understand what that's referring to or do you just see it as a material phenomena that happened right so this is the problem that that happened and so as the scientism and this kind of materialism took shape and christians tried to keep up and try to stay materialist at some point it just shattered and then all these stories just seemed like a bunch of silly stupid stories like why would it matter that some guy got nailed on a cross 2000 years ago like that saves you like some guy gets nailed on a cross and then you're going to have it like really yeah that didn't that didn't make sense to me either right it's like is that the story like dude it's just total nonsense right and so it's like so i get it i understand why at some point people and you see it like you see it even before the modern world you see these kind of esoteric these esoteric groups on these esoteric ideas start to appear even in the 17th century you know you see with the rosie rosy christians and then moving into kind of blabatsky and the theosophists kind of you have this kind of opening up and crowley and all these occultists in the 19th century so you kind of see this this reaction let's say to this materialist moralistic christianity and then that kind of wins you could say in the 60s especially that side of the of this of this kind of conflict wins and then there's this explosion of kind of wild mysticism and all these explorations of all these other traditions and a mixture and and like being you know going to india to find some guru and then yeah being fascinated by anything except your own your own tradition and also like the individualism of the modern world kind of seeped into there and so it became very idiosyncratic all the everybody has their own thing and everybody has their own mixture of stone of like you know crystals and these different practices and spiritual buffet whatever it's all these things yeah and so i get it i get it but i think that it's important to kind of be able to notice that it's it's participating in the breakdown of our societies right so you have all these idiosyncratic spiritualities that don't coalesce they don't kind of come together or they do as a cult so it's either you're totally idiosyncratic or you kind of give yourself completely to this guru that usually lasts a few years then it collapses and there's all these scandals that come out and and so it's a just kind of this this it's a very disturbing situation and one of the things that makes it even more disturbing is really the obsession with the strange that is the idea that my own story is worthless and i can't see any value in it but i can read some like weird tantric texts from from some culture that i have nothing to do with that has a caste system that i don't participate in that has that has all these realities that i can't at all understand but i find it super interesting and super fascinating and really uh kind of i feel like it reveals something to me so my like let's say my take on that or my approach to that is rather than to say okay let's go back into our story and let's try to go back and find find what was there before the breakdown find what was there before things started to fall apart and that's what we see in in the mystics like you read like i talked about sangria misa there are these amazing texts written in the in the early centuries of christianity which have everything of anything that a new ager would want in terms of this kind of cosmic understanding and this mystical union with something transcended it's all there but it doesn't have to break down into all these kind of individualistic idiosyncrasies that people participate in and leads them leads them into all these strange directions you know yeah i think i can understand the allure i think with new age spirituality especially with the you know the understanding of the 19th 20th century of christianity that materialistic surface level christian are you talking about and i can see why people get so attracted to that eastern mysticism side because you can have that direct mystical experience it's a lot more i guess entertaining you know a lot more explorations kind of scratches our curiosity button and but like you said early christianity like orthodoxy it's got all of that mysticism stuff it's just that we didn't we didn't know and a lot of people who are very against let's say christianity like protestantism or catholicism aren't even very aware of orthodoxy and like no early church fathers were teaching exactly and not only that but there had been an effort in the past few hundred years to iron over in even in the bible that is even in the bible translations there's been a concerted effort to iron over anything that smacks of something strange or something that doesn't that that that modernists can't deal with you know and so for example like this whole idea of this hierarchy of angels and all of these kind of sons of god that are in the council of the divine and and and kind of manifest god's will in the world you know that's something that people have just been trying to chase out of christianity for several hundred years and kind of to their detriment because now people are interested everybody's interested in angiology and everybody's like encountering all these different angels but they have no way of discerning what they're encountering that's completely chaotic and they think that just because they have an encounter with the being that somehow this is meaningful and not and and it's like so they don't have a map to kind of function in this world of intermediary spirits but that's all it's all there it's there in scripture it's there in the tradition it's there in the iconography of christianity where you do have a kind of map of this intermediary world and there are ways to kind of encounter it health in a healthy way without you know ending up following some some strange being that you encountered on ayahuasca and then you and then it takes you on down a very dark rabbit hole and you find yourself in psychic trouble you know after a little while where all of a sudden you start to break down oh yeah i've been there man i've been there it's scary stuff i think the having grounding is really important especially like strong scaffolding i think when you just get catapulted into these realms sometimes it's hard to close those doors you know once opened yeah and the thing with doors is that it's a two-way street exactly it's not just you entering the spiritual realm it's also a spiritual realm entering your if you believe in that i definitely i find it hard not to believe that there is a spiritual war out there and there are principalities so like what are your thoughts on this like pre-less spiritual war good versus evil how do you reconcile dualism is a two independent forces like how do you how do you go about this is an interesting there's an interesting way to kind of understand that which is that there is a kind of duality let's say and the duality is due to the fall like no matter how you kind of understand it if you look at the story of adam and eve that's what you see you see that they're in a in a kind of balanced space or in this garden that is kind of a balance between culture and nature that's a bound between masculine feminine that has this this balanced reality it's not perfect right and there's a remainder in it which is this kind of serpent and then this remainder tends them into duality tends them into seeing duality as final but duality exists right it exists in the world and so that's the fall the falls kind of is this fault into kind of extreme duality and so you can see it in the human in the human world as this kind of good and evil and these kind of dualities but you can also see it in the cosmic sphere as these two sides like you said later the angels and the demons are these two sides of a of a great cosmic story but there's also a manner in which these principalities ultimately are resolved in god and so there's a there's an interesting quote from the from the i think it's from saint gregory nazianzis who he talks about the angels of the left hand right that there are the angels of the right hand and then there are the angels of the left hand the angels of the left hand of god are basically the demons and the demons think that they're doing their own thing but they don't realize that they're not that they're actually ultimately doing the will of god in kind of showing us our own let's say weaknesses and manifesting these these weaknesses and this darkness in the world so that that darkness can then be covered by god ultimately in the final okay in the finals image you could say it sounds like it relates a little bit to jungian shadow integration a little bit there's something of that but the difference i would say with the shadow integration is that we really don't we don't see in christianity that's really important christianity doesn't see darkness or doesn't see sin as a positive force it's a it's a what it what it is it's a kind of it's something not in its right place or something not looking in the right direction that's what sin is and so being is always positive like being is always true but then there's an there's a way in which it can become out of whack by let's say attracting too much attention to itself or not being in the right place and so that is the way in which we kind of understand so that's the kind of the joke about the demons is that they think that they're dark but ultimately they'll participate in the greater light you could say without without even understanding what they're doing you know so it's not just that it's not that that god is integrating non-being let's say or or this kind of lack of being but rather that he's revealing the way in which things actually do participate in the great in the great picture i don't know that that makes sense so it's kind of like the image of christ like you have this image of of christ going when christ dies you know there's this kind of more mythological version of the story in the in the gospel of of nicodemus where you know you have the devil in hades in in hell and they're like we won right we killed the son of god like this is it you know we finally did it and they're they're like excited because here he comes right we're going to bring him into death but then they don't realize that if you bring light into darkness right it's not it's not light it goes away it's you do the opposite and so bringing you know god into death was actually kind of revealing the revealing the world and kind of scattering that darkness well it's even like the a physical example of a candlelight you know no matter how much darkness there is around it it can't actually overpower and over consume it no exactly that's the and that's a good the the and the phrase you used is exactly the phrase that saint john uses in the gospel where he says the you know the doctor did not know it but it it didn't it couldn't overpower it because like you said that's not how light and dark work and in the same even in pop culture or actually forever we've been obsessed with the story of good versus evil and the hero's journey and all this kind of stuff and i remember listening to an old podcast of yours and you talked about the hero's journey and how ultimately it's christ's story and that before christ there really wasn't at least the version of the hero's journey that is out today is that true and can you like get into that i mean i think so i i think that because one of the things people talk about is like the dying and rising god that they're all these ancient stories of these right pagan gods that that point towards ultimately this kind of story of death and resurrection but i think they're i think they're kind of how can i say this i think they're looking back from a christian point of view into something which maybe didn't have the same type of hierarchy that they think it did that it was because these scattered these you could say these scattered lights that were in the world but then from the story of christ then we can look back into real into the past and then all of a sudden we see these little spiral lights that are pointing towards ultimately what is the story of christ and so the idea of going into the underworld right this descent into the underworld that's the story that you see in the hero's journey but that you also see just in so many stories or you see it in the iliad you see in in so many myths you know when you see it in the aeneid all of these these stories have this kind of descent into hades and then either you encounter someone you encounter your father and then your father reveals something to you or you go there to get someone right you have you have the story of i think it's hercules who goes down into hades and is able to save his friend out of out of death and so you have these like these little versions of this kind of going into death and bringing out you know kind of revealing something that wasn't that death wasn't able to to hold on to you could say or finding something precious hitting in death like going into death and then finding some some vision that will give you meaning right and so so it's there right it is there but as once the story of christ happens then that story is it reaches its limit like there's no there's actually no other story you could say after the story of christ because in the fullness of the story of christ you have this idea that christ does that right christ goes into death he doesn't just go into death right he actually dies he dies he goes into death and then when he goes down there he gathers everybody that's there and takes them out wow and so right we have this this sentence that we hear every easter in the orthodox church where it says you know haiti hell is empty like hell has been has been emptied by christ christ went down and brought all i mean it's mysterious it's not it's hard to kind of completely understand it but it is this image that christ defeated death itself and that by going into the underworld when he came back out you know that was it and so there's no that it's like i said it's the limit of the story you go down into the underworld and you solve the underworld and then you transform it into glory and then that's it like there's no there's no version which can go beyond let's say that version in terms of categories yeah it's it's a very obviously a story in archetype that resonates with so many people you know yeah and even something like i didn't want to talk a little bit actually about lord of the rings because one of my favorite movies and it's obviously a movie that just exploded in popularity and then i found that years later that you know the author is a devout catholic so it's got deep christian symbology and i feel like a lot of people don't even notice but then they become super religious about lord of the rings even atheists which i find quite ironic why do you think lord of the rings connected with so many people and like what are the main kind of powerful symbolism behind that well i think that i mean what tolkien was able to do is to really reinstate a you could say an ancient vision of reality an ancient cosmic image and because maybe because he did it in fiction people didn't feel threatened by it maybe something like that and so because of that they were able to just be seduced by it you could say and so people no the most materialistic nerd scientific you know programmer guy will just fall in love with lord of the rings and you don't doesn't totally understand why if you ask him about religion he'll say religion is stupid and superstitious it's it's it's all these things but nonetheless he he is able to be completely kind of engaged and subsumed by this story which has this this entire kind of hierarchy of beings that you know that moves from i mean in the lord of the rings himself doesn't necessarily talk about the first god but like it kind of moves down at least in in the middle earth through the elves and then the humans and then the the dwarves you know and then the orcs and so you have this this kind of movement from from light and kind of immortality into this kind of monstrous darkness which is that the bottom of the world and in the movie they captured so well like they just do it so well because they have the guy like coming out of the earth you know and they're all like filled with they're all scummy and dirty and that music as well exactly it's super well done and so because of that people just feel like it's right even though it's completely silly for a materialist to think about elves and orcs and dwarves and all of these all of these tropes they're they're because they're patterning themselves on just like a traditional image of angels involved and demons below and the men in the middle and the king and you know the the the these kind of profit previously figures like gandalf that have more wisdom and they're able to kind of manifest it to us like you know all of these tropes and also the fall with gollum who becomes obsessed and then and then turns into it comes closer to the orcs you could say you know it becomes demonized because he's obsessed with with something which can which can kind of give him power and so it's like we totally recognize the truth but they're really really just tropes right they're really they're really they're it's really a religious story but it's great because it it's actually for people that are attentive to it they can say well you know like i can i can talk to you about the story that's in the bible in a similar way because it's way more than lord of the rings like the story of the bible is is is way more has way more complexity and subtlety and has all these layers in it and and all these patterns playing themselves out in different forms than lord of the rings because of that it's actually harder sometimes because it's so big that it's hard to it's hard to kind of fully get what's going on it's overwhelming sometimes i'll open scripts i'm like whoa man this is exactly through my reading you just fall into some weird thing especially if you open the open i'm five at a time yeah so i'm like like weird law about not mixing you know a donkey and a cow while you're playing like what are all these stupid things how do you reconcile this man you know that's why i i got the orthodox study bible so that really helped kind of fill in the gaps a little bit you know not pretending like i understand scripture of course not i'm still an infant but definitely saved me some time but it's funny what you're saying about lord of the rings you know people get so i would even go as far to say that religious about it you know what i mean like the nerds are like crazy about it and it's funny how like we even use it in our language now like if you go on an epic adventure it's like all right we're going on a lord of the rings adventure you know or if you instead of using the word hell like oh man i went down to mortal last night yeah devoured by orcs you know it's just like things like it's just funny how we use it in our language and it's like it's metaphorical but it also kind of reflects this very fundamental pattern of reality you know yeah that we and the movies were really successful i think in terms of visuals they really captured it still holds up today holds up i watched it just a few months ago too with my kids because they hadn't seen it yet and yeah it just it really does hold up in terms of the this this kind of world that exists and these different characters you know yeah it it does pretty well i was reading a few months ago i was actually reading your your brother's book on the symbolism of genesis and i kind of wanted to unpack that just a little bit maybe for those especially who aren't too well versed in these topics but before getting into genesis i want to know what is the difference between this literal and symbolic interpretation of scripture like how should we even approach this thing because i get that question a few times like all the time take it literally or do you take it metaphorically and it's always we live in a very dialectic culture you know it always has to be this or that is it one or is it zero like what's your answer for this well my answer is that i just cut through all that crap like i i don't like those i don't like that opposition i i find that it's a it's a dishonest opposition because if you remember the way that i talked about what symbolism is like symbolism is the actual pattern by which you're able to attend to something so it's so so it's actually it's a it's the pattern of a story it's the pattern of an image it's the pattern because let's say you take the story of of christ you know christ i don't know christ at the wedding of kana you know there's a million things that were happening in that event they were indefinite amount of things happening at the same time in that place and notwithstanding around it right it's like there was you know there's crinkled in in his robe there was you know dirt on his sandals there was there's a million like billions and billions of things happening and so in order for you to be able to attend to what was happening and to get meaning from it you have to condense those facts into a narrative you have to choose facts and then you have to string them together in a way that i will recognize that this is a union and so even the literal meaning of a text is already symbolic it's all it's necessarily symbolic because why did we why are we talking about this rather than that why am i mentioning these facts and why am i putting them together in a narrative that i can recognize and so there is no neutral reality there is no neutral meaningless reality that's just there and then on top of that i add some metaphorical meaning that's just total nonsense there's already a reason why that story is there there's a there's a reason why the story is constructed the way it is and that those facts have been chosen to be sequenced in that manner and so the meaning is already there at the very first layer right and so the best way to understand it that what you would think as literal just means that you're very paying very close attention to what the text is saying right that's even what literal means literal means literature it means what's written hmm that's what literal used to me it means what's written and so you you pay attention to what's written you have what's written there and then what's written there is structured in a way that is analogically related to other things and then that's when what you would call the metaphorical meaning will appear to you which is that as you look at the pattern of the story you realize that it's structured in a way that is similar to your experience that's similar to a society that's similar to another story in scripture and then a story for mythology and so then you that's when you get what maybe what people call the metaphorical meaning which is that i can take a story in scripture which is already symbolic which is already patterned in a cosmic way and then i can say this is similar to your experience and then i'll apply it to your experience right it's actually similar to the way token understood storytelling because token hated metaphorical meaning he said he said my in my stories i don't have metaphorical meanings and people don't understand what he meant and he said he said they're not metaphorical they're applicable so he said you can apply my stories to things but they don't it's not like you know the orcs are the communists and and this aspect of the story is some other political thing and and this is means technology and this is it's like that's the wrong way of looking at the bible and it's it's the wrong way of reading token too it's a it's mostly that the pattern of the story of tokien can be applied to your experience or applied to a situation and then you can use it as a lens to see the world and so that's the way in which scripture is metaphorical hmm but you won't find like the idea of literal the way that people think of literal that is a neutral telling of a story that is completely without meaning is absolute nonsense it doesn't exist yeah well you know like i said before so i think we're living to a polarizing society and it's very people very dialectic on both the material side of things and even the the kind of spiritual absolutist yeah person who you know like the materials will deny anything that's spiritual and ground their reality from everything below and then the spiritualist will deny matter all together yeah and say everything is one what does that even mean what's what's everything is one i don't think people who say that and other people who talk about non-duality i used to say it too and then i realized looking back i'm like wait that actually doesn't make any nobody but nobody nobody dares to believe in non-duality it leads to the way they think they do they think they believe in on duality and you're like you believe in non-duality really do you eat your feces no you don't eat your feces so don't tell me you believe in non-duality what are you talking what are you even talking about why does eating your crap relate to not duality well because you don't eat your crap because you believe in duality you believe that some things are outside and some things are inside and you don't mix them together right that's that's because you believe in duality you know you you live in a house you wear clothes you you ha you you you function in duality constantly and you experience duality and you live with duality and you don't if you if you believe in absolute non-duality in the way that especially people want and especially the way that relativizes everything then and there are like there are there you can find traditions that are cannibals and you can find traditions that that break all the taboos but i'm not sure many people are willing to go there because it's actually very destructive you know these kind of weird tantric traditions are very destructive to reality most people don't want to destroy reality they're lying when they say they do because they actually exist they exist they have a life they have all these things and so and so the idea is that love is a better expression like love is a better way to understand it because love has the notion of of ultimate non-duality in the sense that we all participate in the life of the infinite god but we're not we don't it doesn't mean that everything is relative and everything is illusion it means that because god loves us then we all exist at the level that we do it's as if god's infinite love also kind of let's say moves out of himself into this multiplicity as he's gathering it back into himself so it's not just like either everything is an illusion we're all just you know we're all just brahma like we're all just drops in the the you know the the the this kind of vast like infinite consciousness it's rather like a balance between unity and multiplicity right an understanding the multiplicity does but that ultimately for it to even exist it has to participate in the oneness but when people just say things like it's all one or whatever like john lennon and that kind of nonsense right it's like we could all be as one what are you what are you talking about it's just it's just it's just just posturing imagine there's no heaven yeah yeah [laughter] he has some good stuff though i i yeah i don't really i mean i like to be everybody likes it nobody who doesn't like the beatles yeah because i like the beatles but that song in particular yeah but it's it's ironic because like you're talking about these people who claim to have this absolute experience and that god is absolute everything and literally every single particle in the universe is god everything in physical reality is just an illusion but then they're basing their experience of the absolute from a relativistic subjective experience so it's like this kind of i don't know it's just this weirdness because you're claiming absolute reality but through a subjective lens anyway so that you can't really escape that that duality you know what i mean there's so much wrong like if you really if you really had an experience that that there's only the absolute and all its manifestations are are complete illusions you know what you would do you would shut up because why are you speaking what are you saying yeah it's it's all that's why that's why you realize that there's just a nonsense to a lot of the a lot of this type of posturing that you hear in kind of in this kind of modern spiritualist you know reality and it's not like you don't encounter texts like that in the traditions like there are there are texts or there are traditions which do kind of try to point to the manner in which let's say compared to the infinite like that the infinite is something which is beyond duality that'd be that the infinite does kind of empty itself and and contain everything at the same time and there's a language of aporia which people use to to talk about that and you see that in the in the even in in in religious traditions but like i said this also has to coexist with all the more buffered versions of that in which we also do participate in which we do go to church we kneel we sing we burn incense we we do all of these celebrations you know and we don't just have this one this kind of esoteric vision of the infinite that destroys reality because that's the that's the problem with a lot of this with a lot of this stuff is that people just say mysterious things they just say you know that kind of stuff like you know the universe is in a grain of sand the grain of sand is the whole universe and you're like really is that really you really think that i don't think you do i think you're just bullshitting me get those social media likes people like to like to hear that yeah they like that kind of that kind of fluffy stuff yeah it's funny because like i started off doing new age stuff but i i feel like because i'm australian i have that kind of inherent down to earth casual sort of yeah relationship with it so i think it wasn't as new age hippie but i think as i got more grounded over time people weren't very happy yeah well it's something that i i question because i find it weird how in this kind of world there is no word for pre-list there is no word for false spiritual experience and even that is very triggering because like how dare you say that my experience was false it felt so overwhelmingly real and i've had many of those i'm not even saying that it's false or it's true but the fact that there is no discernment between them how do you no but you don't have to question the experience people have you know it's mostly it's mostly like you said the discernment of that experience and so you know in the orthodox tradition i think it i think they have the really good way of dealing with this which is basically saying you should ignore all spiritual experiences and i know people are gonna go like what just ignore spiritual experiences but that's that's what they say and the reason why they say that is because they realize that if you really believe even what a new ager will say which is something like you know the purpose of reality is to be united with the one right to be to kind of be united with the transcendent reality then if that's your purpose then that's what you should be aiming towards and then these spiritual experiences that you have that's not it right just because you see an angel or you have some feeling or you have some insight even if the inside is rude to a certain extent that's not your goal that's not where you're headed so you have to be careful not to not to give too much attention to that because you're going to you're going to stay there and you're going to kind of turn around in these like these kind of experiences and so if you just ignore the experiences then there's less of a danger of being you could say seduced by a demon you know or seduce something which is off-key because you're just you're just kind of and you will have the spiritual experiences right you will but you just don't you don't spend your time on them and you don't you don't wallow in them you could say you rather keep your eye on the ultimate goal which is you know which is the union with the divide yeah yeah and even test your experience you know and see if it holds up over time if it still makes cohesive sense with the rest of your conception of yeah and also the fruits you know what you'll know a tree by its fruits that is that if you have these spiritual experiences but you're a total jerk and everybody around you and and it's like and you continue to to have all these sins in your in your life and all these things that are your obsessions and your you know your idiosyncrasies then that spiritual experience is pretty meaningless like it might have felt real and it probably was real but it's not moving you towards freedom it's not moving you towards something which is which is more than just a kind of like like an entertaining experience you could say yeah that's why integration is so important like the work that you do afterwards it's like kind of reading a book and not contemplating you know what i mean it'll just go right through your head except that it's a little bit it can be a bit more dangerous obviously going into these realms and let's say reading a book yeah but i think i think a lot of it has to do with like naivety like you know what i mean just overly trusting i found that the people who are the most trusting navigating through these spiritual realms without actually taking it seriously or like usually yeah just kind of young white hippie western people who've never really i don't know because i i grew up i've had some like kind of rough experiences and i've met people during my teenage years like who are very charismatic and they're very actually good looking and handsome and very you know what i mean they know how to talk to you and make you feel good but then you find out later that they're actually a snake but you can see them go out in the rest of the world like people being like oh he's such a nice person but then when you actually peek behind the curtain you're like yeah i know that guy johnny's a dick don't trust it kind of thing so there's a lot of yeah yeah that makes that makes that makes a lot of sense and i think you know i think there's also an aspect of materialism which is part of that which is that because we've been so hounded and we're hounded in school and we're told that the world is just a bunch of phenomena that can be calculated and be and be measured is that when people have an insight that there's actually something more then it's like whatever that more is they're all excited about it and they just want to dive in and they want to experience so it's like like you said it also the materialism leads to this lack of the sermon as well because it's like oh wow there's this whole world that that they lied to me about that actually does exist and so it's like open the doors open and it's like oh there's something there's something it's like this fast you know everybody's just excited about it but it's like now no wait a minute no no that's a that's a really bad thing like that's a demon and that's actually a projection of your passion and that's a it's like and so but it's at first people don't they don't have that capacity because there used to be complete materialists and so that's probably one of the problems that we have too you know it's yeah i i relate i went through that too yeah and it would even maybe even some people listen to this right now might be triggered for when people even say oh it's a demon like all right crazy christian fundamentalist what do you even mean by that i mean if demons it's saying the role of god anyway why does it matter yeah well people recognize that let's say let's let's give it a simple example let's say you're you're addicted to something i don't know yeah you you drink too much or i don't know whatever it is you watch porn or like you have this addiction right and you know that it's an addiction because it it because you can't control it right because you try to and then you can't and then he kind of pulls you and so that's a principality that that's that's also a principality that is it's it's a pattern in reality that is cosmic it's cosmic because you're not the only person with that addiction dude there are other people that also have that addiction i mean that that's not an idiosyncrasy to you it's not just relative to you it's an actual real pattern that exists in the world but in which you are participating and that that you are not only participating but that you by engaging in these bad habits and these bad behaviors you are feeding it you're sacrificing your time and your attention to this pattern and you're making it stronger in the world because you are you're like a you're a branch of it you're a body for it you're you know your tool for it to appear in the world right so it you don't need like a ghostbusters way of thinking like it doesn't have to be something like a woo-woo science fiction thing this is just cognitive reality of how things work so that principality has a cosmic version of it it has to because it it doesn't just exist in you it exists in all these other people people and so that's a demon and you can encounter it and you can be possessed by it and you can be a tool for it to spread in the world like have you ever met someone who has a bad habit and is obsessed with getting other people to participate in that very bad habit oh why they even know they even know that it's bad for them like if you if you pry them a little you know that it's destructive but nonetheless they want to get that young kid to smoke and they're they they secretly want to get these teenagers to drink or to do whatever it is that that they do and so they're they're they're a tool of this demon in the world it's a real thing i'm just getting flashbacks because like you it's so true like when people are so entrenched in their bad habit let's say whatever weed drugs and i've had these experiences where you're like i don't want any more it's like just have one man just have one just have one like they're like and they even kind of physically transform into that kind of orca demonic like this is that one come on man just have one and it's like dude no and then as soon as you try to break away from their lifestyle then they get like triggered and inflamed and like what do you mean what you think you're better than me you know it's like whoa whoa whoa man i just didn't want to do drugs that's all yeah no but you you've got the exactly that you've understood the right pattern and i don't so these so you can understand that let's say let's say think about this so there are principalities in the world that are trying to get your attention right there are some that are light and there are some that are dark and you know like all the good things all you know like loving your neighbor helping your friends you know being good to your spouse taking care of your children they're all these light these light patterns in the world and they are trying to kind of get your attention and you want to give your attention to them and then you have all these darker ones that are there as well now you can understand these these these patterns as just abstract patterns in the world but they we are conscious beings like we are persons and those patterns end up coagulating into something like persons as well and so that's why we then the same way that i encounter you a patterned thing in front of me right you're just a pattern but i encounter your face and your behavior as a patterned being that is the same for these higher principalities you know and so and so you can yeah you can like i said you can encounter them they can manifest themselves to you and sometimes in a more immediate way depending on people's sensibilities but even if they don't you can still understand that they're acting on you and and and you you know and like let's say i don't know if you've ever you kind of free yourself from a bad habit let's say yeah you have this bad thing that you're that you're dealing with and you're able to free yourself from it and then when you're kind of free from it you you're even like like who is that guy who is doing that you almost don't recognize yourself like you look at yourself and you're like who's that guy that was doing this like how is it that he was doing this and you're like you almost like you don't even there's something about it that you can't even bury that you can barely recognize it of course until the day that you're like in a weak spot and then all of a sudden you don't then again you don't know what's going on and it's like you know you wake up and you're like back in the in the pattern and you're thinking how did i get back here i thought i was out of this thing like i thought i wasn't in there anymore i said i'd never do this again and you're waking up with like 10 hookers around you drugs so you're like and you're like what like how did i get here exactly and so like but these experiences are real like that everybody's had them and so we can understand them just in terms of psychology but they're more than that and and you know ancient cultures and and and christian culture was able to recognize that this is not just idiosyncratic to you these have objective reality these patterns and they're ways to deal with them religiously and that something even like exorcism can actually have an effect on you in the same way that a coach why is it that a coach who speaks to you before a game would make you better at playing basketball do you think that's you don't think that's stupid well why does it bother you that maybe someone with authority could with spiritual authority could affect you in a way that would free you at least somewhat from that from these different bad patterns that you have so there are all these ways to kind of be able to look back and see again these rituals these practices that we see in in ancient culture and just see how they they're totally coherent they're not at all they're not strange the way they people told us they were yeah yeah definitely and what i really appreciate about the trinitarian view of god is that well three the number three is actually the number of reconciliations right transcends opposites and something i've been searching for so many years because no matter what world view i came to there was always this dialectical tension there's always this or is that hermeticism actually did a pretty good job of explaining like transcending duality and dark and lightness and all this kind of stuff and even in hermeticism they completely prove that you can't be god because of this this and this you know and i found that very interesting because in this world today we well either you don't believe in god or you believe you are god which is mathematically the same thing right yeah exactly no that makes a lot of sense and that's what you you end up seeing well we it's more like yeah we're we think we're like little gods you know and then we kind of act that way but usually if you observe someone who thinks that you realize that they're just they're just a series of possessed like they're just possessed by all these things you know yeah and you kind of see them pop up when you're looking when you're watching someone and all of a sudden you like oh oh oh here comes here comes this thing like here it comes and you gotta see it coming it's easier to see it in other people which is horrible right but yeah but it it's true you can see it you're with someone and all of a sudden you can kind of see something coming out you know of them some of some like obsession or some weird way of interacting with others like you for example like you know you you watch you know you have a friend a woman friend let's say and then you know you're engaged you're talking with her and then you go to a party and all of a sudden you see her like falling to like flirt mode and you're like what all of a sudden she's like a whole other creature space exactly everything about her and you're like what is this like who's what's going on this is like this being is is yeah is it's not the same being that i was dealing with you know an hour ago yeah that's why i like to just and constantly remind myself i'm just a human i'm always yeah i'm fallible i'm always gonna fall and this fight is actually quite freeing to think that way versus your you are your own garden you can basically bend reality to your will and i'm sure you can for a little while but i don't know man i feel like there's always a price for everything yeah it snaps back yeah the bill snaps back because yeah there's 98 of you that you're not aware of so much of who you are you're not aware of like you know in the orthodox tradition people wonder why that is but we we're constantly confessing sins that we don't realize we've done so we're constantly saying you know wittingly or unwittingly like yes confessing the sins that i've done you know on purpose or on accident because there are aspects of my being that i'm not even aware of and so people who think that they're that they're kind of like these little gods they don't realize that they have these little imps that are writing them and and so they they kind of act and and all of a sudden something happens like you know this this aspect of themselves that they hadn't accounted for you know kind of springs forth and yeah and then they get they get sideswiped you know so yeah that that's why community is so important you know having i say this all the time but i think it's gonna it's very important to have good friends that will call you out on your bs oh yeah you know being in your own lone world having spiritual experiences and yes gaining so much knowledge just inhaling all that wisdom and you just yes i'm god yeah exactly then you keep recreating that reality yeah yeah exactly and can't do normal human to human interactions yeah but i get it too but i actually really wanted to dive into the like the book your brother's book but just maybe for those who want to wear it what is heaven and earth he has a similar name he wrote a book called the language of creation and my brother and i we both kind of developed the symbolic thinking together when we were in our 20s and he i would say he's kind of a he's a part of superior symbolist than i am in terms of his kind of grasp of patterns and he's almost kind of mathematical in his in his in the way he sees things and so the way to understand heaven and earth is almost in an aristotelian way it's like there's actuality and potential and there's or you can see it like that there's invisible spiritual patterns and then there is the potential for them to manifest themselves in multiplicity and so that's what heaven and earth is it's light and darkness right the good way to understand that so light is that which reveals and then darkness is that which contains the the hidden bodies that will that will kind of sustain the light you could say or it's also let's say this idea of just invisible these invisible spirits like spirit is just wind in in terms of the words and so you have this kind of invisible movement and then you have the waters below let's say so that's what that's what heaven and earth is at least in scripture but not just in scripture it's the same heaven and earth that you find in uranus or god and gaia or that you find in in you know innate in the aboriginal cosmologies and all these different cosmologies it's it's a pretty universal idea yin and yang it's all that stuff and how do you how do you reconcile the kind of physical afterlife place of heaven of what it says in the bible yeah well the bible that doesn't say that you go to heaven oh there you go so there's a difference between paradise and heaven okay oh man i don't even think about those yeah yeah so so paradise is the garden of eden right and so paradise is the paradise is the place where the balance between heaven and earth exist it's the place between where the patterns and the their balance manifestation finds its its totality so christians don't believe that we go to heaven they shouldn't some people do but we believe it will be resurrected that that that the chris that humans will be resurrected and that they will become a perfect union between the invisible and the visible you could say that's the way to kind of understand the way that christians understand spirituality now you do see beings that go to heaven in scripture for example elijah ascends into heaven christ ascends into heaven and you see that you know saint paul talks about you know it seems like it's talking about himself saying that he went up to the third heaven and so heaven is this the place where identities come from and so it is possible for a being to let's say move into heaven so a way to understand it like let me give an example of being going into heaven so saints you could say to a certain extent ascend into heaven okay because then they become patrons of things and so let's say saint moves up into heaven and then now we have churches named after the saints people will inter ask this particular saint to intercede for them regarding certain things let's say saint mary of egypt for example so same mayor of egypt is the same people pray to when they're having sexual temptations and so she's become she's she is to a certain extent in heaven because now she's she's becoming like an angel in the sense that she's like an invisible pattern by which we now congregate that we come together and recognize and then we and then we also kind of ask for her to help us in this aspect of reality i don't know if that if that maybe helps to understand a little bit the difference yeah yeah interesting yeah because i never even thought about the distinction between like paradise and heaven but then there's also the like what your brother talked about in the book about how heaven is abstract principles basically and where the purpose of humans are to inform meaning with matter and express matter through meaning if i remember correctly yeah exactly yeah so that's exactly it so it's like a two-way street it's like you have these you have these principalities which are invisible and are patterns and then they find body in in potential but then it's also matter let's say kind of expressing those those principalities like you need both of them to kind of happen together because because the abstract principles are useless without expression yes can the soul live without a body or does it for it to exist that has to have some sort of it has to have some attachment to body at least at least kind of eschatologically like at least in the totality of things it has to be attached to a body except for of course god doesn't you can take everything is about like god's body is is the entire cosmos that's maybe a way to understand it but it but you know even the angels are said to have subtle bodies for example if they don't have material bodies but they have subtler bodies you know so a way to understand that is like a very simple way very simple simple way is that let's say you have an ideal and you're like you know i don't know you're you're some guy who's 250 pounds you know you you're watching tv and and you decide that you're going to become you know the sprinting champion of the world and then and it's like okay and you may i know you're 50 years old it's like that pattern that you're looking towards can't and be embodied by you it's actually not useful to you that pattern is useless to you that ideal that abstract let's say direction that you are aiming towards is is you can't embody it and so you would you have you always have to find this relationship between let's say the the principles or the ideals or the things we're aiming for and the capacity we have to embody them and you can't you can't make a car out of grass it's not the proper body for that pattern the body of the the body of of a car has to be able to express the car so matter has to express the principal and then principal and the car the idea of a car is useless unless you can drive it like i mean yeah it's nice to think about the idea of a car but unless you can drive it it doesn't it's not going to have much use to you so you have to be able to find reality is about finding the place where these things join together and how does how does christ join together between the material and the spiritual how does this how does a kind of triune god reconcile all these paradoxes that we have compared to let's say the idea of an impersonal god or pantheism things like this well the idea like if you think about it like a mountain you think about it like a hierarchy and that's part of the okay that's part of the this the way in which the world kind of lays itself out when i talk about the pattern of attention this idea of kind of moving even the idea of moving towards the one like as you're moving towards the one that's what you're doing you're you're moving out of quantity or or let's say condensing quantity so that you move up towards the towards the one which is at the top right that's that's where one is if the world is like a mountain so that point is something like ultimately cosmically it would be the fulcrum like the place where heaven and earth meets in a kind of absolute way and then all the other places that heaven and earth meet like the place where the idea of the car and the actual car need that would be somehow a consequence or down the hill from this ultimate place where heaven and earth meet and so that the idea is that that has different expressions in in in scripture you know the the mountain of paradise the mountain of moses where it goes up receives the law the tabernacle where you go into the holy of holies and you know you kind of you move from the quantity of the people into the one priest that goes into the holy of holies and then sees the glory of god so there are different versions of that in scripture and in not just in scripture but in every religious tradition there's all these different versions of it zigguratz you know all these different images and but then the idea that but christians are trying to help people see is that that ultimately is man first of all right we are the place where meaning and the invisibles we are like the laboratory where that happens it's kind of through us that meaning appears in the world and so that's the one thing that you realize in someone like christ is that ultimately man is that place where that happens but then that man let's say the man that has that position will also manifest something and what he'll manifest is that he'll actually fill up the whole hierarchy he won't just be the top he will actually contain the whole thing in himself and so if you want to understand the story of christ that's what it is that's why christ has to die that's why christ is all these things if you look at the way christ is represented he's you know he's all these opposites actually you know he's a he's described as a as a as a farmer in the sense of agriculturalist he's a he's also a shepherd he's the king is he's a priest he's a workman he's a slave he's a he's a he's a criminal he's every aspect of reality that is kind of packed into his story and then that that that kind of condensation of his story and then it also like he he fills the world up that's why he heals things like he's always healing disease he's always kind of let's say at the top of the mountain and then healing that which is below right going to the stranger well that's why he goes to prostitutes and publicans and all these marginal figures because he's going to the edge he's moving out and kind of gathering all things into himself yeah i won't go in he would drink with sinners trying to go into these bars and just go to the satan's den hang out with the homies meet and so he was either yeah he was able to do that without because he contains all of this in himself he was able to do that without losing himself you could say like let's say most of us if i went into a bar with a bunch of prostitutes then maybe i would lose myself there right maybe i wouldn't be the one to to bring the prostitute into into the love of god but i would rather you know find myself being dragged out into the into the den of hell and so that's the difference between the way that christ or when christ encounters the prostitute you know she ends up you know washing his feet out of compunction for her sins and and and you know wants to transform her life and so you see the same he goes to a tax collector who are these horrible corrupt officials you know and and when he encounters them they're like i'm gonna give my whole fortune to everybody and i'm going to you know i'm going to help the poor and i'm going to so it's like christ transform all transforms all these aspects of reality as he encounters them so it's not just about hanging out with with the with the people on the edge but it's actually about transforming everything and bringing it into himself so there's a million examples of how he does that but ultimately the death the death of christ and the resurrection ends up being the ultimate image of that like i said which is that he goes down to the bottom of reality he goes all the way down into death where everything is broken apart and everything is fragmented into its constitutive elements and he then gathers all that up and then rises up resurrects and then ascends into heaven right but now by ascending into heaven he's actually bringing everything into heaven with him so it's an image of gathering all of multiplicity all of death all of this everything into god and so that's the that's what the incarnation is about and it's something which ultimately happens in all eternity right it happened at a moment in history but it it's actually happening it's something which is the kind of a cosmic truth about how reality works it's not just something that happened it's actually revealing that you know lee could say that reality is already and always reconciled in god and that christ kind of manifested it at one point in the story but this is actually how reality works hmm there's a lot of you know old mythical stories of people you know dying resurrecting and all that kind of stuff but is christ at least the first claimed person to have fulfilled that story in actual reality i think so i don't think i've seen another story where it's not just that because people say he resurrected but christians don't just believe you resurrect we believe that he gathered all of death into himself and brought it up you know into the father and so it's like like i said there's no other story after that right it's like that's it like he basically went into death and then gathered all of it all of all the multiplicity all the way to the to the constituentive elements and then brought it up into heaven and so i don't think that i don't if anybody has an idea of another story like that besides the story of christ i don't i've never heard it yeah yeah i'd like to know if there is because it's really i find that symbolic story very interesting of you know christ's gone down to hades defeating death and all that kind of stuff because even people all around the world when they get to really hard situations and i've heard this of like an old one of my best friends who lives in chile they have crazy earthquakes and there was a time where he was like a materialist atheist socialist but then when that earthquake came and he thought he was going to die he went on his knees and prayed for jesus yeah and there's a lot of those kind of situations where people that they could be the most anti-christian person ever but man when you're in a crazy situation where you think you're gonna die who else are you going to call i just find i always found that part interesting and i think that's kind of what made me curious to at least explore christianity is that special place that christ has because people don't call for buddha if they're getting attacked by demons you know and it's just it's interesting because people even i actually want to talk to you about ufos because i found even that to be the case where certain people have a ufo experience they'll call that to christ and then disappear oh really yeah i've never heard that story i believe it i'm not surprised i think i haven't tested it but i've heard yeah exactly i mean it seems pretty obvious by now that there's at least a relationship between ufos and and kind of these dark these kind of dark principalities you know and and you and the relationship between ufos and and also psychedelics seems to be coming clear and clearer let's say you know and and it also it seems like it's also part of the story like it's have you ever seen alistair crowley's his demon like the the the the the creature that supposedly dictated several of his books it's is his demon is called eliaith it just looks like it yeah elia so a a-l-i-o-t-h and elias looks just like like a gray dude he looks like a gray and this is like this yeah and i think it's the first image of something like that that anybody had kind of ever seen but but he he has so he has this encounter you know and and crowley and the oto were we're really heart like they were trying to break things open like they were trying to kind of just remove the seals you know and i think they probably were successful revelations eh yeah and part of the chaos of what we're seeing is maybe this kind of this opening that they participated in and now there's a lot of this stuff kind of flooding through and so it's interesting that you say that that you've read stories of people who pray and then the ufo experience just vanishes i'm not surprised yeah same with sleep paralysis or bad psychedelic trips things like this and again these are people who you can't even say it's us placebo oh it's just bias because it's a lot of times it's coming from people who if anything they're anti-christian so it's like if any you know what i mean like it makes no sense for it to happen it's just funny like people imagine that imagine which is what you said and like i people people stop thinking it's like they say it's just placebo it's just biased it's like okay well then why don't you call it a spider-man and see what happens and see if it's just placebo it's like that's not how reality works it's not true maybe there's something placebo about it but placebo is not arbitrary even if that's part of it it's like you can't just call it to anything and then it'll work it's like no it has to be something that you believe in and that's something which is powerful enough to kind of be there in your story even though you deny it consciously and so and so and so the idea of just saying it's like oh it's arbitrary it's prejudice like okay dude you don't understand how these things actually work it's like no they're not they the reason why they would even work even using the placebo argument is not arbitrary right oh yeah 100 even the word just like oh it's just you yeah i know that word every time someone says that it's just that i'm like okay just a projection yeah i've caught you that's not it's not possible like think of think of the placebo effect you know think of of the placebo effect if you get if you get a placebo from your doctor right you know probably work but if like a homeless guy walks up to you on the street and gives you a pill and says this is going to cure your disease man like it's not gonna work all right yeah yeah it's not gonna work and so it's like placebo is not arbitrary it has a it has a has a structure and it has a it has a way it manifests itself and we can understand it and it's actually part of reality it's not it's not something that you can just put to the side and say this is not part of reality it is because it works like it actually works so foreign what do you think of these have you got delved deep into like these psychedelic entities that people go into like let's say have you heard of the dmt jesters no i know a little bit about this yeah i know about the machine elves a little more yeah what are your thoughts on that like what is that i find the machine elf i let's say i concept or the machine elf experience very it's fascinating because do you know like i do know about the the traditions of the book of enoch you know a little bit i don't i know a little bit about it i haven't read it completely but yeah so in the in the traditions of in the book of enoch the book of enoch is a book that was probably written in the second temple period and so it's like let's say a little bit before christ came but but refers to tradition before the flood it is a canonical so the story is that no i mean it's canonical in some it's canonical in the ethiopian church for example and and it remained kind of part of the it's quoted in scripture saint paul quotes the book of enoch several times so that so it's not it's not fully canonical but it's kind of part of the lord let's say christianity so in in the book of enoch you have the the descendants of cain they're the ones who develop technology by the way in scripture you see that that the descendants of cain are are the line which develop all technology so music and then the arts and then cities and and then metallurgy and weapons all of this is developed by kane but in the book of enoch you it expands on the idea that you know it says the sons of god went into the daughters of men and then from that spawn giants so in the book of enoch the idea is that these demons these spiritual entities come and they teach technical skills to humans they teach them how to make metal they teach them how to how to make weapons they also teach the magical skills like necromancy and they even teach them interestingly enough like they teach women how to wear makeup which is very interesting because it has to yeah it has to do with seduction and it also has to do with kind of this using using a covering to enhance something which is what technology is technology is basically makeup you could understand it out it's like it's it's like adding something to you in order to give you more power right you can understand because once you understand what makeup is it can actually help you kind of get it what technology does so so these demons appear to the or it doesn't say how but they mix with humans somehow okay and then they teach these skills of making technology and weapons and and and makeup and all these things and that is and the chimera is important too so they they teach them how to make hybrids like different kind of hybrids human animal hybrids and you know different different animal hybrids and that kind of the excess of that is what leads to the flood it's like basically things just break down and then here comes the the flood to kind of recapture the world and so the machine elves are super interesting because it just seems like it's playing out it's playing out the story of enoch and slaying out a book that was written thousands of years ago where people encountered these beings and these beings teach them or show them technological or technical patterns that some i guess some people are able to kind of apply in the world and and so it's like the idea that our technology comes from aliens is actually even though like the way that they do it in on the history channel is completely stupid and and ridiculous the trope of thinking that our technology comes from aliens is not completely stupid if we understand aliens as as just these these kind of beings that that are able to kind of manifest patterns to people without discernment and then we kind of move into these these these kind of technological yeah so so i think that it's very fascinating because it seems to be playing along with what's going on and ai is definitely part of that you know the idea of these kind of embodied intelligences mechanically embodied intelligences it's like all of this stuff is moving towards something like what we saw in in the pre-flood narratives you know seems like it and i've had experience with these kind of i don't know if they'll machine elves but basically it was all of evil and darkness composed into one being but it had all these mechanical parts like this kind of soulless mechanistic just i don't know like no free will determinism but evil yeah it's really it's really bizarre but when because when i've gone through these experiences i i noticed then that these principalities it's like they're more fundamental than us you know what i mean it's like a layer before creation or something like that i don't know i might be crazy even saying this but it really does feel so overwhelmingly real that i understand why people kind of get into it but there's also of course the dark side of it and you should be grateful that i tapped into the dark side early on and not you know what i mean not tagged along until later in life so yeah that you that you kind of saw it and said okay well i need to think about this yeah it's like basically hell scared scared me back into heaven sort of thing he's like oh okay i want to go like whatever the opposite direction is to that i'm going that way and just live normal life you know just human human life day to day yeah i think i think that's very important to be grounded you know because i think when you get too lost in these spiritual dimensions without having the grounding it can be more dangerous you know any spiritual practice i feel yeah you know i feel like even christianity could be dangerous if you don't have that grounding and i've seen it with people oh you're right with people who get too inflamed with pride or something like that and they become self-righteous like that typical you know i don't say that yeah but even the mystical practice of the church like in the orthodox church we have a mystical practice which is called hezikasm or the jesus prayer and it's a and it's a prayer which is repeated and then it's also coupled with a breathing with a kind of with a breathing which rhythms the prayer you know okay and how do you do this is this just a quick thing is it like you breathe in you say half the prayer and then you breathe out yeah yeah okay and so this is like this is really kind of the the basic structure of of of orthodox mysticism and everybody does the jesus prayer like everybody prays that but there is an idea that some people will will pray that jesus prayer in a manner that they become or the prayer enters into their heart and that they actually kind of the prayer takes over their being and that they they kind of become just a prayer and so there's even this idea that at some point your heartbeat rhythms with the prayer and that your heartbeat becomes the the prayer and so the fathers will say don't do that like if you don't have a guide like if you don't have someone to guide you like do not do this it you will become insane like it will lead you to insanity if you go in this direction if you try to kind of do to pray without ceasing like to just kind of because this is the idea that they try to do is they try to the monks basically try to become constant prayer where their entire being is kind of caught up in this in this prayer and it leads to illumination it leads to theosis to basically being knighted with god but they tell you like don't do it without him without a guy because it's super dangerous and it and it'll make you drive you crazy and monks go crazy people you go to you go to these these monasteries you know let's say marathos and you'll just meet crazy monks monks who lost their mind because they just weren't they became prideful or they just weren't being they didn't they didn't accept to be guided or they just did their own thing and then well it's funny how that that attitude is so universal because even in the psychedelic well let's say with ayahuasca a lot of people like no don't you dare do this without a shaman and then even to go beyond that it's like you've got to be very careful which shaman you choose because again you're even in these new age practices most reasonable people are aware that you are opening doors you know what i mean and you have to be very careful with what slips through and even if something seems good it might not be good it's hard to know like how can you explore these realms smartly and safely or is it one of those best not to mess with that kind of stuff well it just depends on who you are as a person i mean i've never i've never done psychedelics all right it's like i i can't speak from experience i i feel like let's see from it from a more traditional perspective it's definitely more on the dangerous side in the sense that the idea of a real spiritual practice is to is to be transformed right it's to actually rise up in the hierarchy being is like through humility not through pride but like through humility and practice and and and spiritual discipline that you actually become more like the angels become more like god and so it's not so much to just have these experiences of this world but rather to kind of participate and rise up in in the in the hierarchy of being you would say you see this image called the ascent of the divine ladder where you see monks going up a ladder and there's christ above christ is the goal right you were we're actually aiming towards christ to become like him to be united with him and then they're angels that are kind of helping along the way but then there are also demons you see it in the image like these demons are like pulling the monks down and they fall into like the mouth of hades at the bottom of the image and so yeah their idea is not to either experience the angels or experience the demons right their idea is to aim towards the transcendence aim towards christ aim towards the place where heaven and earth meet and then you will encounter them along the way but but that's not the per that's not the point and so the problem with with i think with a lot of the psychedelic stuff is that people can rip open the veil and then move into this world and they have these experiences but they're not better people but they're not more they're not freer from their from their own demons they're not free or from their own passions and so yeah so they're more in danger than they would be if they if they would just kind of stay in the normal world and why say that but look i'd be honest with you i know several people that that that did psychedelics and then convert it and then just became christian yeah it's not like i've heard that that's that's the thing that throws a wrench in the whole thinking about this because i don't i don't have a necessarily a strong opinion of psychedelics of this or that because they're so mysterious and they have so many different outcomes for different people however i would say that at the state that humanity is right now it probably would be more dangerous than it is good but i don't know if that's necessarily the psychedelics themselves but just where humans are because we're very prideful and very naive and can fall into these traps you know and also because we're materialists and and so i can see it like i can totally see it because it's like for all my love jordan peterson like i love jordan peterson you know but but i think that this is one of the dangers that he's falling into it's because it's easy to you can you can analyze it right it's a mushroom it's like here's the chemical formula right here's the thing it's right there just take it you eat it and there you go so it's like it's super easy so so the most materialist the most scientific person can say like this is like it's it's it this this works it's a pill you take it you have this experience you can analyze it you can calculate it you can you can look at the person's brain you can see their waves whatever is going on and so and so it seems like it kind of material is shortcut you know to the spiritual life but i think that that's also why why it's a problem like i think that that's why it's a problem is because you know look at look at even like at the way that i don't know if you saw that discussion you had with the guy who wrote this this what is it like i forget what it is there's something about how mushrooms are at the source of our religions or whatever some book about that oh yes i actually had him on yeah yeah the immortality came is that right i think that's maybe that's what it is i don't know but look at look at what they're doing it's like so so think of the mysteries of releases you eluses for example right so you have this entire ritual that lasts several days and is extremely engaging and is like sworn to secrecy you're not allowed to talk about it there's a whole thing around the entire mystery of the lucius and then maybe at some point in this thing where they come let's say to the to the edge of it then there's a substance involved in the experience but now the materialist wants to just say no that ritual stuff it's all  it's the it's the mushroom yeah it's the mushroom dude formula that i can analyze and that i can show you and that i can i can measure and i can and so and so it's it's just such a materialist way of looking at reality that even if maybe in some in in some cultures psychedelics were part of the process of transformation of the person the idea that they were the central part of it is complete nonsense hmm it's complete nonsense and and it and it's and it's super dangerous and it's such a it's like a materialist way of approaching you know these these these ancient myths these stories these these patterns of transformation and and i anyway so i i tend to really be very cynical about about this stuff hmm well even kyle young was cynical about it and it's because it's funny because even myself a lot of psychedelic people quote calum like he's a lord and savior but even he's like yeah beware of unead wisdom don't do psychedelics pretty much you didn't say those exact words he did say deserve unearned wisdom but he was very but then again man he went through like a 10-year psychosis so he's like yeah i don't need to open any more doors i'm good yeah definitely definitely yeah he also had i think that problem where he wasn't he didn't accept to be guided you know hmm and and there are there are stories about young like you know even like from even not even from a not a christian perspective you know there are stories of him you know going to india but all but then refusing to even to be guided by the supposed masters that he encountered there and that he wouldn't even meet with them like he was just he's a scientist like in the end he ended up and i think that that he didn't like yeah he just he was never like he he i don't think he ever ended up being either a practicing christian or an initiate of anything he was just someone from the outside who was trying to explain these things and then got cracked open you know just got cracked open is the only way to see it could you imagine that like going to bed sleeping with a revolver under your pillar and having these attacks by these entities every day i'm surprised they didn't like end up killing himself man that's like yeah that sounds like hell to me but i'm glad that he got some knowledge out of it and came out the other side thank god yeah yeah yeah well yeah it is what it is yeah jonathan i would love to just finish this off because i know that you make a lot of videos about like symbolism unpacking movies and stuff do you ever do video games it's funny because everybody's asking to do video games forever and you should and then i did i did a video it was probably because it it's also maybe i didn't approach it the proper way i thought i thought okay so what what i should talk about in early video game to show the pattern and kind of how it was there from the beginning let's say even the more complicated games like superman yeah so actually so i did it on donkey kong because i was moving towards like the old school donkey club i did it a video on a video on donkey kong and it just totally bombed like nobody watched it and then it discouraged me for because i wanted to do it on donkey kong and then do it on super mario as a kind of second a second step to show how it's all there in donkey kong but then it kind of unfurls into mario and then to say mario becomes the becomes like the template for basically all the games we have now but but yeah but then i just never made the second video because it was because it was a lot of effort to kind of to to put it together and to write it and to edit it and then so you can find it the donkey kong video if you want i i think it was pretty good like i was happy with it but maybe i will like i might do it maybe maybe you can even do like a something that i would enjoy anyways seeing you do like a reaction video to one of the more popular games like skyrim or something like one of these epic kind of fantasy worlds that people are completely obsessed with that have really cool stories and symbolism yeah well i think that like elder scrolls i think they definitely do a good job at kind of containing a world like they they present a world that is that is quite is both very diverse but also coherent enough that it really fits in that almost it fits a little bit in that kind of tokian a token is the one who's set by the way token is the one who set the map for all of these things like especially for especially for the the the fantasy video games or the world building video games it's really tolkien you kind of set the standard for that but but for sure in in elder scrolls they do a good job at let's say embodying it you know so so yeah i think so but it's just hard because let's say something like skyrim it's like it's so big it's like sometimes it's like this huge huge game even the story itself is really big and so i think i think it'd be difficult to do like a kind of oh break it down maybe like do breaking down like literally one mission of a certain story you know what i mean yeah maybe just choosing one and then i think it could explode skyrim is very popular you're very good at unpacking these kind of myths so this night you don't have to do anything but it's something no no no no no no nobody it's not it's something that it's been obviously people have been asking me to do video games for for a while for a long time and so who knows maybe i don't know it's possible it's also it's like there's so many things to do too so it's hard to it's hard to sometimes decide what i'm gonna do yeah i know you want to do all these things at once yeah why why do people play something that'd be fascinating is why do people are obsessed with horror games and stuff like that like why do people get out of the way to pay money to scare the crap out of themselves so why do people why do people act like by heart yeah just on horror in general it's something that's been yeah very fascinating for me okay well horror like horrors how can i say this horror is a reality there's there's a relationship there's a little bit of relationship between something like sacred space and horror in the sense that horror is a category is always a category which transcends the rational but horror is like the irrational which just kind of smashes against the right like that primal adrenaline sort of thing yeah but also it's like something which is is unreasonable right it's it doesn't make sense right the even the idea of a mass killer doesn't doesn't make sense and then the more imagistic versions of that i don't like evil dead or whatever like these kind of these kind of this encount with these these really really kind of irrational forces that are extremely cruel and that are extremely violent and and that are basically will just destroy the world it's something that it's something that is that can make us peek into the idea that there's something beyond the rational right it's called it's kind of like in the it's kind of like in the wrong direction you could say but not totally because if you look at christianity horror is part of the sacred right the cross is in part it's not just horror but it's it is horror horror is in the cross there's other things going on in the cross but but horror is there and so i think the difficulty with horror is that it it's just in one direction let's say it's more about kind of encountering the monsters on the edge of the world you could say something like that yeah yeah so but but i but it's not it's not completely it's not it's understandable because if you if you read even the idea of there's a relationship between awe and terror okay just in the experience so think about like i mean you can imagine it like just in a primordial experience of kind of encountering a giant warrior right and this giant warrior like steps out in front of you and you're like i know you're 11 year old boy it's like six foot five massive warrior with a helmet like just steps out in front of you it's like you're gonna be a lot of things you're gonna feel a lot of things when that happens you're gonna feel scared impressed overwhelmed like let's say frozen in front of this like this this revelation let's say and so you get so that's when you can kind of understand this idea of the relationship between let's say the terror of encountering god or encountering an angel you know the reason like the joke on the internet right right the biblically accurate angels like there's something about that that is that the angel says when the angel says be not afraid the reason why he's saying be not afraid is because he's scary as hell okay it's like whoa the angel appearing to you is something like a breaking open of normal space and just like this like rushing in of of this trans-rational space and so there is an aspect of it which is which is going to be kind of terrifying and so it's normal i think so that's why you hear the angels say that because it's like they're also trying to signal to you which which side of this let's say which side of this encounter that you're dealing with you know oh that's so true man those biblically accurate angels are like whoa that's like yeah they're not really they're going on purpose to like make them really wild but like in in the in the orthodox version of angels you kind of you see a something of that right you do have the image of the cherub with the four heads and then the these these wings with eyes on them so these are iconographic like they're iconographic versions of these of these beings or like the wheels with wings and eyes and stuff but some of the means like they just go on purpose to make them look almost like yeah it's like there's a little bit of a sensationalism let's say in that for sure for sure yeah yeah anyways jonathan i'll won't leave you any longer i really appreciate you coming on the podcast we had some very
