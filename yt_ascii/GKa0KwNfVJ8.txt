ever since i wrote my first line of code my dream was to code a tax startup from scratch after i had left my corporate job as a softw engineer disappointed at the lack of challenge and real impact i figured that the natural next step in my career was to try to build something of my own but after months of building various different projects i still didn't have an idea that i thought i had enough potential and i felt completely stuck that was until a friend of mine from high school reached out to me and pitched this idea of an app that would allow you to or organized your entire computer work into these boxes which would house everything from tabs apps and files at first i was confused but then i was like this sounds like a really good idea and i realized that this is something that just had to exist because i really wanted to use this myself so after some thinking i was sold and i decided to scrap all the projects i was working on on my own and joined our new company boxio but little did i know that this was going to be by far the hardest thing i have ever done in my life there were many moments when i seriously doubted if it was even possible possible to make a big vision into reality what the hell is going on and to make things even harder we had to be fast because investors notoriously only want to invest in companies that are able to see results very quickly i even did all of this while traveling across five different countries more on that as we go through the story so in this video i want to tell you this entire journey of how we built a tech start up in 3 months did we succeed am i now a tech billionaire and of course what is happening next with the company but before we get to that we need to go back all the way to the [music] beginning so i started working on boxio in june but our story actually starts a full 6 months before that in january so the situation was that i just left my corporate job as a software engineer more about that on this video i figured that since my content business was already generating tons of money i could use that to give me the time and freedom to work on my other coding projects as well that i could hopefully turn into a startup without having to worry about income come in the meantime but it turns out yeah it wasn't that easy the original idea that i was mainly working on just wasn't something where i saw enough potential to war me spending the time on that rather than just expanding my existing content business and also building an entire startup on my own again turns out was not that easy so i was sort of in this situation where i was building stuff but i was still really sort of waiting for the right idea to go all in and that opportunity ended up coming completely randomly out of the blue when i met up with an old friend of mine from high school for coffee where he mentioned that he had this idea that he had already iterated quite a few times and made some designs for it and he just needed someone to help him build it at first i was still hesitant after all if i went all in on this new company i would risk losing tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in opportunity cost over just expanding my existing content creation side of thing but i knew that at some point in my life i did want to work on a real startup and this was by far the best idea i had come across so far and if they succeeded the potential would be just absolutely huge so i informed my friend that yes i am in our first challenge was that my co-founder was based in finland where i had planned to spend the entire summer in london so when we started working at the company we were working remotely and to our surprise they actually worked really well and it was good practice for remote work in general because we knew that in the autumn i was going to be going back to dubai which is where i live nevertheless after 2 weeks and open zoom calls i did end up booking a plane ticket to helsinki for a month as we figured it would be much easier to build the first version of the app while working in person so i rented some shitty place in helsinki and our plan was to spend 12 hours a day just writing code to get our prototype over the line as fast as possible and that is exactly what we did and it turns out that building an app like this from scratch was not that easy there was so many technical difficulties straight away for instance we of course don't have a low-level access to the operating system of mac os so we were have to build all kinds of more or less questionable workarounds for example we stumbled upon this genius idea of using these things called apple scripts that basically allow you to give commands this like really weird apple specific sort of pseudo programming language which i thought it was a good idea okay but like it wasn't and yeah it didn't work so we ended up losing a full two weeks of work as we had to rebuild our entire architecture to use something more robust like for example a chrome extension to speak to the browser and other window management libraries in node.js we still have trauma apple scripts but despite this after all we managed to get our prototype together and anyone we showed it to was really excited there was clearly enough interest to warrant us to keep going but as any entrepreneur would know it turns out that asking people if they would use your app is the worst possible way to figure out if your idea is actually good or not and the mistake we made is that we relied too much on like asking whether people would use it rather than actually giving it to as many people as possible like if you ask your mom if she likes your idea like she's always going to say yes right yes of course love i love your idea of an ai powered toilet seat i would definitely use it but is that something to rely on well of course not your mom your friends even strangers will always tell you your idea is good not because it actually is but because they just want to be nice so while the initial feedback was promising we knew that the only way to understand if our app actually had potential was to actually give it to people and see if they would actually use it and it turns out this is where the next sever problems came in well the app worked well under perfect circumstances any software engineer will know that the circumstances are never actually perfect what the hell is going on like it's making a sound what the hell man watching someone download and use our first prototype was sort of like watching a giraffe riding on roller skates on thin ice the smallest wobble and everything would crash people were scared to open the first version because like windows would be flying across the screen and stuff like yeah it was it was a humbling moment let's just say that and it was at this moment when i really started to realize what a ridiculously difficult task we had given ourselves to build an entire desktop app that is communicating with your browser with your file system with your app system like everything all at the same time i honestly did not know if we could even make this app happen technically let alone turning into a profitable business on top of this it was now the end of august and i had booked to go and live in thailand for a month we had to now fix all of these while i was going to be working remotely at this point we realized that our workloads were becoming bigger and bigger and bigger and we needed help and this is when we found our third and final co-founder julia to take over all the marketing and operational tasks that company and man was that massive help for the first time we developed a systematic way to start unboarding test users and to collect feedback from them and we even started having meetings with potential advisers and investors while i did my best to take some time off to explore thailand and all these kind of things most of my time was spend on coding at least i had a pool to do it from so on the engineering side we had to sit down and prioritize which customer type did we really want to optimize the app for and what features did we actually want to include in the first public version of the app because one one thing we had neglected was focusing on the essentials we had all these ideas for things we wanted to include like these kns to halves at the star you should not try to fit every feature idea in you can't because otherwise you will never actually get the software to the point where you can release it to a wider range of people to really start getting feedback so we made some big decisions and decided to temporarily ditch a lot of very important features and instead we opted for systematically gathering feedback from our users and using that as our guide for what to build next but most importantly instead of new features we focused on making the user experience of the current basic version as good as possible we created a public weight list with a form for anyone to sign up as a test user and honestly i was terrified like what if no one signs up what if no one actually wants to use the app that we have been spending the past 2 and 1 half months working on at this point i had left thailand and i ended up taking a two week detour to work out of wei works in singapore i eventually went back to dubai and on my way back i honestly didn't not know if this was ever going to work out but what i did know that i was damn proud of the progress we had made so far in the summer but now everything depended on if we could get signups for people to use the app and at first it was quiet but then we got our first sign up and then a second a fifth a 10th a h 100th and quickly we had to close our test user form because we had filled our capacity because at the time we were manually onboarding every user by a call and from my users the feedback started coming in but with less than a week until our first public lod we still had a lot of issues to solve we had no automatic on boarding flow we hadn't even incorporated a company yet and a lot of our integrations were not even approved yet freaking google like why do you always have to take so long to approve everything anyway and with only a week left until our target date of when we wanted to have this app public i still did not know if we were ever going to be able to get this over the line in time so after all the hardship all the learnings all the bugs the errors the embar embarassing feedback the humbling conversations with other entrepreneurs more experienced than me at the end of it all we made it and with that this is boxio it is a sidebar that you install on your mac or pc that allows you to organize your tabs files and tools into boxes you can open and close with one click when you open boxio this is what you see you can start by creating a box for a project or a task let's let's say for a specific coding project or a course that you're following for example then when your box is open all your tabs that you open in your browser get automatically tracked inside of the box and in the future this will also include files apps and other tools that you have open on your computer and the reason we did this is because the biggest problem that i've noticed in my own work as both a content creator and a software engineer is that there's so many distractions out there it's really tough to focus on your work when you've got all these different things open on your computer and nothing's really organized and when i want to start working on something i need to manually go and open all the different tabs and files and stuff that i need but with boxio you don't have to do that best of all you get all of these and free updates for the lifetime of the app for a recurring payment of absolutely nothing that's right the app is completely free to use oh but thomas how do you make money if the app is completely free so our plan with boxio is to use a very generous premium model where in the beginning all the core features are completely free with some premium modules that you can pay for if you need them we're still developing those so for now everything is just completely free but now i need your help if what i just told you resonates with you go download boxio below and please if you know this box which i guarantee you will not please use that feedback button down below to let me know by the way it's the kind of app you're supposed to keep opening the background at all times so don't close the app when you stop working because you're going to lose all the benefits just close the box you're in and close the sidebar so you don't have to look the biggest lesson from my journey of building the first version of boxio is that building gray software is freaking damn hard and so this is for you if you're looking to build something like this yourself whatever time and effort you think it will take for you to do this expect it to take five times that and that is precisely why i love this game because i love trying to win the hardest games possible and believe me there is no harder game than startup entrepreneurship or maybe i'm just a masochist i probably am go try a boxio below thank you for watching and i will see you in the next video on my startup journey i'll see [music] you
