so let me start by asking you a question, you're the numberphile guy: what is a number? (brady: a number is an abstract 
way to represent) (a quantity.) that's a very good answer.
- (i just thought of that!) it's a very good answer. i spent i think most of my phd years thinking about the answer to that, and that's more or less what i had.
- (you should- you should) (have given me a call!) (i would have told you!) you're a hard man to reach. (okay, good answer) (okay. are we right? 
what is a number?) right, so as you said it's just an abstract thing that represents quantity. now if you ask somebody they might tell you, you know, by giving examples. so what is a number? well 0 is a number, 1 is a number, 42 is certainly a number okay? what about half? oh okay half is a number. minus 3 over 8 is a number; wait what about the square root of 2? oh that's also a number. what about pi? you know, what about e? all of these things are numbers. what about i? what about the square root of -1 right? oh that's imaginary, that's not a real number. 
so i is also a number right? it's just not one that makes sense to you sort of as a human; but in electric engineering they use i to talk about electricity flow and stuff like this so i is also a number. you can use other things as numbers right, but that still doesn't really answer mathematically speaking what's a number? now i'm gonna give it away, i don't have an answer to that, there is no answer to that. but what can a number be? so for example a number, if you want to have a strict foundation of mathematics; you want to say i'm going to start with, you know, one thing and build math on that. this is going to be a bit controversial, but the the de facto standard nowadays is set theory with the
zermelo-fraenkel axioms - or zfc - with the action of choice. we're not going to go into 'oh that's the the only one'. it's not the only one, there's a lot of different ones, but zfc is one of the main foundations of modern mathematics. first of all what is a set? a set is a collection of mathematical objects right? this could be numbers, or other sets and so on. in set theory everything is a set. so if you think about numbers you're thinking about sets. now that sounds odd for a lot of people because you're not used to this, but if you think about computers then a letter is a number. a picture file is also a number, so all these things are represented using other things, it's just a matter of you know coding stuff into a system. so a lot of times you will see something that says- so let's say that the number zero is the empty set. so this is the set that has no elements, nothing in it, think about an empty bag. let's say that we already have defined the number n, so the next one is just going to be whatever n was defined and we add to it n itself. so 1 is going to be just zero, which is just the empty set, and 2 is going to be zero and 1 - right, because we had zero and we add 1 itself, which is empty set and this. so what would 3 be? 
well {0, 1, 2} and this just goes on. so in effect a number is just 0, all the way to n minus 1. 
- (so why is 1) (the empty set? i thought zero was the) (empty set?)
- so this is the set whose element is the empty set, so it's a bag containing a bag containing nothing. (okay. so all numbers are just bags) (of nothing? it's just how many nothings) (have you got?)
- kind of. but now we get tricky. so this is just the natural numbers, so 0,1, whatever - what's half? what's minus 1, right? all of these things are not represented here. so now you can start, you know, let's call it going a bit crazy with this. and you can say, okay, i'm going to define a collection of natural numbers and say, this one represents you know -1. and another collection that represents -2 and so on and so on, and then you can take those and make- you know, use this to represent the fractions. and then you can use all kind of constructions to, you know, go from there and get the real number. so for example, after i defined all the natural numbers, let's call this n, how do i get to z, which is the integers? so this is also -1, -2, -3 and so on. just for clarity, 0 is a natural number, this is also a very you know contentious point so; it is. all right, let's just clarify that. (i'll put your email address 
down there.) how do we get from here to here? well for example, so you want to get from the natural numbers to the integers. so one way to think about this is to sort of think about pairs of numbers. so i have a pair, let's call them x and y, and another pair, let's call this x prime and y prime; and i want to think that they represent the same thing if x plus y prime is x prime plus y. so for example let's put in 0 and 1, this would be x and y, and this would be 3 and 4. let's see if i was right: that's zero plus 4 equals 3 plus 1. so this is 4; so i was right, everything works. these two things are kind of the same, so let me you know put this approximate, not exactly equal right? and you can use this now to say, okay, let's look at all of these pairs of numbers that have this kind of thing and let's call all of these -1. so -1 is now really just all the pairs of numbers (x,y) such that (0,1) is the same as (x,y). and now i can extend the addition from the natural numbers to this. so -2 would be (x,y) such that (0,2) is the same as (x,y) under this weak equality. that, you know, gives you a way to define -1 and so on. but you can also redefine 0, so 0 is now (x,y) where (0,0) equals this (x,y); which if you think about this just means that x equals y. so that's zero but hang on, zero is the empty set. and now i'm saying it's not the empty set - it's this collection of pairs. and here's the important thing, it's just coding. you just have to decide how you code your numbers right. so you say, okay i'm starting from this, i'm building the system up and then at the end- so from this you can continue and define the rational numbers, the real numbers, the complex numbers, whatever. and you can say, let me end this at the complex numbers, right, so i went from this to the rational numbers - so half, -3/8 whatever - and from here to the real numbers with pi, and the square root of 2, and from here to the complex numbers with i and whatever. so i can say, okay, let me define all of these number systems and each of those has sort of a canonical way that the previous one mapped into that. so now i have a canonical way of putting the natural numbers into the complex numbers. so the empty set is now, you know, moved here to this particular set and then to that particular set, whatever i end up here, moved to this particular set, move to that particular set. now i can decide that the natural numbers are not this thing; actually whatever i ended up with as the copy in this one. so what's a number from a mathematical, let's say, objective reality? it's whatever you want it to be. (like a really popular question that) (everyone always asks on the internet is:) (do numbers exist or were numbers) (invented? or are they- 
do they just exist) (in the world? presumably you think) (numbers are very much) (a human invention?) well philosophically speaking i'm very agnostic, i don't want to have any concrete set of beliefs because beliefs lead you to being sure that you're right and, you know, you can't really know. the point here is that numbers exist within a context and if you're thinking about set theory as your context then numbers are whatever you decide to mean- whatever you decide that numbers mean in this context, whatever coding you want. you want the standard coding for the natural numbers, do you want to go into the complex numbers? you can use different sets; you can use you know the empty set to say, i want the empty set to be 5 and i want zero to be some other set. it's fine, right? it's all about coding and the the important thing - and this is where you know zfc as a set theory has a lot of power - is that it just shows that whatever coding you did, if it satisfies the basic properties that you think of for the natural numbers, it doesn't matter. you can always translate this to that and vice versa. so it's like if you have something written in ascii and something written in unicode, you can just move between those two, you know, let's say in english without all the emoji symbols right. so you can just move between those two encodings and that's fine. (could mathematics- could) (you know, modern thought 
have exist- could) (exist without numbers? 
like were numbers) (necessary? or was it just one of the) (paths we could have taken to reach where) (we are now?) so it's a good and interesting question; i don't know. but they're so natural. but here's something that people forget: sets are also as natural. you know, people like to say, oh you know numbers started when you know like caveman was hunting a mammoth and was like, okay there are two mammoths and two of us so it's the same quantity. but to understand that there are two mammoths you need to understand the collection of mammoths, and that's the basic of set theory right? so the basic is not just numbers, it's numbers and sets; or arguably numbers and types or numbers in some sort of, you know, collections. and it's just so natural, you know i don't see how we could have gone without coming up with numbers. ....transcendental numbers. 
and so a lot of the number categories refer to in or out of these different sets. so rational numbers are everything inside the blue line, irrational numbers are everything outside the blue line.
