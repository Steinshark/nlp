ladies and gentlemen prepare to be amazed that sentence on a gotham chess video could mean that i'm about to show you 200 elo chess but it also could mean that i'm about to show you 3700 elo chess the games that i will show you momentarily are from the t-c the top chess engine championship superfinal season 25 and they are between stockfish and leela chess zero the two strongest chess engines in the world watching these two fight is a spectacle there is really nothing quite like it and top chess engine championship usually operates where the engines are given an opening that they play against each other with white and with black that's called a pair now stockfish does win a lot of these matchups but they're getting closer and closer and in this video i'm going to uncover the secret of how to beat stockfish how lea chess zero manages to beat stockfish i'm going to show you three games in the first game it's one of the most unbelievable end games i've ever seen in my life the second game is maybe the best positional game i've ever seen in my life and the third game is leela defending perfectly using all of stock fish's attacking momentum and turning it back against stockfish just that's all i have for you i mean just just just enjoy this you know so many people enjoy these computer chess videos that i make that they come up to me at like book signings i mean i can't tell you how many people probably like 30 people at this point have come up to me like while we're talking i'm signing their book and they go you got to make more chess computer content like ai like leela stuff people love this stuff so enjoy leela in the first game opens with ponto d4 and black plays knight f6 and i will be telling you at which point they left theory like when they started thinking on their own and when the pre-programed stuff disappeared c4 e6 knight f3 b6 so already a commitment white has played the standard d and c pawn opening right excuse me and black played knight f6 e6 black could have played g6 but at top computer level i mean it's it's generally better to bring out this this bishop and now white has an option to play knight c3 trying to play e4 and then black of course would play bishop b4 but this is not a human game this is an a computer game so they are pre pre-programmed knight f3 and now black can play d5 black can play the b o indian that's actually called the bogo indian but i prefer to put a z there cuz i think it's funny b6 is the queen's indian defense black will either play here or here targeting that pawn that that yeah that pawn knight c3 bishop to b7 white plays bishop g5 developing and pinning black plays bishop e7 developing and blocking the pin and by the way if you're like watching this as a beginner or early intermediate do you notice how like every move they're getting a piece out like nobody nobody's going i'm going to take the kn cuz i think night you're tricky like try to copy how these 3700 elo things play you know if you're watching this as a beginner like if this is not what your games look like you're doing something wrong not these things white plays e3 and now black has many choices here but black plays knight to e4 a pre-programmed move trying to solve things early in the game breaking some principles of chess repeating multiple moves with a piece that's already been developed but black's trying to trade knights and black is trying to trade bishops leela takes the knight inducing the bishop to come forward and now a standard practice here would be to get the bishop off the board well after you deal with this now interestingly leela does not take i think nine out of 10 players under 1500 here would just take this bishop because you just took this and like why would you waste time and go backwards right well there would you of course you would just lose but no actually bishop f4 it's very interesting so leela just says no i actually you know my my bishop is good and in the long term it's slightly more active than your bishop so computers already at this point know this type of stuff even though we are in of course like the book bishop d3 trying to trade this trade is bad for black because black ends up having some light squared weaknesses this trade is probably even worse for black because black has the light squared weaknesses and white has a bishop to attack with so in the game black plays bishop to b4 check and actually leela plays king f1 like le and again we're still in like the book but the point is that white's king is completely safe white's king is totally safe black doesn't have enough space black doesn't have enough pieces and firepower in fl in fl in fact black has to trade a bishop black has no pieces anymore like black has all the pieces back there that still have to develop and now the bishop comes back again and now leela plays h4 which is a really interesting move securing control over g5 right you're trying to play knight g5 create an attack because your rook is still on the h file you also want to play g3 and king g2 maybe in the future or maybe h5 h6 right advancing the pawn all the way knocking on black store if the position opens white will have a big attack if the position stays closed we know from these if you've watched any computer videos in the past you know that computers love pushing their flank pawns to restrict pawns like that in the end game f5 is the final move by the way you waited long enough for me to tell you this is the longest that that it took for a new move to come about f5 counteracts white queen and leela emerges from the opening with a slight positional advantage the advantage is based on the fact that leela has more space more pawns kind of lined far up more development so how is leela going to bring this advantage home first it plays h5 so it no longer cares about the g5 square it's just trying to advance its h pawn potentially knock on the door here like i already said maybe g4 in the future to open things up but we will see stockfish plays d6 a solid move but a major weakness on e6 but i got to tell you it was tough to develop the pieces right rook e1 so bringing that rook away from the queen side not looking to advance on the queen side looking to potentially cut the board in half and play where all of your pieces are stockfish develops with queen d7 covering its weakness and leela plays h6 finally finally that h pawn move happens if black takes the king is open so black has to go here now this pawn is a major liability in all long-term positional play so in the end game what's going to happen not right now but that's that's going to be a problem because the more pieces that black trades it's going to be really really tough to to get rid of and after something like that for you're never getting rid of than i right so leela now takes a moment to shred open the center of the board leela is really good at exploiting weaknesses and creating them it's also really really good when it has more space and its long-term planning is like out of this world it's not an aggressive computer this plan is actually more positional than it is aggressive yes against the human would be nice to win by checkmate but that's not going to happen when your opponent's 3,673 okay e4 is designed to target the weak pawn on e6 stockfish finally finishes the development but leela plays g3 rock solid my stockfish is already trying to get you know a move like d5 on the board brute force tactics that's mate the knight is hanging block the bishop take the knight take here open this up like stockfish wants to brute force everything you know it wants to emerge in a position like this and then it wants to rethread mate and then black will defend against mate and then it wants to reroute the knight but leela doesn't like chaos leela just says g3 leela is like the magnus of chess engines or magnus is like the leela of humans just g3 you defend the bishop against any nonsense and you play king g2 and stock at first like what a what a stupid move like oh my god what a what a dumb move g3 you know now i'm gonna attack you and leela's like okay and stockfish is like i'm gonna take i'm gonna take the unmitigated g of stockfish to wander off to the edge of the board in the middle of the game and just take a pa like the house is burning down and you go to the forest to pick berries what i mean what are we even doing so le by the way leela can cash out it can take its pawn back no not yet first place king g2 just safeguarding its position stockfish now has to make its way out of the forest leela plays bishop d2 it doesn't take the night yet it makes stockfish make another move another move which is weakening the the pawns behind it and now leela takes and we enter endgame territory rooks knight and bishop and leela is so clever forcing this small move like what could what could be this why was that important bishop f6 rookie d1 look at this pawn controlling that square controlling the file now black could play king f7 here and try to go here but boink and i already told you about that idea earlier get the knight in get the rook to the seventh rank the game is over game over m is in the evaluation all right knight c6 bishop g5 oh what an ugly move and look at leela just surgical trade what the powerful bishop for the knight this might be one of the most gangster trades i've ever seen a computer make and now leela's winning the game is over why is leela willing willing why did i say willing twice winning it's winning because black has no play at all what leela is going to do now is play b3 all three pawns cascade and stop all of this advancement the bishop sees nothing the rook sees a knight but the knight is well protected and it will go there and the rook will come here and black has too many weakness nes concept of two weaknesses in chess in any end game and watch as leela plays a masterful end game expanding completely there's a rule in chess if you want to win an endgame you often have to trade one rook not two one but sometimes two but usually one g5 stockfish advancing rook e six look at this suffocating pressure and now whoa leela enters an endgame knight and six versus bishop six and keep your eye on this knight the knight now becomes a hero as it gallops and finds open space black doesn't have time to win that pawn which is a decoy because the knight will get in here so the king runs over to defend but now because you go to defend that pawn which was really really important the white king gets in and despite leela being a pawn down in a knight versus bishop endgame white is winning white is winning because the bishop cannot abandon the pawn the king cannot abandon the pawn but white's knight is just going to go here and here and then take and then take so now stockfish has to start getting desperate it starts creating tactics but the tactics are too little too late but stockfish does create a runaway pawn but leela's knight zips back and stops it one square away from promotion and now stockfish can't stop these two pawns it tries but it can't the knight plays defense and look at the pawns created the king stops both pawns he's in the square and black can't stop three connected pawns that are going to happen and leela advances on both sides of the board and what a game what a game and i think i i don't remember if this one went until checkmates sometimes they do sometimes they don't no this one ended like a few moves before checkmate but th this was this was sensational like to just have the foresight that like yeah i'm gonna win because i'm gonna put my knight there and put my king on that square and i'm just winning like black just runs out of moves just otherworldly level play ju just sensational and all of this happened because a long time ago you marched the pawn up to h6 and created a weakness on h7 it's it's so impressive so so so impressive this might be one of the best positional games i've ever seen in my life like that one this was an endgame grind right it it was really really impressive you know the way the way it punished some of stock fish's arrogance yeah well this one was a scandinavian defense okay so they played the scandinavian against each other and this one left theory on the sixth move so so now the computers are completely on their own like which is really really fun because in the last game okay they had to play like 12 moves of theory blah blah blah this is brand new and it gets tactical quickly stockfish tries to solve things with knight what what knight takes d4 well the idea is knight takes d4 queen c5 fork now a human here would play queen e2 defending that lose this and go here huge lead in development rooks down the center line position looks good but at a high depth at a high depth black is completely fine like look look at stockfish it claims that it's equal so instead of that leela in this position sacrifices its bishop to ruin black's castling chances and it just retreats and just plays normal chess which is crazy like why would it do that well it leaves black with an isolated pawn i would never do this though because you're giving black quick development but watch as leela just plays centralized chess it waits to castle it forces the black king back with a check and now it castles and now watch as leela structures its entire position perfectly against black's weaknesses when you play against an isolated pawn you want to cover its advancement completely also white doesn't have a light squared bishop so white needs to cover the light squares now it would be silly to just push every pawn to a light square but watch black's bishop has to guard two pawns watch as white applies pressure knight goes to e4 blocking takes not knight takes not knight takes but queen takes inviting stockfish to suffer forever because if something like bishop f five this end game is winning for white white just is too fast against these pawns rook d8 i can just take so instead of that stockfish goes bishop d7 now watch this knight d5 now watch this bishop b oh my goodness what a smart move bishop to b4 removing the other piece that black has that's good and then when you trade you're going to have pressure against those pawns now watch rook f4 what a tactic if you take you lose your queen queen e2 what's the idea if the bishop takes the bishop knight takes f4 if e takes f4 it looks completely fine but rook d7 queen d7 and now queen c4 check winning the bishop and leela despite not being up any material has an advantage in this end game forever due to its activity and due to black having an overextended pawn and a very weak king by the time black figures out how to defend himself he's going to lose the entire house so instead of that rook f7 take first f3 rook d2 slowly building up and now we trade and look at look at white pawns white is about to start the maximum improvement phase watch doubling the rooks powerful knight in the center but that knight is ready to perish because that's the weakness black has these two pawns floating in the center of the board which leela is going to point all of its focus on queen a4 drops the knight back h3 another pawn removed from danger on a light square that is white's major weakness but it is well protected king b1 b3 all pawns on light squares completely counteracting black's bishop king b2 forward defending the knight the knight goes to d5 and now we have a rook and queen middle to end game where white will just methodically slowly improve the pawns trade a queen strip away the defense and break through watch a4 stopping b5 a couple of moves later what a trick attacking the queen because the rook would hang and then repositioning to this square with f4 ideas and rook d5 ideas black goes here white plays c3 white plays rook d5 queen d2 repositioning with more pressure it's just a little bit of a waiting game c4 restricting the black position a couple of moves later rook d5 and a5 taking away all of black space slowly slowly queen e7 king b2 queen f6 b4 it's just a matter of time now the king goes here and now a a moment do i go forward or do i walk my king the idea of king c2 was potentially to bring the king over there so for example king g8 there there could be an idea to play king d1 let's say king f8 king e1 king g8 king f1 king like there could be an idea to put the king right there and then go in or then go in like this or go in like this because black can't do anything but leela knows stock fish's tendencies and stockfish plays b5 stockfish cannot control itself it needs to solve things right now and that move is a massive commitment because both pawns are now liabilities there is on pass but there is also also c5 so with the king here you wave the red flag in front of the bull and the bull comes to you and now you've advaned and now the king zips behind its pieces a a little king walk in the middle of this game with tremendous pressure on the black position building dc5 bc5 leela has a pawn that snuck through and now we're going to a queen or a rook end game slowly we're going to get there the king goes back the king goes back leela restricts stockfish completely creating repositioning pieces i'm ready for an end game if you are i'm ready for an end game if you are we have a staring contest here we go rook end game here comes the king look at that king d3 all of this zipping if the king gets to e4 it's over because it's a dominant position and white has two powerful pawns rook d3 rook d6 all this type of stuff is there but instead of that you know stockfish again brood forcing it trying to solve it tactically giving away a pawn to play rook e8 back and try to just just advance its f pawn to create counterplay leela too good though just too good too methodical rook g5 check rook f5 and pawns are falling one by one the advantage is getting bigger and bigger of course stockfish still here would create massive headaches for a human being but leela has three pass pawns and you're just not going to stop them rook h2 trying to trade the rooks notice how stockfish is refusing a rook exchange but slowly runs out of oxygen and you can't take the rook cuz you're pinned but it's just a matter of time the king goes to the corner a lot of people here would panic a lot of people here would panic leela has a sense of humor this is not made because of this hiding the king in the corner e7 queen c6 and we're going to be making another queen king f2 and i think this game went yeah it ends with a triple ladder mate it's amazing to watch computers like stockfish reduced to this absolute nothingness like it's incredible and all of that was from an opening where leela gave up a bishop for a knight played against an isolated pawn traded pieces off so accurately and then built up on the defile and then put all of its pawns on light squares just completely negating black's position just such what an awesome game just an awesome game and the last game that i had for you is perfectly using stockfish against stockfish itself stockfish is a bully with white with black and especially if you give it the right type of opening it is a massive bully and this is a king's indian defense it is a kings indian defense by black which is a bit obscure c5 chosen white trying to play like a fian ketto setup and i got news for you the new position the new move in this game is like here like like after this is the last move that they were programmed with so it's going to be a very locked position as you can see black is going to play here white might play here but will'll probably advance there and it's a king's indian defense so black is going to move the knight and play f5 f4 that's what black is going to try to do so leela has to use all the forward momentum that stockfish is going to bring you know against th ju this was unbelievable bishop to f3 what what no human on the planet plays this move that is an insane move we as humans are like knight e2 knight bishop f3 is crazy that is a crazy move to play i i i can't believe it like i can't believe i'm just i i don't know you know the idea g4 the idea is to is to strike first look at stockfish creating in insane counterplay on the other side of the board already 98 leela says yo stockfish if you're going to give me a pawn i'm going to take it stockfish is trying to open up the queen side so if leela takes this pawn yes leela emerges a pawn up if you count all the pawns but now black is going to have what's called banko style counterplay that's because there's an opening called the bko gambit where black loses b and a pawns for a c pawn and avalanches down this side of the board however leela says no take your pawn back i'm going to keep the a file close very instructive by the way like i'm up a pawn but you can have it back cuz i don't want you to open up the position queen takes b6 leela plays h4 it hasn't developed a single piece and yet it's still trying to attack black trying to use everything black wants in the kings indian against black plays h5 look at this look at stockfish putting its horse in the middle of the board supported by everybody that looks so unpleasant for white i would be so scared of that knight and you know what leela does it offers a trade which is not going to be accepted but the idea was not to get rid of the knight because then black goes here gets a pass pawn opens up the c5 square for the knight opens up the c no the idea was knight f3 a5 and now remember the game that it just played king f just plays king f1 king f1 just king g2 what are you going to do to me and it's claiming i'm better it's just claiming like you have a nice knight yeah and like what are you going to do with it what are you going to do with this pawn what are you going to do with this where's your attack i have an attack it might be over here now leela's not rushing leela's not rushing to take because actually both of these captures look good to me but believe it or not there is no attack for example if you play queen g1 looking for m i'm going to go here here and there is no mate like i rest assured the king is completely safe so what is going to happen here knight a6 king g2 queen b7 look at rook h3 okay and c4 okay now i'm going to go here trying to get your knight out of the center but look at stockfish bringing its other knight oh that looks so unpleasant knight d2 trying to win the pawn on c4 that stockfish just put there now stockfish lashes out with its final remaining pawn oh my goodness we take aason but the f file has been open this knight is a beast just like two games ago leela pushes that pawn forward knowing it's going to have something in the end game the bishop goes this way what is rook h2 what are we even doing rook h2 just looks like a panic move it looks like i don't know what to do i'm panicking i knight c4 is not taken yet because of this so rook h2 rook b8 oh my goodness it's like it's like white is just desperately shuffling their pieces cuz they don't know what to do queen f7 f3 but then when you pause for a second you go wait black has all of these incredible pieces but leela has a brick wall of defense everything's protected every important square is protected in fact this bishop is an offensive weapon and black spent all this time and energy opening the queen side putting all these pieces but you built a really fancy house and then you ran out of budget to do the sides of the house so there's water getting in what's happening over here like once white defends their position they're not going to play defense anymore it's like when the it's like when the attacked side in in a sport makes starts making a comeback right all of a sudden this pawn is protected one two three four and five times so you know what leela does it just takes the weak pawn on c4 and it says i'm up a pawn not only am i up a pawn i'm going to take this stockfish now says nope not so fast rook b4 a4 i'm still stockfish i'm still pressuring you lea says okay b3 okay you have four different things that see that you i'm playing to your strength please prove your point prove your point show me what you got well if you take then i'm going to trade with you knight takes b3 a takes b3 i'm going to remove your pieces one by one and then i'm going to go over that side of the board i mean it still looks like something should get to this king but there's not enough time queen f8 take take and leela's defending queen b oh my goodness leela is actually attacking and now we start trading the the black knight is still super powerful on d4 but leela doesn't care it just absolutely doesn't care and here comes the other rook and the queen is centralized and the rook is still playing defense which is very very important queen d2 bishop g5 look at those bishops the queen rotates b5 because every square that that pawn moves forward is going to be a problem for black to defend the queen has to slide back suddenly stockfish is the one defending itself rook c7 rook f7 shuffling it's starting to sacrifice its own pieces just to get rid of some of these annoying leela pieces leela's like i'm good i don't want it oh you want i'll i'll give you this bishop this bishop you can have why because i need the bishop on g5 the pawn keeps going forward why can't it be taken why can't the pawn be taken because then rook b1 and i'm getting to the back rank and your king is restricted cuz that pawn i put on h6 everything that leela does make sense it's unbelievable stuff b6 can't be taken now leela has five pawns not all of them can move but it has five pawns queen two rooks and bishop you know what leela moves in this position king to g3 you know why leela went king to g3 because in this position the winning move for white is to strike back where you have been weakest the longest it's like an anime it's like a movie not there but f4 there is no knight check no rook check and the queen can't get in because the king is actually playing the defense f4 is game over because you would start trading everything and you would win and if they don't take you after f4 then you just take them and you open up everything king g3 trying to play that is so gang ster and stockfish sacrifices its other rook take take and if leela takes on f4 then i get in and oh my well we're swimming with the piranhas now i don't like that very much knight takes f3 check and get oh my goodness we got to start trying to get over there instead of that instead of all that i just go back to g2 and now i threaten check and i take your queen stockford got nothing left rook h1 covering everything if queen g5 check king f1 it looks like i'm there but i got really bad news for you a move away from getting mated i take and you take and this is made due to this pawn that that same pawn that you keep seeing crazy queen d8 and my friends i think you know what's going to happen that b pawn causing all sorts of problems queen a8 we go all the way down queens and rooks and leela wins again amaz i mean when i saw this game i was blown away because it just looks like black is calling all the shots from start to finish like the knight coming from ea to see planting itself on d4 so many people here would lose with white so many people because this is like vintage kings indian stuff and leela just sets up an impregnable fortress it defends itself perfectly and just plays like h6 and f3 and that's it there is nothing black can do the major question could be if stockfish should have played c4 but then i don't know what else it could have done i don't know what else it could have done to improve the position maybe a4 but it has to go c4 at some point i don't know and i thought this was super cool using all of stock fish's strongest elements against it and then winning a game like this unbelievable positional game that second one i showed you that first game that endgame foresight knight bishop despite being a pawn down activating both on both sides galloping back to stop the pawn just incredible stuff now stockfish is overall still the stronger engine but watching it lose to like leela it it it's otherworldly i watch these games and i'm like maybe there's something i can learn and then i go play and i hang my rook or something so as you all know it's a common chess condition where you get inspired by something you watch and then you completely cannot replicate it but i hope you enjoyed this video do let me know if you want some more and if you're watching this in december of 2023 i'll see you in toronto in 5 days we're going to have a lot of fun it's going to be great that's all get out of here
