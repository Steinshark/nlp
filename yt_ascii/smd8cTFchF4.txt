isn't it confusing how in recent versions of windows the settings app exists side by side with the old school control panel think of it there are a number of windows features that look pretty dated at this point i mean these icons that you can pick for your shortcuts are literally unchanged since windows 95 what gives it that to find out we went straight to the source so we'd like to thank microsoft for shedding some light on this situation a big part of this mixing and matching of old and new user elements or ui elements is the fact that windows is worked on by a huge number of distinct teams at microsoft combine that with the fact that windows has been developed in a fairly piecemeal fashion for the last 30 plus years and it's not super surprising that each release of such a massive operating system has consisted of incremental improvements rather than full recodes from scratch in fact each team that works on windows uses a guide on how to modernize a setting if they want to make whatever it is they're working on more congruent with the rest of the os it's a real process meaning that microsoft has to prioritize what to redesign and what to just leave alone to do this then the company is continually collecting user feedback to figure out which elements users interact with the most for example the taskbar is almost unrecognizable from what it was like when it debuted in 1995 and the reason it's been revised so often is because most folks are interacting with it almost constantly but even parts of the os that aren't as front and center can be attractive targets for a redesign task manager for instance has had performance graphs startup programs and per process resource usage added because enough folks who regularly go into task manager wanted to be able to keep tabs on exactly what their programs were up to but hold on a second even if people aren't demanding an overhaul of some other windows feature is it really that hard for microsoft to just make everything look like it's at least part of the same os we'll tell you right after we thank enlisted for sponsoring this video ready for some boots on the ground combat immerse yourself in iconic world war ii battles and enlisted command a squad of customizable ai soldiers and fight against other players utilizing iconic weapons and vehicles from the era with multiple unique and varied campaigns no battle will ever feel the same play enlisted for free on pc xbox series x and playstation check it out of the link below and get an exclusive bonus pack it turns out that lots of the legacy ui elements that you see actually rely on older software frameworks basically the underlying code that don't always play nicely with a redesign unless you rebuild the entire feature from scratch and with as many requested windows improvements as there are turtles holding up the earth redesigning a feature that not many people are clamoring for simply isn't a main priority for microsoft which might explain why 28 year old icons are still hiding inside the os but even if microsoft had more resources to throw up the problem certain ui elements are actually left the way they are on purpose some customers particularly business or enterprise users rely on having these legacy features remain exactly as they are in fact certain organizations use custom scripts which assume for example certain settings in the control panel will be present so microsoft doesn't want to break software that other folks have written and then other organizations will reach out to them to tell them that these older elements and windows really need to be kept as they are not to mention that microsoft also wants to keep things familiar for all users instead of changing too many things at once so then does that mean the classic control panel is going to be around forever well microsoft unsurprisingly did not want to comment on if and when it'll be phased out entirely but what we can tell you is that they are continuing to try to chip away at migrating as much as they can over to the new settings app which is good news for the neurotic among us who are really bothered by the weird mix of old and new part of me thinks though the control panel is going to find a way to hang on until like windows 20. if you guys like this video click like if you didn't like it well i mean hey there's that button too if you have a suggestion for a future fast as possible leave us a comment maybe let us know your favorite mismatches down below and subscribe
