this billion dollar company just went bankrupt youtubers claim to have lost everything mark cuban was involved he lost well he didn't lose everything because he's a billionaire but he lost a lot of money and so did his fans the mavericks who he sold this all to i'm talking about voyager why it matters and why what they're doing right now might be illegal so buckle up this is going to be a long voyage with over 2.7 million verified users voyager was an extremely popular crypto broker to buy and sell crypto but even more than that you could also earn money on crypto you left with voyager up to nine to ten percent now i can already hear some of you saying that sounds impossible it sounds like a ponzi scheme but like all ponzi schemes this one was different okay voyager had a plan a plan that couldn't possibly fail they told users they were able to generate this amazing yield because they took your money and lint it out but not just to anyone voyager would only lend to the most trustworthy people that's their secret sauce according to their ceo so you're minimizing the risk because of who we're working with and they advertise this a lot they claimed a low risk approach to investing they said that they could weather any bear market which is by the way a gigantic red flag that you should never ignore but that didn't stop popular crypto influencers from hearing about it who began to either promote it or put their own money into this platform people like scott melker andre dick jeremy from financial education people you probably have either never heard of or heard from way too much such is the life of an internet celebrity but whether you've heard about those guys or not the biggest name that i know you will have heard of is mark cuban who promoted this thing as well and actually turned out to be the worst of them all just listen to them pitch voyager as being as close to risk-free as you can get in crypto i'm not trying here to tell you it's 100 risk-free but it's as close close to risk free as you're going to get in the crypto universe cuban said this as part of a partnership with voyager where he sold the mavericks basically the entire city of dallas on what it was soon to be an insolvent company but don't forget to use the code math fans who download the app create an account using the promotional code code mavs 100 deposit one hundred dollars and make a trade will get 100 in crypto it's all so pathetic isn't it to watch billionaires sell to us like this the pores i mean let's be perfectly clear mark cuban is a terrible crypto investor he's over two we've already covered his last failed venture anyways the point i'm making though is that influencers and celebrities were a huge part of voyager's success and that makes sense right because financial disclosures from voyager show they were spending big on marketing up to 80 million dollars a year but all this hype quickly changed when the news broke this past month voyager digital announcing today it's the latest crypto firm to suspend withdrawals deposits and trading as you're seeing there you know basically lost everything in the stock but i have a substantial amount of money like multiple six figures that is locked up to this day with voyager that i may never get access to again most of my ethereum is now temporarily we'll say i don't know if i voyager will make it right gone my salon is gone so my bitcoin is gone and a lot of the things that i got paid with in usdc go on right man don't you feel bad for these millionaires who put their money into this risk-free investment well don't feel too bad because according to some of them they aren't actually victims like i said i have been a victim i guess we'll call it although i take full responsibility for all of my own decisions so none of us are really victims right we knew the risks and we took them that's scott melker and yeah he seems great after a lot of his followers potentially lost all their money he tells them that there's no such thing as victims this is crypto brain rot at its finest and it's also of course happens to be wrong of course because this idea that everyone understood the risks is simply not true as i'm going to demonstrate because let's take a look at that how voyager collapsed to see what people actually knew it turns out this news of voyager suspending withdrawals came right after stephen ehrlich their ceo said that the money was safe our customers assets are safe and we're processing everything as normal and scott melker himself said that he was shown evidence that the money was fine get up their cfo they showed me a whole lot of evidence that things are fine that they are operating in a completely different manner and i continue to hold my assets there of course this all turned out to be a live voyager wasn't fine see it turns out voyager was actually insolvent because one of the loans they had given out had just gone bad but they didn't want to scare anyone so they told people at the last possible moment that they were insolvent which brings us to their second lie and misrepresentation which is their marketing they said that they had a low risk approach to investing but actually it turns out they actually gave 50 percent of their loans or more to a single person or hedge fund yeah that's what diversification looks like these days according to their documents voyager gave 654 million dollars of their loans to a single hedge fund called three arrows capital now what did three arrows capital do with that money well they invested it in luna which after it collapsed basically made this loan worthless and this is where i realized that voyager was absolutely full of it as were any influencers claiming that everyone understood the risks this is explicitly and provably false voyager lied and not just about the low risks it turns out there was a lot more to this story too see one of voyager's big claims to fame was fdic see insurance for cash this is because they claim they had a partnership with legitimate bank the metropolitan commercial bank now the reason they were able to claim this apparently was because when you put your money with voyager your cash they would then put that money with the bank and according to them and some magical transitive property that they made up the bank's fdic insurance would cover you even though you didn't put your money technically with the bank you put it with voyager but they said that fdic insurance applied they even advertised as much quote in the rare event due to the company or our banking partners failure you are guaranteed a full reimbursement the problem is though that's not actually what they said in their terms of service they said you were only covered in the event of the bank's failure not voyagers quote fdic insurance does not protect against the failure of voyager which is is a pretty big difference especially when voyager failed and all those people who got in thinking their usd was safe all of a sudden realize that maybe it wasn't so yeah that's a pretty massive lie and probably is illegal although i have to say i am not a lawyer although it is being investigated as we speak by the fdic but speaking of lawyers this is where things go absolutely bananas because voyager has obviously been desperate to find a way out of this situation and their latest attempt is declaring chapter 11 bankruptcy which i know you might think that means they're going bust but it's not quite right see bankruptcy isn't just one thing there's many types which i know is a bit confusing it's like hearing someone's a doctor and then realizing it's not the helpful kind it's the lecturing kind anyways the point is there's many kinds of bankruptcies just like there's many kinds of doctors and they all do kind of different things so to be clear chapter 11 is not where you sell everything in close up shop it's special kind of bankruptcy designed to let you restructure your business to repay debts meanwhile everything just kind of goes on pause and voyager loves this idea because it lets them stay alive they think they can restructure their way out of insolvency by drumroll please printing more money that's right they're gonna print more voyager bucks and shares of voyager now the problem with this of course is what's the value of coins and shares in a company that is insolvent it's not very clear doesn't seem very high so this seems like a pretty raw deal for investors but a bigger problem for voyager is not that it's that actually what they're doing might not be illegal let me explain see only certain types of companies are eligible for a chapter 11 bankruptcy when you go to file one of the first things they ask is to describe the debtor's business they list several options like stock broker commodity broker clearing bank but voyager takes none of these when they filled it out they say it's none of the above in their filing now this is pretty strange because the ceo describes their business as a brokerage they say this multiple times so why does this even matter well the reason they're asked earlier if they're a stock broker or commodity broker is because those companies businesses aren't allowed to do a chapter 11 bankruptcy instead they're liquidated under a very special law called sipa the securities investors protection act basically it's a law designed for exactly this case when brokerages go bust and it's good for the investors because they get special protections and are the first to get paid according to axios reporting and this is very different from regular bankruptcies where investors can be the absolute last to get paid so a sip of liquidation could be good for investors so why is voyager not doing a sipa liquidation well it seems like they're trying to have their cake and eat it too because on the one hand they claim to be a brokerage but they're not filing bankruptcy as a traditional brokerage and instead are trying to file a chapter 11 and i know it's getting complicated but this is really important for the investors the reason they're doing this is because under a simple liquidation even though customers might get a better deal there's basically no chance a voyager's plan to print more money and stocks is gonna fly not only that voyager would probably have to cease operations and so obviously voyager doesn't want that so instead they're trying to claim that as a crypto broker they're not selling securities or anything that classifies as a stock or commodity which is very gray regulatory territory not only that they're claiming that all their customers crypto is actually their crypto and that their customers are just unsecured creditors so the customers don't actually own anything and this is where i have to tell you that this is pure lawyer jiu jitsu they are trying to save voyager's skin at the expense of their investors because let's be clear voyager was absolutely happy to advertise things like the easy way to build and track your crypto portfolio but when push comes to shove they say your crypto portfolio doesn't actually belong to you at all it actually means build voyager's crypto portfolio because they're saying they actually are the ones that own it and if you're confused about out all this how this advertising possibly makes sense you're supposed to be it doesn't make sense not only that voyager's own app told people explicitly that they own the crypto they bought thankfully in their first bankruptcy hearing the judge pointed this out and questioned whether voyager had even filed the right type of bankruptcy case suggesting that it met the criteria for liquidating as a quote broker dealer with protected customer accounts which obviously they want to avoid for the reasons we just explained this reporting comes from reuters and i think this judge is absolutely right in what world would buying crypto be so different from say buying a stock on robinhood it's regulatory mess sure but customers deserve regulatory protection and the only people who's arguing that they don't is voyager although their lawyer a guy named sussberg says that they're doing this for the good of the customers actually see we have it all twisted they claim that quote it would result in a lot of expensive litigation that would benefit no one now to be honest i think sussberg is wrong here and doesn't have their investors best interests at heart because obviously he works for voyager not for the investors and anytime someone is trying to tell you that your money is not your money and that they've already lied to you about fdic insurance and all these other things i would be very skeptical if they told you they're working in your best interest instead it looks like voyager is acting in voyager's best interest but i suppose the real question is what happens now well it's actually not clear the judge rightfully points out that the case presents several novel legal questions and i think part of that outcome will be determined by what voyager's customers want to do whether they go along with voyager's plans or if they raise concerns that maybe they actually feel like they own securities and not just unsecured credit according to a restructuring lawyer named robert honey honeywell this could move their claim higher up on the list because owners of securities are more protected than just owners of random things but with all this said and the outcome not very clear i feel like the lessons are actually pretty clear influencers and celebrities are bad and sad in this case because they lost a lot of money investors are screwed but maybe not completely depending on how all this shakes out and voyager lied lied and lied some more about the state of their finances and risk and fdic insurance and is now trying to play some games with bankruptcy law to save themselves and i just can't help but thinking maybe there are some victims here now will voyager's plan work i don't know but either way if you enjoy high effort investigations like this please pump the stock it really helps and don't forget to use code mav at checkout code mavs 100
