can find out more information about this on my website jordanbpeterson.com as well as accessing all relevant ticketing information i'm going to use the tour to walk through some of the ideas i've been working on my forthcoming book out november 2024 we who wrestle with god i'm looking forward to this i'm thrilled to be able to do it again and i'll be pleased to see all of you again soon bye-bye this rise of this managerial class you see it in the deep state in the federal government the people who are the political consultants populating the industrialization of our political politics who are neither ordinary citizens in their own right nor are they actual purposeful creators but are the intermediating managers right that's what's sucking the lifeblood out of our culture and our country and i would go so far as to say the modern west as we know it and so is it possible to reform that beast no i think you have to slay that [music] beast hello everybody i'm talking again to vc ramaswami i started talking to vic before he ran for president on the republican side with regard to his endeavors on the esg alternative front in the financial domain him fighting back against the climate apocalypse mongers in the economic realm i've been talking to vic pretty regularly as he's progressed through the republican primaries he's dropped his striving for the presidency but established himself quite credibly as a candidate and is still active as a political voice we do a post him of his adventure on the political stage talking about the deep state talking about his relationship with donald trump talking about his plans for the future talking about the viability of trump as a candidate trump's divisiveness vivex reasons for trusting trump and putting some faith in a future that might include a four-year trump presidency and walking through the realities of a modern-day presidential campaign and so join us for that hey v thanks for coming on again some of the people watching and listening will know that we spoke well before you made your bid for for the republican leadership in the presidential race we got to know each other before then and then you've been kind enough to take us along on your journey essentially and we haven't done that for a while now i know that part of your political adventure has come to a conclusion but i think it would be very useful for everybody who's watching and listening to start from the beginning of of your entry into the political domain and then just to tell everybody as clearly as you can what happened to you and what you what happened to you what you learned and where you are now so yeah yeah i'm still processing that and that's why i was looking forward to this conversation because even though it's been a couple months there's a whole ton of you know transitional to normal life phase of this that i haven't had my own chance to process that and hopefully this conversation is is part of that for me so you and i actually spoke beforeand you were one of a small handful of people i actually spoke to as i was contemplating this offline but we had spoken on it before i was a businessman and i consider myself a businessman now and i'm thinking about what i'm going to do in the future trying to drive change through the private sector i founded a biotech company that challenged a lot of the way big pharma did business i found it strive to challenge the way black rock and the esg promoting asset managers were functioning and those were successes in their own right in different ways but i realized the mother of the beast in each of those cases and in so many other cases of problems i hadn't tackled was the administrative state was that fourth branch of government the bureaucracy the technocracy the people who are never elected to run the government that were actually exercising political power you could take the fda as an example in the shadow of the pharmaceutical industry which i had seen firsthand and the not only the illogical policies if illogic were the only part of it it would have been a technically solvable problem it was a fundamentally political problem where people were exercising political power that they were never given same thing with respect to the epa and the sec in the case of the asset management industry and so i came to the conclusion look life is short one of the best pieces of advice i got as a younger man was it takes about as much effort and difficulty to do something small as it does to do something big and i've found over the course of my career that that's been about true i've done some smaller things i've done some bigger things both of which are important but they take about the same effort if you're doing something well whether it's something really small or something really large the amount of individual effort you put in is about the same and so look i said what is the biggest possible impact i can have if i'm willing to put all my effort into it it might as well be the biggest possible impact of all let me lead the united states of america let me lead the united states of america to a rediscovery of our national ideal take on that administrative state that fourth branch of government dismantle it to revive in many ways the ideals of the american revolution i mean that's what the american revolution was about in 1776 we said no to elite technocracy in the form of monarchy it's a 1776 moment now young people did it back then i was 37 years old when i declared and most people said that's too young to run for president the truth is i found that as encouragement because our founding fathers including thomas jefferson were younger than me in many cases at the time they created the entire country so that's where i was i jumped off a cliff and didn't know what exactly was gonna was going to be my landing pad on the other side let's just say i learned a lot over the course of that last year and you know god's plan was revealed it was not meant to be the next president of the united states it seems but it did take me out a journey that at least i learned a lot from i took a lot away from and hopefully sets me up to continue to have a big impact in other ways in the future it just was originally my motivation now couple things i learned i assumed that it was going to be a message that people were hungry for i knew people were hungry for this message i had written three books i had traveled the country i had been to most states in this union as a consequence of my business activities across to the books i had written and so i knew how people were responding to this message i thought of running for president in part because many people on those book tours you know tens hundreds of people even who i didn't know come and encourag me to run for us president i didn't have much of a doubt in my mind that that message was going to resonate with a lot of people but what i naively assumed was that somehow that message was going to land on the ears of the millions of people who needed to hear it and a that they were going to hear it at all and b that when they did hear it that was the only thing they were going to hear versus a lot of other messages about me that would permeate the system and it turned out to be a a much more challenging initial incline than i had envisioned the first thing i noticed was we planned a you know a big launch of the presidential campaign a video i had a wall street journal opet probably i'm not saying this to boast but one of the things that i did was probably one of the most thorough policy vision rollouts of a presidential candidate on day one when they roll out their campaign thought i had done it the right way we went pretty quickly i only decided in january of 2023 to run i declared by the end of february 2024 it was february 21st when i declared and we had a big leadup to it i think i had done everything exactly as i had planned to do laid out the message about as well as i wanted to and then i noticed that the world continued to proceed as though i had never launched my run for us president including even the political media that was covering the race another presidential candidate had declared well donald trump had declared and nikki haley had declared and then by the time i had declared it was a it was as though it was non-event and so that was i think the first thing that i realized was i was prepared to go into this as a battle of ideas a battle of vision for the country a battle of who would be the best person to execute against that vision and i was sleeves rolled up ready for battle and then i realized that people didn't even view me as being in that battle which i was ended up being the first battle of the campaign itself the first five months was making the case not for my vision not for my candidacy or my ability to execute but for my ability to even even be relevant in the first place and that would be rather naive of me but but that was that was i think the first hard learning in declaring as an outsider for the race okay so let me draw an analogy there and you tell me what you think about this it's frequently the case that neoy entrepreneurs who've created a product believe that the fundamental issue at hand is the product right it when when i started selling things into the marketplace i suffered from the delusion that it was 85% product and you know 10% administration and 5% marketing and sales and that was like exactly backwards and so it sounds to me like a similar issue here that you presumed that except in the political realm you presumed that if you had your policy prepared you were already a credible person that that would be the bulk of the initial battle but what turned if i've got you right what turned out to be the case was a very sudden realization that while you had to get in the conversation at all and that sounds like a sales and marketing problem to some degree and this is i think why so many candidates who are credible turn to political consultants so rapidly right and and that often syns them so okay so is that a reasonable analogy and you've but you've you've put products in the marketplace before and so in principle you knew that on the commercial side so well i would say something about this is i i i agree with you on your analysis on the commercial side what i would say is that is on steroids in the political side right so even if you transpose the commercial instinct onto politics you'd be missing it by by by mile the other thing is i came from industries that were a little bit different i haven't really been in a consumer products industry or in the media industry i mean the industry that i spent the most time in was developing drugs for diseases that pharma had ignored systematically and that was an area where look it's it's a regulated process i saw from a front row seat how broken institutions like the fda really are but it's not an area where if you're pre-commercial and everything that i did was in the research and development phase not in the commercial phase it actually it as entrepreneurs go i actually did not necessarily have that same experience as many consumer interfacing entrepreneurs so that may be idiosyncratic to me and then i would say even for consumer interfacing entrepreneurs and strive was a little bit closer to that because that's that's a that's a you know fund management company that competes at black rock i had some of that experience it was nothing close to what the importance is of that is in politics is it was all about to call it sales and marketing in some ways undersells the problem because sales and marketing is once you're once you're there how much do you amplify how many people hear your message whereas for me at the early stages of the campaign and as i think about the last year and even some of the things that later came back to become headwinds for me when i was a you know front running or or whatever top four top five candidate were actually the path to getting there sort of set me up for the difficulties that i had later on but the first challenge was not even selling or marketing your message more effectively it was literally like nobody would know that i was running for us president even though i was running for us president so it was just getting on the map or being heard in the first place i just talked to dean phillips and his campaign obviously came to an end for those of you watching and listening dean phillips was until recently running against biden on the democrat side and he faced this problem in spades i think he probably faced all the problems you faced plus the additional problem was that he was absolutely 100% shut out of the entire democrat apparatus people were literally told that if they worked for him they would never do anything politically again in their life and then also he had to face the same reaction from the legacy media and so he didn't get it and i don't think that he was attuned well enough to the alternative media let's say you know the podcast crowd and all that to capitalize on that quickly plus they tend to tilt more in the classic liberal conservative direction anyways okay so you had to face this problem of getting on the map at all so how did that unfold so so one of the things i did and this is where you know i took good advice you were one of the early people who offered a reflection on this and you know i said what what's the downside in trying it makes a lot of sense to me is if the traditional media is ignoring you go to the non-traditional media as a way to reach the people and so i adopted a strategy let's call it a maxim early in the campaign which was the talk to everyone and anyone's strategy okay left right center cable news non-cable news print media smalltime media local media individuals walking on the street recording it and putting it on social media i wore you i'm wearing a little camera or wearing a little what do you call it a little microphone right now i wore a microphone pretty much everywhere i went we just clip the conversations and put it out now my social media following was a lot smaller than than it ended up being at the end of the campaign but still that was just a way of putting out my message into the world and what we started to notice was you know most of those things would get relatively small reach but in a few instances there were a lot of interactions where people actually began to take interest to say wait a minute that's an interaction of a kind that i haven't seen before that's interesting to me some of them were not necessarily casting me in the most flattering light i might not have looked good right just even visually you know the things that i would have said were sometimes a little bit unscripted may not have been said as eloquently as i might have prepared for in a speech or a tv interview but that was actually part of what made it appealing and so that started to take off i think allowed the campaign there were a couple moments and then i got called i happened to be in new york city and they said do you want to come on don lemons show right because many republican candidates aren't going to go on there so they thought they have a republican candidate who's running why don't you go ahead and go on don lemon's show we had a kind of interaction where this man lost went haywire i had just given a speech at the nra meeting and he picked on one particular thing that i said which is a fact of history that black americans in the united states did not get to enjoy their civil rights until they actually had their second amendment rights and the first anti-gun laws that were passed in the united states were designed to keep gun guns out of the hands of black americans and that was part of a broader historical trend where even countries like china or iran or other countries around the world that claim to offer the same bill of rights that the us offers don't have a second amendment and so don lemon and and the funny thing happened actually i thought this would be a bit of an aside but al offro they said there was a list of topics see these are the some of the tricks that the mainstream media plays it was really interesting there was a whole litany of topics they said this is what they would like to talk to you about i forget what it was it was something related to china policy which you know i i believe the us needs to deare independence from china they gave a couple of others but i specifically remember that being one of them and then you go on the set and what do you know is they've pulled a airlifted quotes from my speech at the nra meeting with their own commentary as the wraparound as the lead into the interview when they have purposefully given me it's not like they didn't think about it they said we're not going to tell you what we're going to talk about so this is exactly what we're going to talk about a litany for a you know relatively new presidential candidate first time on their show here's a litany of what we're going to talk about and it was not that it was that they decided to change topics in a in a spontaneous way it was designed as a trap and so in that case anyway i gave don lemon on air a history lesson which caused him to it ended up being a big favor for me on the campaign lose his mind you know the earpiece that he had in he was screaming at the people who were the producers in his ears saying it was distracting him as he was engaged in this debate with me it was such an uncomfortable moment for everybody involved including anybody watching it that it ended up being the new york times reported the next couple of days later the catalyst for don lemon actually getting fired by cnn and so i had a few interactions like that that that started to kind of increase the steam behind people at least paying attention to candidacy and and things went on from there did you know a baby's heart begins to beat at just 3 weeks at 5 weeks that heartbeat can be heard on ultrasound and this can sometimes be their only defense in the womb that's where pre-born steps in preborn rescues 200 babies every day from abortion simply by providing mothers with an ultrasound after hearing her child's heartbeat and seeing its

preborn docomo so let me ask you about well let me ask you about that so i want to know what other moments went viral right so that's a that's a really interesting one because one of the well there's two things about that that i find particularly interesting the first is the way that these mainstream legacy media journalist set up the people that they're interviewing so the game seems to be and this has happened to me many many times the game is very straightforward the game is we will poke and prod at you with ill-informed but provocative opinions hoping that by being as annoying as possible you will say something fatally stupid demolish your reputation online and elevate my reputation the journalist as an investigator who can then walk away with like your scalp so to speak on his belt now that's that's a and so that's the kind of interview you face where every single word the interviewer utters is a verbal trap okay but my my experience has been that if you keep your head during that interchange and you don't play the game so you don't say anything stupid you don't apologize you don't get upset that that can turn viciously vicious ly in your favor and you said okay and so that's interesting so i'd like to your thoughts on that and then i'd also like to know what other things you did in the alternative media and direct to consumer direct to voter model that also went viral you know some of that's chance right if you put out 50 clips you're going to get a pito distribution of effect but did you start to see a pattern for the clips that you got okay so let's let's unwrap that let's start with the gacha journalism first of all well well the gacha journalism so strategy ended up being it wasn't really a strategy i think it's sort of how i'm wired first was to do exactly what you said just rationally process exactly what they're telling you and respond rationally as the person on the other side increasingly loses their mind because you're not doing what they expected or planned or set you up to do which in turn i think makes them look i think far more illogical as a consequence when they were actually taking the rafan populist republican to try to make fry of them even for their own audience they end up looking like the less reasonable ones i went in the breakfast club had a major viral exchange there where a woman she was pressing me hard on the fact that i had only ever really had major accomplishments in the business world that had never been in public service with utter unawareness that the last and i believe successful president of the united states donald trump came with a very similar background and i think she was frustrated that i wasn't falling into her traps and then she ended up giving a soliloquy about her her experience in sixth grade where she put together a coalition for lunch money or something like this which to her own audience which is a largely left of center audience broadly panned saying that we don't want to really hear about your sixth grade experience we understand that somebody who has accomplished things in the business world can at least have a legitimate case for having his ideas heard this is coming from the left don lemon's firing i had an exchange with chuck todd where he said are you how can you have the level of certainty that there are two genders and i explained in manner of somebody who happens to have a biology degree which i i don't usually like using you don't need a biology degree to know something about biology you don't need to have a harvard degree to be able to have standing to speak on a subject of science but i have those things and for an audience that particularly wrongfully elevates their attachment of value to those degrees i decided to use that in my favor and broke down for him here's what 2x chromosomes mean here's what an x and a y chromosome mean and that exchange went viral as well and i think this this one was more by chance but he quickly was was no longer on the air at meet the press which was his made show shortly after i had done the same thing with don lemon shortly after we had exchanges like that at the breakfast club and then you think about the exchanges that i had on social media that ended up being the ones that really caught the public imagination were again interactions that i had in the field let's call it at the iowa state fair at other places where we had protesters or people who were purposefully trying to either disrupt my events or or others i got to give them credit who were respectful but sharply disagreed with what i had to say and approached me in one-off conversations that weren't performative but they were real conversations authentic conversations between people who deeply disagreed on subject matter and so if i'm to put those together both between the corporate media realm as well as in the in the let's just say real world translated social media digital realm that's the through line that i would draw is the thing that really ended up creating not just oneoff but this ended up being a series of probably 3 four months in there of repeated verality of interactions that were nothing more than the kind of interactions that i've been having for all of my adult life which i enjoy which i thrive on you know think about the people i went to school with at places like harvard or yale predominantly had political views that were different from mine i lean libertarian most of them lean liberal some of them are even friends of mine and remain friends of mine to this day authentic heated but earnest exchange in some cases the person on the other side wasn't necessarily authentic in their motives take the don lemon but you treat them as though they are and then they self- imilate in front of you that ended up really lifting up the campaign in this case now far earlier than we expected okay because when we saw me not lifting up off the ground i think i calibrated myself to saying okay this is going to be a long haul it's going to be only after the debates begin and let me at least try to qualify for those debates let me at least make that table stakes that i would qualify for the debate and then after that it would be a steady build up instead something started happening where when i took the talk to everyone's strategy leing media rightwing media corporate media podcasts and interactions we actually saw a pickup that was then far earlier than i expected after i had recalibrated my own expectations and that created new problems of its own actually so what started happening was this is in advance of the first republican debate i started really surging in the polls and that nobody expected he were talking about just four months before the media would not give me the light of day and many people had no idea i was running for president when i was running for president in the month of march now we're talking about july early august i mean i was probably the republican candidate who was most talked about even by the corporate press even when i'm not on there because who is this character that nobody's heard of that's now beginning to surge in a lot of these polls passing up you know former vice presidents of the united states former governors people who were running that were far more prominent viewed as real contenders in the rays and then that's where i started to really get a taste of a new a new kind of issue where first is i i'll tell this is the corporate press i think took some umbrage at the fact that they had been one uped in two ways they had been one uped in two ways one way they had been one uped is right on their own home turf right the don lemon and the chuck todd style interactions so i think that bothered him but the second thing that bothered him and i think this was this was i think the more interesting learning i think they were bothered by the fact that i had sid stepped them that many of the interactions that caused me that were most attributable to americans having a favorable view of me had nothing to do with going through the normal gatekeepers which are those in corporate media and this really pissed them off okay and so what they started to do was to realize that this was an opportunity to trap me and and and i think that this is less about me and more about a defense of their own relevance as the sole gatekeeper in the realm of politics so so this is where i think that if i was to give you feedback from the feedback you gave me the feedback you gave me is sidestep the corporate media you said that in one of our earlier podast probably our first podcast that we had you were one of the few people who was paying attention to me here's what i learned as a consequence of that is we're not yet at a future where the corporate media is entirely irrelevant we're in this lial state this intermediate state where the new media is relevant it's useful it's necessary certainly for newcomer break on the scene like me but it coexists in a landscape where the traditional gatekeepers are still very much present relevant and important and so they realize here's the game they're going to play is take this conversation you and i are having right this is going to be a 90-minute conversation thing about a conversation is it has context what we say 40 minutes from now may call back something that you and i just spoke about 10 minutes ago all right that's the nature of this format the corporate media operates television lists take cable television as example based on two three four minute segments and so there started to be a really interesting thing that started to happen in july and august is by then there's a whole body of probably tens hundreds of podcasts like this that i had done where what they were able to do was to then helicopter airlift something that came out of conversation that had context attached to it right an hour sometimes two hours worth of context around a statement but to airlift that and to put that on air in a way that was cast in a completely different context than what it was intended in the context of a two-hour conversation and it wasn't that they were just punishing me what they were doing in the process was creating a disincentive for anybody else to actually participate in those longer form conversations because the message is if you do that do it at your own peril because you will be punished unless you do it the standard way where you script it you don't go through exactly what the traditional assembly line is for political communication and you're going to do it through the format that we have control over or else we will punish the defector and that's what they began to do so in august in the lead up to the first debate and this was this was somewhat damaging to me and it created a bit of a theme that the other candidates pounced on and and exploited as a theme well i'll tell you the surprising thing that happened at first debate was remember my whole thing was in march make the debate stage what happened is in the summer i surged so much so that not only did i make the debate stage i was at the center of the very first debate stage ronda sanz and i were the two people at the center of that debate stage one of whom was the guy who was the pre-ordained challenger and replacer of donald trump according to you know many pundits in the world of conservative media and then another guy who nobody had heard of at the center of a debate state with the former vice president multiple us senators to governors to other people who were irritated as hell that i was there and i did not expect this dror peterson but the thing that shocked me i enjoyed it was at that first debate i ended up being the target of every person you were actually i think in that in that room physically even and and that was interesting to me but in the lead up to that is what really gave them the ammo and this is where i wasn't strategizing at all at that point i was just still continuing my talk to everyone's strategy i'll talk to everybody i'll talk unfiltered it's etc there was a reporter from the atlantic this is a funny story i haven't really gone into depth on this but i should there's a reporter from the atlantic who has who has been really asking the atlantic has been asking to do a detailed embedded profile of us you my team and i think maybe they were a little bit shrewder than me on this said well we want to be careful about this i said what the hell let him in you know we're we talk to everybody strategy we've committed to something stick to it practice what we preach so he came to columbus ohio and then he was going to come on a on a private flight to whatever campaign stops we were making culminating the lead up to the first debate and there was something funny about this guy i forget his name okay but the first thing he says it's a weird it's like bizarre he has a he has a very mild mannered affect and he goes out of his way to say multiple times i have a stutter i was like okay i don't care if you have a stutter i mean it doesn't matter to me but he went out of his way for me to understand that he had a stutter and he told my wife and everybody else he met apologizing profusely i have a stutter so don't mind me on this my wife is is it has a wisdom that i don't but she said just be careful about this guy because of that fact right it's not that he had a stutter it's that he went out of his way to point that fact out to us that she says i think he's he's looking to potentially exploit you just be careful with him i didn't take it one way or another she you know ended up being a kaisar so kind of kind of character is what what for those of you who who know the movie reference there anyway he he he he you know follow me around builds a lot of sympathetic rapport with me and you know ends up really somewhat of intellectual smart guy ended up able to be leveling with the arguments that i was making demonstrating his sympathy for the essence not just the superficiality but the essence of the arguments so i feel like i'm really leveling with somebody by this point in the campaign we had learned a lesson so so what my press secretary she smartly had the habit of anytime a recorder is recording the conversation she also goes on the record and records the conversation yeah that's a good idea on the record let's make it mutually on the record now she has worked she has worked had you know 247 for a lot of the campaign one of the weekends she had she had to go to a wedding okay and this was a week this was during the flight that this gentleman and i were taking to a campaign stop where we were headed so now he has me without the without my sort of presid person near me and i think without without being in recording he he's got his recorder on the plane okay so we're talking and i'm foolishly just you know talking away like i'm talking to a friend here to a guy who's already ingratiated himself a little bit softened his image with me i almost felt even even a little bit a little bit saddened for the guy that he had this loss of self-confidence based on some attribute that wasn't his own and seemed like a smart guy and so we're talking and he he pulls out so about two weeks before something had happened where i was on one of these podcasts and a guy by the name of alex stein asks me he he's coing kind of a quasi comedic podcast and he asked me do you believe what the governments told you about 911 and i said do i believe everything governments told me about 911 well the reality is we know the governments lied to us based on declassified documents that came out 20 years after 911 that omar albumi who was a individual who was previously deemed to be a 42-year-old graduate student that randomly met two of the hijackers that was the story that the 911 commission and the fbi published 20 years ago turned out in the declassified documents 20 years later was a saudi intelligence operative so we know the government lied about that so based on that hard fact of course the we don't believe everything the government has told us about this now that statement was the fodder it's the classic move take something in the context of a podcast style conversation airlift that to the conversation about okay so here's the conversation we had on the airplane he says all right i believe the government should tell the truth about what we know about what happened on january 6th and that's something i have been very vocal about during the campaign i think government should tell us everything everything's fair game were there fbi agents in the field tell us were there fbi agents in the field were there fbi informants in the field just answer the question transparently most of the mainstream media throughout the campaign has said that the fbi director has said there were none actually that's false christopher ray when he's responding to congress refused to answer the question which the media has then later reported as saying that he said there were none so i said ' whatever is just tell us the truth and so we have a detailed must be a 20-minute conversation easily about my view on the government's obligation to just be transparent whatever it is just let the public tell the truth publish all the video footage don't disclose some video footage and high others just tell the public the truth we the people deserve the truth so then he asked me okay well were there federal agents in the field on january 6 you know do you think it's a fair question to say were their federal agents on the plane on 911 now this is i mean this is a looney idea right nobody this is not out a shred of evidence for this but in the context of my principled answer saying that for january 6th or for anything else the government should just tell the people the truth said look the government should tell the people the truth whatever it is i have no reason to believe that there were federal agents on the plane it's a ridiculous idea to think there were but whatever it is the government should tell the truth to the people okay on that on that segment and it was one snippet of a maybe a 30 minute conversation on this topic which is a broader two-hour conversation during a flight the story comes out this is right on the eve of the debate okay and the story comes out from the atlantic it's in a detailed story goes into a lot of other things the one thing that the editor-in chief or whoever the main editor guy is at the atlantic puts out and highlights is ramaswami fuels conspiracy theories asking whether there are federal agents on the planes on 911 so this is weeks later after he's come so i truthfully like i remember the january 6 conversation this was a one-off snippet i didn't remember saying that and i just told my team i was like i don't i don't remember saying that i mean clearly these people have reporting standards he was recording a conversation he's reporting on something can you just ask the atlantic just share with us the recording where i said it just from my own knowledge of what i even said it was a free flowing conversation i'm not denying the way i was quoted but just tell me what i said they refused to now cnn this comes full circle from the don lemon has their own vengeance to square has booked me that night okay and and boy are they coming ready and i'm sure there's coordination it was it was done in a level at which it would be hard to believe there's not some level of coordination here so cnn's booked me that night and they asked me the question so so i know i'm going to get asked about this so i'd like to know so we just respectfully asked the atlantic what did i actually say just tell me what what do you have what's the thing that you're quoting here in the article because then the article goes on there's a bunch i'm being panned across the spectrum left and right at this point and they refused to provide it so i go on cnn and she says you know why did you say why are you saying that there could have been federal officers on the plane on 911 so i've never thought such a thing it's a rid it sounds to me like a ridiculous proposition so i say look i don't think i said that i think i was i was misquoted or taken out of context that's the truth of it and i think that what i did not realize is that's when they knew they had won cuz she went out of her way to say oh i take you your word there okay what they had then within hours of that interview airing the atlantic slices just that portion where he's questioned me after the detailed discussion about january 6 would it be fair for the government to ask the question of where their were their agents on the plane on 911 just release that snippet and then cnn and the entire media has a field day cuz the entire slogan of my campaign is speak the truth right speak the truth when it's easy when it's hard truth is the one word slogan of my campaign they use this to damage the hell out of me and so i asked the atlantic we said publicly you release the snippet why don't you release the entire conversation why would you to this day they haven't done it and to this day i will challenge them if you want to be honest arbiters of it cnn the whole next day running an entire field day saying that he said i have and if you listen to the exact footage it's even different than the describe it the exact footage is sure i think the government should tell the truth i have no reason to believe there were it seems like a ridiculous idea that there should be but whatever it is the government should tell the truth that's what i said which they summarize as saying that i'm raising conspiracy theories that there were federal agents on the plane on 911 ridiculous now you now you attribute that to so let's go into the attribution so obviously this was somewhat shocking for you shocking yeah okay so now but you you've already set up some diagnosis of the motivation you said that as far as you were concerned the legacy media wasn't very happy with you sidest stepping them let's say even though at that point you didn't really have an alternative they also weren't very happy with the fact that their attempts to pigeon hole you let's say had backfired quite spectacularly and then you had this character from the atlantic who played i'm i'm your friend while you invited him in only to try to find one of these situations where something you said could be taken out of context to savage your reput but but but but there there's the rub like why exactly is it is it just the additive combination of the reporter wants to make a name for himself the atlantic wants to have a story cnn wants to capitalize on it along with the fact that well it would be lovely to throw some dirt on a republican because what the hell why not and to paint him with this right-wing conspiracy theory like is that sufficient is that the causal explanation for the manner in which that laid itself out and then we'll get back to what effect that had at the debate yeah so i don't think it was sufficient all those things were were definitely factors but i think this was in the context of something is going as it's not supposed to here okay there's a guy here who is advancing a trumpian worldview of positive i think of it as a positive nationalism but nationalism nonetheless in the united states and he is defying our expectations for what that's supposed to look like because he speaks in a manner that is at least as i'm not saying this about myself i'm saying this what i think they see in me as audite and educated from the halls of the same ivy league colleges that they that they deemed to be their esteemed institutions and speaking in a manner that goes toe-to-toe on the facts with debating so-called the science on issues relating to covid policy or otherwise that we're unable to contend with this is a real threat we need to go after this in a deeper way because he's not given us the video clips from speeches that we can caricature we need to actually set the traps and this needs to be quashed it needs to be quashed now and by the way this social media thing that's sidest stepping us to hell with that that's creating the disinformation that's creating the alternative the misinformation that allows candidates like this to rise it is our job and our social responsibility as a media institution to extinguish that possibility let's punish his ability to do that by lifting some of the comments he's made in those lwd settings offline from the traditional media that individual citizens are beginning to access to their own peril and set the record straight for how this is done were're the people who vet who actually become serious presidential candidates when he's a non-serious contender who cares but this guy's rising in the polls to become a serious presidential candidate could really have an impact in shaping public opinion we have an ability and a responsibility to make sure that doesn't happen cut his legs off i think was exactly what happened and then you have the industrialized politics in a republican primary where that provides the fod for other candidates who were frustrated by the same thing happening to be able to use that to their advantage not even the candidates but in many cases even the super pacs supporting them which is part of this industrialized cess poool of the modern industry of american politics that's really what happened

some observations and then respond to them and and you can tell me you flesh that out so first of all all i spent a lot of time working with democrats in the us and i've pulled back on that attempt in over the last two years i would say because i got tired of having to walk on eggshells with absolutely 100% of everything i said all the time the the idea was to attempt to pull the democrats on the moderate side away from the radical progressives who they're so foolishly aligned with and against whom they refuse to erect any barriers whatsoever and so i've spoken to a lot more republicans more recently and i found that a lot more straightforward even when we don't see eye to eye i don't have to watch what i say and there's almost always a genuine exchange of information now when i went down to where was the where was the debate where was it held the first one was in i'm losing track here i i know the stage it was in it was in of course in in in wisconsin that was where the in yes okay so i was actually i was impressed with the the field of candidates that the republicans had offered i thought that the debate was the debate was more rigorous and intellectually engaging than i expected it to be it was a real spectacle in the american sense and you americans are unbelievably good at that and so it also had that but then it was interesting watching you because what i saw was that first of all you were a focus of attention for the rest of the candidates not the only one but certainly our focus of attention i think it does reflect what you just described and you also elicited more positive and more negative response from the audience than any of the other candidates right and so now and so i'm interested in in the personal element of that this was i'm not exactly sure what it was like for you to be on the stage with these political heavyweights comparative political heavyweights let's say and holding your own it wasn't much before that where it was not as not written in stone that you were even going to be part of the debate so this is very new for you so what do you what did you think of the other people who you shared the stage with what do you think you did well and and what do you think you did well and what would have you liked to have improved with regard to your performance for that particular event yes so i'm still reflecting on a lot of this and i haven't landed on firm conclusions yet but i can tell you you know some maybe half baked you know or some some some incoit reflections here okay i went into that feeling a great sense of liberation and fun that was my strategy okay and we even we even put a fine point on that you know i was playing hours of tennis and working out and we put out some videos on social media you know almost mocking the process to be honest with you it was a little smug of me to do it i have to admit that but i had it was it was a smugness that i kind of acquired as a little bit of a defense mechanism against what was already a poisonous system by that point right you have a media that systematically ignored me and then finding my way to prominence nonetheless with the actual voters sidest stepping the media which is no easy thing to do systematically punish the super packs of the other candidates in the leadup to that presidential debate i mean you had you know i mean i'm not picking on anybody here but you take nikki haley mike pence all of their political consultants you know lot ronda sanz's machine basically every other one this is all public record were in the leadup to the debate online and otherwise issuing directed criticisms towards me foregrounding what was coming on the debate stage and so i kind of entered the moment with and i don't hold that against the other candidates just how this game is played but i entered that stage with the feeling of somewhat of a sense of disdain for the process the industrialization of this and what i saw were the products of it which were in many cases other professional politicians i had a sense of disdain i also had a sense you said you pointed to the fact that some of that might have been defensive you know because i think so i think so right because i think okay well it's very interesting because that's a common defensive reaction but it definitely has dangers especially when you're in engaged in the process right i mean it's a weird thing because you're part of it clearly part of it and then you can see where it goes sideways and you have to criticize where it goes sideways but you're still in you're in the game and so you can't be contemptuous of it because what the hell are you doing in the game if you're contemptuous of it so that's real it was it was it was it had a layers of paradox to it so so even in the leadup to the debate as others were attacking me my mode was let me not just attack them and the lead up to the debate but let me in as you know i would say it was pretty condescending manner putting out here's my debate prep and i put out a shirtless video of me playing tennis we're we're working out we're doing all kinds of fun things and kind of saying one of these is not like the others and and it was it had a certain contempt to it i i'll admit that it had a it had a contemptuous tenor to that heading into the debate which of course only threw fuel on the fire and the irritation of the existing system and to some extent the other candidates as well so that might have also that might have also accounted for the of course expanded emotional response he because when you said positive things the crowd was very enthusiastic but i suspect now now that you've told me this i suspect that the more exaggerated negative response was probably a crowd reaction to that to that leaking in of disdain you yes absolutely and and i'm you know we're we're being pretty pretty unfiltered here but i think that it's a good thing for people to be able to see behind the curtain a little bit of what is otherwise a shrouded process so so anyway we start this we start the debate and i'm going in that night i'm not one to be naturally prepped in this setting and so there was some minimal amount of prep that i did which felt very unnatural to me and so the day of i just made a decision i'm g to have fun i'm g to have fun one or another it's a hell of an experience as this is a life experience and i'm going to just speak in a pretty unfilled aled way and i'm going to be a fighter like we feels like you're going into an arena you're you're going to have a fight roll up your sleeves in a little bit of a gladiator spirit having fun when you're going in there don't play with kid gloves bring your brass knuckles and let's go have a fight and i think that that's the tenor i was in going in there and so i think from that point in the campaign forward right that effectively became my modus opendi first was nobody was relevant nobody viewed me as relevant not even hearing my ideas second phrase is they're hearing my ideas but in a actual i would say i hope i tried to be respectful manner with the left right the people who are actually ideologically on the other side that created this this ground swell of verality which then caught the entire political system the establishment in the republican political industry which is different from actual earnest candidates and the mainstream media by storm the arrows then start coming in somewhat is a defense mechanism and somewhat because i didn't see a better alternative i just said okay well i'm just going to fight i'm going to take the take the gloves off and i'm going to be a fighter for the rest of this and i'm going to have fun while i'm at it ended up being my attitude going into that first debate and what we saw and i think that was basically the tenor from there for the second half of the race was me being somebody who was i didn't i didn't proactively hit anybody who hadn't hit me but my rule from on was if you're going to hit me because it had just begun to you know i it wasn't relevant now it's relevant but the relevance came in the form of being hit whoever it is republican democrat media i don't care if you hit me i'm going to hit you back 10 times harder and i'm going to be unsparing about it and that's what effectively that first debate ended up being it's what most of the remaining debates ended up being it won me a lot of fans i will say the fans who loved me for doing it still ended up voting for who they saw the ultimate figh of all which is donald trump but they loved me as their second choice and i think in many of the polls what we saw by the end was the second choice ranking to donald trump i'd be number one in the rest of the field but that still left me with only 8% of the vote in in iowa 7.8% of the vote in iowa but it did actually probably lose me a lot of other supporters from the remainder who actually once they were finally hearing my ideas which keep in mind for the first half of the race they hadn't but by definition once they really heard my ideas they were actually prepared to latch on to that but were put off by the pugnacious way that i handled the way that i was getting hit and so that's the real story of the reflection as i said it's still not i'm still in the process of reflecting on much of what happened last year there's the first kind of conversation like this that i've had reflecting on it but i think that's effectively what happened is i was unconstrained i was a fighter and i'm proud of being a fighter i think we need a fighter who leads for the country but i think we need more than that too and i believe i bring more than that but the formats that i was given in that latter half of the race allowed for people to see that i am a fighter and that i am and i'm proud of it and i won't apologize for it but there was no other forum for people to see the other dimensions of my ability to be a leader and dare i say a uniter for the country other than in-person settings of 50 to 200 people at a time which is what i ended up gravitating to in that latter half of the race in those final months of the race i ended up doing you know hundreds of events in iowa which i was the life was experience of a lifetime by the way i mean this was really probably some of the most emotionally challenging and testing period i've been through where i'm not approaching these with canned lines right i'm treating each interaction with somebody at a pizza ranch in iowa as though it's the first time i'm answering that question that was the standard i held myself to so every day you're waking up at 7:00 a.m. in some cases 11 events over the course of a day you'd be going to bed at midnight the next day do it again did more events in iowa than the rest of the field combined i ended up resorting to that because that was a setting in which for the people who saw me there which ended up being a tiny portion of the electorate i think the feedback i would get right because we would do photo lines whenever there was a whenever there was an opportunity i would stay till the very last person had left the number one piece of feedback i heard and and i didn't know how to take this well was you're really different than what i thought of you coming out of the debates and not not everyone meant it in a bad way or a good way but it was just genuinely fascinating to people that okay like this is a different side of you that i did not see when i saw you at the debates and i think most people meant it in the sense that the people who were in those rooms say i wasn't necessarily thinking about voting for you i was intrigued based on what i saw in the debates i wanted to meet you i didn't think i was going to vote for you but i'm going to vote for you now the issue is you're talking about a few thousand people max that you touch that way right if you're just talking about individual events of 50 to 100 people at a time and that just wasn't enough to win an election that's mostly decided by people who are accessing their information in ways other than showing up in the middle of a blizzard or a winter at a pizza ranch in iowa and so that was you know in a nutshell i think a a summary of of the trajectory of the year and some of the things i learned in the process and you know there's a million small things i probably would do differently if given the opportunity again just the first time of course i i would have expected that and it is the case that there are a million small things i would have done differently but in a big picture sense am i grateful that i ran and took the risk and bore the cost financial and nonfinancial associated with doing it yes i am brought our family closer together it's probably one of the most important things that i did is so so you were one of the few people i talked to before i ran one of the people i talked to also before i ran for genuine advice when i was thinking through i was inclined to do it but i wasn't certain yet was actually talking to tucker carlson beforehand and he gave me probably the two simple best piece advice he didn't have much by way of advice but he had two pieces of advice that were gold i think the first he said was whatever your personal bubble is so your family environment your closest friends travel with that and keep them around you and that will keep you ground it was very practical but that actually was really good advice we ended up doing it as a family he said hold yourself to a standard right and and he for each person this will be different what he told me but here's what he said is do whatever would make your wife proud of you okay and he said it with a smile on his face but not as a joke as as a serious matter so so it's a certain sense that assumes that you're with a life partner and you and i have talked about this before for i one of the things i'm blessed with in my life is to actually have found my soulmate and to be married in in married to my soulmate is something that is not something that everybody gets to say but i think tucker told me do something that makes make sure everything you do makes your wife proud travel with your friends and family around you so that you don't get sucked into the circumstance of waking up in some sort of muddied haze wondering where i am on a given day and then becoming some alternative version of yourself a lot of people get sucked into doing that don't it i followed both those pieces of advice and i think that that made the process one that i'm grateful for regardless of the fact that it didn't achieve the result that i intended which was to be the next president of the united states it brought our family closer together it brought me in closer touch with my own convictions i think you're tested on a daily basis i probably came out of that year with an even greater certainty of my own convictions than i went into it with i thought i had high conviction going in but you don't really understand your own convictions until you've been tested and in a few instances dare i say it even had convictions that were slightly different than where i began the campaign with and for anybody else who didn't go through that experience without having their views modified in some way means you're probably not a person who's open to open to reflection i mean you can't be challenged on a daily basis for a year without having your own own views sharpened along the way and so i think our family is stronger for it my views and my convictions are stronger for it didn't achieve the intended result but it does give me a greater and renewed sense of purpose and mission to still do whatever i can to save this country even if it's not going to be as the next president and i'm grateful for that at the end of it there's lots of places we can go from there but i i want to go let's try two to begin with the first i'm curious about i've been going through the biblical stories in my on my tour and in this new book i'm writing and moses in that book is the archetype of the of a leader that's what that story is about and moses is seriously punished by god for reverting to power when invitation and explanation would suffice that's his temptation right and you could imagine that that's the temptation of a political leader is especially as your reputation grows the club that you can wield gets larger and larger as you're more and more influential and so i'm wondering if that proclivity that you described for that tilt that that temptation towards disdain and fighting back you know i i'd like to unack that a little bit more because you you lay out a very clear clear case for why that all emerged but then you also said that to some degree that interfered with people's ability to see who you were on the really on the leader front rather than on the fighter front let's say and i'm not saying i know how to negotiate that because i don't it's obviously an extremely complicated space but so let's let's assess that in reflection do you think there are ways that you would conduct yourself going forward if you replicated your adventure and then i'd also like to delve more into your relationship with trump drawing on something that you did say earlier you know you you you said that perhaps part of the reason the legacy media went after you was because they saw you providing the same attractive message to say disaffected workingclass americans that trump managed except you could do it in a manner that was int actually credible now you you were careful during your campaign in my estimation to not poke the bear that's trump or his followers for that matter and so i'd like to explore your relationship a bit more with trump and i'd also like you to comment a bit more on that contradiction between fighting and pushing and laying out of an attractive in invitational vision yeah so i'll start with that latter piece it's a hard thing to do and i i don't see a particular for myself at least a point to relitigate you know what i would have done differently you know i think circumstances in some ways in some ways it's hard to imagine it going any differently because the path that led there was the entire path that i walked through in our conversation it was almost unavoidable because at that point if i if i it was a sort of damned if you do damned if you don't situation because i put myself in a situation which was the only way to get on the map that had invited the level of arrows that i was taking from the other candidates from the media and you know from the traps that were laid and from the political industrial complex that if i didn't hit back i'd be too weak to be the president of the united states and wouldn't deserve that job and there was no other way other than to hit back and hit back hard but the window of formats that reaches people is sufficiently narrow that it doesn't allow for multiple aspects of a personality to come through right so you're going to you get you get one label you're able to get through to the people in the mediums that are available to you in the media i don't really mean in just the corporate media but the collective mediums that are available to you fighter was the one that came through and so could i have done it differently i don't know i i certainly was was unable to cuz the truth is i am a fighter but i'm not just a fighter but that's what came across when people were finally paying attention to the candidacy and the reality is and and understandably so for many voters if you want a fighter in the white house take the one who's proven who has taken more arrows far more than i have and overcome them that was donald trump which was many of the people who loved me the most i mean like really love me as as supporters like the people who are guys who were maybe coming to 15 20 events that i held in iowa people who are enthusiastic supporters speaking still caucus for donald trump right and and i don't blame them for it because if what you see is the value proposition is here's a young fighter who's going to fight for me and fight for this country just as hard as he fights to defend himself against the treacherous media and political industrial complex i love that and i'm going to vote for donald trump because he has proven at a scale that nobody has that that's guy who's going to be able to do it so that's that's what ended up happening there but on a go forward basis i guess the differen is and i i i don't know what's next for me the truth is i'm keeping a very open mind the only criteria is have an impact on the country that's positive and not small as i said it takes as much effort to do something small as it does to do something big large scale positive impact in saving this country and reviving who we are whatever i do next it's going to fit that description but let let's say let's say that there was a you know a replay of it but you're starting from where we left off right this last time i'm not starting from the place i did last yeah right right and so you're not it's one thing to fight for relevance and then fight to be perceived in the right way if you're starting to already from the place of relevance but then the question is just making sure people understand who you really are you know in some ways you can't it's like an algebra problem right you can you can only solve for one variable with one equation at a time and so in some ways i was with one equation the one linear race trying to solve for both two variables one of relevance and the other one of actually being seen the correct way you had to kind of pick one sleep is a foundation for a mental and physical health in

is your kick at the can it i don't feel having watched what you did that you're exhausted as a political candidate especially given how young you are right okay okay so so so you know maybe you maybe you laid the groundwork for something that could emerge in the future now there's a variety of ways that could go everyone can see that you've had a fair bit of interaction with trump after the after your run for presiden you know came to its end everyone of course is wondering what that might hold in the future what's your sense of what you could bring and might bring to the table assuming that a trump presidency is realized in november well the first thing i would say is i think it would be a mistake to just rest on one's laurels as a candidate and assume that is the outcome so the first thing i'm focused on is making sure that we do have a trump presidency in november doing everything i can traveling different parts of this country campaigning for trump not just through the primary which is now you know effectively and has been for a while over but in the general election against biden reaching young voters reaching non-traditional voters i mean even you think about asian-americans or indian-americans i think 70% went the direction of biden last time around despite the fact that their valu is almost undoubtedly more aligned with the pro excellence agenda that trump stands for now young people in this country who are starving for purpose and meaning we've talked about this in our last episode that we did together well the left isn't providing that or they're satisfying it with the equivalent of fast food with race and gender and sexuality and climate a positive nationalistic vision that says that you know what this is a country that is the greatest country known to mankind and you have an opportunity not only to live here but to contribute to this country and pass that on to the next generation that civic sense of duty fills what many young people are starving for and i think that that's far more aligned with the message trump is delivering than the nonsense they're hearing from biden or the other side and so my focus in the near- term is don't take some outcome for granted make sure that trump is elected as the next president do everything i can in my power to make that happen and in the meantime you know if there are opportunities to continue to drive positive change through the private sector as i was doing before i ran for president let me have added the perfect opportunity to do it i mean strive is a company i co-founded as you know to push back against the esg movement i'm incredibly proud of progress which is going very well p i'm very proud of stries accomplishments and i and and mentoring some of the other businesses that i've co-founded to have positive impact for-profit nonprofit through the private sector a lot of ways to drive change and then make sure that that electoral outcome is what it is in november i think that's actually the top objective and one of the things i found in my life at least is when you make these elaborate personal plans right you know if this happens then i'm going to do that thing and if the other thing happens then i'm going to do the other thing and if that doesn't happen then here's my plan b at least in my life i've learned that your plans are stupid okay at least maybe not yours but mine my plans are stupid and so i'm guided by my purpose that's great the plan will reveal itself but the purpose is the same one that i entered the race with which was to revive who we are revive our missing national identity and self-confidence pass that on to my kids and their generation i volunteered to do it as the next president the people of this country made clear certainly in the republican party and i think far beyond that that they want donald trump to do that job thankfully his ideology is you know very similar to mine in terms of what it means to advance an america first agenda and so i've put all my energy into to making sure that donald trump is elected the next president the reason i support trump is because i support america first values because i support this country it's not the other way around but that's i think the reason most people who support trump feel that way and i view it the same way is we're going to do whatever we can to revive our country the number one most impactful thing we can do is have a us president that shuts down and eviscerates much of that managerial bureaucracy in the federal government that revives our sense of national pride does some basic things that americans across the political spectrum agree on from shutting the border to growing the economy i clearly believe that donald trump is the man to get that job done and i'm going to make sure that he succeeds at it okay so your next your next party your next plan is okay is to continue the campaign and now you made reference back to the way we started our conversation and so let's pursue that a little bit i'd like to know more about what you now know or believe you know about the political industrial complex right i mean you said that you got into the race to begin with because you were concerned about the proliferation of something like a midlevel tyranny right which i think is something that we're seeing all around the world it's a collusion between mid-level state actors they're usually not elected they don't have to face the electorate they're not on the hook for their own economic survival because they're paid bureaucrats they've extended their domains radically at every level of political organization and i think part of the reason that the magot types who are firmly behind trump are behind trump is because they feel in their bones that trump is enough of a bowl in the china shop to actually pose a challenge to that system so i would like and the you know the example of the argentinian current argentinian president keeps popping into the back of my mind because he's doing the kind of radical cuts in argentina that that musk did for example at twitter and so i would like to know first of all do you actually think now that you've seen this the system per se operate at close hand do you think that it's actually possible for a candidate even trump who's only got a fouryear mandate which is not very long to have the power no have the ability to make a difference in this in relationship to this unbelievably entrenched widespread system so i'd like to know how you feel about the political industrial complex that you've now come up against and are also now a part of right peculiarly enough peculiarly enough and isn't that interesting how that works i would say it's not possible to reform it it is possible to decimate it okay i think and that's what it's going to require this rise of this managerial class you see it in the deep state in the federal government or the fourth branch of government the un eled bureaucrats who are unties but you exactly it's not just in the deep state it's the manager class the associate dean of god knows what the ambassador under secretary to something or other the people who are sitting professionally on a board of directors the people who are the political consultants populating the industrialization of our political politics it's a horizontal managerial class who are neither ordinary citizens in their own right nor are they actual purposeful creators who are able to create something of inherent value but are the intermediating managers right that's what's sucking the lifeblood out of our culture and our country and i would go so far as to say the modern west as we know it and so is it possible to reform that beast no i think you have to slay that beast and i think it is possible for a chief executive you could take it of a university you could take it of the country of the executive branch of the united states of america of a company you could go one by one but but for a strong chief executive who is at least least on paper vested with the authority to run an organization to take what's on that piece of paper and actualize it to actually run that organization and the system isn't set up for it it isn't set up for a political candidate to really run their campaign it's done by the industrialized machine around them it isn't set up for the chief executive of the executive branch the president of the united states to run that executive branch or that bureaucracy it's not naturally set up that way and it's not set up for the president of university to run the the you know endless committees of of associate deans it's the committee class that permeates each of these institutions even for large fortune 500 companies you might have hr heads who are exercising greater hiring policy decisions than the ceo so that's not the default but it takes the kind of executive who will overcome that activation energy to say i'm going to break that system anyway i'm i'm not going to fall for the siren song of saying that i can reform it reform isn't possible but will i take the risk and it is a risk and there will be costs to it of saying i'm not bringing some sort of chisel i'm bringing a chainsaw a jackhammer to the whole thing raising it to the ground burning it and then burning the ashes and then and then start with a blank slate and build a new if i have to and so the answer to your question is yes but that's what it'll take i watched what musk did with twitter with great interest and i've watched a number of leaders at a variety of corporations do something similar and revitalize their their respective companies you know it it's a it's often a lengthy process and you have to be a very particular sort of person to do it and i think people hope that trump can do it but but here's a danger that i see even in what you just said i understand your concern and i'm very sympathetic to it i know that since time immemorial the the evil brother of the rightful king has posed a archetypal threat to the integrity of the state abetted by the blindness of the king right and that the archetypal story is that that descends into stasis and then chaos and i feel that everyone feels that that's what's happening but there's another phenomenon that emerges when all that occurs and that phenomenon has been s symbolized as the dragon that eats its own pale that's the symbol of chaos that's uros and the fervor with which you just described that potentially destructive process the reason i'm pointing about out at that symbol is because there's an element of it that's similar to what the radicals on the left say you know that everything has to be burned to the ground that it has to be decimated that we have to start a new and i can see the critical conservatives and libertarians such as yourself inadvertently accidentally in some ways and even inevitably adopting the same dire prognosis right so what's the difference between your view of creative destruction let's say this is a very hard question what's your the difference between your view of creative destruction and the left this view that our institutions are terminally corrupt that we have to raise them to the ground and and start a new sure so i think that there is a different vision of what you create to fill the vacuum and what you've seen from the modern left is actually the very bureaucracies that they've they've created right this vestage of bureaucracy the committee class is indeed the product of what has cannibalized the institutions that once existed so we're not starting from a neutral starting point that's what i would say if we were starting from a neutral starting point we would start with a blank slate and ask what we need to build a new we need to get to that blank slate we're not even at that start line right now and so in some ways i think the overgrowth of that managerial class and that bureaucracy has itself been weaponized by the left that their tactics are no longer ones that say tear it down their tactics are weaponize what's already there to advance your ends right they're not tearing down the financial system the question is how do you weaponize the financial system to advance your own substantive end they're not tearing down the prosecutorial or justice system the question is how do you weaponize that justice system to go after your own political opponents and keep them from running against you in elections they're not tearing down corporate america they're leveraging corporate america okay so what you're pointing to there is the falseness is the falseness of that revolutionary claim that that's window dressing for acquisition of power and the and the use of the current of the current systems the systems that they purport to despise yes it's either a falseness dr peterson or it is a modern incarnation of the left that's different from the kind that existed when kl marx existed so or even when bernie sanders existed for that matter right even when even then when bernie sanders existed for that matter exactly it's it's a particularly new strain of the left that's a little bit different from the occupy wall street let's tear it down version this isn't that anymore they sort of i think in their you if you can't beat them join them became the mentality and don't do if you can't really tear it down through if you can't invade the castle through the front door you couldn't tear it down through the front door just invade it and infest it from the black back door and that's actually what's happened okay so you were you had a clarion call to leadership as you pointed out at the beginning of this interview because you believed that the the fundamental institutions upon which this country your country are predicated are are they're they're on the money they're on the money right and so the path forward that i've seen for the conservative types is to see what the leftists want to do let's say they let's talk about the ones who do want to tear it down they want to tear down the existing system and they want to rebuild it in accordance with the dictates of something approximating the radical left vision of marx let's say radical egalitarian ism that could extend even to the notion that something like property is theft so they're going to tear things down and they're going to rebuild it on on those principles now you guys in the united states you already have a set of principles and one of them is the principle of distributed responsibility right and so and that's the age-old medication that's offered when tyranny looms and chaos beckons it's that it's you don't fall prey to either of those and you don't fall prey to the dynamic you reinvent at the institutions of distributed responsibility now you've been pointing in that direction right because you've taken a pro family pro patriotic pro-america pro west right and i don't know what you know where it goes beyond that whether you're an enlightenment guy and and and how you view the interaction between all of that and the underlying judeo-christian foundation let's say but your your call and i'm hoping this is the case for trump too is your isn't merely to decimate it's to clear the path so that what's true and right can make itself manifest again which is what for example what musk was trying to do and i think did successfully at twitter he he got rid of 75% of the employees right but he wasn't trying to decimate the company he was trying to establish it on he was trying to establish ferle ground yeah exactly exactly and so the decimate it is the overgrowth i want to be really clear about this is right that's good to be very clear about that yeah is is is to is to tear down the cancerous overgrowth itself so i'm saying we're not trying to treat this tumor with symptomatic therapy right we want to we want to we want to decimate the tumor but the underlying organ is still what we want to save okay and i think that that's that's actually really okay so let me ask you about this tell me what you think about this like look you were attacked a lot and you said that one of the consequences of that was that well it got your your backup let's say and some of that was contaminated with a certain amount of disdain and we already walked through that and but you also pointed out something that's relevant in this context which is that the slings and arrows that were directed towards you are relatively trivial in comparison to the comp continual utter assault on trump at every every level of his life virtually and so my fear let's say is that he's so embattled and so pushed into a corner and so poked and prodded and provoked that he is he wise enough to separate his desire to clear away the overgrowth and let what's healthy survive or is he pushed into a corner enough so that that there are enemies everywhere and his wrath will know no bounds let's say so what do you think about them and you've got to know him a bit and like yeah so here's what i will say is is is is the man i've seen is i i'll reveal maybe two insights that are a little bit different from the media portrayals but true to my understanding of what i see one is i see a leader who is even more ambitious for the country as a consequence of some of his learnings from the first term i think the first term was incredibly successful look you got four years of trump four years of biden compare the results and make your vote accordingly and if that's the way this election goes i think trump will be elected as the next president but i don't think he views that as sufficient i think that he believes that there are a lot of lessons learned from that first administration that he is ambitious for our country to want to translate in that second term i think that's a real positive because that to me signals growth and it signals actual positivity towards the future to say that there's a lot of things that i will still have learned from that first term and that's an advantage he has relative to anybody else who ran for president is he actually has those learnings from having been in that office even relative to me with a very similar vision he's faced down that administrative state in a way that i've studied and have deep intuitions and knowledge about but haven't faced in the same way that he has and the second thing that i've noted about him is it this is in the last couple of months but he is very receptive to the best arguments for how to do that as long as i think they're delivered in the right digestible way that's e efficient and effective and thoughtful around him i don't think he has patience for long driveling of of you know anyone's oral diarrhea on a given day but if delivered in a pointed way i think that he is actually very open-minded to adopting ideas that weren't necessarily part of his agenda previously but if they're aligned with the actual vision and their ways of specific policies or specific actions to take that help advance the right america first vision for the country he's actually very receptive to that and the media portrays him as some sort of dogmatic single-minded man that's not what i see actually i see a leader who actually cares about the country who wants the best and brightest to give him and arm him with the tools he needs to turn that vision into reality i mean this is one publicly reported example so you know i'll feel free to talk about it i want to be respectful of the conversations i've had with him separately but since this was publicly reported i can speak to it is you know i was backstage with him in new hampshire this is after i dropped out and endorsed him and we spoke about the perils of a central bank digital currency and you you and i may have talked about this in other occasions i trust that you're familiar with some of those perils coming from the canadian side of this yeah yeah i'm i'm plenty familiar with them all so so what i what i admired about donald trump is he had on one hand an intellectual humility about him he didn't try to pretend to do what i know many politicians would do would try to recite some talking points they briefly memorized without understanding what the actual thing was he has the self-confidence to say well tell me about what that is and tell me about why it's bad well great that's actually an honest conversation to get to here's what it is here's why it's bad and then he also asked the further question of well then why are the advocates in favor of it right understand the best argument for the other side it's not just okay this is what i'm supposed to say so let me digest it what is the argument for the other side so we went through that and he didn't immediately adopt it right he asked a coule coup of other people for their views went on stage that night didn't talk about it that night but a few nights later we're in new hampshire and lo and behold and he didn't talked to me about this beforehand he comes out in his speech he he references my conversation with me backstage in his speech to the audience from a few nights before and says i will tell you tonight that i am against a central bank digital currency and here's why and the audience cheered and he had his own conviction in why he was offering it for something that even a matter of days before and it wasn't flippant he took a couple of days he understood the best arguments for the other side he consulted other people as well in the process and then came to a decisive answer that to me is a mark of a leader that isn't just behaving in a reactionary response which is what your concern was as expressed but somebody who is able to think through the right arguments to make sure the right policies are actually advancing the agenda rather than just reflecting whatever direction the winds of temper are blowing on a given day and i think that that that's really encouraging it encourages me and i think it should encourage every american and certainly every person who's voting for donald trump or every person who's open to voting for donald trump to know that that's actually what i think they're going to get and i do think it's going to take a i a responsibility of people around him to provide that to him in a way that allows him to lead but you know i think i'm going to do my part and i think the other people around him are going to do theirs to hopefully make that second term far more successful than what was already i think a very good first ter okay so let me close with one final question so when i was watching the republican primary know i was hoping initially that public opinion would fall behind desantis because i thought desantis has a credible pro-american truly conservative vision and he has administrative experience and the reason that i personally i'm only speaking personally and as a canadian you know preferred desantis to trump is because the the divisiveness that surrounds trump makes me very apprehensive and this is independent of his merits as a person and as a businessman perhaps even as a president trump the phenomenon of trump polarizes people to a degree that i think is unparalleled it's unparalleled in my memory in what and having watched the political scene for like five decades you know so i would like you to tell me why you think that polarization is so intense and what you think see because the the the the the real critical part of me thinks and i'm not saying i'm right about this but the trump presidency the trump phenomena is so divisive that i think the divisiveness itself poses a threat to the integrity of the country now and i thought that okay so so separate two things there one is does divisiveness itself just irrespective of trump does divisiveness itself represent a threat to this country of course it does i think this country is skating on thin ice we're at risk of dividing to a breaking point i put a lot of that in the media i put a lot of that in the industrialization of politics i put a lot of that in the super pack puppet mastery that characterizes modern politics i think that you shouldn't have congressmen who are i think you need term limits i think congressmen should not be able to trade individual stocks i think that the administrative state needs term limits i think the people who we elect to run the government should actually run the government those are things that left or right people agree on in this country policies that you get to speak your mind openly as long as i get to in return inherently most people in their value set are not actually divided but is the projection the artifice of division created but by the projection of the media that creates the appearance of division that then becomes the new reality so that's where i think it's actually coming from and then trump is trump the treatment of trump is really just a symptom of that the media puts him in in such a box to create a caricature of a man that is part of the broader project of division they're creating irrespective of trump they've just used trump as another vehicle in achieving the divide and conquer strategy of a small group of people who benefit from that division okay so you think for example i don't want to put words in your mouth but your sense would would have been for example that had disantis emerged as the republican leader instead of trump that the same forces would have turned him into another trump let's say in the public imagination that this is actually a consequence i don't think that i don't think that any other person you know you know you know desantis or anyone else would have been a cure to the problem that you're concerned about now do i see an opportunity to level up as a movement and say we're not just against what the other side puts up which is a temptation but to say this is what we're actually running to these are our affirmative values of what we stand for right what is the opposite of the great reset sovereignty sovereignty at the level of the individual and the family and the nation and god that's what it means to be a conservative that's what grounds our shared american values that's that's our identity well that's the identity that can be offered confused young people right subsidiary identity and as a leader i'm leading you there yes i see that opportunity and you know even in the last couple of months and i want to respect a all the conversations we've had but in the last couple of months one of the things that donald trump has said that i think inspires me and i hope inspires people across this country is you know what our vengeance will be success will be our vengeance success is unifying and so i see the earliest direction of us beginning to go in a direction he said that did he that's that's a good line that's a good line i agree with you on that i i very much agree with you on that and i think that that is a unifying message success is unifying and as he said it success is our vengeance well that's the vengeance that you americans took against the soviet union yes in many ways even against the british empire in the american revolution in in some ways but very much against the soviet union in the cold war success was our vengeance against against that enemy and success can be our vengeance even against the enemy that we face of our own division and so i think that i am cautiously optimistic that we may be stronger on the other side of this division as a bone heals stronger after it is broken yes the bone of our identity has been broken but it can emerge stronger on the other side and for the next four years this may not just be a four-year project for the next four years i believe donald trump is the best positioned person to lead us there i think it is the respons his responsibility and the responsibility of people around him to make sure he's as successful as he can be in getting us there but it's not just a foure project it took us 30 years to get to where we are right now with the assault on our institutions and our national identity and our national division it could very well take more than four years to find our way out of it to be stronger on the other side but for the next four years i'm optimistic that this can be the beginning of a step in that direction well that's a very good place to stop thank you very much for speaking with me again and making your experiences available to everyone who's watching and listening i wish you the best of luck ne negotiating these very complex high waters over the next few months it's going to be fascinating to watch this unfold i think we decided the last time we last couple of times we spoke to check in every four months or something like that i think we should keep doing that as this progresses so that everybody can stay of what's yeah yeah and useful a fun for me actually good good good good well in good luck helping promote that positive and unifying vision like that's it would be lovely if trump's campaign could turn more and more to that as he's simultaneously defending himself from the multi-dimensional assaults that assail him but that vision of distributed responsibility that is the time tested antidote to tyranny and slavery right and it is the fundamental realization of governance that your country is founded on that principle of subsidiarity and it's such a great call to adventure for young people it's like take your place in a marriage take your place in a family take your place in a community bear a load you know all the responsibility you abdicate personally will be taken up and used against you by tyrants that's the iron law of humanity right and so that's a great thing for everyone to understand and i'm hoping the conservatives can run with that you know because there isn't another pathway forward that isn't chaos and tyranny so i'm hopeful and i promise you i'll do everything in my power to make it so all right sir to everyone watching and listening thank you very much for your time and attention to the film crew here in toronto today thank you guys for setting this up to everybody who's watching and listening your time and attention is much appreciated i hope you found the conversation useful and revealing and be it's always a pleasure talking to you and you know keep the flag flying man thank you i appreciate it take care [music]
