i put 100 people inside of a giant circle and whoever leaves the circle last wins 500 000 but if you touch the red line it's game over i don't care how long this takes whichever one of you leaves last wins half a million dollars five hundred thousand dollars oh i cleared my schedule i am literally good for the next three weeks carolina takes weeks months it doesn't matter how long are you staying in this circle well i took off work until january first you took off work for the next six months literally 100 people this place is packed they brought grass down the possibilities there's only one smart thing to do is to begin the hibernating process this guy right here is already thinking about getting out he might be our first loser to be honest there's a hundred people here i'm not gonna win what's the point hey everybody this guy just said he wants to get out all right let's see it he's over playing this so much just step out even though you got out first i still have a prize for you just wait here congratulations you just won a brand new car for being first out who would have thought being a loser would pay off someone just left honestly i knew he'd be first i smelled the weakness from the beginning massive morale boost if everyone's weak like that they're gonna be gone in no time time to update the board 99 remain good luck knowing they can win a random prize definitely wore a few people down and after a couple of hours things got a little emotional this is gonna change my life tomorrow i'm gonna take a lot of this and pay my bills thank you so much i was not expecting that she's got me about to cry i can't wait to see how the person that wins the half a million dollars at the end of the video reacts we're about to raise the stakes i hope you guys like filet mignon we got you all escaped they said the filet mignons yeah i'm just casually eating a steak and a pile of money they're gonna be feeding us like this i could be here like for the rest of the year it's now night time of the first day and 94 people are still in this little do they know i have something in store for them in the morning now it's time i introduced the twist at the end of each day we're gonna shrink the circle a little bit we're going to bring the new line to is that good i'll do a little bit more all right i'll go ahead and start filling it in nope when the camera cuts someone else will do it after seeing the new circle a few people started to crack jimmy jimmy so you're gonna play him and rock paper scissors if you lose you'll get up are you kidding rock paper scissors shoot imagine losing 500 000 on a single game of rock paper scissors that was the dumbest thing ever there was no upside they just wouldn't stop getting out one after another it seems like two days in a circle is most people's limit there's someone sleeping on a cereal box it's nighttime of the second day and carl decided to start some trouble one second i think i just watched one of the guys reach over the line no way oh that's half a million dollars with fruit snacks right there i don't know who threw the gummies not only have the contestants spent three days in that circle but we've spent three days living here i've been sleeping in that rv morale's getting a little low hoping breakfast is something a little bit better oatmeal boredom's starting to settle i don't like oatmeal it tastes like wet cardboard so this is pretty rough to be honest the circle's gonna shrink again not looking forward to that it's the start of the third day so we gotta shrink the circle again [music] i'm not letting chandler do this again chandler made this light so long this is kind of boring now the circle is fully painted as you can see we took a lot of space out of this circle and while we were painting it throughout this challenge we realized that if we give people things to do they'll occasionally mess up and touch the line which is exactly why we put this soccer goal here to see if we can get some people out i'm crossing my fingers i'm crossing my things you stepped on it right there the soccer goal worked it's the start of day number four so we gotta shrink the circle again chandler i'm gonna trust you this is like three more feet i'll see you when it's done and there you go it literally took two seconds to fill in the that's a lie line like magic you're lying it's been a few hours since someone got out carl i know what i need to do i wanted to give you guys music to listen to [music] it's just a 10-hour loop does that make anyone want to get out this is music to my ears because i press snooze every time do you think anybody's going to leave because of this i don't think anybody's going to leave because so you were saying you would get out for a brand new iphone yeah i need a new phone badly here you go right off into the sunset now that she's out we're gonna keep playing that they didn't like the phone alarm sound so now i'm playing man screaming [applause] hello [applause] it's just a fever dream now everyone wakes up screaming alive slowing down a little bit but i'm gonna try to keep going all right everybody you know what time it is we gotta shrink this circle right there jump cut boom i can move now the circle keeps getting smaller and people are dropping like flies halfway done [music] grass ball has taken over my entire mental capacity that's all i can think about i'm losing brain cells by the second i just lost 10. we started day six like usual by shrinking the circle since they want me to take a lot i'm just gonna take a little bit and then i made a mistake by putting nolan in charge if anybody's butt even touches a blade of grass you're out it's been five seconds and he's already instigated no making fun of nolan the standing challenge got one contestant out sorry bro simon says hit yourself in the face simon says do a push-up i can't do a push-up touching the ground so i'm not doing that all right just don't do it then your knee touched unfortunately your knee did touch the ground here's your thousand dollars i have so much power is this what jimmy feels like [music] do you all know why the party lights are on because you survived an entire week inside of the circle to celebrate an entire week inside of this circle i decided to give them a challenge with the tesla as a prize who wants a tesla the boys are rolling out a special tarp starting now all of you can walk on this thing right here if you can ride this and touch the tesla without touching the ground i'll let you keep it no you're not doing it i'm just scared okay oh he's gonna run all right everybody's back up let's see this running he's running they're literally engineering a team to win this manifesto all right he's on the tire they're about to launch no did he step out okay everyone time out we got review footage we'll be right back unfortunately cory definitely stepped on the line get rid of the thousand dollars give him five thousand dollars thank you for putting others above yourself then finally with the help of iraq to give a momentum jack did the unthinkable [music] [applause] before i brought the tesla in we had 36 people now we're down to 32. the numbers are dwindling it's day 8 and we needed to do something different so we split the contestants up by their shirt colors into quadrants today is day number eight and so far no one's gotten out so i made this mystery wheel because we need to get some people out who wants to spin it i'll spin it spin it hard though not no like half spin that's exactly what i was looking for congratulations you just won three thousand dollars he just spun and won three grand and he's going again david go for it all right let's see it he found an infinite money glitch how does he keep doing this jimmy came out saying we gotta get people out and david is rocking three briefcases i just don't think that could have gone any worse it's day nine and we lost another person during the evening but then something happened that i never would have expected oh my god did you guys see that one coming no let's give it up for them congratulations sounds like we need to get a briefcase for ten thousand dollars to go towards the wedding i've been in a circle for the past nine days but i could not be happier now it's time for a very important message we were too lazy to write the other half but you should still subscribe are you guys subscribed that's exactly why they're here hit the button you could be in a video and now it's time to shrink the circle for the day or instead of shrinking the circle we're expanding the lines but now it's time to introduce the difficult part earlier i asked them to pair up and now we're going to be duct taping the pairs together for the day for the rest of the day you could also no longer sit down day nine and guess what they did to us let's go forever together forever together forever how are you feeling i don't really like my partner that much so it's gonna be kind of hard well this is awkward earlier when i was explaining the rules this happened and i had the replay right here and as you can see he stepped on the line deal man first he loses a lamborghini and now half a million dollars neil buddy i pulled up the footage it's on the line i'm sorry neil all right i guess i'll take my wall here's two thousand dollars what's wrong we've been final two this whole time from day one and i was hoping i'd be there with him at the end but it's the game i've never seen a cure at this determined before he looks like a man that's gonna win this mark my words that man's gonna win this challenge i promise you get it here boys put the balance beam on that quadrant bring it on over now this is ten thousand dollars in cash i'm gonna set it right here any tankers ten grand on the line don't think about how this took nine days and if you fall it's all for nothing oh god let's see if david's luck continues i assume by your stance you do gymnastics i do yeah i can tell you look very calm all right all right that's all you it's wiggling it's wobbling why did we let a gymnast in this circle [applause] david has so far won nineteen thousand dollars without leaving the circle if anyone else not named david wants to have a go here's another ten thousand dollars and he's off there here's the bench that's a good pivot that's a good pivot how is everyone just robbing me of money at the moment i told you it was easy [applause] boys boys the balance beams got to go that did not go like i thought it would here's what the circle looked like at the start with 100 people inside and this is what it looks like now on day 9 with only 25 people by day 10 we decided to just mess up the circle completely and at this point our luckiest contestant david had a really strange request you wanted your magic 8-ball i want to ask you if i should get out right now or if i should stick it through magic 8-ball should i leave the circle right now yes boy indications say yes so it literally says yes congratulations you just won another five grand on top of the 19 grand you won anyone else want to shake the magic eight ball no we're good he's literally walking away with four briefcases of money i'm just glad i could be a part of it i'm glad you had fun bring out the thing the thing's coming majority of the balloons have fun prizes some of the balloons have punishments punishments included being double blindfolded or having to wear a giant shoe bander which one should i go for that one you have to do a hundred push-ups before midnight yo my bad other contestants got prizes you just want a go-cart you actually won two thousand dollars here you go some contestants had a little trouble with pillow the balloons blanket i can finally sleep oh you're not worse than classy you can have goldfish whenever you want who actually likes goldfish i do you gotta tape your feet to someone until the morning you have to sit on the tire swing until the morning and now we are done with the balloon wall that was fun whoa remember if you touch the ground you're out sure yes sir cool we're going through the net baby we're gonna

stepped out william just stepped out one step closer guys we just lost will to the 10 000 offer the smile on his face is so big these people are tougher than i thought i wonder if any of them regret not taking the 10 grand i just don't know if i could forgive myself if i took it i shouldn't tip 10 000. not the smartest decision i'm not the smartest man i wouldn't have left if you didn't throw the ps5 in that's a fact the only thing we can really do now is wait akira you've been standing for 10 hours straight now what's happening i can't take it anymore and i got to think about my future so
