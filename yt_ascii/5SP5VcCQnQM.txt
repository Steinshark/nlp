um hold on margaret let's go no more what is going on everybody thank you for tuning in to today's video sorry for the for the loudness i'm so sorry it looked funny on youtube when everyone sees your pain but they don't experience it because flip reduces the volume and everyone gets to laugh at your pain but a little tip as a content creation video does not matter as much as audio so if you have the time spend a hundred dollars on a microphone talk to you guys a little bit more about the reasons that i got fired from my first two junior developer jobs i know that there's a lot of people that have gone through coding boot camps and they've turned out a lot better than i have i also know that there's a lot of students that have gone through coding boot camps and they've turned out a lot worse than i have i just want to share with you guys my experience hopefully it'll be useful for some of you guys and it'll help some of you avoid the pitfalls that i personally fell into so i always love these kind of videos right there's a lot of you that you know hell i could even learn from this thing as well just having the ability to to learn from someone else's mistakes is just a huge benefit in someone's life so this is this is a good moment to be a part of i've made many mistakes and i've been very honest about all my mistakes so this is great this is good to stuff quick summary about me my name is joe i spontaneously signed up for a coding boot camp about two years ago i didn't have a computer until just a few days before class began i was definitely one of the worst students rather than one of the better students but i decided to go anyway because i was desperate to find something to do with my life and coding seemed like a good idea so i went ahead i gave it a shot i got my ass kicked but i definitely learned a lot and it's been it's been worth it overall so anyway let me i gotta put some respect on that okay hey can we put some respect on that you know not even having a computer signing up for a boot camp i'm just saying you gotta put some respect on that give you guys a breakdown of what happened to me so starting with my first job let's start there number one this job was handed to me essentially i didn't apply for this job through like indeed having a job handed to you is something i do not recommend number indeed that's a little confusing handing a job interesting interesting take interesting take okay number two i wouldn't be working on a team at this job which turned out to be a huge problem number three my first job i was working for a non-tech company if that makes any sense basically this job like i said this job was handed to me by a cousin he has the same last name as me so you guys can consider it a family business i guess they needed somebody to help them set up a dashboard that basically was pulling data to display in graphs and charts and they used a specific software to display these graphs and charts and so my cousin was talking about it he's like yeah all we need is someone that knows basic javascript and sql and i was like hell yeah i'm your guy i just went through a coding boot camp that taught me that i'll do it for you turned out to be a disaster by the way i think this is a really good point which is when someone says your job requires x and y they're probably lying it requires x y and synergy the not very popular 1980s language that's kind of like small talk you know like when you really think of small talk right whatever you're integrating with a piece of software it's always a terrible terrible terrible experience oh synergy yeah bisco knows about it you're right it's like it can be so you know this is a good lesson right here already off the rip which is you should really ask a lot of questions but you know to be fair you also get some learning experience when you're fresh out having experience having real experience is always a you know a net benefit always ask questions though mentorship no help nobody within this massive building to ask a simple coding question to 80 of this company is like warehouse work and i was just on the really small operations side so nothing i did nothing was react or angular or no framework there's that again so this is that big thing i always talk about when people just know javascript they orient themselves based on the ui library just like as a as a way for you to be better as an engineer don't orient yourself according to a library right become really great at the fundamentals learn how to build complex tools and the framework will stop mattering more and more and more and more and more okay works nothing that i learned from my coding bootcamp i did this first job and i kind of expected that that's what i was taught but this this was different now the thing is there's a lot that can be done with computer code and facts there's only so much that you can learn from a coding bootcamp what i think myself into was not a good job for somebody with so little experience i definitely needed a mentor i needed to work on a team i needed just somebody around me that i could just talk code with and that's something i didn't have at this job sure i think this is just a good point for anyone especially the newer you are in a career and in reality even at my level at my time my tenure in a career honestly having people around you to discuss things is really really really good honestly it's really really good you especially i mean just but it's it's it's that's like my whole worry with this remote work revolution which is you are new in an industry and you don't have someone that can help guide you the same way because you're remote right the barrier to ask a question remotely versus in person is way way different the amount of communication that's going to happen is way way different and so i i mean i do i really do feel like that this like this group whatever it is this group of people that are working you know today that are just starting out man that's like that's tough you know that's it's it's really really tough stuff out there okay i i feel like it's tough pair programming like pair program is great when you're especially the newer you are pair programming is great it really is i think that i could have figured it out chat cpt is not a replacement you know i know you're joking i know that's like tongue-in-cheek chat jeopardy is not a replacement for human interaction it will never be a replacement for human interaction in fact the the when we finally die like when the human race finally goes extinct is when they can integrate chat jeopardy into sex robots no one's gonna ever have a human interaction again and the race will die that's just that is just what's gonna happen and no one will know how to have relationships ever again so guess what it's not that great let's not be all happy about that sure there are other students out there there's people that went to my class that they probably could have done this job the thing is i just wasn't one of them i i struggled with it i say i got like 80 done with it but bringing down the last 20 it just it was beyond me it was beyond my skill level and the company just kind of realized that you know maybe this dashboard is not important let him go so off i win so the moral of this particular story is be careful about the first job that you get directly out of a coding bootcamp i highly recommend that you stick with something similar to what with what you learned through the coding boot camp which is most likely something web related regardless of what you're doing i highly recommend you get yourself a job where you're gonna find a mentor so that was my first job i think that last piece of advice is way better than everything else he said i don't think you need to stick with anything you've learned within a boot camp right like if you've went through boot camp and you figured out how to program you understand what programming is besides for just using react right like don't if you're in a boot camp now take time to build things other than react build a tic-tac-toe player but try building it only using like printf statements that you refresh the screen every single time try doing it with the tui try building anything aggregate data and build something else out build a service that has to stand up by itself just stop being a one library one framework andy and actually go on and become something that is a programmer but he is 100 correct if you go to a job without a mentor the likelihood of your success has been greatly reduced i feel like i hardly learned anything from that job and everything that i learned from my coding bootcamp felt like it was just kind of slowly starting to fade away as i was trying to learn this this software to do all these graphs and charts i don't know it i was a stoked that i got a job but it just it did a lot more damage than good if i'm being honest with myself so you think that i would have learned my lesson based off of what happened to me my first one more thing that you noticed that what he said i want this this is a big takeaway and i want you to kind of think about this so obviously you didn't give us how many hours he was working he didn't give a lot of information about what was going on in his personal life so we're only making conjecture here we're not actually making any sort of true true statement but if you're at a place in which you feel like your skills are atrophying you have two you have two things you need to do one you need to find a new job but two you need to work on side projects you need to make something that grows your skill set if you are atrophying it is usually a very bad sign now if you love your job but you're still atrophying then side projects are the simple answer you don't have to get a new one but it's just something always to take that into you know into in in you know to heart first job but unfortunately my second job is kind of the same thing once again this job was basically handed to me i didn't apply for it again i do not recommend this number two i kind of lied on my resume i'll be honest the guy that was hiring me he knew that i lied on my resume so we thought it was going to be okay we thought we'd kind of be able to work through it now this was for a senior a senior full stack position basically yeah okay in general like it's good to try to like apply to jobs outside of your skill set you know like if there's some growth in there that's okay but if you're fresh from a boot camp and you're trying to shoot for senior i'm just letting you know that's like it's a disaster waiting to happen you know what i mean like that's too far outside right like i wouldn't be able you know i know how to program and i know some things about python and some basic data science like i know why you want to take the median over the the mean right that doesn't mean i'm a data scientist or have any clue what to do yeah i can write some basic squeal queries i'm not a data scientist so for me applying to be one of them would be a ridiculous it would be ridiculous and dead endeavor right i would just get fired because people be like dude you don't know what you're even talking about basically four years of javascript experience experience four years of linux experience four years of server management experience served four years of sql nothing within the job description i qualify for it there was also a handful of things within the job description that i needed three or four years worth of experience with i didn't even know what it was but i talked with the guy he's like you know what i'll hire you anyways i think we're gonna be able to work through this the third thing that was wrong with this job is it was like my previous job i'm going to be working on a small team my last job i was just a one-man show which was a huge problem now with this one at least i had a boss but it honestly it was just me and him there was one senior level engineer and then one junior level engineer who was me basically the job description said that you're gonna need to work independently you're gonna need to be able to finish your tasks with very little help those should have been red flags right there because clearly i needed help but i was i was desperate for a job so i was honestly willing to take anything i could get like i said this job again it was handed to me and it ended up being a bigger disaster than my first job i accidentally erased all of the files for one of our web pages you know that's always funny to me but how does that happen like real talk how does that happen like i get the deleting data from a database one but how does erasing files happen don't you have some git somewhere right yeah some version controls somewhere at some point and you still have reflog right even if you just delete your project and force push master you still have history luckily it wasn't live at the time so but still it was a huge disaster because we didn't use git which should be another huge red flag if you're familiar with code or at least even just code web design you should use git we didn't we only used ftp file transfer so it took like oh oh he just named two different technologies as if they're the same thing we didn't use git we used ftp you're like what what what the hell what the hell did you just say eight hours to upload a single file and nothing that i would write on code would reflect live in the browser like it does with react or even with just simply refreshing an html page i would write code take an hour to upload it if it didn't work then i'd have to go through it just honestly it was a mess and there would be days in between me even talking what yeah i mean that just seems like a developer nightmare that senior engineer that's there this so this is one of the problems with small shops is that there's people that are senior engineers that shouldn't be senior engineers you know i mean like if that's what i was doing as an engineer that means i have fundamentally messed up hands down and so i've seen this before you get enough incompetent senior engineers together you have truly found 10x engineers and by 10x i mean it requires 10x more effort to do anything it's the only truest 10x engineers out there right it it is just insane what could happen with my boss sometimes like three or four days would go without us even talking and he was like three times my age so it kind of felt like there was this little bit of disconnect almost i personally felt like we were designing and building websites that looked like they were from 1997 and everything that i felt like we were using was so old and outdated and looked old nothing that i've learned from my coding boot camp was even in sight of what we were doing but i couldn't say anything to him because he's my boss here he's been doing this longer than again so this is this just goes right back to that same don't be a react andy like if you threw me right now into a jquery project if you threw me into a just a dom only manipulation peer javascript project i could be successful i will be successful because i understand how these things work like i i don't want to just be a react andy i can do it right like i can i can figure this out i've even been alive and i'm just a junior developer they failed my way through a coding boot camp so like what do i have to say to him i remember i made a post on reddit kind of laying out my job trying to get some feedback from some people shortly after i started and i'll never forget i had to actually delete the post after like an hour or two because it was just blowing up and so many people were like get the hell out of that job like you don't do this you don't you use ftp you don't use github you don't do this like there were so many red flags yeah the github one is just insane one was like get out of that job like go find a job where you're going to learn and i should have listened but the pay was good i was desperate for a job and so i just stuck it out for as long as i could and it ended up not really being worth it i'll be honest now the final straw for me at that job was when my boss left for a seven day vacation and basically he like switched servers like the night before he left and sent me login credentials that didn't work and he said well he didn't have service for seven days i couldn't get into the server i really don't know about server management i'll be honest and so when he got back and realized i didn't do anything for a week he let me go which i don't blame him i'll be honest i probably would have let me go too but i couldn't get into the server passwords never worked it just it was it was not a good time not to say the least i'm i'm glad to be out it was it was something it if the boss fires you over that honestly the boss needed to be fired if you left seven days no service and you handed someone incorrect credentials there is no level of server management sophistication that you're going to be able to fix that situation right like unless if you happen to be elliot from whatever that whatever that hacker man tv show was like unless if you're a hacker man hacking time you're not just gonna be like oh yeah yeah oh you you actually gave me the wrong credentials well let me just let me just root access your machine really quickly if you're root accessing the machine you're at the wrong job ah here i go just a quick look this guy just set up a quick honey pot i saw that coming let me just skirt around these issues it was good it was fun a good experience a bad experience i got fired so take that for what you will so there you guys go there is my list of excuses on why i got fired from my first two junior developer jobs trust me i've thought it over a million times i know there's a lot of things that i could have done differently to change my results but hey you know now you guys know and honestly that's that's what's most important i hope you guys learned something or you guys will take away something from this video or at least it was enjoyable so if anything i've said has been beneficial to you guys go ahead leave a like down below consider subscribing to my channel i apologize my videos are not always that good they're slowly but surely getting a little bit better continuously trying to learn lighting and camera and video editing while trying to launch a website or a web no you gotta learn audio i know this is a couple years old please tell me you fixed your audio design business freelance find clients charge clients i'm just trying to document this whole process so thank you guys again for watching and i'll catch you guys he became front end jesus not too long afterwards look at that on the next video can you say hi kitty can you say hi to the camera kitty he flex that was a flex uh oh oh oh oh hey everybody hey everybody have you seen my mouse it's right here [music] just kids oh there's my there's my mouse again it's over here [music] not a big deal i just use a mouse you know from time to time whatever nice mouse thank you that was just i was just flexing my mouse game okay it's a nice mouse yeah sun's out guns out show your left arm you don't want to see it it's way thinner let's see okay well now that we did that real talk though great video takeaway you should have okay okay cam i got you cam i got you the takeaway you should have here is that mentorship is your biggest goal mentorship is going to be the thing that's going to make more difference in your career than anything else and i mean it so so real real talk get a mentor i'm not a mentor right people reach out to me on a weekly basis asking to be a mentor the thing is if if i'm not there with you if i'm not building a project with you you can't pay me money to make me a good mentor right you need someone that that could actually be your mentor that sees you day in and day out that spends hours you know at a time with you that like knows who you are find a good mentor and i mean that find a good one it will make a huge difference in your life the name is the private jet don't be a react andy
