hello in the next 15 minutes i'm going to go over what is aces why i use it and just maybe why you should as well so first and foremost what is aces aces or academy color encoding system is basically a visual effects and film workflow for color management if i look at the google definition it says the ace's color space includes everything the human eye can see meaning there are no restrictions or limitations of the color space to massively simplify it aces allows you to have a consistent color workflow across multiple programs and platforms one of the main benefits is you can take multiple cameras and apply a conversion to make all of the footage look the same the next question is why would you use aces over something like srgb or rec 709 which is much more common again to massively simplify it aces allows you to have a much wider gamut of colors what this means is the ace's color space can display many more values of red green and blue and so you have much more dynamic range in your footage and because you have the extra range it allows you to have more versatility in things like compositing and color grading whereas if you work in something like srgb or rec 709 you might find yourself hitting the boundaries of what the color space can do so that was a brief overview of what aces is and how it works now i'm going to go through and use some footage to get some demonstrations of it and then at the end of the video i'm going to go through how to set it up in blender nuke and davinci resolve and then go through and talk about the color workflow between all three softwares okay so here we have two different pieces of footage this one is shot on my sony a73 and it's shot in s log 2 which is a log color profile which is why it's kind of flat and this one is shot on my phone so it's obviously much more contrasty because it's not shot in log one of the main benefits of aces like i said is you can convert multiple cameras to look very very similar so for example if i go into the color management settings in davinci resolve change it to aces cc and you can see also when i changed it to aces it's quite dramatically changed the colors on the footage then what i'm going to do is assign an asus input transform to each of these so if i select the phone footage first i'm going to right click and go to aces input transform and i'm going to set this to be srgb and as you can see that's now gone back to looking pretty much how it did before and then if i take the sony a73 footage and go aces input transform s-log 2 which is what it was shot in you can see it's now done a conversion and they both look very very similar so the great thing about this is if you're someone like me that has a few cameras i have a gopro i have my sony a73 sometimes i shoot on other cameras as well you can take all of those cameras and convert them to have one solid look which makes it much easier for doing visual effects and color grading on but that's more of an editorial thing which is something that i'm not really into my predominant workflow is vfx stuff so i'm not too fussed about you know balancing camera looks and things for me the main benefit of aces is the transforming of the log footage into a more usable color space and this is a perfect example if you're shooting on a green screen you don't want it to be really low contrast and low saturation because you want there to be a distinct difference between the green of the green screen and the foreground elements so it's much easier to pull a key if i switch back to the normal davinci resolve color spaces you can see that this one when it's really flat there's not much of a difference tonally between the gray of my jumper and the green of the screen which is going to make it much harder to isolate me from the green screen the extra contrast and saturation that comes with doing the aces conversion makes this much easier to work on for visual effects to demonstrate this i've got an example from a video i did a few months ago in this video i didn't do the aces transform and i worked on the footage in log and as you can see here when i start trying to do a green screen key it looks absolutely horrendous there's loads and loads of noise in the key and you can see there if i rewind a little bit look at how horrific the edge is on that green screen key whereas if i had done the aces input transform and converted it properly so it was easier to work on then it would have been a lot easier to key this so that's how aces works and a quick demo if that's all you're interested in feel free to click off the video now but if you're interested in adopting aces and using it in your workflow now i'm going to go through how to set it up in the three different pieces of software and i'll also share some cool tips that i've learned from watching multiple youtube videos on this topic because there's a couple of things that will catch you out with working with aces so first things first let's import some new footage this is a perfect opportunity to show off the clip of me acting out the scene with no cgi so to start working in aces the first thing you want to do is go to file project settings under the color management tab you want to change from the davinci resolve color space to ace's cc then you set your output device transform to be either srgb or rec 709 then you can either leave the input device transform blank if you have multiple cameras it might be better to just assign it manually or if it's just all on one camera and it's all one color space like me i shot in slog2 then you can assign this as your input transform and it will just interpret all of the footage that comes in as s log and convert it to srgb so now if i hit save you can see it's going to do the color space conversion up here once i've done that what i do is i jump to the deliver tab and i get ready to export this into nuke for all of my vfx stuff what i do is i export to an exr format so i set the format to exr codec to rgb half zip compression then obviously decide where it goes and then hit add to render queue now very importantly before you hit render you have to turn off the output device transform if you don't turn this off it does a bit of a weird double conversion when you render and you end up with footage in the wrong color space which is obviously not ideal so set this back to no input transform and then hit save you can see now the footage looks like it's gone quite dark and contrasty that's because we've turned off the display transform but when i bring it back into nuke or blender it will look correct so now that that's done hit start render and now it's ready to be picked up in the next piece of software i'm in nuke now and i already have aces set up but this doesn't happen by default you have to download something so you have to download the asus setup files so i'll leave a link to this in the description click on the link download these files and then you'll be good to go then in nuke what you want to do is go into your settings go to color management mine's already set up but i'm going to reset it to the default so this is how yours should look you want to change it from nuke default to custom and then what you want to do is browse to wherever you downloaded the files from github so for me it's here then go into whatever is the latest version at the time you've downloaded this so for me it's 1.2 and then you want to click on the config.ocio file and open it and basically that config file is like the library that tells nuke where all of the aces color transforms and stuff are which ones to use when and as you might have noticed when i changed it all of these default color transforms also change to be the aces equivalents of what they were before so then you can hit ok and then what you want to do up here is change your view transform to srgb in brackets aces obviously if your monitor isn't srgb change it to rec709 or whatever else you're working on now that's set up nuke is working with aces so what i can do is read in the footage we just exported from davinci and when i look at this it looks the same as it did in davinci resolve doesn't seem that mind-blowing now but when i'm trying to figure this out on my own it took forever to get it to look right and just to show you the difference this is what it looks like viewing in aces if i change back to the nuke default color spaces it looks like this and you can see it's gone a lot flatter so the next thing i do once that's done is i export some jpegs to blender so i can start working on them in cg so to do that you just add a write node and then set it to wherever you want it to go to when you set nuke to render out some jpegs it will default the color space to map painting which is correct that's making in the ace's color transforms into the jpegs then you can just set the quality to be whatever you like and then hit render then next we want to jump into blender again out of the box blender is not quite set up to work with aces so you have to do a little bit of tweaking so open up a file browser go to your hard drive that windows is saved on go to the root folders then go into program files blender foundation go on the version of blender that you want to change to use aces go into the version number folder and then go into data files and then the color management folder then what you want to do is delete all of these i'm not going to do it because i've got this set up in a way that i like but basically select them all delete get rid of them then what you want to do is go to the folder where you downloaded the github stuff then you want to select all of them and hit copy and then go into the folder that should be empty obviously ignore the fact that these are still here and paste them into this folder what that's going to do is replace the default color settings in blender with the asus ones then if you open up the version of blender that is set up to use aces under the render settings you can go to the color management tab and if you open this you should see display devices set to aces now and if you see that it means it's worked and you're good to go you can start working in aces so like i mentioned earlier there's a couple of things that can catch you out when working in aces one of the main things is there's now loads and loads of color spaces because it has transforms from basically any color space into another color space so if i open the footage that i exported from nuke this is what it looks like when i bring it in by default obviously the color space is a little bit wonky by default this is in asus cc we actually want this to be in the matte painting color space that we exported it from nuke and if you click on the color spaces menu you go oh my god there's so many that it's going off the screen you actually have to zoom out in the blender ui to click on it and display all of the color spaces it's pretty crazy what we want to do is set it to the map painting one like i said and a quicker way to do it than zooming out and searching through the menus all the time is you can just click on the box and then hit m and it will basically jump to the first one that starts with m which just happens to be matte painting and as you can see now it's defaulted to the correct color space so then you can track your footage do all that lovely stuff and then if we go back to the 3d viewport and add a camera i can go to background footage add background image again for the background image the color space is completely whack so go over to the background image settings and then on the color space drop down click it and hit m and it will jump to the map painting which is the correct one that's one of the only drawbacks of aces there's so many color spaces that you have to kind of go through and assign them which is a little bit annoying but it's part of the fun another time it will probably catch you out is when you're using image textures for shaders so normally these will be set to srgb but because the srgb colour space no longer exists they've just defaulted to be blank and they look really crazy if you look at it in rendered view and this is why on the first iron man video that i did all of the colors especially on things like the gold looked really weird it's because i didn't realize this was a problem so all of the textures were in the wrong color space and they didn't display the things like the metallic properly so the way to fix this is basically the same thing you go on the color space tab and hit m and then it will default to roll matte painting the only difference here is you want the base color to be the map painting but you want the rest of them to be the equivalent of setting this to non-color data like you do for normal maps and things in the normal version of blender in aces it has a similar name it's just called roll data and the fastest way to get to it instead of clicking on this and finding it every time is again click on the color space and hit m which will take you to the map painting one and then hold ctrl and scroll the mouse wheel up twice and luckily in the list it's only two away from the map painting one so you can jump to it by pressing m and then just scroll up twice and that's how you do it for all of these ones then what you can do is set up the cg and get it ready to go i'm not going to spend the time to do this properly spent way too long working on iron man videos recently so i'm just going to render it like this instead similarly with hdris you also have to set these to be the correct color space because these are an exr not a jpeg they need to be set to utility linear srgb i don't have a fast keyboard shortcut to get to this i'm afraid so zoom out a little bit so you can see the whole menu and then just find utility linear srgb which is here you probably won't see a huge change there but it does handle the colors a little bit differently so it's important to set it to the right one after that you can hit render okay that's finished rendering i'm going to bring in the render now like i said i didn't spend any time getting it to actually line up so it looks hilarious but if i just set the black points and stuff to be in the same sort of place that's going to be my very in-depth compositing and then you want to write it out of nuke as an exr and go back into davinci resolve so i'm going to add another write node set my render destination you want to make sure you set this to be an exr it will default to scene linear which is correct because it's a linear exr and then under the options you want to tick write aces compliant exr this will basically make the exr compliant with the asus color space very self-explanatory and you'd have to change anything else that's it so then hit render okay back in davinci resolve now the first thing i do once i start bringing back in the vfx shots is i create a new folder for the vfx shots i go to import media and find the render then if i bring this in i can drop this on top of the footage i only rendered one frame so it doesn't really matter what frame this looks really crazy again because we turned off the output transform before rendering so i'm going to go back in and change the output transform to srgb again hit save and now the footage will go back to looking normal but the render which is the exr will still look crazy the reason for this is it hasn't come back in as slog2 which is what the footage is in the davinci project is currently set up to convert everything from slog2 to srgb so it's doing the wrong transform on this which is why it looks crazy so to fix that right click on the vfx shot render go to aces transform and scroll right the way down to the bottom you want to change this to asus cg it's easy to remember that because this is coming back from the vfx pipeline so it's a cgi shot basically and once you turn that on it will default back to how it should look and if i toggle this on and off you can see that the colors are exactly the same minus the fact that it has a massive iron man in the shot one final tip is that exrs are very very heavy and currently this is only one frame so it doesn't really matter but if you have a whole image sequence for the whole shot like i did for the iron man video then when you hit play it usually starts stuttering the way to fix that is you can right click on the clip and go to generate optimize media and what it will do then is create a slightly lower quality cache file that you can work on and playback in real time and then when you go to render it will use the actual full res image sequences so then if we pretend this is an entire youtube video and not just one frame from one shot you can go to the deliver tab and this is basically where you export the finished product for my render settings to youtube i set the format to be mp4 and then i set the codec to be h265 if you don't have davinci resolve studio the encoder will just default to native which is fine just use that so then i hit add to render queue and then you hit start render and that's the final step it will render out onto your hard drive and then you upload it from your hard drive onto the internet and then it gets a million views and you can quit your day job for more monetization wow that was a lot of talking hopefully you guys found that useful a lot of people ask me to talk about how i use aces and just how to use it in general if anyone's interested in picking it up i highly recommend it it's really really cool you don't have to use any of the paid software to do this so obviously blender is free you can do it in the free version of davinci resolve i was doing that before i recently bought the studio version i used nuke indie in this video but nuke non-commercial also works in exactly the same way so just set it up how i showed and it will run exactly the same originally when i started using aces i didn't have any videos like this teaching me how to set it up properly and so there's a few videos like the thor video and the first iron man video that i exported with color space problems which is why they looked a bit funky so hopefully what i've done here in the last however many minutes has demystified the whole process for you slightly if you do get stuck feel free to leave a comment down below and i will try and reply and help you out so thank you very much for watching this video hope it's been useful and i will see you very soon [music] you
