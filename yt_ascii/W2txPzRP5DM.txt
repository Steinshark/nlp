hello everyone and welcome in this video as a general theme we're talking about what today's best electric vehicles are and so this is a bit inspired by current drivers eevee of the year and if you can see from this magazine cover they gave it to the ford mustang machi which is an excellent electric car and it's pretty solid however in this video i don't have anything against their decision there i don't think you should either like i'm not here to be like man tesla should win who cares pick what car is right for you the end but this car this tesla model 3 performance that we are sitting in right now which is three years old is still still a good bit ahead of the competition three years later that's coming out today and i find that you know pretty impressive on tesla's part how advanced this car is considering its age relative to the new things that are coming out today so in this video we're gonna be talking about these 11 electric cars that car and driver compared i'm going to show you lots of bar charts because i know everyone loves bar charts but we're going to tell a pretty convincing story with these bar charts about how dominant tesla is so it is my opinion that as it relates to electric cars convenience is king now if you have multiple cars and a place to charge an electric car who cares get whatever electric car satisfies your needs the end don't worry about you know how convenient the one vehicle is if you have multiple cars to do multiple things but if you're just using one car in my opinion that car should be as close to if not equally if not better than from a convenience standpoint gasoline cars and so that is the challenge faced by electric cars and the biggest place you notice this discrepancy in the convenience factor is on a road trip so current driver did a test where they took you know 11 cars and they ran a thousand miles and they tried out these different electric cars to see how they did on a road trip which is the most difficult scenario because it basically tests all of the convenient factors of an electric car now one of the first things electric car makers love to tell you and they'll give you this very high very exciting number is how much power you can charge their cars with so how fast you can charge these cars and they give you this peak power rate it's kind of like you know manufacturers give a peak horsepower rate right but you don't know what the torque curve actually looks like you have to go in and look at it and the same is true for these power curves and how fast these things charge because on the low end of the battery short they'll charge very fast and so i'll show you a comparison of what everyone's claiming their you know peak charging speed is for all these different electric cars but then if you add into that chart what the average time is which car and driver tested from 10 to 90 percent charge so you know a realistic 10 to 90 charge of that battery then you get an average charging speed which may or may not be significantly lower than that peak charging rate and in most cases it's quite a bit lower so tesla did really well here audi did really well here porsche did really well here the mustang did not do well here and the reason why the maki didn't do well is because after 80 percent its charging speed drops off dramatically so it's actually pretty good up to 80 percent it went from 10 battery to 70 battery in about 35 minutes but it took 90 minutes to go from 10 to 90 percent it was the longest out of everything tested to get to that percent it's because they have a really slow charging rate from eighty percent to ninety percent maybe they'll update that in the future but for nailed mustang charges really slow above eighty percent now thinking about how quickly something charges by looking at percentages may or may not make sense to you and all of these different manufacturers they come up with these different ways to tell you that their car charges really quickly by saying it goes from 10 to 60 or something like that and it's like well how far does that actually get me so car and driver actually does a really clever test so they look at how much time do you need to spend at a charger in order to drive 100 miles on the highway at 75 miles per hour and so that number for the tesla model s is just 11 minutes which is very impressive that was the quickest time and then the slowest time was the nissan leaf at 45 minutes so not very convenient there now another deceptive part of the story with electric cars is how far can you actually drive on the highway and so current driver tests this at 75 miles per hour to see what the actual range of these vehicles is relative to what the stated range is the epa measurement and so tesla is notorious for doing very well on these epa tests but then not so hot in the real world on the highway and so you can see the discrepancy here with the different vehicles porsche gets very close to their rated range so i think that's really cool about the porsche 97 of their stated range is what they get on the highway versus the worst this car we're sitting in right here tesla model 3 performance getting only 71 of its stated range on the highway and that holds up with my own experiences this thing does not get anywhere near 310 miles on the highway like you know the the stated claim of the range is now tesla isn't giving you a number and saying hey this is our highway range you're saying hey this is the epa rating so it's not like you know they're being deceptive necessarily it's just that on the highway which i feel like is a much more relevant information it does not travel 310 miles what will become interesting throughout this video though is that despite this massive discrepancy that tesla has between epa range and actual real world highway range is that they're actually extremely good at road trips so as i mentioned car and driver did this 1000 mile loop with these 11 electric cars and so the whole idea here is that there are certain waypoints that every car has to go to every car has to check in at these certain way points but as far as how they get to those waypoints they can take whatever route they want you know based on chargers whatever they want to do right so it's kind of replicating a road trip you're traveling a thousand miles you have certain destinations you want to check out and then you're coming back home right so this thousand mile trip i think the biggest question is how much time did it take everyone so if you look at that you know first place goes to the tesla model s second place goes to the tesla model y third place goes to the tesla model three so tesla sweeps the podium there and and versus the competition you know they've got a healthy margin on how much time it actually takes to travel that 1000 miles now for some of these charts i'm going to add in my own car because i've done a thousand mile road trip in my model 3 and so i thought it might be cool to just incorporate that within the data and show you how that compares as well now it is worth mentioning that my time has a slight disadvantage and that i did it all in one single day versus car and driver all these 11 vehicles were able to charge overnight as this was a two day test and so that charging time for overnight is not included in the overall time it's time that people are going to be sleeping okay so you can see how far behind a lot of the competition is compared to tesla but i want to do a couple corrections here because not everyone drove the same distance and part of that is obvious right like if you're seeking out different chargers you're going to have a different overall trip odometer once you finish those 1000 miles but i want to correct for that i want to pretend that every car traveled exactly 1000 miles so i'm going to correct for it and with porsche they actually missed one of their waypoints so they have a long time that it took them to complete however they missed one of the waypoints and they had to go back to it so they ended up driving over 1100 miles total so significantly further than everyone else how far porsche drove so if you correct for that then porsche is a little over two hours off as far as how long it takes them to drive a thousand miles versus the tesla and so also looking at the mustang the mustang was a decent bit behind but they got you know a bit of a charging snafu that happened where several of the chargers where they were showing up to wouldn't work and so they had to keep seeking out additional chargers and that ate up about two hours so for the porsche and for the mustang if everything went perfectly and i'm not saying that it will go perfectly out there with these non-tesla chargers i probably won't a lot of them are problematic but if everything were to go perfect the porsche and the mustang would be significantly closer to the tesla times and so those cars the tesla the porsche the maki those are cars that i feel like i could reasonably recommend today and say hey you can get in these and it is possible to go on a road trip and it's not going to be this terrible experience the rest of them i don't see any way of actually recommending them for a road trip because it just seems like it would be awful you're spending so much time at these chargers now there's another interesting thing i want to do with a bar chart because i'm loving these bar charts and i hope you are too is i want to do something called a google maps reality check and so this is we're going to take what does google maps say it will take to do this route how long does it say we'll do it and then how far off are we from that time and so i'm going to say we're going to take the google maps time we're going a thousand miles and we're going to add 30 minutes to that time so we have three 10-minute stops i feel like that's pretty reasonable to assume in a gas car you could have three 10-minute stops over a thousand miles you probably would stop more than that but maybe you're trying to go for time here maybe just two 15-minute stops whatever we're adding 30 minutes to whatever time google predicts it will take to do this route if you look at the other cars compared to that google maps standard plus 30 minutes tesla with the model s is only 20 minutes behind and this is a thousand miles we're talking about so 20 minutes is nothing that's very impressive how close tesla is considering the fact that you do have to visit chargers to google maps predicted time so i think that is very cool the other ones get fairly close again these are all corrected for a thousand miles and so they get pretty close you know with the porsche with the tesla's around two hours the nissan leaf plus 14 hours absolute insanity so why is the nissan leaf so bad at road trips well apparently i was talking with car and driver about this and part of the reason is you can only get one fast charge within a 24 hour cycle because this thing is air cooled the battery is air cooled so the other times that you're visiting a fast charger you're not actually charging quickly because the battery pack can't handle it because it's getting too hot so the nissan leaf despite its 225 miles of claimed range does not make sense at all as a road trip vehicle in my opinion because you're going to have to spend so much time at chargers so another thing that's interesting to look at is to just look at how much time was actually spent at chargers so tesla doing really well here not spending all that much time at chargers to you know travel that 1000 miles and then also looking at the average speed you were traveling throughout those 1000 miles so you know tesla model s doing over 60 miles per hour for the average versus the nissan leaf its average speed for its entire trip was a little bit over 33 miles per hour so just by looking at the data from this trip you can see that numerically based on merit tesla wins right but that's not the whole story and so i asked carl and driver you know how many of the drivers were using the onboard navigation from these vehicles in order to get around and find these chargers versus how many were using their phones and it seems like pretty much all of them used their phones at some point but definitely everyone that wasn't in a tesla was relying on their phones not relying on onboard navigation so tesla's onboard navigation is fantastic it'll you point to point you tell it where you want to go and it will get you there i could feel confident putting my mom and sorry mom but she doesn't understand technology well putting my mom in this car and telling her to go somewhere she could punch it into the navigation and it would tell her what to do in order to get there at a reasonable pace not a perfectly optimized pace but a pretty good pace and the others that is not true i could not put my mom in any non-tesla electric car and tell her to get across the country today today it is too difficult it is a cumbersome experience that you have to put thought and math into in order to carry it out and it's just something that my mom wouldn't have the patience to figure out she could do it you know if she wanted to but she would be like this is so silly why am i wasting all this time with this terrible user experience like get me out of this i should say that in different words but i'm putting it nicely so tesla has really focused on that user experience and i think the ford mustang maki actually does pretty good they get pretty close in that you can just plug it in to an electrify america charger and it just works also with the mustang the navigation will automatically route you towards electrify america chargers so i think that's good but when talking with the driver of the maki from this test they said the first electrify america charger they showed up to it didn't work just blue screened and and so they had to use another charger thankfully ea chargers have multiple chargers at one spot so you're not showing up and hey it's the only one charger like you might do at a charge point or an evgo it's the only one someone's eating their breakfast while their car is charging you're like well i guess i just sit here all day and so that's really one of tesla's big advantages right like traditionally car makers make cars and gas companies sell gas and that's pretty easy like it's pretty convenient there's standards for gas you know you go out there you get it it works regardless of which gas station you go to your car keeps running right with electric cars you know automakers are using the same process they've always used they're saying we make the cars electric charger companies make the chargers and there are standards again but it's not a smooth process and so tesla says let's take everything and put it within our control put everything in our control so they control the charging experience where the chargers are and they control the creation of these cars so they all communicate very cohesively and everything works out very beautifully versus no one else really seems to try this methodology and it's expensive right it's challenging to do no automaker wants to put up that much money in order to make it happen but tesla did it as a startup and has made it work and the user experience is fantastic so it's really beautiful to see that it can be done right and if you go through and you read this magazine which i recommend you do about the non-teslas and the charging situations that they got into showing up to charges that don't work showing up to only one charger and there's multiple people already waiting in line for one single charger it's like there is insanity that you have to go through whereas with electrify america which i think is getting better but definitely with tesla you know you have multiple supercharging stalls it's a smooth process you just plug it in it works it's just so much smarter than the competition now it's worth mentioning if you're watching this video and you're like why are volvo and pulsed are doing so terribly in this road trip test well during this test volvo and polestar vehicles were not compatible with all electrify america chargers they were compatible with some now apparently that has been updated and so they all work but this just drives home one of the points that i really hate about modern ev vehicle releases and that is first impressions matter first impressions are very important and so many of these electric cars are released unfinished and it's fine for cars to get better over time but there are certain things that are just unacceptable to have a car released and then these not be a part of it so saying that here's an electric car it doesn't work with the chargers out there right now but it will someday that's insanity to me volkswagen not communicating with their own chargers that they make that's insanity to me during this during this road trip the volkswagen id4 it didn't show the speedometer or the battery the remaining range that it had there was a part where just glitched out it's like these are unacceptable glitches for first time ev buyers to be experiencing because they're going to get turned off from it very quickly and for a correct reason like i can't fault anyone for getting an electric car showing up to a charger it not working and then saying this sucks i'm not doing this that makes sense to me and so that's what i admire about tesla because despite all the insane marketing stuff that tesla does that i think is really dumb like you know the the roll out stuff the full self-driving stuff that's just never gonna be released this level five it's like they keep saying you know level five is coming it's right around the corner it's not it's not coming anytime soon because every deadline they've said it just hasn't hit right they've got all these cars they say they're going to build cyber truck roadster blah blah blah they never hit any of these deadlines that stuff's really annoying but when it comes to the actual cars that they do make the user experience is very well thought out and i admire the heck out of that from tesla so props to the folks at tesla for doing electric cars right because they really do put a lot of thought and a lot of detail into making the user experience when you're taking a road trip they make it very seamless and very close to what it is like driving a gas car as far as a convenience factor and then there's benefits on top of it that i really like and why i drive this vehicle still electric cars are very cool so thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below and hey look if you like gas cars more that's cool it doesn't have to be like a choose size and get angry at everyone right like we can all like stuff i have gas cars i have electric cars i think they're all really awesome there's really cool benefits on both sides i think it's neat we don't have to be angry about it we can just you know we can chill out we can make the internet a fun educational happy place at least that's what i hope there's no chance whatever
