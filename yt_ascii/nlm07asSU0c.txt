you know i used to play a lot of snakes and ladders with my sister as a kid and i assume this game was somehow an english game or and i was really surprised when i visited india to discover actually its heritage is from india this is actually a snakes and ladder board that i found in the pitts river museum in oxford i mean it's a beautiful board with these snakes and ladders on it's a 72 square board and square number 68 is the one you're heading for and this represents vaa or a moka so you're you're aiming to actually reach you know that's what the hindu religion is about rebirth and your karma and what gets you to a state of mshar so interestingly the snakes and ladders represents good things that you do in life to reach moa you know helping other people or a snake will be labeled with drunkenness and so you will slide down the snake and and and move further away from from your destination and in this hindu version of the game you go round and round because of course you're reborn so it's not like snakes and the laders i played with my sister we'd sit there waiting to try and get the score which would get you to the final square interestingly this one you go round on round reborn and see whether you can do better this time in life but i was quite interested in you know how long does it take to to reach moa you know nana how many throws of the dice am i going to have to do in order to to get to this final destination and that's something actually turns out mathematics is really helpful to to calculate it involves a really beautiful little bit of mathematics uh involving a matrix which gives you the information about how you're moving around the board actually a good game is one where the rules are so simple you get it within a few seconds i think that makes good mathematics as well simple rules give rise to complexity so the rules are you get to throw a dice it will be 1 to six and you can move one two or three around the board according to the throw of the dice if you hit the bottom of a ladder you shoot up the board if you hit the head of a snake you slide back down again so you're basically moving around the board the weird thing is actually when i was playing with my sister i used to think i was somehow in control of this you know that i was making her go down snakes and that i was i'd somehow done a great move to hit that ladder and of course as an adult i realized it's a weird kind of game because you're just a machine a cog in this and it's a weirdly actually unsatisfying game because there's no agency by the player and a good game should actually you should be able to express yourself through your moves and so but that said there's a really beautiful piece of mathematics which helps you understand the dynamics of this game involves something called a marof chain one of the key things is how i got to a square does not affect which square i'm going to go to next cuz the only thing you know if i'm on square 72 it's just the throw of the dice which is going to determine where i go next doesn't matter how many moves it took me to get to 72 so this is the important thing about a markof process that it should not depend on how you got there but just where you are now is what's going to help you determine where you're going to go next snak lad is a certainly example of that so i thought i would explain this with just a very simple snakes and ladders board which i've prepared earlier so so here ab board is actually just 1 2 3 4 5 6 up to the destination 9 okay but i could put zero cuz that's where we start so i'm going to put on a ladder so for example if you get to square 4 you get to shoot up to square seven however if you're on square eight you'll slide back down to square two so this means that there's a little bit of dynamism in the way the game will play so the question is if i'm throwing a dice how many throws of the dice are expected before i reach the final destination mock show which in this case is is square number nine well there's this important thing which is the u transition matrix which is the key to understanding this game so we're going to do a matrix and we're going to have a row and a column for each of the squares of the snakes and ladder board so we're going to start on the zeroth square so we've got a row corresponding to where we start but then you can go to square one 2 3 actually four is not somewhere where you actually end up because you'll shoot up to seven so we're going to miss four out because you'll never actually sitting on four so actually the next one is five six seven and then eight you're never on eight because you get sent down by the snake back down to two so these are actually the only positions that you'll be on except for the final one where you're right but we're not interested in that because the game is won by that point so these are kind of the transitionary states of the ball can i ask a silly question i seem to remember when i played snakes and ladders as a boy you had to land exactly on the final square you couldn't overshoot it so this is important so you have to throw the exact number if i'm on square seven i have to throw a two and if i throw a three i stay on square 7even this is different from the indian version where actually you would overshoot and be reborn so the matrix will be different in that case if actually you're allowed to restart the game but in the classic kind of english version you have to get the exact score so that will be important the point is that this matrix has a row for each of the places where your counter is at the moment and then what we're going to put in this matrix is the probability that you move to another square so actually we have again columns for each of these states so 1 2 3 but not four remember cuz that you go up to s 7 5 6 7 so it's a square matrix a 7x7 matrix and then what you do with this matrix is putting if i'm on square zero what is the probability that with the throw of the dice i'm going to be on square one well i have to move off this so square zero i'm not going to stay on square zero so zero probability there but from here it's one6 that i throw one one six chance that i throw two one six of a chance i throw three interestingly the four one six of chance i throw a four but that will end me up on square seven one six of chance i'll throw a five and one six of a chance i'll throw six so so that's quite sort of clear you know there's like six possibilities and they will end you up on different squares but now what if we're on square one well you can't go to square zero actually you have to move somewhere off square one so you will not on square one so that's a zero chance there but the interesting thing is here i can get to square seven with a throw of a six but i can also get to square 7even with a throw of a three because that gets me to the four square where i go up a ladder so there's a two in six chance that i will actually get to seven and or i think all the other cases are one over six from here throwing of the dice and landing on that square but because there is two ways to get to seven i get 2 over six so now we'll go to row two we do again the probability from row two on square two that you're going to get get to each of these different squares but something interesting happens here because actually i can remain on square two because i throw a six get to square eight square eight sends me down the snake to two so there's a one in six charms actually i'll stay on to square seven there are two ways i can get there i can throw five or i could go up my ladder so what about square three well notice square three i can also get to square eight again so i can shoot back down to square two so there'll be a 1 over six chance cuz three plus a roll of five will get me down can i stay on three no i don't i can't stay on three here three actually noticed that i can actually win so which we're not recording here so we're not going to see the whole you know total six lots of one over six because one of those is a winner so three i can go to five i can go six and again i can throw one to get the ladder or i can actually just get seven i throw a four but notice here we' got 2 3 4 five it's the one over six actually will give me a win but we don't record that in the transition matrix okay what about on five well again i can get down the snake by throwing and getting on the eight here i've got zero i can stay on five because now from five i've got to get nine so if i throw a five or a six i'm throwing too many so then i will stay where i am so so now it's interesting that you stay here two out of the throws actually stick me where i am throw of a one will get me here and now i'm past the ladder so actually there's only one way to get to seven from five again there's one winning move so you'll see that 1 2 3 4 five but there there are two where i'm actually just stuck and so the same will happen with here i can again keep on going down that snake from from six going to eight here it's zero zero but i actually can stay stuck here but now there are three different throws which are going to stick me there and then one way to get and then what about from seven well again i could still go down the snake get to two but now i could be stuck with four different throws which keep me on seven okay going get a two so there's the transition matrix and this is going to help us to tell how many moves it's expected to make to win this game so how do we do that should we call this q so some more brown paper [music] braid so this matrix is actually representing where you're likely to be after one throw of the dice and a sixth of the time you're going to be on the squares 1 to seven so what we want to work out is if if we play the game keep on throwing the dice over and over again how many times are we likely to be on a particular square starting from the the zeroth square so this is after one roll of the dice sixth of the time you'll be on each of these squares the lovely thing is if i square this matrix that will then tell me what happens after two throws of the dice because that's what squaring the matrix does and so the the new probabilities in here will be will tell me actually the chances of being on each of these squares after two throws of the dice and so this is what's going to help us to to calculate the number of expected turns it's going to take before before we reach the end because what i need to do i i start with the identity matrix a 7 by7 matrix and then i take this is one throw of the dice and the first row will tell me kind of the odds of being on the square so there's one in a sixth chance that after one throw i'll be on one of the squares 1 to seven but the square of this matrix will tell me after two throws of the dice how many times i'm likely to be on the squares and three throws of the dice now we want to know how many throws of the dice are expected to reach the end but it it could go on infinitely and so actually what we've got to do is to calculate an infinite sum of matrices and we're going to add up the first row and the first row if we add up the entries in the this infinite sum of matricies that's going to tell us how many times will'll be on each of these squares if we play the game infinitely before we reach the end so we've actually got to calculate this infinite sum which looks like oh my god how am i going to do that with matrices and things like that but look there's a really cute bit of algebra which happens because if i do i the identity matrix minus my transition mates q and look what happens when i multiply a finite bit of this sum well let's take 1 q + q ^2 up to q to the n was a very nice thing that happens here because the identity matrix just repeats this but then i'm taking minus q * this i get q q^2 q cubed up to q to the n + 1 so actually this is equal to the identity matrix minus q to the n + 1 because all the other terms get canceled out i've got this i but the q gets canceled by this minus q * the i that's interesting but what what happens i want the infinite sum but the amazing thing is n tends to infinity this translation matrix gradually gets kind of with smaller and smaller entries so the interesting thing is q to the n + 1 tends to the zero matrix so this means that this infinite sum that i'm trying to calculate if i multiply by it by i minus q i get to the identity matrix so actually this means that this infinite sum that i'm trying to calculate plus q ^2 plus all the way up to infinity is actually equal to the inverse matrix of i minus q now this is something that you get taught at a level maths or first year undergraduate how to invert a 7x7 matrix actually most computer algebra packages will have such a function in it so this means something really beautiful i first i i needed to calculate infinitely many matrices add up all of the entries in the first row add of those together and that's the expected value now i just need to calculate this inverse of a a matrix i minus the q that i've written down here and so actually you inverting a 7x7 matrix is not a trivial thing so i actually got a computer algebra package to do it and what it told me is that the if i add up the entries of the first row of this matrix it came to 10 so the expect number of throws of the dice to win this game is 10 and i i find that really beautiful that this kind of bit of matrix mathematics with a little bit of this algebra and a little bit of kind of you know infinite algebraic expressions can tell you how many times you need to roll the dice to expect to win the game i imagine the matrix looks a lot more complicated for like a 100 square gap well yeah so i actually did it for this snakes and laders board here again there are 72 squares but remember that you have to remove the bottom of the ladders and the tops of the snakes so that goes down to a 52 square matrix so it's a 52 by 52 so that's pretty big so as you calculated this and i had to use the computer algebra package to do the inversion of the identity matrix minus this actually you actually also have to remove the final destination which is the 68 square and it turned out that you need 59 throws of the dice i think it was in order to reach moire but there was a very interesting thing that i experimented with because you'd think that by removing a snake i might decrease the number of throws i need to get to moxa because you know snakes seem to be bad however when i removed one of these snakes the expected number of throws went up now i was like why is that what what what happened there what i'll tell you why if i remove this snake it shoots up to 77 now that's kind of what why why is it actually harder to get to the end even though you've removed something which seems to be taking you further away and the reason is that you're getting a second go at this big ladder which is really helping you to get towards the end so this snake is actually helping you perhaps the message here it pays to pay behave badly because it gives you a second chance to behave well and reach mocka so there are some surprising things you know you can actually see and and this actually happens a lot with mathematics can sometimes help you that you think a a new road will help the traffic but sometimes it can actually cause the traffic to get worse and so there are unexpected things that this kind of mathematics can reveal and in this case it reveals that snakes sometimes help you i remember i used to make my own snakes and ladders boards at home you know i designed my own i learned and i once made one where every square you landed on was a snake or a ladder and that only afterwards i realize you do need a few blanks you know you want that sweet spot between you how many ladders and or snakes do i need actually to make this game not go on forever or not finish too quickly so this kind of mathematics really helps you to you know n advance well actually it's too many throws of the dice i need let's stick in another ladder and see what that that does so so people can have fun you know you should take your snakes and laded border at home generate this matrix put it in a computer algebraic package which there are online and and see what the expected number are for each of your different snakes and ladders boards professor you spoke at the start of this video quite negatively about snakes and ladders and we referred to us almost just machines playing this with no agency i have to ask the question of you as a mathematician is this a game that you have played with the young people in your life do you introduce young people to snakes and ladds or do you avoid this because of your your snobbish attitude i actually yeah i i think this game is dreadful so it doesn't give you any agency and therefore you can't express you know some strategy in order to play the game however you might think therefore oh he must be a lover of chess and the chinese game of go which are pure strategy but no i think those also have a problem and it's comes down to actually playing with a young person that if somebody knows how to play a strategic game then the the junior player has no chance to beat them so you know kasparov against donald trump is not an interesting game when it's chess they're equally matched if they're playing snakes and ladders for me the sweet spot is a game which has some element of chance but still some element of strategy in order to help so you can express some some part of your intellect in playing the game so you know if you going to push me i think one of the really lovely games that is simple to learn and i play with my kids is backgamon because backgamon throughout the dice is important so you know you really can win even if you're a first-time player on the other hand with good strategy using the dice in order to move your counters such you're not exposed and they don't get captured still strategy can help you even if you get bad throws of the dice actually to win that game so and it turns out it's one of the most ancient games as well so it's related to a racing game that you can find in the british museum which is about 4,500 years old and is thought to be the first board game ever it's called the royal game of or it's a dice game but the dice that they use are not the cube shaped dice we use in snakes and ladders but a little tetrahedron or actually several tetrahedron so this is kind of weird because that's a triangular based pyramid and that doesn't land with a face up with the faces down and so what they did with these dice is they colored two corners of the four corners on the tetrahedron and you would throw a lot of these tetrahedron and you would count how many colored corners are pointing up and that would be your go in the royal game of or and so that's regarded as one of the very first board games and b gamman kind of grew out of that game someone watching this is probably thinking why the heck does marcus know so much about games why is all this game stuff in your head go on okay well i have just written a new book which is called around the world in 80 games and this is kind of this passion i've had for collecting games wherever i'm traveling on my mathematical journey i i thought oh it' be lovely to put together kind of the story of my my journey for the many decades digging out games and so and when i listed them turned out to be 80 games or game themes and so i thought oh that's perfect i'll use jules vern's story of phyas fog going around the world and actually philas fog loved playing games he he loved his game of choice is a card game the game of wist which is one of the games in the book and he actually would spend more time looking at his cards than the views out the window so they arrive in india in the book and he's just managed to win wist and take all of the tricks and he's super excited by this and completely misses the arrival in bombay or mumbai all right people links below to buy the book go and read this book there is a snakes and ladders section of course along with 79 others okay so now i got these things so all i have to do is convince you that that all of the faces are the same that there symmetries that take any to any others so there you go like so you can see the three-fold rotational symmetry here like if i rotate it like that it's the same and then the three on the back if i do this they're also the same
