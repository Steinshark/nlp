ibm was thinking of launching the 360 series computers that will be byte addressable in the early sixties there was a well-known committee that decided the character codes we used today the ascii committing american standard code for information interchange early sixties ibm approved variet they even had delegates on the board so then the embarrassing questions start coming in okay so there's these 8-bit characters where are they going to come from they're gonna be asking aren't they an ibm coughed and blushed and spluttered and said we'll make a statement into course and a lot of a saw was going to come up here they'd had half a century of evolving their own codes which were based on bcd binary coded decimal more about that possibly later and they just kind of evolved the salespeople gonna burn ours is a little boss this 360 series right if you're saying it can't use our existing codings on our card punch which we've been using for years got bcd i've become ab stick as extended binary coded decimal interchange code and that was the ibm way along with six versions of that faced historical reasons even now i don't know if you can get out of ibm that document that shamefacedly owns up to six different versions of obviously look it up on wikipedia it's hilarious it really is so basically the solar cell look if we can still use our peripherals with this new machinery we can ship quickly if we start messing about saying we will be totally ascii tested and compliant before we ship we're going to lose a huge segment potentially of our market to our competitors so why not just say you know where you are with ibm you're not really interested in these technical details we'll hold your hand but under the hood we will carry on using em stick as our characters and i've no doubt the comments will be full of typical i behaved attitudes all about this but you could see that commercially for them it made sense oh by the way sean have you noticed it has a unforeseen side effect this it locks people into using ibm machinery forever more because they'll be utterly non-standard everybody else will be using ascii is this a bug or is it a feature you know and i do believe and i i think while we discussed it before i do believe that even now ibm replacement mainframes will be using app stick inside but did they eventually get the message and come properly into the modern world yes they did but it took a time because as far as i know some of the earliest machines to actually use ascii that where i bm was when ibm discovery unix and decided all there's all these servers unix other people doing it let's do it the ibm were a great expense but for our customers who don't know spending money where's will so here's the ibm way to do unix well they're a ix i think it's called servers do of course use ascii life will be intolerable for them if it didn't so in a way the absurdity of it could be confined to the mainframes and kept behind the ibm wall as it were but just occasionally problems from apps tick lept out into the outside world sometimes as a result of ibm trying to be helpful would you like to have your ascii-based pdf accidentally or deliberately stored and forwarded by an m stick machine that probably thought it was part of its duty to translate all this rogue ascii into web stick for internal use and then translate it back into ascii again on the way out i remember jim king of adobe telling me it was his biggest nightmare for ages was this you know ibm trying to be helpful yeah store-and-forward ab stick based machines he said you know i tried to discover what the common characters were between ascii and ab stick how much commonality is there could be a lot that must be 100 all characters which are in different mapped positions but nevertheless they correspond one-to-one well first problem is for c programmers there's no curly braces in epps tick i don't know how they got around that i'm guessing some something like use backslash open paren or something for curly brace i don't know and anyway jim says he said we finally decided to dobby there were eight to safe characters that were into mapable between the two we were wrong it depends which of the six version is a purpose that you were using i think in the end they decided they were only 64 absolutely safe characters that could be interconverted between the two so i think the moral of all this is that of course increasingly ab stick is now utterly confined to the i guess replacement hardware why bother to reprogram edge it was written in cobol in 1965 it's still working we just want faster hardware to run it on good old ibm supply what the customers want just sign here i mean i speak as one who's seen a meg in a box delivered by ibm you know three sixty seventy i think it was and a lot of very words of people were doing very good data processing using cobol and all this kind of stuff and the thing was so unbelievably slow and to ibm salesman came buttoned up holding well we here in england only the chancellor holds up a red box with a budget statement these guys were holding this box i just happened to be there and i think think manager computer center managers name was dawn the luckless and don was faced with these guys holding this black box and i said don we here via back channels from your users they are not happy with the performance of your machine on the they called an ias their database system i forget now anyway they're not happy don we have the solution for what says the luckless donna learned raining unless it's done it's a megan box and they took out two things that look more like television cabling with your plums on you plug them into the meg in the box and say open up the cpu based on some watching all this happening they put these things are there okay regen i think that's the ibm where did you regen the system tell it it it's called a megabyte more memory so the regen was done honestly the thing went off like a lamborghini compared to what he was doing before and the nice thing almost littering the queue of users outside the door because of course then the ibm salesmen depart hey just leave it there can't you let your users again yeah and the users are outside don's door in a matter of nanoseconds or what if i said gone that memory stays that memory goes you die this machine's wonderful this is the way it should have been and of course the bill was presented for the meg in the box but of course could now be done as a properly supplied unit but just for now i think it was something like $10,000 $10,000 for a megaman for this ibm memory shawn it was so fast the users were happy i actually saw it in operation that's the way it worked you know you've got a lot of money you know it makes sense don't take chances they won't sack you dong for spending and thousand dollars on amazed i was with ibm there we are so was that all there was to it no on the sidelines and treated quite honestly and shamefacedly i say this in many ways with a bit of division was commercial computing and the company as i'm sure you all know that was instrumental in leading the way with that was ibm
