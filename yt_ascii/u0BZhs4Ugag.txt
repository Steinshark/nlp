hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about how automatic transmissions became cool again and i say again because i assume at some point they were considered cool because of how popular they have become just over the years i mean so many vehicles no more manual transmission we're moving on to automatic and now we have other options like dual clutch and we also have cvts as well as the manual transmission but what seems to be the case is that the automatic transmission isn't going anywhere so if we go back to the 2002 bmw 7 series this was the first production core to have a six-speed automatic and by automatic in this video i'm talking about a planetary gear set and using a torque converter the slush box which isn't that thrilling of a name and so you know why would why would a slush box ever be cool but today today i do believe they are so back in 2001 when the 2002 7 series was introduced that was the first six-speed automatic transmission and that's kind of crazy because you know that's not all that long ago and six speeds today are kind of irrelevant we've got eight speeds nine speeds 10 speeds i don't know infinite speeds with a cvt so we have so many speeds now in different transmissions but we also have dual clutch transmission so in 2003 volkswagen was like we don't need to do this automatic planetary torque converter nonsense dual clutch is the way to go so they introduced the dsg in europe with the volkswagen golf r32 so this was the first production car to have it and it didn't have a torque converter and so you know you had quicker shifts you didn't have the efficiency losses associated with a torque converter and you had very direct driving feel because you don't have that torque converter and so you know perhaps dct at the time seemed like the future and still in many scenarios you know it's still relevant it does have quick shifts for sports cars but you know for everyday vehicles and even for sporty cars the automatic transmission has remained relevant how in the world has it done that you know 15 years later after that dct was introduced we still have a very cool automatic transmissions and the dct did not replace everything well i am sitting inside of the bmw x7 and this has an eight-speed automatic transmission it's the zf 8hp a newer variant of it so there's various variants of the 8 hp and this is one of the newer ones in this brand new bmw x7 and the 8 hp by zf or zf if you want to say zf i'm going to say zf because it sounds a little fancier even though i still say corvette z06 and z for every other reference that uses the letter z anyways it's zf that's how you say it and so it's the zf 8 hp now this transmission has changed in my opinion the automatic you know revolution so so the automatic is cool again purely because of this eight speed zf transmission and you might think okay this bmw has a 4.4 liter twin twin scroll turbocharged engine 456 horsepower tons of torque why wouldn't you pair that with something super sporty like a dual clutch transmission and yet you don't need it this eight-speed automatic with a planetary gear set and it's in a torque converter you know in my opinion it does just as well as a dual clutch performance wise but bmw isn't the only company using this transmission so i've pulled over to read you a very quick list of cars which are using the zf 8 speed and it might not at first seem like these cars should be using a regular old planetary automatic aston martin vanquish alfa romeo julia jaguar f-type bmw pretty much every bmw pretty much every rolls-royce jeep trackhawk dodge hellcat bentley continental gt lamborghini urus toyota super land rover maserati the supers e4 ram trucks even use this according to car and driver in 2017 they built 3.5 million 8 hp transmissions for various manufacturers so everybody is using these things well why is everyone using it well in 2015 i got the opportunity to find out it was my first time driving a vehicle with this transmission that i was aware of at least and it was in the jaguar f-type r and when i drove the car i didn't know what transmission it had i had no clue but i knew that i loved the transmission because it was very smooth and it was very fast in fact i thought it was a dual clutch transmission and then i went home and i googled it and said what transmission does this have and i found out it was the zf8 speed and so then i went and did a little text overlay on the video and said this is the best automatic i've ever driven because i thought it was a dual clutch i thought it was shifting as quickly as a dual clutch and it felt as direct when you were in gear like a dual clutch and so you know what what have they done here and so from a driving perspective you know there's two things that i really care about in a transmission is it quick to shift and is it smooth so that includes the response time of when you ask it to shift as well as how long does it actually take to execute and then you know is it smooth and shifting and in this vehicle truthfully if you have passengers in the car and you're just sitting here selecting through the gears on the with the paddle shifters here they're not gonna know you're shifting gears you can barely barely feel it so the shift quality is insanely good the shifting is so smooth and it's extremely fast so you know it does both things from a driving perspective that i think you want in a transmission but from an engineering standpoint you know shift times and shift quality as far as how smooth it is that's not all that matters there's many things that matter in a transmission so cost of course is critically important when designing anything efficiency of course is very important to engineers size is very important because that's to fit within vehicles and then of course the weight of it is important that correlates with efficiency if it's giant and heavy even if it does work efficiently as far as the losses through the transmission no one cares because it's too big and too heavy so speaking of size and weight what's really impressive is that apple was able to keep the size of it the length of it is the exact same as the six six-speed that it replaces so it can be packaged in the same vehicle and you can just put in that eight-speed transmission rather than the six-speed and it takes up no no more space and it does that with 2.8 less kilograms so you get more gears in the same amount of space that weighs less i mean that is just incredible from an engineering standpoint okay so what about efficiency efficiency is obviously important here one of the cool things about this transmission there's five shifting elements within it in order to select the different gears so there's three clutches and there's two brakes and so you use a combination of any three of those whether that's two brakes and one clutch just three clutches and no brakes one brake and two clutches whatever it may be that's how you select each gear and so what that means is that any one given gear you only have two elements which are open which are going to give you those parasitic drag losses so the less elements you have open the less drag losses you will have and so the more efficient that transmission is going to be they also claim that they have a 98 or better gear set efficiency so the actual losses through a gear set is less than two percent and in fact for first gear and for sixth gear it's essentially just a locked up direct drive so you have zero gear set efficiency losses in first gear and in sixth gear they've also stated that between 500 rpm and 3000 rpm so that's that region where if you're trying to drive efficiently you're probably going to be within that rpm region they have dropped the losses the efficiency losses by 50 percent versus the six-speed transmission so they've really improved that so what does this all add up to well they have six percent better fuel economy six percent fewer emissions purely from switching a transmission so if a transmission alone can give you six percent better fuel economy and emissions i mean that is pretty wild that's a huge improvement and certainly worth doing so same size less weight more gears more efficient what about shift times so in many cases it's actually twice as fast to shift gears versus the six speed that it replaces i mean that's incredible improvement whether that's from you know second gear to eighth gear from seventh year down to third gear and so you know there's kind of three ways that they they worked to do this so there's optimization from the shifting itself so you have the command when either i touch this paddle and say hey i want to downshift there's the command and so it has to process that information and then it has to actually execute this shift so it sends that hydraulic fluid to the correct brakes and the correct clutches in order to execute the ship so they've optimized that you know minimizing the amount of flow how that pressure works out the processing time required to interpret when do i need to shift gears or when you push your foot down on the throttle pedal then there's also the fact that you have more gears so eight gears versus six gears it means the steps can be smaller so if you're dropping the engine let's say you're downshifting and you're dropping the engine from 5000 down to 4000 rpm rather than from 5000 down to 3000 rpm obviously it takes less time to drop less rpm so just a simple way of having more gears means the shifts are probably going to be quicker and then finally you know using the engine to help out so in this case you know on a downshift you're going to blip the throttle a little bit to help get the engine up to speed on an up shift what you're going to do is kind of kill the engine so that it drops down the engine rpm drops down very quickly to whatever speed it needs to be at to match the next gear but overall i mean it is incredible how quick and how smooth this thing is able to change gears i mean i'm in comfort mode here let's put it in sports so it actually you know it's a little bit more aggressive with shifts and even still you barely feel it and it is so fast to do it it is unbelievable how quick this thing is able to shift gears all right but what about all the downsides of a torque converter because that's kind of the big player here as far as efficiency losses if you have that torque converter spinning up and you're just putting heat into a fluid you're losing you know power and energy that could otherwise be used to propel you forward so less wheel horse power versus a dual clutch less efficiency versus a dual clutch but the thing is modern torque converters and modern transmissions have been designed to maximize the region at which the torque converter is locked up so once it's locked up you get that very good you know direct feel of when you put your foot down it doesn't feel like you know this kind of slushy sloppy mechanism it's very direct in what you ask for and what you get and so that's really only occurring where you have slip in the torque converter at very low speeds and so why do they do this well it's actually advantageous if you've driven a dual clutch transmission below five miles per hour you've probably felt the vibration the roughness the harshness it kind of is lurchy because it wants to collapse those clutches rather than have them slipping so if you've ever driven a dual clutch at very low speeds you notice you know it doesn't have that smoothness that you get with a torque converter so there's an advantage from an acceleration standpoint from a smoothness standpoint from a stop using that torque converter and having slip the other advantage of course is having the torque multiplication that torque converters provide so you have torque multiplication you're able to get a better launch from a stop so from a stop a a traditional automatic is better than a dual clutch because you're able to have torque multiplication and it's smoother once you start going you want to lock up that torque converter so you have the direct feel and then use you know the modern technology that we have now to have very quick shifts occur so it really is kind of the best of all worlds and in fact the aston martin ceo was like it's cheaper it's lighter and it's quicker than dual clutch transmission why would i put a dual clutch transmission in my cars i mean that is just such a crazy endorsement and sure aston martins aren't meant to be all-out performance and there's a reason why mclaren is still using dual clutch transmissions but there's also a very good reason why this 8-speed zf transmission is literally everywhere because it is such a good transmission and it does everything so well and the shift quality i mean it's it's unparalleled in the automatic world it really is it is so good to shift gears so smooth and and there's nothing else no other automatic that i have driven that's been anywhere close to the quality of shifts that this thing has now personally of course i would prefer everything came with a manual transmission i would always opt for the manual if it was offered but i cannot fault manufacturers for choosing to use this zf 8 speed and it's awesome that it's so prevalent and so common without within the industry now and that there's so many cars that you can get with it because it truly is an exceptional exceptional transmission so thank you all so much for watching and if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below
