hi, everyone welcome to this introduction to game development in unity in this series we're going to start out by looking at the basics of programming in the c-sharp language and then continue learning more as we create games of increasing complexity inside the unity engine along the way i'll also be providing some challenges for you to try complete on your own so that you can practice your problem-solving skills as a programmer so to give a rough outline of the series. i'm going to begin with several videos covering some important programming concepts such as variables methods and classes following this there will be a brief introduction to the unity engine after which we'll experiment with some practical examples of the things we've [learnt] once we have the basics down we'll then finally be able to start creating games and as we go through this process also be introducing new concepts to solve challenges as they arise that's everything for this introduction. i hope you'll join me in episode one until then cheers
