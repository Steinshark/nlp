there are over 11 500 convenience stores in taiwan with a population of about 23 million that is about one store for every 2 000 consumers that is denser than japan and second only to south korea which has over 40 000 stores about one store for every 1 200 people convenience stores are a core part of the taiwan everyday experience yet also a relatively recent addition but every day over half of the island's entire population spends money at one and this perhaps silly and unnecessary video let us dive into taiwan's ubiquitous convenience store industry taiwan's five largest convenience store brands are 7-eleven family mart high life and okay mart the first and largest of the five is 7-eleven 7-eleven is an american brand in the 1920s claude dolly purchased eight ice manufacturing plants and 21 ice retail stores based in dallas texas to found the southland ice company ownership later passed to john thompson and his family at the start the ice retail stores were called totem based on customer feedback the stores later added milk bread and eggs to their retail lineup alongside the core product of ice by 1947 there were about 74 stores in the local dallas area most of them were open door drive in the stores that sold ice cold drinks groceries and some over-the-counter drugs they opened early in the morning and stayed open until late in the night seven days a week at the suggestion of the tracy lock ad agency southland got the store operators to stay open from 7am to 11 pm they then rebranded the stores to 7-eleven they later moved to a 24-hour model by the 1970s southland was a successful retailing company in the united states seeking global expansion the company dipped its toes internationally with some stores in canada and mexico however the real international step came in 1973 when southland signed a licensing agreement with japan's itoyokato itoyokado also has a long history stretching back to a clothing store in tokyo in 1920. they run a series of successful retail chains including superstores supermarkets department stores and restaurants the first door opened in tokyo in may 1974 their first sale a pair of sunglasses by may 1976 there were 100 such stores in japan today 7-eleven is japan's biggest retail brand having proved the value of the international licensing model southland continued striking agreements with partners in other regions next up was australia in 1976 and then finally taiwan unipresident enterprises began as a small flower mill in the southern city of tainan the company's co-founder gao ching ren belongs to a clique of southern taiwanese business tycoons this includes wu shu chi the founder of tainan spinning corporation who had been gao's manager and helped to get una president off the ground unit president quickly went from flower mills into the production of instant noodles cooking oil soy sauce dairy products and so on on route to becoming a general food company the company vigorously competed with some of taiwan's other major food giants like condiment maker wei trend foods corporation and cooking oil maker ting shin international group as unit president continued its growth as a vertically integrated food company management wanted to have more control over how its products were marketed and retailed this meant creating a retail subsidiary 7-eleven was not taiwan's first convenience store probably the first was the youth store this was a government initiative that came about when officials visited the united states and admired how clean american supermarkets were in 1979 unit president through its subsidiary president chain store corporation or pcsc opened a dozen stores across taipei tainan and gauchon these stores struggled as the company had little experience in retail while traveling in the united states company founder kal came across a 7-eleven store he felt that the format could help solve their retail distribution problem so they approached southland for a license in 1978 or 1979 i have multiple sources saying different dates unipresident struck a deal with the southland then in 1980 taiwan's first 7-eleven convenience store emerged on type a's tang on east road along with its license southland had transferred operational knowledge their instructions were to create uniform modern stores open 24 hours a day in residential areas so to target local housewives however this knowledge did not transfer all that well to the taiwanese populace the average taiwanese annual income back then was less than two thousand five hundred dollars the 7-eleven aesthetic required clean but expensive packaging of things like eggs making their products less affordable furthermore most taiwanese prefer to shop at traditional corner shops open-air groceries or traditional markets they like to haggle complaining that this 7-eleven product sold for 11 ntd but was really worth 7 mtd 7-eleven struggled during these early days two years after their launch una president was still running large operating losses eating nearly a billion ntd of capital 7-eleven general manager shu tong ren struggled to turn the company around the store suffered from the disease of wanting to be everything to everyone causing chaos some stores were selling fresh fish and meat while others had seven or eight types of detergent sure shifted the store's target audience away from housewives to young and busy working consumers he first localized the store's food offerings replacing the western food options with boxed lunches meat buns and the now famous tea eggs management back at southland objected but eventually she got his way he saw a slurping machine in hong kong and added what was then called slime ice to the product lineup this product became very popular with the young people and critically shoot closed nearly half of the underperforming stores cutting the number down from 75 stores to 30 to 40. these closures shifted the company store mix away from residential communities and towards street intersections slowly this turnaround worked in 1983 one 7-eleven did well enough so to stay open 24 hours a day and in 1986 after losing money for six consecutive years the convenience store business division finally turned a profit at this time there were about 100 7-eleven stores throughout taiwan around the same time southland corporation ran into difficult straits in the 1980s southland diversified away from its core businesses for instance they purchased citgo petroleum in 1983 thinking that they needed to protect the gasoline supplies for their gas station stores the company became big and bloated struggling against new competition in a difficult economic environment corporate raiders targeted them for a buyout in 1987 the owning family the thompsons announced a big leveraged buyout they issued billions of dollars of junk bond debt to buy out all the publicly traded shares southland went private but still struggled to turn itself around having lost 1.3 billion dollars in 1989 and with nearly 4 billion dollars of debt in 1990 the company filed for bankruptcy and was eventually taken over by ito yokado it's japanese affiliate the combined company renamed itself to seven and i holdings southland's fall did not much affect the stores in taiwan which were still largely run by pcsc in fact the taiwanese convenience store industry was about to go into overdrive throughout the 1980s and 1990s convenience stores grew to dominate taiwan's retail sector after 7-eleven proved the model competitors began to flood into the market familymart is a japanese brand founded back in 1973 by a supermarket retailer called seiyu today it is largely owned by the general trading company itochu in 1988 a number of japanese and taiwanese companies joined together to bring family mart to taiwan it was the store's first overseas expansion familymart also struggled during its early years turning losses until 1994 when it hit about 192 stores after that however store count grew rapidly that same year fang chen enterprises collaborated with the americans convenience store brand circle k to create okay mart a year later in 1989 a dairy company called quang chun dairy company set up high life high life is the third largest convenience store brand after 7-eleven and family mart these smaller convenience store brands banded together to compete with the dominant 7-eleven which had a fairly big head start on everyone in 1994 there were about 5411 convenience stores four years later in 1998 that number had grown to 7533. several factors drove this growth first taiwanese incomes were growing rapidly surpassing ten thousand dollars per capita in 1993. more people were working and hitting up the convenience store and earlier in 1987 the taiwanese government lifted martial law after many years which allowed people to finally go out at night they also loosened restrictions on foreign capital investments allowing a new class of investors to open up franchise stores in taiwan 7-eleven adopted the franchise model in 1989 and family mart in 1990. in 1988 the taiwan government phased out the practice of selling charity lottery tickets many small shops selling these tickets went out of business leaving behind empty storefronts in prime places for convenience stores to move in over time the stores gained further value by adding new services like postal delivery buying train tickets to the ibon machine paying utility bills and paying fees further deregulations throughout the 1990s made these service partnerships possible several brands found themselves unable to compete during this period and exited the market this included taiwan big egg and waitron's am pm convenience stores after 2000 the convenience store market started to become especially saturated growth and revenue at least for 7-eleven largely peaked in 2005. nowadays you might see a family mart and a 7-eleven right next to one another it sort of makes sense since they are competitors but you might wonder sometimes why you can find two 7-elevens or family marts within close range to each other sometimes literally on opposite ends of a traffic intersection there are some economic sense behind the madness two stores so close to each other will cannibalize each other but 7-eleven wants to place these as close to people as possible there are logistics advantages that are mentioned later but they also believe that most people have a preferred store that they repeatedly visit even if another is close by regardless of all that it is true that the convenience store market is very saturated now and that means that 7-eleven family mart and the other brands had to get more efficient they worked on improving distribution like opening up new warehouses and distribution centers or upgraded the point of sale systems to make processing orders faster while convenience store brand may directly own and run their own stores many stores are franchised this means another business the franchisee gets to use the 7-eleven or family mart brand an operation network in exchange for a cut of the profit taiwanese convenience stores have several types of franchising models first there's a mandated model where 7-eleven chooses the location and opens the store and grants a particular franchisee the right to run the store here 7-eleven gets to keep the majority of the profits another model is the authorized model this is where the franchisee owns the space and works with 7-eleven to open a shop there in this case the franchisee keeps the majority of the profits in both cases the franchisees run the store i.e hiring and cleaning and such but franchisees are under the convenience store brand's thumb with many product decisions made for them by the central office a source of friction your average 7-eleven or family mart offers about 2 000 to 3 000 goods in a relatively small area about 45 to 200 square meters larger stores might offer dining areas a bookshelf or even a mini bar product turnover is high so these stores are regularly replenished by trucks dispatched from the distribution center two times a day six days a week depending on an area's store density a truck might visit as many as 10 stores in a single trip adding more stores to a truck's route without changing it helps cut the purse store delivery cost making supply more affordable a very significant network scaling advantage in july 2022 pcsc opened its 10 000 7-eleven each day 7-eleven issues 13 million receipts implying that half of the island's population spend money there each day it is dawning on me right now that i have done a 10 plus minute video about convenience stores so i feel that i should wrap it up quickly the thing that really struck me as i worked on this video was not how great these convenience stores are though they are certainly great but just how massive this foods company unipresident is i never heard of the company before i came here yet unipresident not only runs all of the 7-elevens here in taiwan but also all the starbucks mr donuts shops cosmed drugstores and cara4 hyper stores here too and then to boot they're also one of the world's largest food conglomerates with a dominant position and instant noodles cooking oil tea packaging materials and more they also own a baseball team in taiwan's largest shopping mall dream mall in gauchon it is kind of freaky how a single company came to be so deeply involved in taiwanese life food for the thought alright everyone that's it for
