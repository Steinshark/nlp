this phone is not normal this tablet not normal but maybe we should change that because the fact that designs like this and this are normal doesn't mean that they're the best that is why samsung display sponsored this video to show you how their latest folding and expanding screen designs could make your next device less normal but better suited to how you want to use it and we'll be giving you guys all the facts you need to tell which ones are gimmicky solutions looking for a problem and which ones are so exciting that you are going to want them in your next device we're starting with a design they call the flex g i think because of how it looks in profile view folded it's about the girth of a late 2000s era flip phone but folded open and it becomes a shockingly slim 7.2 inch amoled display with an accompanying stylus at least on this prototype that's you gotta remember guys these are not early units of upcoming samsung electronics products these are concepts from samsung display a completely different company now some of these proofs of concept could appear in samsung branded devices but they're just as likely to show up in devices from companies that you might traditionally think of as samsung's competitors this one is impressively thin which helps it remain nicely compact when it's folded i'm not sure if i'm personally convinced of this form factor but if one of samsung's partners wants to go forward who knows and that's because as a samsung fold user i know that the extra work of opening one of these devices not just me towards using it closed and i'm not exaggerating here about 80 percent of the time so for me to buy into a flex g style phone it would need to have an outer screen for me to shoot off text messages from since typing on any screen wider than a couple of inches means really long travel distances for your thumbs what's cool though is that when we brought up the possibility of adding an external display to it the response was and i kid you not why not i mean leave it to a display company to say oh you want more displays well no problem sir next up is the flex g tablet concept and i think this design makes a lot of sense i love how the screen is fully protected when it's not in use and i love how small it packs up this is like sci-fi guys a 12.4 inch tablet that can be folded up and packed into a purse i mean it's easy to forget how much our clothes and our accessories are impacted by our devices like we take for granted that we need a backpack now or at the very least a messenger bag to hold on to our laptops and our tablets but if these go mainstream maybe it'll be the catalyst we need to finally bring the fanny pack back next up there's the flexess style where my opinions are actually kind of flipped with this config you always end up with an outer screen which i think is probably not that useful on a tablet though it could be good for typing or reading but on a phone well now you've got a single screen doing everything whether the device is open or not i like this a lot and check out how awesome it is to close with one hand like how could you do this without thinking later peasants future man has places to be slip slip flip see you later and you'll definitely feel like you're in the future when you see samsung displays expanding screens these are exactly as trippy to look at in person as they are on camera they have a couple of displays that are motorized but the prototypes here are manual requiring very little but not too little force to manipulate them the idea is simple want a couple extra inches for some extra tools just pull the screen apart want to get rid of those pesky black bars and watch the content at its native aspect ratio push it back together they even have concepts that can both expand and fold as mind-bending in sci-fi as this tech is though there are a couple of things to keep in mind number one these demos are a little more slick than what i would imagine real software is going to look like especially at first i mean yes operating systems like say android are designed to be responsive but that doesn't mean that the developer of the app you're using has implemented a way to thoughtfully use extra real estate that you randomly stretch out the phone into and even if they have there's a good chance that the ui is going to bug out for a second before it adapts similar to how our phones stutter when they're rotated between portrait and landscape which has been a feature for over a decade and yet it still happens second the expansion is made possible by a slide out mechanism that does make the device thicker it's a thing not only that but the expanded area of the screen is a bit warped and sloped compared to the more stable parts at least for now it should be noted that this was a non-issue when we were looking at it directly but it is something that you have to consider if say you're sitting on a plane and you want to prop it up in between the two of you and enjoy a movie together with your seat mate i think the main reason these things are worth noting here is because i'm still trying to figure out if an expanding or a slide out display makes sense on principle if the screen can be bigger won't people just want that extra space all the time and if you can fold the display wouldn't be better to just whip it out rather than stretch it out like like no really i'm actually just asking you guys let me and let samsung display know how you imagine using these displays in the future in the comments below there's a good chance pretty much a 100 chance that someone at samsung display or maybe more importantly their partners is going to see your ideas and they could make their way into your hands in the future back in folding land here's one that's a bit confusing at first the flex in and out is like my galaxy z fold except after it's open you can just keep on opening it why you may ask that's exactly what we asked and the answer was that there's no new thing that this really allows you to do but you can do all of the regular stuff that you could do with something like a z-fold with less see unlike my daily driver this concept has no second external screen but you could still use it one-handed and fold it over so maybe you have it fully open when it's in your pocket like at a convenience mode or fully closed when it's anywhere else and it could be in protected mode it also only needs one camera instead of five like mine but still easily allows you to take selfies or elsies by flipping the device around so i am excited by how bendable this screen is because it could be the concept that brings folding foams like this to more mainstream prices i can't say this one looks like it'll come into the mainstream price though the flex note is basically a ginormous 17 inch tablet that in theory you could prop up and use like a laptop it's a head turner for sure but i gotta admit that on-screen keyboards are a bit of a turn off for me so i personally wouldn't be too interested in this concept as it is but it if it has inputs that allowed me to use it as a foldable portable monitor whoa now it's getting cool maybe i'm just lacking an imagination though so if you guys can think of another way that this form factor would change your life you gotta let us know down below speaking of external monitors they did actually have one monitor on display it doesn't fold but the oled color performance and pencil thin form factor still made it worth including here not everything samsung display showed was focused on mobile devices though the digital cockpit showed off a concept for what a future car absolutely full of screens could look like this one in the front is particularly cool because like the xenion flex monitor that we saw recently it can be curved or flattened depending on the driver's preference finally we have a gaming concept that i think is way more compelling than you might at first realize we've seen dual screen handhelds before and while i can immediately imagine this being great for emulating said device the more day-to-day useful thing about this one for me is the way it moves your eye line as i noted in my recent short circuit on the gpd win 4 the display of which slides up to reveal a keyboard having the screen higher than your hands does wonders for ergonomics and as an added bonus the flip serves as a built-in screen protector now anyone who's been a fan of small phones over the years but has had to upgrade recently can tell you that the market is moving towards bigger screens and that's awesome you know from a certain perspective except when it isn't awesome not everyone has deep pocketed costco jeans and likewise not everyone has giant mkbhd hands so i think the best thing about what samsung display is creating here is the flexibility pun intended to build devices that can serve a broader range of users without compromise thanks again samsung display for sponsoring this video and i think even more importantly giving us real hands-on time with these concepts i'm actually super jelly that james got to be the one up close and personal with them don't miss any of the rest of our ces coverage by the way from the away team or maybe already came i don't know when this video is going up
