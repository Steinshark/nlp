[music] this video is sponsored by macpaw ooh okay all right now we're working hey what's up guys i'm kbhd here and today was apple's online only 2020 the worldwide developer conference where they of course typically have a lot to say about software there's sometimes some hardware surprises there was no hardware this year but they did have some good announcements there's some cool new features and there was a bigger a bigger announcement at the end but first can i just say as a video nerd the production was a plus i was kind of wondering leading up to it how would apple do an online only wwdc keynote you know they've been the gold standard for live events for years and we've seen that excellence but now that they can't have people there will they still do it on stage like that but with nobody clapping would it be kind of awkward but they nailed it essentially it was a pre-recorded presentation so it was a little more dynamic with some varied locations around apple campus some variety of presenters same style but they kept up the pacing and kept down the awkward jokes and they still got to flex their production muscle a little bit with some pretty wild over-the-top but still tasteful transitions thanks to some drone work i don't know if the apple team watches these recap videos ever or even cares what people think of it but bravo bravo so it started it kicked off with ios 14 and there's some new features and some fresh new looks and there was a sort of a theme to it don't worry you'll pick up on it so first off in the iphone there's what's called the app library basically an app drawer that's organized by categories recently added etc helps you see everything in one place instead of having to swipe swipe swipe through all of your pages of apps and what i thought was nice is now since you have that all app view you can actually hide some of those extra pages of apps that you don't need just sitting over there so you go into what they call i swear they called it on stage jiggle view i just go into jiggle mode and then tap the dots at the bottom and then just uncheck the pages that you don't want to see anymore nice then they also added widgets to the home screen so they're taking them out of the today only view on the side and you can put those widgets anywhere on your home screen well actually not quite anywhere on the home screen i still think they're pinned to the top so you can't truly put them anywhere on the whole grid like free placement like a certain other os with widgets but nevertheless widgets are welcome they're rich they have plenty of information in them plus there's this new smart stack widget which essentially changes what widget it is throughout the day so it starts off as like your calendar widget in the morning but through the day as things happen or as it knows what you want to do it'll switch to your news briefing during the day or maybe turns into a summary of your fitness activity in the afternoon like hey get a workout in so home screen customization an app drawer widgets on the home screen just stop me if you've seen this before they also added picture-in-picture video support much more generally and that's something that's been sorely missed for a while in ios that's been in other os's and then siri has a ui overhaul it's not full screen anymore but it's a much smaller portion along the bottom of the screen now you know kind of like the google assistant with i don't know it's kind of like android crawled so iphone could run but for real siri should have way more answers in her knowledge graph now so she can hopefully answer way more questions instead of just telling you here i looked that up for you or here's what i found and then there's a few more things like a new translate app that they're adding which will hopefully let you have conversations back and forth in different languages you know if only there was some other industry standard translate app i could compare that to okay i'll stop and then there's also something called app clips and they basically let you interact with small parts of apps that you don't even have installed and it'll plug into apple pay and sign in with apple and everything else and you can really quickly do stuff that you couldn't do without that app and they've made it easy for developers to build in reminds me a lot of okay androids instant apps basically the theme of course is we're going to see a lot more overlap with these two mature os's ios and android it's just funny that so many of these new features in ios 14 have been around since like the beginning of android but that's not to say there weren't some other features that weren't in android and hey maybe they should copy these features in the messaging app for example you'll be able to pin conversations to the top and they added inline replies in group chat and mentions in a thread so you can have a group chat that only sends you notifications when someone mentions your name kind of like slack that's pretty sweet apple maps has now added a couple new countries and a dedicated cycling mode for when there's bike routes and also a new ev routing mode where it knows once you tell it what type of electric car you have and then can route you along the way where you have compatible chargers for your car that's something google maps should add and then underrated carplay gets a nice fresh ui overhaul with wallpapers a good wallpaper just really sets your mood for the day not gonna lie but maybe the most impressive demo of them all was using the iphone as car keys so the first car that's going to be compatible with this is the 2021 bmw m5 which they had there and there will be more cars in the future compatible with this but it will literally use nfc to turn your phone into your car keys to unlock the car and then dock it and start up and drive away which on one hand is like oh great okay if i lose my phone now i also lose my car keys but on the other hand if i lose my phone i was already losing my wallet my phone my camera my communicator i might as well add car keys to that list i guess so then next up was ipad os 14 and that got a lot of the same improvements you saw with ios so the new widgets with the customizations siri is now in the bottom corner so again it's not taking up the whole screen to tell you that it's going to look for something now when calls come in they don't take up the entire screen too just another small notification thank god and there's a smaller universal search bar you know it's a lot of the same stuff we saw with the iphone but some of the next level stuff came with the apple pencil so scribble lets you hand write in any text field and any text you write or take notes in will automatically be converted to text that you can then copy and paste into other places and search with universal search super powerful ocr really useful kind of similar to what we saw with the galaxy note but of course now it's all on your ipad and the iphone and the mac another fun one you can draw a simple shape and then pause at the end and it'll automatically draw a perfect version of that shape one thing that i tweeted about during the keynote that i think got a lot of attention but it's really one of those examples of why apple's ecosystem is so important to them is because they have this integration where it's a new airpods feature and if you're listening to airpods and you have your iphone out it can tell now with ios 14 when you put down your iphone and pick up your ipad and it'll switch your airpods audio straight away to whatever you start doing on that ipad and if you put down the ipad and start using the mac it'll know that too and switch your audio all of that automatically that's the kind of stuff you look forward to oh and another one of those things that sort of slept under the radar but it was on that slide that they put at the end of some of the sections where there's some stuff they didn't get to talk about and that is you'll be able to set a default email and browser app on the ipad and the iphone finally again this has been something you could do on other os's but hey gmail as a default chrome as a default you can now actually do that thank you i'll probably do a sort of a roundup of the best features of ios 14 and ipad os 14. the betas are out now you can grab them right now i probably will as soon as i'm done shooting this but similar to what i did with android 11 maybe leave a thumbs up below if you're interested in seeing a video like that i feel like a lot of people are just interested in seeing how the widgets will actually work but let's move on because they moved on to watch os seven this is a there's a lighter update they have some new features you can now do watch face sharing so you can share via messages to contacts or to social media if you want to share your watch face and you can now do multiple complications from one app which is nice but it's still not a totally custom third-party watch face like we want oh and there's also now autumn this is the most 20 20 thing ever automatic hand washing detection as you start washing your hands it hears with the microphones the sound of soap and water and will start a countdown timer and won't stop until you get to 20 seconds encouraging you to wash your hands properly this is one of those things we're going to look back at like wow what a time to be alive but the biggest feature for sure on the new apple watch os is sleep tracking this is something we kind of wondered about since the apple watch first came out it's one of those big features other fitness bands had there's now going to be sleep tracking on the apple watch which brings up the question when do you charge it and i think the answer unofficial maybe officially but the answer is in the morning so if you wear the apple watch all day you typically get about two hours of two days of battery life with it so you wear it all day then you wear it all night it tracks your sleep the screen is off it can wake you up with a haptic vibration so you don't wake up other people around you and then you charge it like briefly for like a half an hour in the morning and then you put it back on and you start your day with a full battery i think that's how it should work or you could just not have it track your sleep if you're not into that all right the biggest update in my well many people's opinions but the biggest update from wwdc mac os big sur so this is mac os 11. i don't know if you caught that during the keynote but we've had macos10.x.x for a while now this is mac os 11 and it is the biggest change since mac os 10 basically started and it's it's it's mostly a design overhaul and i have mixed feelings about it because i like some of it and i just don't like some other parts remember when i said a good wallpaper sort of sets your tone for the day i think i think the new wallpaper kinda i'll link it below sure i think it kind of masks some of the things that i don't like so much first of all there's way more rounded corners way more transparency with windows and menus way more variation in textures i don't like the rounded corners on everything but i'm cool with the rest of that then there's a new dock with new icons and this i have to do a double take at i do not like a lot of these new icons and i think it's something about the shading or the shadowing that they added the uniformity in size that is great but just looking at like the icons by themselves like the finder icon the facetime icon i just i don't know looks kind of weird to me maybe let me know what you think i don't hide my dock you can't see it over here but it's always on the side there and you know this is probably one of those things we'll get used to in like two weeks of having it but maybe this will make me finally hide my dock i don't know looks kind of weird but there's also a new quick settings and notification center that really struck me because it really looks like it's modeled after the ipad which also makes it feel like it would work better with touch than a mouse now i don't use the notification center in my daily use that often but the inspiration here is pretty clear and that is a big change for people who actually do use this often but again most of that is visual changes but that brought us up to the big announcement which is the big transition so apple did in fact use wwdc 2020 to announce that they will be transitioning the mac from intel silicon to apple's own custom silicon this isn't really a surprise we sort of saw this churning in the background and we knew it was coming but it's a big deal you see apple has had their own silicon in some of their products for a little while now it's in the apple watch but we've seen the type of impressive performance they can get out of an iphone pretty good then we saw the type of impressive performance they can get out of an ipad best in class better than a lot of laptops so now we're expecting to start seeing the type of performance we can get out of the thermal architecture of a laptop and a desktop now there's upsides to this and downsides the upside is of course with their own chips in these devices you can expect next level performance that you can unlock and it's also clearly a huge advantage for apple to control their own destiny when it comes to performance updates and features instead of waiting for and relying on intel but on the other side of the coin there now has to be a transition period because as a developer i mean this is a developer conference you now have this choice weirdly between optimizing for intel max or optimizing for apple silicon max whatever they call them because for a while these two things will both exist at the same time now apple talked about this at length on stage this is why they talked about smoothing it as much as possible with xcode and a universal binary that works on both intel based max and apple silicon but there is probably a brief moment in time where some apps work better on intel and some apps work better on apple's chips and you have to make your choice of which mac to buy accordingly now craig federighi on stage said he expects this transition period to last about two years seems reasonable and he also said that they still have some more intel max in the pipeline coming up and to also expect the first apple based mac what is it called apple silicon based mac the first one of those will be coming out by the end of this year 2020. but yeah i'm super curious what sort of things that will unlock for apple as far as performance when they make their own ships like i'm imagining in a couple years a mac pro just being so sick having all the thermal headroom in the world or even just a macbook pro that doesn't thermally throttle because they're so much better at that architecture than intel has been but you know what that is about it that wraps it up for what we saw at wwdc again we'll take a second look at those features in ios and ipad os but fun fact we'll also be having craig federighi as a guest joining me on the waveform podcast this week so i will ask leave in the comments below what you want to ask what you want us to talk about what sort of clarification or specific questions you might have and craig and i will talk about it until then thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one and shout out to macpaw for sponsoring this video so with as much good as apple does with mac os it can still build up imperfections over time and it does need maintenance so that's where their product clean my mac x comes in it helps you stay aware of all the apps and services installed on your mac and all your permissions so you can figure out which programs have access to things like your camera and your microphone and it gives you more control over apps and their files helping you free up space and the most popular feature smart scan helps you find logs and cache files that are no longer needed and get rid of them thus cleaning up your mac so i'll leave a link below to check it out for your mac and thanks again to macpaw for sponsoring this video catch you guys in the next one peace
