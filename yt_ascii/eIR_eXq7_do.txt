hey hey yeah yeah come on come over here yeah yeah come on come on come on hey hey hey hey hey i just wanted to take a second and tell you two things in my kind of long career that were the most foundational moments of my life in programming and so the first one has to do with data structures and algorithms and specifically two things the first one was seeing how a stack was created a really well really a linked list was created seeing a class in java 1.5 yes i said 1.5 it was a while ago okay just seeing how a class could have a value and another field that can reference the class that was created and then being able to see how memory was laid out and all that just blew my mind so much and i became so excited about programming i still remember that was the moment in my programming career where i went from i don't know if i like this to i absolutely love this and then the second big one was recursive like being able to understand recursion i remember just taking so much time and like writing out factorial right the recursive way or doing summing the recursive way or doing the fibonacci sequence the recursive way or even copying the power of hanoi code hanoi code which was i still don't even understand that to this day but i remember none of those set in and i thought okay i'm just not smart enough for computer science i can't learn this i don't understand recursion and there was one problem specifically that we had to do for the same class that showed me linkedin linked list not linkedin very different experience on linkedin but it was a maze solving algorithm and it was super simple and once i saw how that worked all of a sudden it was like i see recursion i know recursion like i i just knew it i knew it and i knew i could do it awesome and it was one of the best experiences of my lifetime and so the reason why i say this part is that for free on front end masters forever no credit card required sign up you get this this is 11 hours this took me effectively 200 hours to prepare i get asked this question all the time what is the free algorithms course that i mentioned this is it right here we go over lots of things including tries implementing a heap we crush a depth first search binary search blah blah blah blah blah all the good stuff all the algorithms all the things that made me a good programmer to this day we go over and i just found it super important in my life and so i wanted it to be super important in your life and that's why i worked with front and masters we made it free i'm going to include a link down below if you use the link and you do end up paying and buying a membership then i get something baby that's right we're talking about i get something then but if you just watch it for free i get nothing totally awesome go and do that it is worth the time it takes because it will dramatically shape your career and i do mean that and so this well i don't know what happened i breathed in my like throat collapses like the the soft palate my back my throat anyways yeah this is all one take you get stream brain right now and so the second one and the second thing that was like probably the most important or second most important thing in my life was learning how a compiler worked this was just i cannot tell you the amount of different tasks i've had over the years or learning new languages or doing things that have made such a dramatic difference in my life and i just understood how it works and so like here's a quick example i know again this is going to sound crazy but i had to use to do groovy a bunch right and you'd get these errors i could read the stack traces because i built something similar to create closures in a language that didn't have closures as part of my exercise building a compiler and so like i understood what groovy was doing underneath the hood in the jvm and i could just i could get it at a fundamental level where everyone else was just like dude what the hell's happening they just didn't have the same experience i had and i also could understand it with javascript the reason why i could understand javascript so quickly is because i got it i understood what was happening because i've built something similar building a compiler will plus one your understanding of any programming language just like so much faster it is just incredible what it does and so that's why also again i know this is crazy we've been building this on stream right here you can use code the prime gen you get 30 off i get zero dollars from this one i get nothing this is not a sponsorship this is not an ad thorstenball amazing writer makes an incredible book it is literally 30 for you zero percent for me seventy percent for thorson he's a great guy and he agreed that he would like to just help get people this out i think this is super important and you can also join in on all the fun on the repo right now we're just trying to get this interpreter built in a whole bunch of different languages we actually got quite a few right now i really need help managing this the pull requests are coming in faster than i could do like what the what the hell why do we got chat jeopardy chat coming in here and actually like look at this we're proofed engineering these proof engineering anyways so it's like you know building an interpreter or building a compiler will also just be something that will plus one your career so so much it makes such an incredible difference in how you look at a programming language if you understand how it works not at just the surface level or you explaining to someone else who understands programming but at the underneath the covers level and so i just wanted to take the time and tell you the two most important things in my career that i can kind of look back on there's a few other important ones maybe we'll go over those at another time but i wanted to talk about those two just due to how important they were to me and the fact that i can even remember so many moments almost 15 20 years later like in the class i can remember it's just it's it's hard to describe how important it was to me so i hope hopefully you like this hey hit the sub button hit the like button do all those things you know you got to do because if you don't if you don't do that then i'm sad you want you want a cyanogen is that what you want the name it's the satogen i gotta press the stop button because this is all one take
