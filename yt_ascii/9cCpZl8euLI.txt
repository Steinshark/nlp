- all right, thank you, sir. guys, we just got this house and we're giving it to a homeless person. chandler's family friend is in trouble. - what about brother bobby? - brother bobby's been hit by a car. he can't even freaking walk. he's on one of them little knee scooters. - oh. - and because of that, he
hasn't been able to work much and he's about to go homeless. not on my watch! - that was the key. we need that. - so we've got him this house. we're gonna deck out this house. we're gonna give chandler
a couple thousand dollars to have fun with him, and then at the end of the day, he's gonna come to this house
and he won't be homeless because his lease is almost
up and he has nowhere to go, so he's gonna go here. - here. - there's a lot of money. take that, go get brother
bobby, get your dad, and go have fun. while you're doing that, we're gonna take this house we just got, deck it out, and at the end of the day,
we're gonna give it to him. - one, two, three, brother bobby! - go have fun. - all right. - and now that we took care of that, we need to pick out what we're gonna buy. i want a couch here. i want a rug. i want a lamp. i want a table. i want a new fridge. i want a microwave. i want a new stove. - all right, so i guess
jimmy gave me some money to go spend on brother bobby. i'm gonna go distract him for the day. i'm gonna go pick him up. we'll have a great time
and play some bingo. all right, so we just picked
up brother bobby and my dad and jimmy gave us some
money to go have a nice day. and we're gonna do whatever
you wanna do today. - i'm with you guys. y'all do what y'all want to do. - we're gonna go probably
get you some clothes and then we'll see what
we can do after that. - whatever y'all say. i'm with a good family. - it's all about you today, man. so whatever you want,
that's what we're doing. - how many years have you known me? - 100, at least. so you just be yourself and
let's have some fun, man. - that's right, awesome b-roll. yes, yes, yes, please. this one's not bad. okay, no, let's get it. it's ours. - hey, this one's not bad. - all right, we'll take it. i think he'll like it. - yeah! - this is all we need. this entire u-haul is
just gonna be trash can and a vacuum cleaner. - perfect. - let's see if he wants this. - hey, what's up? - hey, do you think he wants this tv? all right, we'll get it. - hey, that's the tv i have. if we're getting him a nice tv, we gotta get him a nice tv stand, right? - where? - to walmart! - oh. - ah, why? we almost made a very bad mistake. you need a plunger. okay, there we go. he'll need some glasses. old people love countertop ovens. dude. jimmy, tell me i'm wrong. - that's right, work it. work it. - hello? - hey, is he a suave or a
head & shoulders type of guy? - head & shoulders. - gotcha. head & shoulders it is. - do you think it needs these? - it doesn't hurt. - they're like band-aids. he could probably use some bandages. - yeah, and like maybe for his elbow. - yeah, these are elbow band-aids. oh. - so we were going to
walmart to buy some things and apparently chandler's here. okay, so how are things going? - things are going really well. - is he having fun?
- yes. - he is? - he's so grateful. he said it like 8,000 times already. - okay. go back. - all right.
- keep distracting him. to the next place! - ahh! - all right, we're picking
out a really nice couch. that's the one. - i want this one. - this is the couch. i want this couch. i don't even wanna look at the rest. i want this one. - is it comfy? - yeah. - this whole set.
- yeah. - let's take all of it. - yeah, this set is actually . - hey, what type of
mattress should we buy him? because i have no idea. i mean, we're just laying on 'em, but like does he want a sturdy one? go on a covert operation
and have chandler record it. try to ask him what mattress he'd like without giving it away. all right, we sent his
dad on a covert operation. - what kind of mattress
do you have now, bobby? - one that's hard as
that, that over there. hard as a brick, old as dirt. - you like a real soft one? or like medium? - yeah, medium. - all right, chandler,
what bed does he want? - a medium. - medium? - this is pretty good. - oh, that literally says medium. - yeah. - okay, cool, thank you. - i gotcha. - watch yourself. - there we go. so this is everything we're
gonna buy for brother bobby. now we're gonna take it
to his house, set it up and surprise him. hey chris, what do you
