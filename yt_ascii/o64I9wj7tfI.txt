ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the channel today we have an exciting episode of colts going to war two of the biggest cults on earth right now it's the elon musketeers versus the bitcoin boys twitter's going nuts right now elon musk is the enemy of the bitcoin boys the elon musk fans they say hey it's all about dogecoin and look at the end of the day it's just cringe on both sides and i'm gonna play both sides right i'm gonna play a little mac from always sunny in philadelphia i get myself into too much trouble this time i'm playing both sides so that i always come out on top dude it honestly feels so it's like such a big war it feels like a mr beast went to war with pewdiepie like youtube wouldn't know what to do with themselves they'd implode right and it's objectively funny watching these people look the maturity of elon musketeers and bitcoin boys it's not much more than nine-year-olds or ten-year-olds like half of them think that digital money is going to make everybody rich who buys it and the other half thinks that elon musk's going to put a nano chip inside of your brain inside of two years so both side i think are a little bit wrong at the same time i'm kind of a fan look i own a little satoshi i own a little bit of actually i don't think a musk but i like musk right so with that out of the way with covering both of my bases with appeasing both sides because i don't know who's going to win yet let's get let's jump into this story right let's go to the board ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla and yeah so to give you all a little bit of backstory about how this massive battle started right elon musk announcing back in march that you can now buy a tesla with bitcoin now bear in mind crypto is still sort of a new thing even though it's getting wider acceptance and something as big as tesla sort of publicly announcing that they're going to start using this as a transaction like that you can actually transact and buy a real thing with bitcoin was a big deal and it was a sign that crypto was here to stay additionally tesla even took bitcoin onto their balance sheet according to a 10k filing they had put 1.5 billion dollars into bitcoin elon musk even called bitcoin a slightly less dumb version than cash he was pretty much like beloved by everyone at this point he's the hero to crypto there's no betrayal he's just pro bitcoin everybody's excited everyone wants to talk to him all of crypto follows him and they're all loved by tesla's cyber trucks they're putting in their pre-orders he literally gets everybody on his side then he even promises to put a literal dogecoin on the literal moon i mean this man is loved by everyone so what could go wrong fast forward a month and tesla does a stress test they do they prove wanted to prove liquidity by selling bitcoin they wanted to prove that it could be a viable cash alternative and people understandably start to get nervous they wonder is tesla really in this for the long haul is he a bitcoin maximalist what is he doing here and many thought that this was proof that maybe elon musk was getting cold feet about the whole project but then the fire nation attacked ladies and gentlemen put the ominous music on because on may 12th elon musk puts out this tweet tesla and bitcoin basically they say they're not going to accept bitcoin for tesla anymore like they won't accept it as a form of payment because of it's quote great cost to the environment which i guess elon musk is saying he just found out about and so everybody loved this except for the bitcoiners right bitcoin is freaked out so at this point you can literally see the second that he tweets because bitcoin falls from a high of like 57 000 to 50 000 in like one tweet you know the price of bitcoin by over 10 no big deal guys but honestly i think people miss how genius of a troll this is because not only is he manipulating the market with his you know movements here but i'm also convinced that he didn't just now decide and realize that bitcoin was bad for the environment literally the data has been out on this forever you either believe it's a bad thing or you believe it's a good thing people disagree but literally if he thinks that it's a bad thing why did he say this a month before this jack from twitter ceo of twitter says bitcoin incentivizes renewable energy guys it's good for the environment bitcoin isn't bad we thought it was bad because elon musk said so now it's good except you know who else agrees with jack elon musk who tweeted a month before saying that it's too bad for the environment he can't accept it for tesla he said true it is does incentivize renewable energy so not sure how to square that one but either way the result was the same bitcoin boys get furious and look i'm not talking about like random people who own bitcoin like everybody does there's this special breed i don't know if you know this they're called bitcoin maximalists they typically have laser eyes in their profiles and they basically think bitcoin is going to save the world from everything but these guys completely lose their minds like elon musk poked the bear when he caused crypto to crash so i'm gonna be pulling from barely sociable's twitter account where he's been cataloging the meltdown of some of these people check this out dear jack i reported elon musk's account because he's using his huge number of followers that he gained because being the richest man in the world to manipulate the crypto market and sure you know that what he is doing with bitcoin kindly to sp suspend his account or even warn him about this manipulation as it is affecting a lot of people negatively hey guys the big bad billionaire made my crypto account go down and i'm very mad about time to give elon the donald trump treatment wow when you see fudd click unsubscribe thank you now just bear in mind that the same guy was worshiping elon musk like two months ago this unsubscribed guy where elon musk is talking about tesla buying bitcoin and he goes yeah that's what i thought said you clearly like doge a lot personally which is awesome really appreciate you pushing awareness of doge bitcoin and crypto so literally these people they they love you until you say anything negative and then they go unsubscribe flood this is useless now to be fair i'm sure they would say the same thing about him is that he flip-flopped on bitcoin which he did but all i'm saying is like the second you criticize anything with bitcoin they unsubscribe from you no i can't i can't listen dude this is fun unsubscribe follow it's like dude you're cringe weren't you the guy saying big fan hope to get a drink and maybe a clubhouse session one day we'll be so psyched is that you is this you to be clear i don't know whether to be upset that elon musk is like definitely manipulating the market or just be annoyed with these like cringy crypto maximalists i seriously don't know but you would think that maybe like that would be the end of it but of course it's not because peter mccormack then writes this long twitter thread like dear elon musk it's a dear john letter basically to elon musk elon musk ends up replying obnoxious threads like this make me want to go all in on doge this guy isn't interested in crypto he's he's a troll who loves dogecoin but then underneath it chain link god 2.0 basically says like well it's adversarial but this guy's got a point and elon musk says that actually bitcoin is highly centralized with a super majority being owned by a handful of big mining companies a single coal mine in xi jiang flooded almost killing miners and bitcoin hash rate dropped 35 sound decentralized to you now again this isn't that bad of a point but it's like did we not know this a little while ago it feels like we did and all of a sudden he sort of cha making an about-face but i mean look it's my personal opinion that we have billionaires sort of manipulating the market with impunity and the sec doesn't seem to care to do anything about it but at this point the price of bitcoin is tanking even harder like it's like dropping once again because elon musk keeps tweeting about it and so there's this weird thing where like people are like hey let's stop talking about elon musk let's not talk about him he's gonna he's gonna kill us he's gonna kill krypto we've pissed off the the sleeping giant here but then other people decided that he should quote pay for his sins which yeah that that doesn't sound like a cult at all like what are you guys doing man i would almost be on your side to be against this market manipulation but it's like so cringe what you guys do literally look at this sorry but someone had to say it i don't give an f that you're rich and popular i'm not scared of you humanity gains nothing from your ego humanity gains everything from bitcoin i will die oh my gosh you're gonna give your life for bitcoin for internet money i mean look i like bitcoin not gonna die for a dollar you know what i mean i will die by the fire so at this point some sort of like contrarian accounts get involved i like this guy mr whale and he basically says that bitcoiners are gonna slap themselves next quarter when they find out that tesla dumped the rest of their bitcoin holdings with the amount of hate elon musk is getting i wouldn't blame that him where elon musk then decides hm i haven't manipulated the market in like five minutes and goes indeed like this is this is basically saying tesla's sold so of course everybody panics because they think elon musk is abandoning bitcoin elon musk is abandoning bitcoin he's gonna abandon us he's already gonna go all in on doge now bitcoin's done doge the next big thing so bitcoin crashes again and that's basically i think where we've kind of left it is big elon musk has basically ditched bitcoin for doge i kind of think to myself like what's the big deal i mean look if it's a great currency it's gonna get used regardless of whether some billionaire uses it or not it's like some kind of insecurity here if you think that so easily bitcoin's gonna get replaced if you know some big twitter account thinks so and like pushes it i don't know i think you don't believe in your currency enough as like useful you know what i mean and now that's pretty much where we leave it i mean elon musk is sort of passively aggressively like liking and retweeting things like truth let's do this about ditching bitcoin to go for doge or doge is the people's coin i don't know anyone irl with bitcoin but no dozens with doge it's kind of like he's a little upset he's hurt meanwhile the bitcoin maximalists are hurt and they hate elon musk it's sort of this interesting arc where elon sort of become the villain of the crypto community and i just can't help thinking it's the whole thing's absolutely hilarious although is it market manipulation almost definitely i mean the sec just doesn't care like dude when millionaires and billionaires manipulate the market the sec couldn't care less but if you manipulate the market with you know a 10 000 follower twitter account you're gonna you're gonna get slapped immediately that's kind of how it goes kind of pathetic but which cult do you think's gonna win do you think bitcoin satoshi is gonna take down elon musk i never thought it was possible but who knows who knows his egos hurt the bitcoin community's ego's heart let's find out he might single-handedly bring down crypto i mean who knows my portfolio is in the red let's just say that for now anyways thanks for watching i hope that brings you up to date on this ridiculous petty story i mean i know this feels like it's like drama alert like we're keemstar right now you know talk like reporting on this petty drama but at the same time you have to bear in mind that hundreds of billions of dollars are being liquidated right now so it kind of is a gigantic story even though it's so stupid it's just like a bunch of egos and then elon musk being like herder i care about the environment today but not yesterday it's anyway it's ridiculous all right thanks for watching i'll see you guys in the next one
