it's an exciting holiday season for an electronics buyer you got some really interesting new products on the market if you can get your hands on them that is there is the new 5g iphone in three sizes and with the sexy new design apple is really ramping up marketing alongside the telecoms to push the 5g angle and sell a huge amount of these new phones apple has also begun transitioning its max from intel chips to its own apple silicon the first generation m1 chip has impressed reviewers with its performance and battery life the macbook air is apple's most popular mac and they sell millions of units a year and that's one of the macbooks that get the new m1 chip how many units who knows apple's been working hard to hide their unit sales numbers over the years you also have a new generation of gaming consoles the xbox series x and s as well as the playstation 5. the gaming industry has never been hotter what with the global pandemic and all everyone being inside consoles are long-lived hardware items they sell a lot of units over many years the ps4 has sold over 100 million units since its release in 2013 the prior xbox one is estimated to have sold over 40 million since 2013. and then you got the two large overarching trends relating to the 5g transition qualcomm and the light churning out chips for 5g enabled mobile phones and cloud computing with so many people around the world being locked in their homes all these trends will require an immense amount of chips to drive them the chips for the first three products those from apple and the gaming consoles are exclusively made by tsmc being one of the last two fabs using the latest advanced processes tcmc is also a major fab for companies operating in the cloud computing and 5g markets shortages are the usual case with any new product launch there is always more demand at the start than supply but the pandemic has interrupted supply chains everywhere and sent demand levels to unprecedented new heights so it's hard to say whether or not the shortages that we are seeing in the ps5 xbox macbook air are related to tsmc not making of chips or because of some other component that's missing or because demand is simply just that high but what the foundry is making is indeed critical to the final product being ready while waiting for the m1 macbook air to become available in taiwan i began to think about the sheer amount of chips that tsmc needs to make in order to satisfy all of its customers while maintaining market share it has thus led to this video it's less exactly a video essay i would say than a collection of thoughts and ideas around the idea of tsmc making enough chips but first again i want to take the time to talk briefly about a new thing that i'm committing myself to working on i want to direct your attention to the agenometry email newsletter the newsletters will have more information outside what can be found in the video so i'm including a lot more sources including a lot more additional commentary some data maybe some charts and some interesting links that i've seen from time to time so i just want to call out in the newsletter we have an upcoming ipo analysis of a chinese ai company meg v i went through the hong kong prospectus and i really enjoyed it it's coming out i believe in a couple weeks but maybe i'll move it up as i get more content into the site so yeah i hope you find it worth subscribing we'll try to make it worth your while and much thanks i wanted to start things off with the idea of capacity tsmc makes about 12 million 12-inch equivalent wafers a year each wafer depending on various factors can result in tens of thousands of chips dies i suppose but not all of these wafers are made with the most advanced processes almost all of the company's wafers are fabbed in taiwan in facilities in the cities of tainan shinchu and taijong there are two fabs on mainland china shanghai and nanjing and then one up in washington state but those two are not using the latest fabing processes which is now the five and five nanometer process again i do want to interject another reminder the five nanometer name which apple is using right here is an industry-wide marketing label and does not correspond to any actual measurement on the chip die itself the progression so is intended to replicate the expected benefits in terms of performance and power consumption so seven is supposedly better than five five is supposedly better than six but six is better than seven but like i said it doesn't really mean or tie to anything necessarily on the chip itself the die itself tsmc if you notice in its press correspondences and conferences actually calls the process n5 so just a little piece of information there there's another n5 fab being built in arizona but it's rather small and is likely to be for government or location sensitive applications in addition by the time the foundry is ready in two or so years the n5 will no longer be the cutting edge process it will be superseded by the n5 plus and the n3 and maybe even more than that the chips for apple's latest ios devices as well as the m1 macbook that i'm waiting for are made in fab' in tainan fab' is the cutting edge of cutting edge facilities costing an estimated 17 billion dollars tsmc broke ground on fab' in january 2018. initial production run of n5 chips began sometime in q2 2020 but the fab won't hit full volume targets until 2021 when is phase 3 is completed it does not appear that tsmc is going to be building any more n5 facilities on taiwan the arizona facility seems to be what they're focusing on right now and i've heard well not heard you just google it they've recently begun hiring tsmc has a two-year half-step cycle for its flagship processes the first year you're going to end seven and five or n3 process advancement which is a big jump the second year tsmc improves on that and unveils a half step improvement which is essentially a plus process that refines the previous year step so that means an n7p or n5p process tsmc does this to accommodate apple's annual iphone release cycle if you want to learn more you can watch that video so 2020 is for the n5 process 2021 we'll see n5 plus and 2022 the n3 that's just the cutting edge there's also they do improvements on top of the you know trailing edge processes as well but i won't talk about that n5p is not expected to require a new fab so it's still going to come out of the tainan fab' the n3 fab which is also in tainan is scheduled to start coming online two years from now that new fab which i guess is fab 19 i suppose is estimated to cost 19.5 billion dollars in total double of what it cost tsmc to build fab 15 in taitung 10 years earlier cost inflation for semi-conductive processes is very real so since we can't expect more foundries being built in the immediate future i think the key to tsmc getting more chips out to meet customer demand is one hitting phase three on time hopefully they they say they're on track to do that but also by improving the yield rate that means getting the highest possible number of quote unquote good chips per wafer per the documentation that the company's providing n5 is trending in the right direction following his predecessor and seventh path to a 90 plus yield so that's really good news the stakes are high capacity means more than just some consumers not getting their stuff immediately it also means real business nvidia and qualcomm defected from tsmc to its great enemy samsung foundry recently for some of their top new products nvidia's exciting new graphics cards the rtx series 3000s i suppose for example are fapped on samsung's eight nanometer process part of the reason for this has to be price as samsung reportedly offers more favorable terms than tsmc but i also wonder if tsmc's production capacity has something to do with it as well and i think that this is one thing that you know intel still has over amd apple and many other semi companies in the market intel might not have the performance crown anymore but they do still have the capacity intel covers the entire market from top to bottom and has built enough boundaries to meet that supply intel's 2020 chip production numbers are estimated to be over 60 percent higher than tsmc's and twice as much as what amd nvidia and apple are buying combined so it's more of a competitive advantage than you think in my opinion half of the winning the game is just showing up the customers might love your products but they can't get their hands on them it doesn't matter they'll buy something else the sheer size of intel's capacity makes me wonder about the likelihood of the rumors of intel tapping tsmc's five nanometer process the n5 for a future chip intel has been a tsmc customer for a very long time ever since intel bought altera for 16 billion in 2015 but it's never used the foundry for its most advanced cpu products it might need to though for a critical project that industry people are closely watching there's an american government project that intel has been commissioned for the 500 million dollar aurora supercomputer it's due to be delivered in 2021 but as chips named ponte vicio i probably messed that up after a bridge in europe need to be made by intel using its latest seven nanometer process which is roughly equivalent to tsmc's n5 intel 7 nanometer is now delayed it's scheduled to go into high volume by late 2022 so either aurora is delayed for the second time it seems or intel taps tsmc for the early ponte vecchio run the interesting thing is that a lot of the signs seem to be pointing towards it not only the comments made by intel ceo in recent earnings calls but technology architecture-wise too a non-tech recently pointed out in an article that intel's been rolling out these new technologies that allow it to essentially mix and match dies of different process technologies for a final product so theoretically can put together a chip with dies from its own 14 nanometer foundry its 10 nanometer foundry and maybe a die from tsmc's 5 nanometer foundry it gives them more flexibility and further opens the door to third-party dies interesting stuff but it means that tsmc has to provide the capacity for intel and like i just said one of intel's big things is that it can generate enough chips to meet an immense mark in need so i'm just wondering where is that capacity going to come from are they maybe even building towards possibly meeting that you know possible future demand as well as the current demand they're already doing so i guess we can look at the capital expenditure number tsmc is expected to spend some 17 billion dollars in capital expenditures from 2020. it had raised that budget from 16 billion to 17 billion at the q2 2020 earnings call in 2019 the company spent some 15.3 billion dollars the fact that tsmc didn't change that forecast at the q3 2020 earnings call makes me wonder if they either think that they have enough capacity or that they can't get any more of what they want to spend it on tsmc gets supplier hardware from a company in the netherlands asml asml only makes a few of these machines every year does the flat capital expenditure number means that there's no more machines for it to buy maybe but the flat capital expenditure number makes me wonder if the intel customer is actually coming or if it's coming at all in very small numbers tsmc has said that it hopes to maintain 50 percent market share in the founding interest deep going forward this is a hyper competitive market you're competing against samsung as well as the unlimited funds of the chinese government capacity is going to be a critical factor in whether or not tfcc can manage and maintain that fifty percent market share tnc is likely to be able to sell every chip they can make for me i wonder if they're going to be able to make enough all right everyone have a good one take care of yourselves see you later
