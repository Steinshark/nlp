hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be learning how v8 engines work starting off simple and then diving into the details of the 3d printed chevy camaro ls3 v8 engine seen here so starting with the very obvious v8 engines get their name from having a cylinder block in the shape of a v in this case at 90 degrees and from having eight cylinders in this case the numbering starts at the front most piston on the right and then works its way back 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. this engine operates under the same basic principles as any other gasoline four-stroke engine focusing on just a single cylinder first the piston pulls in air and fuel as it moves downward then it compresses that air and fuel as the piston moves upward next a spark plug fires igniting the air fuel mixture and forcing the piston downward and finally the piston pushes out the exhaust gasses on its way back up before the cycle repeats itself now in a v8 engine this cycle is happening in eight different cylinders at different times instead of multiple cylinders firing at the same time you want them to be spread out so that power delivery is smooth for this chevy v8 the firing order is 1, 8, 7, 2, 6, 5, 4, 3 with eight cylinders there is a cylinder firing for every 90 degrees of the crankshaft rotating which means that at any point in time there are two cylinders on the power stroke a four-cylinder engine would only have one cylinder firing at a time meaning the power delivery wouldn't be as smooth so now let's look at the valve train to see how air flows in and out of the engine the intake air comes from the top of the engine and into the sides of the cylinder head the exhaust flows to the sides of the engine exiting the exhaust valves from the cylinder head looking at the cylinder head removed from the engine you can see that there is a single intake valve and a single exhaust valve though it's also common to see engines with two intake valves and two exhaust valves in this case the larger valve is the intake valve and the smaller valve is the exhaust valve the pushrod valvetrain gets its name from the metal push rods which activate the rocker arms which open up the valves the camshaft located in the center of the v of the engine block has lobes on it which pushed the push rods up opening the appropriate valves here you can see a simple demonstration of the push rod being used to open up the intake valve it presses against the rocker arm seen in red forcing the intake valve open the camshaft which operates the valves is geared to the crankshaftm which is what ultimately all the pistons are trying to rotate for every two rotations of the crankshaft the camshaft rotates once if we remove the oil pan from the engine we can see the operation of the crankshaft the crankshaft is the yellow shaft and there are added weights to it for balancing the engine the connecting rods are in brown which connect the crankshaft to the pistons what's cool about v8 engines is that the two pistons across from one another are actually paired to the same crankshaft bearing so moving on to those large yellow counterbalance weights looking at the first pair of cylinders you'll notice that as one piston reaches the very top the counterbalance is directly across from it balancing out the force as it rotates another 90 degrees it now counters the other pistons force rotating another 90 degrees the first piston has reached the bottom and the weights counter that downward force with an upward force and then finally another 90 degrees later the second piston reaches the bottom where its downward force is once again countered with an upward force. this is actually balancing out a rocking moment caused by the pistons movement in full swing though the whole engine may look complicated from a balancing standpoint it actually is extremely smooth running with no first or second order vibrations and only a first-order moment that is countered out through the crankshaft design all of this is to say that the engine runs very smoothly now this particular v8 is what is called a crossplane v8 which means each connection point on the crankshaft is offset 90 degrees meaning the pistons operate in two planes or a cross plane the alternative is a flat plane crank shaft where the pistons are simply offset'0 degrees meaning they all operate in a single or flat plane the advantages of this engine style include its large displacement which often correlates with generating lots of power while in a generally compact and very rigid form they have very little vibration however compared to some engines they have a relatively higher center of gravity and are complex since they require two separate cylinder heads rather than just one like an inline engine generally speaking although they are compact in form they are still quite heavy compared to smaller style engines though of course while producing more power if you found this helpful i have included links to other videos you may enjoy also a huge shout out to erik harrell for lending me the 3d printed v8 engine. i will include links to his work in the video description as always feel free to leave any questions or comments below and thanks for watching.
