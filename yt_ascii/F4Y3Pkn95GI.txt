- this is the beginning
of a $70,000 pizza. in this video, we will be
eating a $70,000 pizza. oh my god. - this is incredible. - [mr. beast] $2,000 steak. - oh my god. this is amazing. - [mr. beast] $5,000 taco. - it tastes like the ocean
is swimming in my mouth. - it does. but first we're gonna start with $1 pizza, and work our way up. this is $1 pizza. (pizza screams) this is a $2 hot dog. this is an $8 burger. it's better than mcdonalds. these are $16 wings. that's it? eh? next is $64 golden wings. here's the golden wings. do you always serve them on with that? can we have it?
- there you go. - here you go chandler.
- thanks. wow.
(he screams) chris is sick, so he's
tuning in on an ipad. - these are our famous
ainsworth 24 carat gold- - i'm sold. now i just
kinda want to eat it. - hey, don't forget me! - you can wait. (wings crunch) (puppy whines) oh my god. - that actually tastes really good. - i hate both of you. - next is $125 milkshake. - been looking forward to this all day. - this is the luxe milkshake. it's tahitian vanilla ice
cream, 23 carat edible gold, donkey caramel sauce, drizzled. that's a little weird if
we all go at the same time. so i'm just gonna... - i'm gonna look at you while i do it. (amorous music) - oh my goodness. that tastes amazing. - yeah, he's dead. - oh my gosh. this is so good. i don't know what to do. it tastes like silk clouds. - that is actually a good... - it tastes like ice cream,
but like 10 times better. - next is a $250 grilled cheese. - it's my favorite food of all time. - i don't even know how
that's possible though, to be that expensive. - oh!
- what? - [chef] here we go. - so this grilled cheese is $250? - yes.
- tell me more - a french pullman loaf of bread, caciocavallo podolico cheese, 23 carat edible gold... - all right, say no more. $250 grilled cheese. dude. it tastes so good. - yo, this is so good. - i know, right? (laughs) i don't even wanna talk,
i just want to eat it. - oh my god. - this is probably pretty good too. - that's for decoration. - wait, david dobrik sent me a text. dude, should we ask him
to join us for the pizza? - yeah. - you guys keep talking... - no stop! - now it's time to blow your socks off. all the food going forward is extra crazy, and super expensive. up next is the golden opulence. - what?
- i don't know. bring it on out. oh, whoa. - we start off with a three scoops of tahitian vanilla ice cream
rolled in 23 carat edible gold, chocolate sauce in there that's made from the rarest
chocolate in the world. - all right. you wanna go first chandler? - of course i do! (chomping sound effect) oh yeah. - hold up, hold up. can we take turns here? thousand dollar sundae. it's great. it's really good. right? honestly, i think i
like the milkshake better. - really? - i think they're both equally as good. (chandler chewing) - hold up. let me see if david dobrik texted us back. let's just call him. so you wanna be here when
we do the $70,000 pizza? - [david on phone] yeah,
when you said that, i thought was a typo. i've heard of a thousand dollar pizza, but 70,000 doesn't make
any sense whatsoever. - yeah. it's not gonna be ready in time. before you leave. - [david on phone] i'm
gonna see if i can come to the steak thing that you guys are just- - okay.
- okay, cool. i'll let you know. - all right. bye. you guys ready for the next place? - nope. - why not? - i don't know, i'm distracted. - we're at the next restaurant, and this time we have chandler here, as you guys know him, never on the video, and also david dobrik.
(children cheering) - i'm david, this is
natalie and this is jason. - so what are we eating this time? - steak. (all laugh) $2,000 to be exact.
(graphic sparkling) - here it is. - oh, wow! i'm so happy it looks like that. i thought it was gonna be like gold, and like unnecessary, but it looks good. - i did too. to be honest, it's a little weird, 'cause i know we're gonna
eat a $70,000 pizza later, so it's kind of hard to get
hyped for a $2,000 steak. - sure.
- you know what i mean? - it's very light, but it's like july 4th. it keeps coming back. it's the finest beef, i
believe, that you'll ever taste. - i bet this will trigger him. do you have any a1 steak sauce? - stop. (all laugh)
- i called it. oh my god!
- whoa. - it's like slicing into a baby. - huh? (mr. beast laughs) - poor choice of words. i'm
just saying it's really soft. - yeah, this is amazing. - yo! i was actually expecting
this to be a little in, but this is really awesome. - oh mr. beast. - oh mr. beast. (all laugh) mr. beast, this is delectable - please, call me jimmy. - it doesn't taste like
steak, you're right, it tastes like something else. would you say it's better
than a filet mignon? - you can't even compare
this to a filet mignon. this tastes like bacon. - we never swear in our videos, so ima let one of you do the honors. (drum roll sound effect) - hey! (all laugh) - too bad it was bleeped. so we all ate the steak and
now we're gonna rate it. what was your rating? - 10 outta 10. - oh, come on.
- you stole my idea. - i would say like a
nine or eight and a half. - she was so scared. - yeah. i'd say i'm nine out of 10. and that's really good. - i didn't get ketchup, so
it's five outta 10 for me. chandler, end us off. - 10 out 10. it was great. - so david has to leave and he won't be able to eat the pizza. so if i send you a slice
of the $70,000 pizza, it'll be about an eight grand slice... - (laughs) $8,000 slice. - in the mail, will you take a bite of it? - yes, i will. genuinely, when you told me
$70,000 pizza, i was like, "oh! i wanna be there so bad". can you send it to me with a guy with a briefcase attached to his hand that the pizza should be in
the briefcase, handcuff to him, - pizza, handcuff, okay what else? - and he should just come
up to my house and open it. - we're at the next place, and david had to go film
stuff, do david things, but it's okay because chris is back. how was the kidney stone? - it hurts when i pee. look at that meat. so what kind of meat is that? - so this heritage pork. so it's a old spot pork
that is from north carolina. - oh, looks like a cinnamon roll. - so much is going on! it's so cool! - [chef] i made a nice sauce
with a 26 year old scotch. - what? that looks so mesmerizing. looks like a swirl that i
could get lost in forever. (mysterious tone) - how is your $3,000 pork? - tastes like four. - 4,000? okay. now it's my turn. - that's a big thick... that's got a lot of fat on it. that's gonna be good. how is it? - it's good, i'm just
not much of a pork guy. - great opinion, thank you.
(chomping sound effect) - so you're not like me. - oh yeah. this is great. - $3,000, what'd you think? - i thought it was really good. it's a little different. - what do you think? - i did enjoy the pork and the ham, but i did not enjoy the, anything else. - i really wasn't a big fan
of it, just to be honest. up next is a $4,000 meal, is it a golden tomahawk? - [chef] no, just a tomahawk. - all right, bring it on over. - not everything you eat has to be gold. - so this is kopi luwak coffee, which is a coffee that has been eaten by, basically a mountain fox
and then has been processed, (record scratch) so that it mellows out the- - tell us what processed means? - it was in the poop? - it means it's gone
through the entire body. - all right, chris, this is a $4,000 meal. - i'm a meat guy, so i'm
gonna start off with the meat. - eat it! - oh. that's good. - is it? okay. - this is old fashioned taste. - this is amazing. - it's the fancy version of
something everybody likes. - we don't want any of
this to go to waste, obviously it's very expensive, so here's the staff of the restaurant, here you go guys. it's all yours.
- enjoy it - also. just so you guys know,
when we filmed this video, we tried to give any extra food to people who helped prepare it or anyone else in the restaurant. we really tried not to
let any food go to waste. all right. we're at the next restaurant. and up next is $5,000 tacos. - i love tacos. - this is not a joke. we're legit paying five grand,
five bands, for some tacos. each of these is about a thousand dollars. what makes them so expensive? - what makes it is the old ingredients. the tuna, the caviar. the shell is made out of squid ink. - squid ink?
- yes. - no way. - is this a jalapeno?
- yeah. - this is a grand. - i've never had caviar before. i'm actually kind of nervous. - i had it yesterday. - how was it? - very salty. - i like salty. - you will like it. - bite into it. bite into it. go for it. you only live once. how is it? - it is pretty good. - all right, i gotta try it. (camera zooms)
- it wasn't that great. - i know. - it is very salty. it tastes like the ocean
is swimming in my mouth. - it does. i feel like the more expensive food gets, the more it just throws
flavor explosions at you. take a real bite. come on. you could pay your rent with this taco. - oh! what is that? - he does not like leaves. - oh! - dude, the ocean's trying
to swim out of his mouth. - i don't eat fish. - i liked that. - so what's next? - [chef] so here we have the short ribs. - this is six grand. - that looks like chocolate cake. - that does look like chocolate cake. - it has a nice, beautiful
glaze in there, the salt. - now, remember, this
is the last thing we eat before the $70,000 golden pizza. - i don't know how i'm gonna handle that. - it's a black wagyu short
ribs, obviously super expensive. so i let it sit here,
marinade for about two days, and then slowly cook for
another eight to 12 hours. - i'm proposing, i just
eat it, and you guys watch. - okay.
- sounds good. - just kidding! give that right
now, put it into my mouth! - oh my god!
- whoa! - that's a butter knife. - here we go. i mean, it's whatever - i've already made up in
my head i don't like it. - it's crazy to me how it tastes like a really fancy version
of things i've tasted before. all right. well... i was full... - i can't believe we
spent six grand on this. so, you know, six grand, five grand. this is with the gratuity baked
in, so they got a good tip. so far up to this point,
the takeaway of this video is that more expensive food
doesn't actually taste better. i'm ready for a $70,000 pizza. so are you. (chris vocalizes)
- transition - i'll be honest. the $3,000 pork, $5,000
tacos and $6,000 short ribs, weren't, you know, as good
as i thought they would be. but up next is the $70,000 golden pizza. this pizza is made by a private chef that normally cooks for billionaires. - i'm not a billionaire. - wow. what is that? - because who else could
afford a $70,000 pizza? - let's go. - this is going to be the
biggest meal of our entire life. - i get it. i could have bought this,
and this, and this, and this, and that, but i didn't, i bought a pizza. now, before we go too far,
i think we should, you know, dress up a little bit. let's let's go change. all right, boys. all glad we got that taken care of. - that's pretty fast. - we want that $70,000 golden pizza. - fantastic. it is ready to go. - really? okay.
- let's do it. - we have an ounce of gold
that's covering the crust. the first sauce we put on top of the pizza is a 10 year old parmesan bechamel. our japanese beef has
been marinated overnight in a $10,000 bottle of grape juice. hudson valley foie gras has
been seared and flambeed with a $6,000 bottle of apple juice. again... i know, right?
(all laugh) - whoa! - but just wait, just wait.
it's not finished yet. we have other things to put on top. we are gonna shave some white truffle we have flown in from italy. - flown in from italy? - [chef] so here is
about $4,000 in truffles we got for the pizza. - wow. - we have beautiful albino caviar. it's almas osetra, this is one of the rarest
caviars in the world. and this is about $16,000 in caviar. - yo, that tin is $16,000. - on the pizza crust, right now, there is an ounce of gold leaf. and we're just gonna throw some more gold leaf flakes on top. - we were like, "we want the most expensive
pizza in the world". like literally guinness
record, most expensive pizza, and you legitimately delivered. - [chef] now we're gonna
finish the top of it with some awesome smoked sea salt. - ooh - this actually looks really good. - here we go guys. (pizza crunch)
- all right, let's do it. - oh man.
- oh boy. - how do you feel cutting this right now? - pretty awesome. i mean when's the last time
you made a $70,000 pizza? - wow. - right chris, you taste
test super pizza first. this slice is $4,400. (tense music builds) - just the cheese is amazing. everything else is even more amazing, but i can't get past the cheese yet. - dude, the crust is golden. - go for it. (upbeat hip hop music)
- oh my god. - this is incredible. - this is really good. no, like straight up, i
really, really like it. (pizza crunches) - oh yeah. that cheese is insane. - i know. i thought it would be gross,
but it's actually really good. - i'm pretty sure my life has peaked. i don't know if there'll
be any other moment better than this. exquisite, marvelous, amazing. - amazing. best pizza i've ever had. - can i just return this half of the pizza and get like 35 grand back? - whoa! come on dude, no. (all laugh) - thank you. oh my gosh. $76,000 for a pizza. - that's two of my cars. - wow. - how did we end up like this? - think it was a really good pizza and a really good experience. - i kinda wanted to do
a little bit of good. 10 grand, where are we donating it? - donate to some food
banks, some food shelters. - we're gonna do a $10,000
donation to a food bank just to not be wasteful. $20,000 donation to food bank. so i think we spent like over a hundred thousand
dollars on food today, and then a $20,000 food bank donation to kind of help make up
for a little bit of that. if you could subscribe, that'd be cool. - yeah. please help. - buy merch. yo, you want me to get this? - you wanna take it? - yeah, i got this. i mean, it's gonna say
declined and i'm gonna sprint, but i got it. this should cover it, right there. - that your driver's license... - oh, well that should get it. - well, hope you and...
