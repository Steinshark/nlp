ladies and gentlemen chess is hard and it's especially hard because it's difficult to learn from your mistakes and how to prevent them in the future and so in this video i'm going to look at three games that my subscriber sent to me around the elo of 800 1200 and 1700 which covers a very very big range and the elo that most of you probably fall into and we are going to take a deep dive in this video about how to actually break your games down how to get tangible actionable advice away from your games and how to utilize them in the future i make a lot of entertaining chess content but this is going to be purely instructional and before we jump into these games i'd like to thank the sponsor of today's video incognate folks it's 2023 the world is more digital than ever before every minute of every day in fact every second of every day millions of website signups and online transactions are happening and at the epicenter of it all is one very important thing your personal data nowadays data breaches are more common than ever before and there are literal data brokers buying and selling people's personal information the smallest inconvenience of this is you getting one of those annoying telemarketing calls but they're potentially much bigger issues like identity theft someone signing up for a credit card in your name but that's where incogni steps in incogni fights on your behalf to scrub your information from the internet in the places that you do not want it and it works in just three simple steps first you sign up for an account on incogny's website then you grant them the right to work on your behalf and lastly you just sit back relax and watch them go to work they will take on data brokers and any website where your personal information might be located personally i hope that governments step in and start fighting for the data of their citizens but until we get to that point incognitive is a fantastic solution and my friends you know how this works click the link in the description if you're interested in incogni and the first hundred of you to use the code gotham will get 60 off your incognito subscription now let's get back to the video so i asked my subscribers to send in rapid games that they played recently that they lost and what we're gonna do is we're gonna look at these games and then we're going to take away three to five bullet point summaries of what happened why we lost whether we played a good opening and mistakes that we can avoid in the future in middle games that's the most important way to get better at chess is to pull away generalities general things that you can fix concrete things you can fix to work on things that you do well things that you do poorly let's jump into game number one between wizard and henry usernames have been redacted because i do not want to expose anybody white plays the move knight c3 black plays e5 already we have something weird and you're going to notice maybe that was a mouse slip like we don't know maybe i don't know if white deliberately tried to play this or what but the way black has played the opening is already much better than the way white has played the opening for a beginner early intermediate player this is excellent stuff that's why black already enjoys an advantage white plays bishop b2 black castles and now like rook b1 is weird i you know but that's you can't control how your opponents play you can only work on yourself white has clearly played in a way that is bad why has white played in a way that is bad white has developed the pieces in a way where the bishop is stuck and this bishop is blocked right the rook hasn't moved yet and right like just a little bit congested here and now instead of playing pawn to d6 and bringing the bishop out black plays d5 so the point is if black has an opportunity to put two pawns in the center they should which is exactly what black is doing right because if pawn takes pawn takes take take take take life is good okay this pressures this and black can always put the rook and move the bishop out and so if you can put two pawns in the center you should do it now of course can black play d6 absolutely but black plays pawn to d5 okay pawn to d5 completely reasonable move so far so good everything going well for black now we have knight f3 black plays d4 natural move advancing forward i don't hate that move could black have you know played here or try to trade the knight for the bishop and damage white's palm structure sure i don't hate this move and actually black immediately gets into trouble excuse me white immediately gets into trouble and black plays b5 so so far all black is doing as a beginner is using two pawns using all four of their pieces and creating threads that are not just simple threats they are actually improving black's position securing more control of the center of the board and position is very reasonable now here white goes for something that just doesn't work okay black attacks the knight right the text tonight white counter-attacks the bishop and this move fails for two separate reasons number one white completely stopped calculating at pawn takes knight pawn takes bishop but that wouldn't be the end of the sequence because after that this would take another piece so it would go take take black just wins two pieces okay sure white has an open file but there's no checkmate the queen cannot teleport okay so that is just a fundamental tactical mistake and the second reason this fails is before you take the knight on c4 you can just take this knight so you get both of white's horses and now you are just winning you are just up a full peace but the point of this video is to show how we lose games right but black is completely winning well black clearly did very well in the first 15 moves of this game now it's about winning right it's about winning this game i don't dislike black snacks move which is knight to b4 attacking the pawn on c2 with a check and i mean what like it's actually kind of difficult to defend if white plays rook c1 you will just take this pawn then you will come back and pressure that again so night before and in the game actually white played a3 and not just played a3 white lost this pawn and then white proceeded to lose this pawn as well which they lost in the very next move so my friends this is going to clearly as you are seeing be a game where we were really confused how black managed to lose this game but this is very important stuff pawn to c6 is a weird move and also black spent 48 seconds on that move that move doesn't make much sense you should obviously be trying to take but if you can't you should try to use one of your pawn to c6 a very odd move but okay now white plays d3 and now black takes now black realizes that's hanging then takes excellent black is up four points of material and the way you would win this is you would either simplify all the pieces down or launch a big attack on the king you can make moves that improve your position that put pressure on your opponent you can utilize this pawn you can just push this pawn as far as possible what you should not do is blunder a knight in one move and that is what happened and that is why we lose games sub 1000 one move mistakes a lot of one move chess a lot of it in fact the follow-up here is even worse than the first mistake because the first mistake black is still winning black is still winning here because black can go here and then infiltrate and it's gonna be very tough for white to protect the whole position it's just not possible not to mention that's mate but black blunders and lets the second mistake kill them and they just play this one mover so a one mover to lose the knight and a one mover very very simple chess just attacking the queen not thinking any deeper now we lose this pawn and now we lose this pawn we just lost the knight and two pawns and we are about to get checkmated how quickly things turn around and there's another reason you're going to see that black ends up losing this game pawn to f6 king h8 and suddenly black makes a comeback black queen takes pawn check look at this what is going on this is insane and now another clutch move by black bishop c3 getting in the way of the bishop very nicely spotted you can't take anything in bishop f6 if rookie 8 is played here bishop f6 is fatal for black so excellent move rook f1 now the pawns start falling and you'll notice here black starts spending 30 seconds of clock time 30 seconds right upon 25 another 20 seconds and then realizing that if they play rook takes they're gonna hang this so here they have to spend another 15 seconds now they're down to 230. the position is very balanced white is a pawn up but black is doing well because this king is so weak and the rooks are congested and this is an outside pass pawn now a lot of shuffling a lot of shuffling a lot of checks rook d8 rook f7 and at this point look at how much time black has left one minute and seven seconds and that's very important because in a perfect world you're just gonna win this pawn it's impossible for white to escort the pawn up because you're just gonna get in against the king for example if white plays rook c2 in this position you can play rook f8 f2 c5 rather f2 and this game will just simply end in a draw because you will take the one now you could take on g3 but then this is still a bit scary but instead of that with a minute on the clock black shuffles black shuffles and removes the queen from the defense of the rook and loses the game so in total in this game black lost eight points of material to one movers black lost the knight on h5 you could also argue black law is this and black law is this so black lost 10 points of material to one move captures 10 points okay why else did black let white back into the game because black needs just a little bit of practice and end game conversion but i think actually what takes priority here is just the one mover the one mover the one mover and all of just three one movers in a row did a good job fighting back and then after that inefficient use of time that's actually time management is a major part of the game 230 versus 552 is just not it i mean you gotta you gotta go i understand losing a game because you're playing too quickly now is the same thing as losing a game because you have no time on the clock at the end and you blunder even here 14 seconds to hang the rook just inefficient time usage as you get better at chess and you're gonna play 30 minute games 60 minute games at local tournaments you have to be able to use your time efficiently because losing a game because if you play a little bit too quickly versus losing a game where you have absolutely no business losing because you just didn't budget enough time is a major major com you know major major component of the game so the real reason black lost this game is time management that's actually like the last mistake that black made is black kangaroo because they did not have enough time to stay calm but they got to this point because of one movers and a sequence of moves that fully allowed the opponent to get back into the game stopping yourself after that first mistake composing yourself and realizing how do i get my most powerful pieces into the game okay how do i get my most powerful attacking pieces that are not playing into the game black did not move these pieces at all look how long it took for black to start moving pieces black was completely busted took black 20 moves to move any of these pieces utilizing those heavy pieces a little bit more now i have another game for you this game otter chaos utter utter chaos we're going up the ladder to 1150 1200 level black plays a kind of a accelerated queen's gambit and gets exactly the kind of position you would want white doing all of this stuff to hang on to the pawn it's it's not recommended to to take c pawns like this because they're very easy they're very easy to win back giving black quick development and in this game white tried to defend this as much as possible but just ran into huge problems later black could have already played knight d4 by the way and this is kind of how you shouldn't understand your your openings bishop e7 is fine but you have to understand you played a gambit you're down a pawn so if you have a move to go into the center of the board target the enemy piece eyes on this eyes on that eyes on you know various for instance knight b3 wins because of this right so i don't mind bishop b7 but you know you got to step on the gas a little bit it doesn't really matter because black just gets a crushing position in 12 moves clearly black has a higher understanding of this opening than their opponent knight takes queen takes and now i wouldn't even prioritize prioritize taking this anymore i would prevent my opponent from castling but i don't mind this at all clearly the opening is a success the bishop goes to a6 laser beaming and now do you trade the queens 1200 says no one of the best moves trading queens here alleviates so much pressure look at the eval back to -1 here it's minus three it's minus three that's how good black's position is because the queen is an attacking piece not trading the queen is very good so far i have no complaints the opening has been great you completely are preventing the opponent from from castling what we should do next is not simplify we're not simplifying that's how you win a winning position when you're out material you're not up material here go forward attack with your rooks attack with your knight blow open the center of the board the king cannot get in contact with his rooks that's really really bad so knight takes e5 is a terrible terrible move because it opens the floodgates to the rook rookie 8 here is automatic automatic move you just now knight d3 i can take take the pin is alive rook takes e4 check the king's gotta move rook d4 boom there's my win queen f3 here is a counter attack but i can play like rookie eight white is just out of sorts white is just playing down a full row knight takes e5 is unclogging the artery of the e-file i mean it's only a benefit to black and you know what else black has here just a fork purely winning the game pure fork it's right there black did everything right pawn to d6 too slow too slow you have multiple options here and you choose to attack the knight with a pawn allowing the knight to get back very very not okay and the next move is even more heartbreaking the night in four seconds no your bishop is the best piece you have you need to play moves here that bother white that don't let white castle you have to ask yourself i'm better but what does white want white would love to castle love literally nothing else free queen shut up white wants to castle why was the castle that's what i want you can't trade your law your your piece there i don't care if it's attacking your queen because what is white's next move it's this now if i'm sitting here thinking okay how do i prevent white from castling here i'm thinking rook a3 i'm still thinking of ways to attack but it's too late by the time you get all of this white's gonna castle and then it doesn't matter that you won the pawn back because white's king is safe and white's rooks are coming and it's game on that is the most important thing here black got a wonderful position but misunderstood the concept of time misunderstood the value of certain individual pieces the relative value of individual pieces at this moment in time pawn to d6 is not it it's not it you've got to activate these pieces just like the last game the person just did not activate their queens or their rooks and then this is this to me is is the big mistake and now this is a gross mishandling of the rook the rook needs to not stare into its own army like this the rook needs to steriff at if it stares at anybody it's esther at the enemy army or like that rook d8 is imprisoning this rook and now this rook can only go there and by the time that rook goes there it's going to be too late and black tries to play d5 but this is hope chest black is just hoping for pawn takes rook d5 which is winning for black that's that's not wrong but if white just goes e5 that's it now white is better we just went from a position where it i mean it was miserable like white was never gonna castle and white opened up the files for your rooks game was over so black failed to capitalize in around a three to four move sequence by incorrectly making an exchange and not utilizing their pieces to the maximum ability just taking a moment and going wait a minute this is massive for me because i'm basically rendering two pieces completely out of commission and by the time we fast forward a couple of moves you've traded your bishop white's king is safe and white is a pawn up why this is purely up a pawn it's a really bad pawn too because it's an outside pass pawn now that's not the end of the game despite all of that and despite you know like f6 like black is just yeah black is in a bad spot here but despite all event black keeps fighting kicks out the night activates their knight light goes here queen f5 it's still a game and ben white blunder's a fork so black is actually winning again black is just winning purely winning why is black winning now we have to adapt to the situation rook is better than a knight and a pass pawn just pass pawn you just play d4 computer is going to show some knight c6 stuff here but d4 d3 and i mean that's it it's a completely winning position you just need to activate these rooks push this far enough and escort the pawns and and trade into an end game this incredible stuff i mean excellently spotted okay d4 rook d4 okay we stopped that pawn now g4 now we slide in a little bit closer to the game is over the game's got to be over the king is safe our pawn is two squares away from queening white is doing everything wrong the king is weak this is weak white plays a6 we play d2 worth square away from quitting the game is absolutely over minus three and up three minutes on the clock g5 you just take it you could just take it if take take they lose the knight there's nothing there you can maybe give a check first if you want instead this queens anyway pawn to g6 is actually a little bit scary but actually queen takes g6 is still winning because you still have a queen you still have a queen so if knight takes you don't do this and lose your queen you give a check and that's it so of course you should minimize your opponent's counter play when you are up this much on the clock you have to minimize the counter play instead of that black blunders checkmate black blunders smothered mate knight takes h6 queen g8 and just unbelievable with a pawn but that doesn't happen instead this and now the queen can block the check and instead of that black goes here and hangs mate in one oh there is a lot more to unpack here okay that there is a lot more to unpack number one why did black lose this game panic black lost this game in the complete opposite way that that the sub lost the game last time black had the three minute time advantage panic that's what this was panic just playing against these 44 seconds a lot of you do that don't play you got four minutes on the clock your ass better not lose this game by checkmate in one discover check block the check all right this happens games like this or what that is why black lost this game one reason and one reason only is because of that now we have to work backwards why else did black lose this game complete disregard for opponents counter play right ponto g6 check protect your king material and king safety always protect your king always look at like the first thing i see here is g6 check so i'm just gonna take because there's no checks in this position i don't care how much time i have i had the one minute i would have still taken that pawn that's number that's number two now number three we start moving backwards that's why black lost the game in this position that's how black law is this game panic because of the time situation didn't respect the counter play on the king how did black lose the advantage earlier everything that i said the opening was spectacular and then here complete and total misunderstanding if you're not gonna trade the queens in this position because you know you're not supposed to trade the queens you should know you never trade the knight for the bishop ever so that queen trade was good that's why you're 11.50 because of you know you didn't trade the queens but this is also why you're 11.50 because of bishop d3 if you don't trade the queens here and you play rookie 8 instead of pawn d6 you'll be 1300 1400 okay that is how we make improvements incorrect moments of peace trade not exactly understanding that the situation the time sensitive situation of the board allowing the opponent to get away while having a totally winning position and not using the pieces to the maximum then fighting back to a winning position and then purely panicking that's why that's why black did not win this game now last game very high level game all right 17'00 this is a king's indian defense black plays some weird opening white gets a monster center black i mean i don't even know what is going on here all right white develops white castles and white plays e5 excellent look at this four pawns knights bishop e5 black is worse much worse take take and now a very major moment in this game we have a big advantage what's next do we keep making improving moves do we develop our queen and our bishop or do we go for an attack yeah me personally i i like what white did i like trying to attack but you do have to think about what does black want and actually black one c5 and 1700s might not know this they have to learn this this is actually the best move here it's one of these really absurd moments in the king's indian where nothing in black's position can move because black played in a very silly way so black would play b6 and in that time you would start an attack because nothing can move by the time black takes this pawn knight f7 bishop c4 and black is completely lost because black is just unable to move any of this but that's channel information okay that's information knight g5 played right away h6 and now white goes back okay i don't like that see these are very subtle things but what did you expect when you played knight g5 you probably expected c5 i don't know e6 was there a reason you went here i don't believe this whole thing of well i wanted the pawn to be weak i don't know if you have the time for that but see it's very subtle because the advantage is still big so c5 in that time in the time that you did this you now gave your opponent second wind so now your opponent has a bunch of central targets to start an attack on a person you want to attack them over here you gotta lock the center d5 but d5 loses a pawn no it doesn't because of the pawn that you just put for my bishop you just did that take take bishop h6 white is still very happy here look at the advantage size 1.4 that's very big queen rook here very nice i don't really like this move all of the advantage is gone why because in the king's indian if the opponent manages to shred open the center you're in trouble you are not going to attack anybody with an open center because black's gonna have immediate counter play so just little fundamental positional understandings now black plays b6 which is an atrocious move now again lock the position sack the pawn to open up the king you gotta go for it again preparatory move queen d2 don't love it don't hate it but now pawn takes d4 and black is developing all of their pieces knight c5 and now black is totally fine black is completely fine they just got out in time and now a big exchange happens white decides to relieve a little bit of the pressure everything gets traded knight takes e4 who is better here and why still white i think i think still white white is better because white has a what's called a queen side majority three pawns versus one which is good in most end games and black a3 is a great move black gets to this position and is just a clean pawn down how does white win this to win an end game like this you need to trade a pair of rooks a trade like this would greatly benefit white the rook would immediately get in and blacks black doesn't have like a second rook so if black plays rook b8 you go b4 blacklist you go c5 queen side majority completely winning but black doesn't want to rook trade i'm glad so now you have to defend yourself against rook b8 is it better to defend your pawn laterally or by standing behind it laterally laterally why because this doesn't defend the pawn at all in fact it just gave a target rook a3 number one and number two you can never do this to a rook ever like and even even better move than that would be rook d1 because after take take and take at least this rook has some target it can go for you understand by putting the rook on d1 you you completely like this is just an end game misunderstanding right that's this is the level that we're at at 1700 move 27 is when we you know you have to understand what you're doing in the end game now i love what white does here i love getting the night in the game and now white is winning why play 19496 hitting the rook the rook has to stay pinning this is what this is winning for white 97. because the rook can't do both 97 if king f7 knight comes back threatens this instead of that white blunders doesn't see knight takes pawn because forgetting about this this is like end game tactics and now i really don't like this move if i asked you right now what is white's biggest asset in this position what is the one thing that white has that black does not you say a knight not really but yes by the way because this is still the best move c pawn the best move for white here is probably c5 because if pawn takes pawn c6 who's stopping the pawn rook b8 c7 rook c8 ba oops you should have you should have given the put the rook in that position right so this whole idea right of just marching the pawn up the board it's there and in the end game you've got to flip a switch it's not just about taking pawns and tactics what is the what is the major asset that i have instead white takes and now here comes the bishop and that bishop is about to cause a whole hell of a lot of problems because after 96 rook a2 knight d4 you blunder a fork rook takes see white thought take take but what white didn't realize is rugby two you have too many things on dark squares for a dark squared bishop to exploit and when it's all said and done you lost the piece bishop takes d4 and good job by white not trading the rooks that would have been just basically like resigning but it doesn't matter excellent conversion by black and that's it game is over so why did white lose this game what happened white misplayed the end game white played pretty well in the end game but in end games you have to play better than five moves seven moves you have to play 15 moves well you have to understand what am i trying to avoid dark squared bishop dark squared problems right that's where all the problems came from and letting the bishop into the game was a big mistake it actually would have even been better maybe to go e6 because you never know it's two squares away from queening f5 of course would still happen but then you would go here and then it's game on this pawn is two squares from queening my friends like that pawn is a major problem black would go king f8 and maybe hang mate in one or maybe black with like bishop f8 which is a huge mistake because the bishop is now very passive so the trade deep into the end game to activate the bishop was a major major mistake and besides that putting the rook a little passively in the end game and besides that it was a good game i mean i had some complaints about the opening but openings are tough understanding when to start an attack and when you know again like a time thing knight g5h6 like this don't waste time you know if anything you could even sacrifice and and calculate whether this works or not like e6 black and defend themselves but this this does look very promising so don't waste time in the opening but you see the difference the difference is that now when the 1700 get into another end game they got to think about where are my past pawns what are the tactics that exist in the position of knights and bishops let me now put my rook passively ever again the 800 has to worry about not losing 10 points of material the 1200 has to worry about converting the right way not trading certain pieces trading certain pieces at certain moments and protecting counter play against their king while also not panicking about the clock so many takeaways literally i think that was like 10 to 12 things that could have been learned in one video and you just do this again and again and again let me know if this was helpful and i'll see you in all future content you know where to find me if you like this if you like my videos check out the courses
