[music] hey what is up guys mkbhd here and welcome to ask mkbhdv30 actually so it's a new month it's july we have justine at the studio welcome hi this is so exciting yeah so i mean we haven't really changed the format at all we asked you guys what you wanted to know on twitter you guys asked a bunch of questions and for both of us this is the best of that yeah there's a lot of questions tyler says i hate school what's a good way to be successful i want to be a software developer okay that's a that took a nice positive swing that's never really a problem you can go online there are tutorials i learned a lot of things that i didn't learn in school on youtube so that's one way of just figuring out if you're good at it or not for sure i feel like you if you want to be something like there's nothing that is stopping you except yourself if you want to be whatever it is you can find anything online which i mean we're talking to people who that's basically all of our lives so i think whatever you want to be you can be it so be a software developer go for it tyler yeah should we answer the question of what are our thoughts on the new refreshed macbooks sure okay basically it's a spec bump plus a slightly new keyboard i don't know if you had any issues with the previous keyboard i didn't i had a very little bit with like the space bar and the tab key but then i would just kind of like and it would just stick towards yeah so it's a minor it's a minor update but that's part of the thing is when people go mobile you don't really see a big difference until you get to the high end which is the maxed out there's now a six core 15 inch macbook pro with up to four terabytes of internal storage 32 gigs of ram it's a beast and the reason people will be going for that one is because they push it to the limit kind of like how they would a desktop but they need to be mobile for sure i mean i edit almost all of my videos on the go like in hotel rooms or wherever i am like you edit on a macbook pro yes yeah that's really hard for me to do really so that well you're editing a little bit higher quality but everything i do add it is at least 4k so it is it's a little bit so you have a struggle you'll probably benefit from the higher end for sure you've upgraded i did okay yes because i have the previous one which was completely maxed out so even then it's like those fans just start running in the middle of the night when i'm exporting videos so i'm excited to do sort of side-by-side comparison i have a question yes do you when you edit with your macbook pro do you are you always plugged in or do you ever edit on battery power i sometimes on planes edit on battery power okay even when i'm on the plane i plug in to edit on on power well if i can plug in i will always but sometimes southwest there's no outlets you just have to edit but editing on a plane is so weird because everybody is watching you it's very weird to yeah i've had editing yourself i was coming back from wwdc and this one guy's like hey i saw you editing some stuff about the apple watch what do you think and it was just showing like some of the screen captures yeah and then i'm starting to have a conversation and it's just it gets weird but it's it's a thing it's a struggle you guys should try it but either way i definitely bought one of the macbooks and i am quite excited about it shouldn't i sheep views on apple products be taken seriously yeah that's actually a good thing because when there's something that i don't like i'm pretty vocal about it when okay when justine has a complaint about an apple product you know it's real yeah because it comes from here and it's probably something that a lot of people who use apple products have experienced so you should take someone who uses apple products opinion about apple products seriously yeah and i mean obviously i'm a huge fan so that i may be a little biased but again if i have an issue then it's an issue here's the thing about bias i've talked about before i have no problem with bias if you calibrate yourself to another person's bias then you can enjoy and learn from all kinds of videos that's a really good point yeah so bias i have it you have it they have it they don't even think they have it sometimes but they do they do telling you you do so yeah not a problem oh here's one i mean people have asked about this i'm sure a lot but what are your thoughts on igtv if you could give your your 30 seconds of thoughts on igtv i actually really enjoy editing vertical video but the problem is i feel like people are just repurposing old content which i was also doing because i already had it i just feel like it's i don't know i don't want to watch long-form vertical content yeah i love stories it's tough for me to find something i've thought about what's the sweet spot for a length of an igtv video i think it's like 90 seconds yeah yeah even longer than a minute because i just feel like i'm like okay cool what's next do you ever turn your camera sideways to shoot in vertical what do you mean so like your iphone obviously turning this vertical but turning like a i refuse okay that's i can't do it i can't go there but what i've been doing is just shooting with a wider angle lens so that there is more field of view so it's not as cropped in if you've ever tried to crop in on a normal video and realize just how tall a 9x16 is it's tough so you got it you got to think about that do you think apple will continue to remain relevant in the smartphone game or will a new or existing company take their market share take their market trip everyone's trying to take apple's market share yeah it'll be a long time before i think these are word relevant it'll be a long time before apple's not relevant yeah they are currently huge it's just it is a completely different thing like there are so many different smartphones that are on android and this is really the only one on ios that's so true everyone i talked about the ecosystem a while back if you ever want to knock apple off its relevance you can't just make a better phone you have to make a better experience and that involves a lot more than just the phone it really is an experience and i mean i'm still a huge homepod fan because obviously i'm i'm the number one apple fan girl so i hate it on it pretty hard what do you like about the homepod though it sounds really good it does it sounds really really good and i have one in well not like every room would have on my office i do have one in my bathroom just why not i want another weather sometimes you know then i have one downstairs and then one like in my living room so it is now that you can actually use all of them that's yeah it sounds great in the stereo did you try the stereo i haven't tried it yet although i do own two they're in different rooms get them together you need to try it because i was actually surprised that i'll give a shot it sounds really good it does sound great and i also have a lot of alexas yeah now you can say there's none in here okay yeah but they might have them true never mind sorry waffles are pancakes oh i bet i've answered this before but i don't want to be inconsistent i think i said waffles however you're feeling today i think i like waffles but i also like pancakes so i don't really like this question moving on are rose gold and gunmetal gray air pods a good idea i mean yeah have you seen yeah yep they're sitting in my doorstep right now really i'm so excited i'll show you the ones i have they're matte red and matte black but that's probably not the best idea for like an airpod you want something that like hides dirt better yeah but they're amazing i would be totally down with new airpod colors i would be too what is it what is the next iphone called i was going to ask you the same thing i have no iphone because there's supposed to be a small iphone 10 i'm just going to call it iphone 10 a small one and then like a bigger iphone 10 and then like an even bigger iphone 10 and then the two bigger ones are oled the smaller one is lcd but the smaller one with lcd has different colors than the big ones that are oled this is even overwhelming for me don't even know where you begin to name these things i don't know i mean would it be but iphone 11 would be weird because they skipped nine which still i'm a little sassy about and then they picked a roman numeral for one and a number for the other and i still want to call it x and i try really i still everyone's going to call it xy so what do you this is a this is one of the biggest mysteries in tech today what is the next iphone gonna be called who's better at fortnite do you play i mean yeah then you're better than me okay all right yay did you get the four terabyte yeah yeah i did people were it's the most expensive option it's 3 000 i that's an entirely new computer it's a lot more than most people pay for a computer by itself but here's the thing about having all that much storage i know it's it's way overpriced but cloud storage is great but like when you work with big files you just need a big drive that's true someone said did you perfectly make this an open for a surprise tweet because it shows up like that in the timeline and then you open it and mac appears that's so good didn't do that on purpose did not do it on purpose i mean yeah totally did that on purpose gotcha of course i'd be curious for your answer this what is your favorite smartphone to date favorite smartphone is it automatically the iphone 10. because it's the latest and greatest or was there like a nostalgic like 5s or like se i mean i probably maybe a red one even just the first iphone i feel like that was such a revolutionary time i think for all of us and for me personally because i didn't know what i was gonna do for the rest of my life i was confused everything so it's like when i got that phone it just felt like i was now connected to everything and then it just sort of became like my storytelling device it's like a milestone type of device yeah that's fair i think my first phone ever would be one of my favorites it wasn't the best phone i ever owned but it was the motorola droid it had those droid does commercials there's just the whole whole culture around it that was really exciting for me at that time so i'll put that high on my list what was your first iphone wow i think 5s 5s was the first iphone i ever owned and actually the first time i ever held a first gen iphone was yours yeah so i had never been close to that that was the that was the i think that was that the iphone 10 yeah oh my goodness it is crazy just to hold it now because it is it's it's like it is a nice size though so it's a nice little brick phone yeah yeah have you done that have you had to sleep outside i've never camped really i've never done it you should do it just for fun the closest i ever came was an android phone actually really believe it or not in hoboken there's a verizon store and when i was a freshman in college i woke up early and got in line for the verizon samsung galaxy nexus and how long did you have to wait and i was like 10th or 11th in line and waited for half an hour that's it yeah i mean because they just got people in and out people were just buying the phone it wasn't a whole thing nobody had cameras but that was the only phone i've ever physically waited in line for have you waited in line for anything else i don't think so really i mean other than like a roller coaster that's probably never to never to buy anything i don't think i waited it was over 24 hours for the first playstation 2. that was i was in college i think then and then worth it well i didn't have a job i was in college and then some woman offered us 2 500 for it and i was like oh okay here we go this is this is the rest of the year i'm set nice and then 16 hours for the first dunk of donuts in los angeles and then 55 hours for the iphone 6. all right so that's where i'm gonna end this q a thank you for for asking your questions and if you want to see a video that was shot on justine's channel i'll put
