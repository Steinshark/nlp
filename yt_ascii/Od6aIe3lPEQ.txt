let's make an astronaut in this video i'm going to go over how i made the astronaut for the last video and then do a little bit of texturing and animation as well if you'd really like an astronaut for your videos but you're not quite good enough at blender or you haven't got the time you can go on my patreon and get all of the blender files from these videos for a dollar a month pretty good deal and you'll be supporting the channel so it'd be greatly appreciated but that's enough self-promotion let's get on with the video so firstly you want to start off with some sort of basic mesh of a person you could just make it from scratch but i just downloaded one from the internet this particular one is just from free3d.com i'll leave a link to it in the description once it was imported into the project i went into edit mode and deselected the hands and feet i had separate objects for the gloves and shoes so for this part i just wanted to have the suit isolated on its own just a quick disclaimer here i didn't make the shoes that are a part of this model originally i did try and make them but i've never really modeled shoes before and everyone will know that your first attempt at modeling something is never as good as you want it to be so instead i did what i do best which is copy somebody else's work once the hands and feet were deselected i pressed control i which inverts the selection and then i deleted the vertices then i jumped into sculpt mode to actually start making the shape of the suit i turned on dynamic topology and then turned off symmetry and then i started using the inflate brush to fatten the suit up a little bit it's a good idea to change the detailing to constant detail and use a number of about 10 and then press the button that's called detail flood fill detail flood fill is kind of like a subdivision surface modifier it just adds the universal amount of geometry over the whole mesh which makes it better for sculpting details next up i started using the cloth brush this is my first time using the cloth brush and blender and i didn't watch any tutorials before doing this i just got stuck in basically from what i've worked out you just click somewhere and drag your mouse around and it starts creating creases i couldn't really work out if there was a technique to get specific look increases so i just kind of did something in one spot and if i didn't like it i would control z and redo it until it looked kind of cool so it's a bit of trial and error just getting it to look how you like i guess there's no real right or wrong way to do this anyway i just tried to get some cool looking creases over the whole mesh essentially the cloth brush does tend to make the mesh collapse on itself a bit in some places so i used the inflate brush again to expand those parts of the mesh where it had gone a bit mental the next step is kind of optional but probably recommended if you're going to be using this for animation like i did as you'll probably know sculpting in blender absolutely ruins the topology of a mesh so i exported an obj and then used instant mesh if you haven't used instant mesh before it's an open source free piece of software that's really good highly recommend it you basically bring in a mesh tell it how many faces you want it to have and then it does some clever ai stuff and works out the topology flow for you so if you want to do this here's a rapid fire instant meshes tutorial open your obj and then set the target vertex count to how many vertices you want the mesh to have hit solve and it will kind of work out the topology flow this is an indication of how you want it to look and if there's some areas where it's not really working or it looks a bit weird you can use the comb brush and kind of guide where the topology is supposed to go once that's done hit the second solve button and then press export mesh and then hit the extract mesh button and then just save it wherever you want it to go make sure you put obj on the end otherwise it gives you a weird error so then what you can do is jump back into blender hide the high resolution sculpt that you did and then import the obj of the remesh that you've just done from instant meshes and you'll have a lovely red apologized mesh for some reason instant mess chucks it out absolutely full of sharps so go into edit mode select everything press ctrl e and then just do clear sharp which will get rid of all those blue lines the rest of the model is really simple so i'm not going to talk about how to model that particularly especially because i cheated and stole some boots from online the hands are from the same model of the human base mesh and i just use the inflate brush on them to make them a bit fatter again and the helmet is basically just a sphere that i cut the sides off and then duplicated the front to make the visor the harness and straps are really simple as well i just added a plane and then added a mirror modifier to it so it would be the same on the other side of the body and then i just extruded one of the edges and kind of made it follow around the body so it looked like a strap and you can turn on clipping and make them meet in the middle so they join up in places i did that really roughly and then just added a subdivision surface modifier to make it a bit smoother and then i also added a solidify modifier to make the straps have a bit of thickness and the last detail is these couple of vent pipes or whatever they are on the front of the suit the model of this suit is called a nasa asus suit i believe and i basically just went on google images and looked at some reference photos and then kind of matched what i saw on that and modeled something that looked similar so now the suit is all modelled and sculpted we have to make a shader to make it look nice and real it's quite a big shader it's certainly the biggest one i've ever made but i just kept adding little details to it and it just kept getting better and better and i got a bit carried away but it looks really cool so it starts off with a really simple principle shader setup i went on textures.com and found i think it was like a sac texture or something i have a albedo texture which is like the diffuse color there's a roughness map a normal map and then a displacement map as well so i did a bit of color correction to make it orange because originally it was green and then i made it look a bit dirty by doing a technique that's called dirty vertex colors basically if you go into vertex paint mode and just search for dirty vertex colors it's kind of like an ambient occlusion effect where it will look at the crevices of a mesh and make them darker and the kind of flatter bits will be white essentially if you change the highlight angle to 90 degrees that's the one that i found worked best for this and you can see on the side here it creates a new vertex colour group and you can access that with an attribute node in the shader and type in whatever the name of it is and then you can use that to basically mix into the colors of the suit so i multiplied it over the kind of diffuse color which made all the crevices of the suit look a bit dirty then on top of that i made the suit look even more roughed up with a noise texture at the moment the vertex colors thing is only really affecting the creases of the mesh and i wanted to have the whole suit look a bit more uneven so i multiplied another noise texture on top which added some darker patches to the suit overall made it look a bit more random then i added a few logos as well to add a bit of detail a really easy way to do this is you can create a new uv map just for the logos and then basically unwrap those faces and just apply that texture so this is the uvs just for the nasa logo and you can see the rest of the suit is just tiny in the corner and then those faces on top of the logo are taking up the whole of the texture space and then you can bring in the logo and just position it by moving the uvs around you have to tell the image texture which uv map you want it to use especially in this situation because i'm using multiple in the same shader so add a uv map node select the right map and then plug it into the image texture i used pretty much the same technique to add some stitches onto the shoes as well on the seams so what you can do is select a face and then hold ctrl go further up the mesh and click again and it will connect those faces in a line and then you can create a new uv map and unwrap just a section for the stitches and then use that uv map to apply the stitches just on those faces this is what the stitch texture looks like literally something i made in photoshop just by drawing a dashed line with a brush this is the stitches on their own just a black and white map and then i can use that to plug that into several things just to add some more detail i did exactly the same thing for the nasa logo just to add an american flag onto one of the sleeves as well and then all of those things combined together go into the base color of the principal shader and then as well as the base color you also have the normal roughness and displacement textures that get combined together in the principal shader and make a really nice looking suit and especially if you use something like an hdri it really makes it ping and you can see all the different fibers of the suit have a little bit of different roughness and look really realistic that's the modeling and texturing done so now all you have to do is animate it to do some cool stuff so this is the rig that i built it looks a little bit complicated but that's only because i've made some custom shapes for all of the bones it's pretty much just the default basic human mesh that comes with blender the only thing i really added was making the hand and feet ik bone so that when i moved them it would move the legs and arms at the same time it just makes it a little bit easier for the animation especially doing things like jumping so to finish it off i'm going to really quickly animate a zero gravity jump like in the original video the first thing i do when i'm animating is go to keying and change active keying set to location and rotation so whenever i press i adds a keyframe i'll set up my first pose and then hit i with everything selected which adds a keyframe for the first frame then i jump ahead about 10 frames and set the next pose which is going to be a crouching position the beauty of using an ik system here is i can just grab the hands and the waist and drag them down and the knees will bend automatically for me and the feet will stay where they're supposed to be then i select everything again add another keyframe then jump forward another 10 frames or so and then create a pose just before the astronaut's feet have left the floor so this is like the last stage of the jump before actually taking off select everything again add another keyframe and then create a pose in midair where he's completely left the floor and then just for fun i made a pose where his legs are tucked into his chest a bit and he starts to do a backflip and voila so hopefully without going into mind-numbing detail that has explained how to model texture and animate an astronaut for you if you guys have enjoyed this video consider subscribing and remember if you can't be bothered to do all of that work you can just get my blender files for a dollar on patreon in the description i also have a discord channel for vfx if you guys are interested there's about 30 members in there at the moment and people kind of go in and share their work it's really fun leave your comments down below for what vfx you'd like to see in the next video and i'll see you guys next time
