okay have you seen this yet check this out this 
is one of the most in-demand frameworks to learn   if you are a developer solutions architect or you 
just want to ensure your team is using the best   cloud technology but first what exactly is the aws 
well architected framework it consists of six key   pillars one being security reliability performance 
efficiency cost optimization sustainability and   operational excellence the aws well architected 
framework is a way to provide consistent approach   for our customers and partners to both evaluate 
architectures and also implement scalable designs   this is something that is super in demand from 
both an employer looking to see if someone that   they are hiring has these skill sets and this 
knowledge about this framework and then also   too when you are on a team if you are looking for 
a promotion upskill or continue to build out your   team this framework is essential to stand out i'm 
going to really dive into operational excellence   and also to reliability but before we do that that 
let's look at each individual pillar to give you a   really big sense of what exactly this framework is 
about let's start with security which essentially   is the ability to protect data systems and assets 
so it of course includes confidentiality integrity   and availability then we have performance 
efficiency which is the ability to use   computing resources efficiently this could include 
things such as selecting the right resource type   and sizes reviewing to continually optimize and 
also to monitoring performance next up is cost   optimization pillar which essentially focuses 
on avoiding unnecessary costs key topics from   spending over time controlling fund allocation 
and selecting resources of the right type and   quantity then we have sustainability which is 
all about minimizing the environmental impacts of   running cloud workloads key topics such as shared 
responsibility for sustainability understanding   the impact that these technologies and what we 
are working with has with sustainability and also   to maximizing utilization to minimize required 
resources and reduce downstream impacts and then   we have the two that we're really going to dive 
into which is the operational excellence pillar   and the reliability pillar and here's why these 
two are so important now for me one of the best   ways to really understand something is through 
a real world example so let's use this example   of acme core acme corp runs a mission critical 
e-commerce application on aws and sees significant   spikes in traffic during the holiday season and of 
course in order to maintain high reliability and   uptime during these peak periods it's up to acme's 
devops team to employ several techniques the first   being operational excellence detailed cloud watch 
dashboards and alarms are configured to monitor   key application metrics due to latency error rates 
and traffic this gives real time visibility into   issues all system components are fully documented 
and operational rem books are defined for rapid   incident response now let's go go to reliability 
the application is deployed across say multiple   zones using auto scaling groups and elastic load 
balancers regular load tests are conducted using   a tool like say testable to validate the capacity 
limits also too when it comes to resilience both   the ops excellence and also to the reliability 
pillars really help achieve that common goal   resilience is essentially the ability for a system 
to recover from a failure induced by load attacks   and failures and with the aws well architected 
framework it will essentially help cloud   architects build the most secure high-performing 
and resilient infrastructures that are possible   for applications it really provides a consistent 
approach for everyone to evaluate architectures   and have this guidance almost to implement 
designs that can scale with your application   anyways that's like a lot of technical jargon 
in there but the point being is they are under   a lot of pressure it's holiday season and they 
have a ton of traffic coming to their website so   during this holiday peak the ops team is on high 
alert and of course monitoring different metrics   now once the holiday season has come to an end the 
team is able to review the operational data that   they have gathered throughout this really high 
stressful time to identify potential improvements   for next year's peak to understand what they could 
do better for the future additional dashboards can   be created and the runbooks updated to incorporate 
these learnings so essentially by leveraging   something like aws services and well-architected 
best practices acme is able to really optimize   reliability and operational excellence tying 
it all back together again this is a real   world example that i really like i need a visual 
storytelling aspect when i'm learning something   new and when i was going through each pillar in 
this framework this really helped me understand it   by thinking how would a real company utilize this 
framework how would they implement these different   pillars and that really brought it all together 
with for me if you will okay but here's another   example of both reliability and operational 
excellence this really helped me as well when   you think reliability your architecture should 
be like a rubber band it should be flexible but   also able to bounce back from getting stretched 
then when you think operational excellence your   operations should run like say a swiss watch 
finely tuned with all parts working together   so what exactly can someone expect to make in 
salary or compensation when it comes to having   these skills and having this knowledge for the 
aws well architected framework is it something   that you should put on your resume that you can 
share with your employer well i kind of alluded   to that earlier that yes this is very important 
and it will help you stand out cloud is continuing   to rise at such rapid numbers for being in demand 
for such large companies that really any skills   revolving around cloud is such a way to stand 
out now i went to levels fyi which as many of   you know is one of my favorite websites when it 
comes to salaries and total comp mainly because   it's accurate it is literally through connecting 
with employees them sharing data they have to   back up that data those numbers and let's go 
into a level of fyi right now let's click on   devops because devops is something that would 
utilize this framework quite a bit now as you   can see here under devops the total median comp 
is 145 000 us so we can go here and see view jobs   and i mean a lot are significantly higher 
than that and one of the things with levels   fyi i really like too is that they do it based on 
location based on company but overall it's it's   a good salary i gotta say devops is where it's 
at and this is a great way with this framework   to really help you stand out because it is a 
very competitive industry now let's talk about   promotions doing something like this gaining this 
knowledge around this framework is a great way   to not only put on your resume when you are job 
hunting but also to to help you with a promotion   i know a lot of you are really big on getting 
certificates or continuing to learn and upskill   as we continue to see how quickly tech is moving 
and transforming we need to stay on top of it and   this is one of the most in demand frameworks to 
have an understanding of to really have a deep   sense of not only from a hiring standpoint as 
i mentioned but also to being able to work on a   team and utilize these skills and this knowledge 
all right i hope you enjoyed going through this   video with me sharing more about the aws well 
architected framework it's one of those things   that for me anyways if it wasn't for some of my 
friends working at aws and really being immersed   in tech on a day-to-day basis i wouldn't even 
potentially know about this framework or that   i can take this online by the way it's it's 90 
minutes in length it's really not that much of   a commitment in time i wanted to share it with 
you because i know so many of you are really   focused on leveling up upskilling and many of you 
are interested in areas of tech that are growing   rapidly one of them being cloud and this goes hand 
in hand with that whether you are interested in   cloud or maybe interested in software development 
devops however you are growing your career as we   know having continuing to level up it's never a 
bad thing and i thought this was a really fun way   to go through a specific course a specific program 
let me know if you enjoyed it any questions you   have oh yes and of course i link down below 
the aws well architected page so make sure to   go check it out and learn more about how it can 
help you in your career journey also to leave in   the comments if you have taken this before your 
thoughts on it and if it helped you level up in   your career in your skill set all of the above 
all right i'll see you all soon thanks everyone [music]
