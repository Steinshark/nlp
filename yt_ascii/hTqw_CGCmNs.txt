in this building right now we have some of the rarest most valuable phones in existence but not just that some of these are my personal dream phones ones that i've spent years in the background just inching closer and closer to getting like yes the actual pokemon phone so let's go from pretty rare to very rare to so rare you can't even get one first up being the galaxy z flip 5 retro i love this whole past meets future concept oh wow so three boxes on the inside fun fact this one here has samsung's very first logo on it with the word sam sung very literally meaning three stars and inside is stickers that cover their entire history followed by what they call the flip suitc case and then on this box this is the samsung sgh e700 from 20 years ago the phone that this entire limited edition is paying a marge to one of the original flip phones that also by the way happens to have a dual display like its modern counterparts and inside it is a metal collector card with what i assume is a unique id number so i get that on the face of it this sgh e700 it feels like a pretty random thing to make a limited edition based on but this phone special to samsung it was released in 2003 a time where nokia and motorola basically owned the phone markets and everyone else was small price so samsung poured everything they had into this flip phone with features like an internalized antenna an ultra compact design even with that and incredibly for 2003 a camera capable of taking 5 shots per second or leading this phone to be the first ever samsung to hit 10 million sales breaking that glass ceiling for the first time and actually bringing samsung into the picture so considering how much people talk about the idea of the flip phone being back now actually bringing it back in the form of a recreation of this is a pretty smooth move it's got the same silver and blue color scheme as the old samsung i feel like these colors just embody that entire era of phones ooh this is cool it's got the old phone that slowly turns on and then like a custom 16bit wallpaper in the screen of it ah and that becomes your full cover screen when you fold it up and these are flip suit cases they're actually pretty cool so they're half external customization but thanks to an nfc chip inside of them when you place them onto your phone it also instantly applies matching internal customization and these are good quality proper animated wallpapers too this is a wicked product for proper samsung fans but i can't give it any more than a 6 out of 10 just because of what we've got coming like this next one which is definitely one tier above in rarity still not super rare but you basically have to import it from china i'm talking about the mickey m phone yes disney made a phone and this right here that's an official holographic disney sticker as a seal of authenticity so this company takes their collabs very seriously right so first thing is an insert wow this already has a lot of stuff inside so there's the sim ejector toour delightful certificate of ownership nikki sticker page and then a case oh boy this is one of the most premium thoughtful cases i've ever seen included with a phone i love the fact that this bottom section has multiple layers to create that complex light reflection the charger and the cable are standard but then we have the [music] phone so pretty incredibly i'm holding right now the first time ever that disney has collaborated on the design of a phone what prompted them to do that well disney's been around for a 100 years now from snow white and the seven dwarves their very first movie back when they look like this to now when they look like this what i'm more curious about though is how well did disney pull it off okay this this is up there i'll say that there's a custom mickey ui skin with their own charging animation their own lock screen clocks unique wallpapers and they feel right you know very often with these brand collabs they can come across as a bit cheap on the software end this is quite the opposite i always appreciate when designers go to the effort of making every icon look consistent and not just the few that sit on your main homepage and then even the back of the phone every single section has its own individual texture which makes it feel a whole lot more interesting to look at as opposed to a flat google image jpeg just slapped on the back like mickey's buttons for example the way they reflect light differently to his clothing actually makes them feel like buttons a shame there's not enough room on the back panel to add two little mickey ears from the camera but i haven't even shown you the best bit okay so we open up the camera we go to portrait mode try taking a photo of me like this oh the camera sounds delightful look at that mickey mouse boker it turns all those little soft blurred lights in the background into mickey's it is quite a large phone though i'm slightly upset they didn't make a mini version takes the mickey oh you're taking the mickey and now just before we start getting to the eye wateringly expensive let's go for the shockingly cheap with the mr doodle phone who mr doodle aka sam coxks is a british artist who specializes in stay with me here doodles ever since he was a child he's had the habit of doodling everywhere on all sorts of things like less paper more tables and chairs and even walls so it's pretty cool that that has now become his entire career with him blowing up online in 2022 through the doodle house this highly creative and no doubt painstakingly time-consuming stop motion video where he covers his entire house in graffiti spaghetti as he calls it and some of his works now are selling for over $1 million w what a way to start so that's the phone based on the techno camon 20 and below that transparent stickers to make your own doodles i guess it comes with a transparent case which is fair you want to be able to see this design a normal power brick cable and sim tool and this is the [music] phone and on first glance it might look like i've just unboxed the wrong thing that's actually what i thought it nearly returned it like it doesn't really look sketchy enough which in itself is a bit sketchy but you actually just have to look closer uv torch me check this out it's the back of this phone that has what technic calls moonphase color changing technology or in other words phosphors that glow in the dark after being energized with light which means that while all you can see during the day is the normal design of the base phone turn some lights off and it becomes clear that mr doodle was there all along feels pretty groovy to me but now it's time to start cranking the rarity upper notch so i was in japan recently and out there the one piece anime is absolutely enormous it's a manga and show about this young boy with a dream to become the best pirate in the world and find this treasure called the one piece we went to one piece shops one piece restaurants we went to a one piece themed gym and so it's hardly surprising that yes there is also a smartphone and only 50,000 were ever made okay this presentation is already amazing a treasure chest is such a clear win for a pirate themed phone oh and you open the lock to get inside 200 iq wo there is a mountain of booty in here the phone's on top there's some sort of dock an actually custom themed charging cable this is like the entire cast of characters and this is luffy the main guy oh wait it gets better i've just realized each one of these is a dust plug to cover your 3.5 mm headphone jack which also means you get a 3.5 mm headphone jack right there is one massive thing inside of here and it's an entire construction project man they've really thought about the construction of this one you know these characters the 3.5 mm jack doesn't just mean you can plug them into your phone you can also plug them into your ship and then the best bit this dock it actually connects to the ship and you use it to charge your phone oh and obviously every single character has its own individual plastic wrapping that is japanese tech through and through now as for the phone itself this is an old phone it's from 2012 which makes it i mean basically a fossil by smartphone standards but look at it so much love has g gone into the theming here like everything from custom bootup animations to a custom animated wallpaper which makes it look like you're on the ship with these guys even custom widgets like the music player wait even the apps themselves are custom you can literally see the theming carry through to everything as for a rating i mean it's obviously dated and some of the design choices i would say are not for me but at the same time i have never seen a limited edition of anything in my life that has this amount of sheer effort poured into every corner we've got to give it a night okay now that that ship is sailed i do want to clarify something that while i do love pretty much all collector's edition phones if i had to level one criticism it would be that well of course they're really cool at the moment where you first unbox them they can often over time start feeling a bit tacky after a while of being your daily driver and that's a sentiment that it feels like the oneplus marel odyssey edition is designed to counter i mean just from the outer box it already feels less shouty and more subdued than most and if we unwrap it there's an in a box which says as unique as you which is actually what i think is so interesting about this particular limited edition every single phone is completely one of a kind so on top we have an insert with some manuals a clear case nothing really special going on with it maybe the biggest sim ejector tool i've ever seen nice though and then on the bottom is a pretty standard oneplus charger and oneplus red cable now the phone which i am curious [music] about okay uh it's nice it's pretty and also ultra comfy thanks to it being rounded from every possible angle and even slightly cold to the touch then the construction of this phone in general is just quite sophisticated it's not actually marble because that would make it unusably dense but instead the designers at oneplus worked for over a year using rare micr crystalline rock material that resembles marvel to make this which is why every single one is slightly different and this is not an easy material to work with like apparently the creation process of just this back plate involves nine complex steps including chemical treatments that are like first in industry plus because it is a new material they've said that finished articles were individually examined by hand and any ones with imperfections were discarded i'd say it definitely accomplishes what oneplus was intending a limited edition that's just trying to give you that feeling of owning something special like you can get access to exclusive oneplus marble themed wallpapers but i don't think it's quite for me i mean the wallpaper just looks like a recolored version of the bass phone's wallpaper but more importantly if your key selling point is that your design is one of a kind i think that loses quite a lot of its appeal given that you have to squint to actually see that design it's too subtle 5 out of 10 next up transformers and we've actually seen quite a lot of transformers phones over the years they must be very willing to hand out those licensing rights but i don't think any of them have looked as good as this one right here so it opens very swanky i might add with a metal pin of optimus prime then you got a cooler this is super well themed and can apparently take the temperature of the phone down by up to 26degrees c everything here is custom that's what we like to see even this case that's proper metal which i suppose does also sadly mean no wireless charging at the bottom then we've got a transformers power brick and not one but two different charging cables depending on how you're feeling on the day i guess and the [music] handset okay this back design this is what i would call prime like it's actually thoughtfully themed after a transformer instead of just being a quick image of one and this metallic band in the middle it's not just that you can see it you can feel it yeah boy but with past transformers phones the software has tended to be what's ruined it so let's see oh cool so every time you unlock the thing it cycles between a bunch of wallpapers that suit the theme of the phone i'd definitely prefer something subtler like this as opposed to to oh you wanted transformers right well here's one hello there oh unfortunate timing well you know what this is actually way way better than past ones see the thing that this setup has that many limited editions don't is that it actually feels intentional like the focus of the wallpaper optimus prime's hedge it's not being overlapped by icons or widgets and it doesn't look like an oversharpened mess so you get the feeling that care has been put into it there's actually a whole load of custom wallpapers here you got shadow flow and ai painting and meta universe and even animated ones like armored battleship i like this menu the icons too they completely match with the wallpapers and the theming is sick red and blue accents echoing optimus prime's colors oh yeah the clock icon actually tells you the real time even the folders look like some sort of machine futuristic drop pod the theming doesn't go much deeper than just the home screen but these guys have really turned this around worthy i'm going to say 9 and you know in a similar vein we've seen limited edition genin impact phones before too you know that really popular phone game that everyone uses as the benchmark showoff graphics yeah that one but i have never seen one like this look at this packaging apparently inspired by the ancient chinese stacking lunchbox there's a really good reason for that see this isn't just a generic limited edition for genshin as a game but more a very specific limited edition centered around the character shang ling she's a pyro or fire based character who's fittingly the head chef hence the lunch boox all right so in the first compartment i want to say a pen nope it's a scroll every time i see scrolls i just think of the dragon warrior scroll in kung fu panda except this one isn't empty it's very authentic feeling i mean it's even got that traditional scroll grain i'm impressed one plus and then on the front of this book is guar who in the game is god of the stove and like shang ling's partnering crime that's insane it actually changes expressions as you move all right so on the inside you've got 3d poppet art you got a pack of collectible cards what looks like a set of stickers and a really weighty guoba sim ejector tool maybe the first time that sentence has ever been said and then the bottom compartment is where we find the phone let's take a look at [music] it and we've seen maybe more limited editions than anyone else on the planet well that's a crazy form but i've got to say oneplus really took the brief seriously is the phone as impressive as the rest of it well it's got a leather-like finish which is again super high effort since the phone that it's based on has a glass finish and then of course shang ling also gets her own custom fire theme and this is how i think it should be done a loud flashy animated lock screen wallpaper which then transitions to a much subtler home screen wallpaper your home screen's going to be busy anyways so a busy wallpaper on top of that that can just become clutter and this is subtle but nice a warm orangey color theme that's running throughout the entire ui of the phone it's got a brand new charging anim and these just keep getting better and better you can see the fire starting as you plug in and then slowly fizzling out as you unplug the icons are all themed to but the theme basically just turns them into octagons which is not aesthetic they've also added a custom keyboard and it creates a chili pepper every single time you tap a key just when i thought they'd figured out subtlety you got to commend the effort though they could have just left it but they thought no chili peppers so this feels like a 92 right so that phone was nearly $11,000 this next one 3155 very rare yes so rare in fact that the website is actually gone but very affordable if you can find one and when you look at what it's actually got going for it that price feels amusing so this is a collaboration between bmw and the phone company infinix we got an intro card on top and wao this box is an absolute party so there's a wireless charger in here which can deliver 15 ws of power that's pretty good there's a set of wireless earphones you can kind of tell this is on the more affordable end by the way some of the packaging feels but at the same time i'm getting far too much for the price to be complaining oh and also just realized there's another tray below everything else which has a bmw tag for your keys and also a vip card with perks like prioritized repair services i don't know why they still print these out we need virtual ones for our virtual wallets i guess it just makes you feel cool so this is already a very impressive package for its price with the phone's back embossed with tiny little triangles to resemble the grip of a steering wheel a custom android theme harmonized with bmw colors and a feature they're calling magic ring which is basically apple's dynamic eyelid it is useful to be fair for some really subtle notifications but it's got one more trick see back here you'd think oh well that's just leather right and yes but it's actually translucent thermoplastic polyurethane leather which allows it to do this and to do lighting properly like this while having a completely seamless leather likee back it requires quite a few things to happen like for example a light guide film at the bottom to make sure the lighting doesn't spill and a middle layer of transparent fiberglass for rigidity and this is not just lighting for the sake of lighting these leds will indicate to you the phone status when you've got it face down like a simpler version of the nothing phone's glyph interface but it is something that i do more and more now when i go out with people so i appreciate it enough to give this limited edition an eight and from the same infinix company now we've got a collab with tesla no not that tesla this is with the tesla sign center in new york at the site of nica tesla's former laboratory when was the last time you saw a museum phone although we do actually have one coming up that is such an artifact it probably belongs in a museum so on the back side of the cover it talks about infinex deepening their exploration in the field of electricity we got a 15w wireless charger again and then let's start with the left box i really love this physics classroom kind of texture that everything seems to have applied to it feel smarter just unboxing the thing oh so these are all postcards that's the first and then then we have a case with more equations takes a certain kind of person to want this and it's not not me on the other side then is our phone box which has the phone on top sim ejector tool and manuals below that you got another case a glass screen protector as well as the already applied protector that's nice of them a 68 w charger one short of the big one a usbc cable and a pair of wired earphones in a long time since we've seen that come with a phone what is this how did it come about well nicola tesla was basically the founding father of modern day electricity and the application of that electricity is still what makes every current piece of technology possible so you know we have that to thank him for and that's what the tesla science center does it honors mr tesla by both showing all the awesome things that have become possible because of him and also encouraging the next generation to make the next set of breakthroughs so i guess the link to infinix is well nicola tesla was really good at electricity so our phones but it is actually kind of endearing in nicola's life he dreamed of the idea of being able to wirelessly transmit power like he actually filed a patent in would you believe it 1907 for an apparatus for transmitting electrical energy and modern day phones are real life products with his vision baked into them it' be kind of poetic if you could see it the fruits of his labor maybe hide the wi earphones though the packaging was awesome but the actual theming of the phone itself is way less custom here so i'll give it a six my fingers are tingling we're moving now onto what i would say is my favorite smartphone of all time but the official 24 karat gold edition this is the hgc 1 m8 and yeah you can get third party goldplated phones but this is the ultra rare made by htc themselves variant got a super siiz black htc cloth which is also microfiber so you can use it to keep the phone clean or you know your house if anyone knows whose signature that is then let me know a certificate of authenticity the the accessories are just standard htc accessories so let's have a look at this [music] device oh man in some ways this is very beautiful in that like a lot of the time when you see gold phones they're like this thick and they're obviously encrusted with lots of things this is just the actual design of the phone but gold i wouldn't say it's a ical finish like i'm starting to understand why they gave us such a big cloth but it is really cool to see a phone that i loved so much being given this royal treatment now you might be thinking why why do i care about this phone and well for starters generally at the time this came out in 2014 htc was just making great phones they had this all metal construction they had beats audio stereo sound at a time where that wasn't the standard and i so remember just loading up seasons and seasons of big bang theory on this and just relishing in that media experience watching them bing plus the cameras this was one of the first ever phones to have a proper dual camera setup and it's not a good camera by today standards it's literally 4 megapixels but it was my first ever glimpse at the possibilities of portrait mode and it made me feel like a real pro car it on that is a harsh vibration motor wow this really does take me back back when phones were small enough that you could literally just have the power button on top back when cameras had like two modes and that was it back in the day where companies used to bake in a slideshow of photos to show off how good the screens were as for this particular model this is extremely rare from what i can see compared to the 50,000 one piece phones that were made for this 200 were made and you couldn't buy them this model was only made available to giveaway winners making it effectively priceless at this point now coming from that to this the nokia xr21 you're probably thinking what's so special about that after disney and bmw and 24 karat gold i mean this just looks very normal ah but see this on the back 32 out of 50 yeah this limited edition that i'm holding in my hands right now is literally one of 50 and actually only 30 of those 50 were made available no one sent it to us we didn't use a third party seller i actually sat there like the uber nerd that i am waiting on the product page for it to become available just so i could buy it and be the first one to show it to you now why on earth did i do that well nokia as you might know is a finished company and they've for a long time now been making i would say very consumer centric decisions making all their phones affordable giving people lots of updates one year of screen replacements for free really large batteries and tough construction but for the last 5 to 10 years that hasn't really been what sells phones it's really been the chinese companies those who don't necessarily focus on the nice to have little things but can just make better spec phones for even less money that's what the market has asked for and that's what's caused the extremely rapid growth of companies like xiaomi and realy but now only just starting very recently it is starting to feel like the tide is turning i guess with the current political climate there's a growing market of people who are starting to have doubts about what's happening with their data when they buy a cheap chinese phone and they're increasingly looking for something locally made which plays very well into nokia's positioning of we might not be the cheapest or the best spec for the money but you can trust us and to really steer into it while nokia phones have historically been designed in finland but assembled places like china where it's cheaper they're now starting to be assembled in europe too with this limited edition being the first phone to actually come off those european production lines there's nothing particularly extravagant or mind-blowing about using it i mean considering the normal version of this phone is like $500 it's very clearly not trying to spec for speec match what the market is doing apart from the durability the thing's got rubberized ultra grip edges which also creates a bit of a lip to protect the screen and the back is like ribbed plastic which while not fancy is far less brittle than glass kind of seems like nokia's just accepted the memes at this point with this limited edition having both military standard 810h and ip69k certifications meaning that you should be able to both drop it without a case and also spray it with some very high pressure water just in case that's on your to-do list but it gets better because yes this right here is a pokedex oh and my entire childhood i can't believe i'm actually holding the pokemon phone right now okay so it starts with a bunch of custom accessories a pikachu tail for your keys a pok ball stand want to say and then stickers so that's bulbasaur charmander squirtle pikachu snorlax it's pretty clear that this is being targeted to adults who grew up with pokemon as opposed to new younger fans which makes sense given that pocket money is not going to buy this we got the case which is all pikachu with two different design options depending on what you're feeling another pokedex which in this case is your carrying pouch i will say the print quality is super high and it feels that really nice leather-like material with felt inside and then the phone which once inside the pok ball packaging looks to be fairly [music] normal so just to try and clarify how hard this phone is to get if you haven't had a taste of how rabid the pokemon fan base is pretty much any venture they take on it turns to well gold in the sense that many many people want that thing you go to a pokemon center store cues at all times you want some of the original pokemon cards well you might have to pay very literally millions you want a seat at the pokemon cafe you have to wake up at 5:00 a.m. months before open up their site on as many devices as possible and pray to archus that you should be so lucky that's from personal experience by the way and so when this company decides that they're making a phone exclusive to south korea it's of course going to have hundreds of thousands of people waiting at their computers ready to buy the entire stock in minutes poor me here in the uk is not going to be one of the lucky few so i i resorted to other means i basically spent the last 2 years just in the background of other videos probing asking people online if they've heard anything about it setting ebay alerts putting in bids on stockx just in case anyone lists it until one day when someone very special who works with samsung sent us that fiful message that they secured one now all of that said holding it in my hands right now i have mixed opinions like i loved the unboxing experience but the phone itself they could have done so much more with this i mean what about making like the bottom of the phone white and the top red like a poke ball that you can very literally open and shut or even just a custom wallpaper that shows like the inside of a pokeball as if you're opening one when you open the phone it just feels like too good of an opportunity to literally just ship the base vanilla phone with and while this pokeddex packaging is undeniably top tier the actual stuff that you're getting with it none of it feels particularly special or unique from just going to your local video game store and buying a mug or a wallet with just your favorite pokemon's face on it so i like it i obviously like it but i don't love it 6 out of 10 okay it is caviar time yeah i know there's always some sort of phone from them in these videos but two things are different this time one that this isn't even the rarest phone in this video and two that this particular phone is pretty special for me oh these are tiny what do i meant to do with that anyways inside of this box right here is the megalodon phone yeah the shark for those of you who don't know megalodon is like a prehistoric ancestor of the great white shark literally three times bigger than the biggest shark today or in other words far more shark than you'd ever want to be in the water with but at the same time this creature has fascinated me ever since i was like this tall i even did a full class presentation all about it once including how the largest megalodon tooth that's ever been found is 6.9 in nice or like this big i actually don't know what's in this gold box so it's a key and it's a coin okay how's a qr code on the back i pray to god that it doesn't take me just to the caviar website it's like you just sunk half your life savings on a phone here's a link to buy the next one alala keep this safe just in case i ever need quick access i'm 99% sure this key neither locks or unlocks the case which seems a little fishy let's go face to [music] face this is absolutely terrifying got reams of paper in here international certificate of ownership and then you got another plug to go buy more caviar stuff got a warranty certificate of authenticity ah okay i actually want to show you this now this phone there were only ever 12 of this phone made which is extremely limited and to top the whole thing off you see this little brown bit right here can you guess what that is it's a fragment of a real megalodon tooth now i'm not someone who us usually cares for fancy jewelry or the grade of diamond that a phone has encrusted in it but that to feel like i'm touching a physical part of this prehistoric sea monster that is wild and it's what this certificate of authenticity is supposedly verifying it says tooth discovered in georgia usa geor and the thing that's particularly cool about it is that sharks ar likee dinosaurs where if you get lucky you'll find a massive preserved skeleton the vast vast majority of the body of sharks is cartilage which does not preserve leaving the teeth as basically the only memory that we have of them aside from that this is basically a samsung galaxy zold 5 but with a back plate made of impact resistant titanium with laser blackening which is what allows it to be so pitch black and then i can only assume this guos pattern is meant to resemble ocean waves i have to say the web page for these products is pretty weird so it's aimed at business sharks and it's constantly talking about how sharks are such good predators and then how that equates to to dominating the boardroom i just find the image of a grown adult buying a shark phone to show their dominance very amusing and if you're enjoying this video then a sub to the channel would be awesome so how on earth do you get rarer than that well ask google this is the google pixel fold hip hop 50 edition 400 were made in total which might sound like a lot compared to the 12 caviar phones but here's what takes it to the next level you couldn't buy them no one could buy them these were given solely to some of the biggest nam celebrities in the world for their contributions to hip-hop so it's a really rare insight into a true celebrity experience i like how google's managed to get their logo into this geometric design in a way that doesn't feel garish so what does it say if you need support setting up your device please reach out to our vip concierge at oh maybe i shouldn't show that email address so this is all in celebration of hip hop's 50th anniversary oh and there's another vip cach that's pretty interesting there's a separate email address for vip customer service and that's with a vinyl record and then these two cards tell you instructions and then about simone smith wife of a famous rapper who made the jewelry cuz yes this is only the third time i've ever seen a phone come with jewelry and it feels like a lot of thoughts gone into it it's all g which i can only assume means it's all good or it's all google there's a set of pixel buds pro these look like standard buds not customized the pixel fold with this special commemorative engraving on the camera module and that's not even been really the star of the show it's this an actual vinyl player how awesome is that so this idea of a genre of music being founded is it's a weird thing to think about but it looks like what google is referring to is in 1973 when dj co herk used two record players playing at the same time to basically isolate and loop the percussion breaks of songs switching between playing from both of these two record players to give more time to a song's most dancable moments the actual phone is very close to the original stock version and if you ever decide that you're not happy with the way your phone looks then rhino shield can fix that they're sponsoring this video so i can show you their whole design your own case feature for which first of all rhino shield offers an advanced printing process that results in a finish that won't fade or even scratch and then to design your own you just have to hop onto their website and use their interface which is really intuitive you have endless room for creativity when using it like you can upload your own photos you can combine with their stickers you can choose your texture and then the style of case you want to be designing it is immensely customizable you can even pick from 16 camera ring colors and 27 button colors i've loaded up the old mozart see how it sounds hey not bad at all and what a vibe this is like the perfect setting to have this music playing besides because rhino shield cases are entirely made from a single material they're incredibly easy to recycle without any additional sorting sanges and because it's christmas they've got us a code mr boss 15 which gives does 15% off everything on their site so go check it out after this video oh and also that's a cassette player 1,643 videos on this channel and you've never seen a phone comp like that
