real talk i thought samsung was joking when they said they wanted to sponsor an unboxing and demo of the odyssey arc did anyone actually expect them to make this thing after they showed it off to say yes i assumed that it was just some kind of you know concept display you know to pull in the crowd you know i was wrong very very wrong 100 pounds of gaming extravagance wrong this is it the heaviest the most curved the most immersive gaming monitor ever created and while i don't know if i need an aggressively curved 55-inch monitor i sure want to experience it let's roll that intro [music] whether you wanted it or not samsung has done it they've brought us the world's first holy crap 55 inch curved with a capital c 1 000r radius gaming display it uses their quantum matrix tech with a mini led full array local living backlight it's got hdr 10 plus dolby atmos and a speaker setup that they and i cannot wait to experience this apparently call the sound dome okay well don't go away how am i going to set this up on my own samsung demands that's just the stand this is just one part of the stand there's a whole second are you freaking kidding me samsung demands that you have a friend to help you set up the odyssey arc and for good reason oh my gosh so it goes in i think it goes the other way yeah yeah no problem just put this together using my trusty ltt store.com screwdriver sign up for an in-stock notification lttstore.com wow i feel like i could almost support myself on this spring lift mechanism take that apple sup mac nerds that's a nice monitor stand you've got there this is my cloud strife edition monitor's 10. boy the buster stand there we go hey we heard the click hey and then there's two screws yeah i'll get them so but to get it yeah oh that's it guys that's it that's what i'm talking about that's why this thing needs the most mondo stand in the world so you can watch youtube shorts you guys have seen me one hand lift 65 inch tvs even and like mount them onto the wall i've done it on this channel there is no way that i'm lifting this from here to there that is not happening by yourself unless i have a helper yeah you're supposed to so they're like the direction this is how you're supposed to do it yeah so we get a hand under the stand oh yeah tilt it under the scale back and then we hold it and then we use our legs and not our back yep crap it's heavy okay david's like coming over here like i can do it i have crts don't don't knock it over anything but just hold on hold on please don't help him okay from the ground though no no no no no no no no you're good you're good let's put it down you're going to challenge me if you don't want me to fall obviously 95 of the time you're gonna have it like this and the whole thing with its four speakers and two integrated subwoofers comes together to make a personal gaming theater that is samsung's words not mine personal gaming theater and it's like a fun mirror oh my god i'm wide putin it recommends 80 cm oh distance 80 centimeters yeah so i gotta be the back here apparently huh turn it vertical for alex oh my god yeah here you go alex ready this is an officially supported mode ah that's so cool can we get three of them what are we gonna do with three of them what would you do with one of them you might as well get three everything about it is perfectly normal monitor except that it's as tall as i am we've seen this before but it's cool enough that it's worth another mention this is called samsung one connect and basically it's a single cable you can see the tv end is marked tv right here that goes into the back of your personal gaming theater cable manages through this boy and carries all the power and all the signal data that our display is going to need that means that any of your devices plug into this b a m f er the one connect box you've got your oh is there no displayport no so it's a tv then it's all hdmi 2.1 oh all four of them are hdmi 2.1 yeah one with the arc wow i'm not even gonna miss the display port then it's 4k whoa shut up yeah sorry i'm gonna let you finish but i've read it off there yeah it's 4k 165 hertz it has a usb b uplink two usb a ports though they are usb2 so you're not going to use them for anything other than maybe your keyboard or mouse something along those lines it's got optical it has a network port so presumably it uses samsung's tizen os for smart tv functionality and a total of as we mentioned before four hdmi 2.1 ports now we are going to need a tape measure i want to sit in the optimal position in my personal gaming theater and i think the reflection was because there's a peel on it oh yeah that's way less reflective naturally we've gone with an rtx 30 90 for our test bench because let's face it if you can afford a personal gaming theater like this one it's only the finest for you when it comes to gpus and i think other than that we're ready to fire it up aren't we it uses the same remote as samsung's tvs that's interesting you can really tell that the sound is optimized for a near field listening experience really yeah or maybe part of it is just that you're sitting in this reflective sound dome that's what they call it right sound dome it's got four speakers one in each corner and two subs in the center does it come pre-loaded with all this stuff yeah okay you got your geforce now got your xbox app yeah those are all part of the samsung gaming hub so you could stream games if you wanted to no downloads and no storage limits yeah i forgot samsung has that partnership with microsoft so you can just like play xbox games on it okay pretty cool i mean we're pc around here so we're gonna go ahead and switch over to our pc input let's go through and fine-tune our settings yeah faster is almost always the right one standard is probably fine screen ratio yeah we're not going to change that unless of course we wanted to have you know the ultra wide experience get some black bars more cinematic gaming going on here yeah there it goes okay and i don't see any weird scaling issues so if if that's what you want then you can do that personally i think i would probably just make use of the entire canvas in front of me oh this is not a good place for this why not because oh if you want to rotate yeah when it's time oh it clears it push it back a little yeah it's great okay never mind it works oh my gosh hold on no it'll auto it'll no no no no no no we'll get to that later lighting definitely gonna need some lighting oh may increase power consumption yeah i think that's the least of my concerns when i've got a 55 inch 2000 nit peak brightness mini led backlit gaming monitor on my desk let's see what other modes we've got we've got some different colors got some oh oh are we going full unicorn vomit yes hdr10 gaming basic game hdr this actually makes a ton of sense because they're probably just leaning on all the excellent work their tv folks have done and putting it in a monitor weird the setup is actually that simple i didn't even manage to get the arc dial out of the box and it is already paired so that's neat with the arc dial you can quickly access any settings that you would want to as well as quickly change the aspect ratio or the screen size so if you wanted to emulate a different screen size then let's figure out what button hey there we go multi-view flex move screen you want flex mode yeah let's do i'm gonna flex i'm gonna flex on the haters what you don't even have an arc dial hey what are you doing man it's got buttons yeah yeah i see them i see them i see it so i'm gonna put my i'm gonna put my screen over here what you get what your your monitor doesn't do this that's okay if you don't have this at the very least you can get a subscription over on floatplane.com where we have great behind the scenes like oh we had a ton of fun at the backpack launch pop-up shop you guys can check that out okay so i think yeah i'm done with that for now this can sit here man was the last time you saw this many peripherals for a monitor you got the one connect box you got the arc dial you got the remote okay i get to game on it now yeah sure i thought we'd do vertical stuff first but it's already we're gonna do vertical later okay you wanna do landscape first i wanna play a game i don't know if it's finished installing but i put arc on the test bench because that'd be fun if you played oh dog i heard you like arc yeah i wanted to get an arc gpu as well so that we could play our arc on an arc using an arc yeah yeah but they're not really out yet and i mean i don't know if it'll run 4k so uniformity was an immediate concern for me brandon you're gonna have to get a little bit closer to have the same experience that i'm having but i do not actually see any kind of dirty screen effect oh oh and i might not even be in the optimal spot adcm 80 cm 80 centimeters okay let's see who was right because i don't remember what i said actually but okay this is the optimal eyehole distance from the screen thank you i will not move my feet put a marker down hold on is this an hdr game because this is really freaking bright no it's probably not it's old and stuff i just i saw this thing is just really bright this is literally entirely for the memes now one of the challenges with mini led backlighting is that depending on how many zones you have you can get significant halos when you've got bright objects on a dark background but that problem is exacerbated by extreme viewing angles so it seems to me that samsung's odyssey arc team sought to get around this at least in part by applying such an aggressive curve to the screen because when i am standing in this optimal position here i am actually looking straight at the screen no matter what part of it my eyes are tracking toward samsung's name for this anti-glare anti-reflection film is apparently sagar film and it's not segar the horrible it's sega pretty good that's an old reference isn't nick's supposed to be at work what's he doing playing cookie clicker this is the danger of adding your boss on steam it's an idle game minus this it's just idle right now these are really deep blacks it's got 1056 dimming zones it has 1056 dimming zones like it's pretty good well that explains it because i was like i'm looking at this going where is it that's really black how much is this thing 3 500 3500 okay i mean they did put all the cookies and cream in it yeah the stand is enough to you know kill a man assuming you can wield it check the display make sure the display's got hdr on too use the dial what are you doing oh yeah what am i doing the remote is for cave what am i some kind of idiot oh you got it yeah no no i'm just i'm looking i'm looking oh it's almost definitely hdr that's so bright totally probably but it's gotta be i'm having too much fun with this it's dumb it's extravagant as all hell but like it's it's pretty fun it's pretty cool so when you're full screen okay you get variable refresh rate with amd freesync premium pro with support up to at least 120 hertz low frame rate compensation low latency and sdr and hdr and full support for hdr color and luminance certification this looks freaking amazing zero tearing or stutter hyper responsive bright hdr we have not tested samsung's 2000 nit claims but frankly speaking at this distance it's bright enough like that does matter and the wild part is that samsung is normally the king of you know blown out vibrant best buy effect colors but it's vibrant but it's not like that at all like look at these greens they're not overdone friendly reminder no matter how good your gaming display is it will not make you a pro gamer okay quick play here we go boys i'm the one person playing halo infinite right now this is gonna be your new office monitor ah 55 inches is really big i know i my desk isn't deep enough at work you don't think so no i don't think so what about at home ah it's tempting at home i just got a super deep desk at home it's deeper than this one hey all right i mean there you go hey oh you didn't get him how did i not get that i don't know i thought for sure he was i am terrible you guys swapped to the pistol yeah nice i don't have to do nothing i don't have to do what you say all right i'm never gonna call you dad all right there's quad object tracking sound and dolby atmos dolby atmos you say obviously it doesn't have the same bass as a subwoofer that's the size of the tv or anything like that but it's not bad clarity is good and i guess there's something to be said for having speakers that are just physically far far separated from each other right when you're sitting right close to it like this full credit the sound stage is really wide like the directionality is outstanding when there's a frog like over here it sounds like it's coming from over there enough of the can confirm it's a top of the line gaming monitor let's have a look at the gimmick cockpit mode oh yeah and you say it's supposed to oh it does too yeah it did automatically moved to portrait mode wow i mean that is something i feel like i'm in the front row you know what i'm saying videos okay let's find some shorts whoa wow it's right there it's big hey look it's linus actual size on your tv okay i had to try it i had to try it come on oh geez oh my goodness this is wow this is a little disorientating it barely fits on screen oh my goodness oh my goodness this is you're actually fighting like life-sized demons okay they're life-sized now it's time for perhaps an actual practical application to this let's try multi-view press the button below to add a view let's add a view oh oh sick okay so you could have like okay app or source ah man we don't have a ton of sources here no so you're able to mirror stuff through like miracast or whatever yeah and you can have the apps but my one big issue is that you can't do two hdmis really you can't you can't do picture-in-picture yeah it was a very i'm i was like ecstatic about this thing until i found that out we even tried i grabbed the xbox and i tried to throw the xbox and the pc on it doesn't want to do it as soon as you select one hdmi input it grays out the rest when you go to the second view the way i was doing this was create like a custom multi-view but you've got three can you do tizen apps or anything like that like if you had a plex app or something like that could you just have like a movie chill in there yeah and then so like it's it's fine it's just kind of disappointing hdmi inputs would be better i'd love to see them address that in a firmware update or something like that because as it is this could actually make sense yeah i just have like some app with like i don't like my stocks or something whatever it is that i want peripherally available to me and then i've got you know maybe a movie that's you know playing while i'm you know working on a project down here on my bottom monitor yeah that's great that's wild man and then and then if it's horizontal you can do four 27 inch screens roughly four 27 inch screens yeah so you can do the same thing but quad that's pretty cool i do wish that you could have two hdmi sources that would improve it a lot or four because there's four hdmi 2.1 ports on the connect box that would be amazing samsung if you're listening that's an improvement that we would like to see it really does have a like a concept product vibe to it that wow factor but then they actually did it the mad lads actually shipped it thanks samsung for sponsoring this video thank you for sending over the odyssey arc the most unbelievable monitor that i think i have ever seen if you enjoyed this video i don't even know what to send you to i don't know there was that there was that curved laptop we checked out that one time go watch that that's pretty wild too
