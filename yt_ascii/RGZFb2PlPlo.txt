guys the whole point of this video is to undo the catastrophe of the car radiator video this is a heater core and this is what i was supposed to have that time around you can see we've designed a shroud for it that'll allow you to use a regular pc cooling fan even though this was originally designed for a car these were mostly popular in the early 2000s when custom-made pc water cooling radiators weren't really a thing yet what does this have to do with any of what i just said and what does it have to do with this message from our sponsor motiongray their sit to stand desks and ergo chairs provide maximum comfort at an affordable price crunch your numbers not your back by checking them out at the link down below and use code linus to save 10 on your purchase it's this thing new from a 69 camaro why would it be new i don't know maybe there's a for enthusia just restoration parts brand new or something look the point is this aio water cooler with a triple 120 millimeter radiator costs a whopping'0 dollars which got us thinking given that you can go to a junkyard and pick up a heater core that's got to have at least that kind of cooling capacity for like 40 bucks could we scrape together everything else we need and build a competitive water cooling system i mean we all know about the problems with aios weak pumps skinny tubing and want to upgrade them forget about it this might not be pretty but if we choose the right case we might be able to install it in such a way that you would never know that it's inside the question is just how much did the rest of this stuff cost us in total everything including the heater core was a hundred and eleven dollars really so we beat this by 70 bucks yep all we need to know now is how much work are we going to be putting into installing it and what's the performance going to be like to be clear this isn't a given and one of our obstacles is right in the name it's a heater core it's not for cooling it actually takes cold air coming into the front of your vehicle sometimes at a significant velocity takes hot water from your engine heats that air and then blows it into your face on a cold winter's day which means that even though it would typically have a fan as an assist heater cores are thick with dense thin arrangements because they need a lot of static pressure to get through them static pressure that a typical pc fan is not really designed to provide although then again if those can't do it maybe these can and if these can't well this definitely can definitely not in the budget but i think this would probably fit yeah that one that one plus it a bit while alex gets the fans mounted i want to talk about yet another obstacle you know how i just said you'd expect to have way more airflow in a car well you'd also expect to have way more water flow from the pump you would find in a car and while we did find an affordable aquarium pump that claims to do 1 400 liters per hour the issue with aquarium pumps is they're typically designed to maximize flow rate even if it comes at the cost of head pressure so as soon as we start to try to pump that water through a restrictive cpu block or a big fat heater core we could see those flow rates plummet also that's the least of our concerns at the moment because like does this even hold water what's yeah what's inside of it solder oh that's green okay that's not supposed to go down the sink okay tasty that seems fairly minimal please don't attack our office greenpeace it warmed up when i cleaned it out with the hot water now it just smells gross that's been in my office the whole week so i know how you feel put your face right in it i don't mind it that's all that but metal smell one of the big challenges with two thousands era water cooling was finding a a heater core that would fit in a case and b a case that would fit a heater core because you got to remember back then most of our cases had a ton of drive bays especially the large premium ones that might have enough space so what folks often ended up doing is dremeling out or otherwise removing large amounts of the front of the internals and in some cases even the front of the case in order to get enough airflow through these hogs thankfully we shouldn't have to deal with any of that because our handy dandy engineer kyle made us a shroud which is going to serve two purposes one it's going to create a gap between the spinning blades of our fan and the heater core itself you can see it's about a centimeter right now that's going to help us make more effective use of the fins that otherwise would be under the hub or under the corners or way over there where our fan can't reach them the second purpose is it's going to make it compatible with our case because we can mount the fan here and then we can mount our two fans into the front of the case this is exactly how smoothly that car radiator shoot was supposed to go if only we had gotten a heater core that time like i asked what we have done literally nothing so far linus we've done something can you say this is going smoothly we haven't even jb welded our fittings into it yet oh wait no we could just stretch tubing over that that's three quarters of an inch i could stretch half inch tubing over it seems like a tight fit you know what oh where's that heat gun oh if it fits you know you're gonna sit what what graphics card is that in there don't worry about it okay bye-bye 4090 no he's actually doing better than i thought he would i think my first rodeo okay back of my day i used to do a 3 8 inch thick wall tubing over half inch fittings to make sure they would never leak so one thing i've realized that's going to be a problem that we could probably solve right now is that my aliexpress water block i'm listening it's not am5 compatible because i just forgot that i have am5 here it's dangerous don't worry about it oh that's that's fine you're actually a lot further than i thought you'd be at this point in the video you're probably wondering why we're even bothering to show you this it doesn't seem like the sort of thing that you should do at home but that's not actually the case i mean we are intentionally using the wrong size tubing here because we would have to go all the way over to the other building to get thicker tubing so it's not the kind of thing that you would have to deal with and as long as our performance is okay there's no denying the difference in cost so as long as you can find a good deal on a heater core i don't see any reason why you couldn't replicate this at home however it's gotten a little bit more difficult finding copper based heater cores these days since a lot of the modern ones are aluminum and those of you who are experiencing water cooling will know that if you run an aluminum component and a copper component together in the same loop even with an anti-corrosion additive you are asking for a bad time and since aluminum water cooling components are few and far between you will need to find a copper heater core motorcycle radiators are another option if you can find one with dimensions that'll fit in your case ultimately you just do what a lot of people used to and you don't bother putting it in your case just run some tubes out the back and go whole room water cooling oh no i was just trying to think you might need to do even more stretching now that i look at the fittings that we have for this aquarium pump that's the only one you have to go into the other side well i have this one oh ye of little faith success sure if that doesn't look like performance to you i don't know what would guys what did you think to maybe offset this so that it fits in the case i thought that we can just take that part out yeah or dremel ah oh yeah [applause] ltc screwdriver for the win yes hey this is a pretty big moment of truth oh no oh you've kinked it bro don't kink shame also i have a plan he was supposed to cut the tubes shorter that's a way worse plan hold on okay hey so now when it leaks it's right on the power supply yeah oh geez you're spilling water in the case too where were you planning to put the reservoir and pump well my thought was we would cut these tubes short which i forgot to mention and then we would put the radiator up top with the pump down below i see i really have to remove my tube no you just cut the copper pipe off the tube's still attached rest in peace stretched tube hey guys cavalry's here what's up colin oh this is perfect we got some nice thick boys yeah sure just just right here is good yeah just depth literally anyway thank you no thanks excellent you contributed to that that was not all of us i got some tech tips here for you kyle that looks pretty good alex made the executive decision to not try to install our cheap aliexpress block because it's not am5 compatible and we're just going to use what an ek block alpha cool actually yeah we're still well under budget like 50 60 bucks under what we would have paid for an aio yeah and we're using a premium block from a very reputable water cooling company oh that sounds so good it's pretty it's a bad color i'm trying to sell this screwdriver you the best way to do this would have been to braise fittings onto the copper pipes however the good thing about the way we're doing it is we're showing you guys a lot of the different options you can also just stretch a tube over and you can also epoxy a fitting onto the bare copper pipe just bear in mind that brazing would be the most reliable it's bigger freaking a that's what you said all right but do you have a fitting for this for the other side no wait we're good we go from the radiator to that side of the pump oh yeah as long as that is an appropriate loop order then we're good to go okay alex is here with the big tube okay i think we're just gonna put big tubing over jb weld i also know how we can adapt between the two oh no i approve i approve perfect i approve no no no no no no no no no no yeah it didn't stick it in it didn't zip tie it i'm bringing this back over and we're forgetting about the jb weld then yep i guess so all right oh it's pretty hardened boys the good news is that it's at an in-between tacky phase where i can get it off really cleanly guys this is great okay this one goes on this side then that's a lot of jb weld on my tube okay we need one of those zip tie guns have you ever seen one of those zip ties yeah they're super cool they're not that expensive you want me to buy you one nope i've wasted so much more of your money than the frequency of thai gun mate okay here we go come on yeah yeah oh nice this is actually going a lot better than i thought it would what happened last time someone said this is going really well have you learned nothing nope all right not bad though hey we still haven't pressure tested it i'm just saying it right now so that when we spill water all over 40 90 that there's documentation of i told you sir i often tell this to people on the leadership team here i told you so is not acceptable all right if you knew better you have to actually stop it could i stop you if i tried nope well i for one am excited what are we using for a rep really that loopy little thing yeah this is our radiator yeah and that's a reservoir it's really cheap oh you realize how much bigger this is than the reservoir that was in the aio that's true yeah it is infinitely bigger than the reservoir that was in the aio which doesn't have one we are going to have this loop filled before you can say bob's your uncle don't try to say bob's your uncle faster than i'm doing what i'm doing right now magnet why did it have to be flesh colored too bad we don't have the only fans anymore freaking hey that like is not bad though guys like for realsies not bad it actually looks like industrial yeah i'm bringing the radiator down to the pump which i just need to get repositioned so that the inlet has access to what's coming off of the reservoir i just need a position for it where are you going to put the reservoir it'll have to go somewhere right before the pump okay i can't screw this up so i'm gonna err on the side of a little bit longer okay then this bad boy has to go over this barb or we are boned oh look at that perfect actually that's that's a genius way to mount the wow it's right here seems like yeah that's real good old school freaking water cooling guys we are doing it i'm actually feeling really good now this has been a bit of a discouraging project up until now other than the first bit where things were going really well and i jinxed it oh man we got this question select kyle how does the reservoir get water from this oh okay i didn't see that don't worry kyle everything's going to be okay forgive me for not having faith in these guys i can see it i can smell victory right now look at this now we have access to both the inlet which is going to come from can you pass me this one this one here so you passed me that what do you mean goes to the inlet through where yeah yeah exactly right there and we've got a fill port do you want to cut it shorter we'll just leave it long no no we'll cut it shorter we'll cut it shorter here okay don't kill it that short tell me when just like look at it and cut it in the right spot you're a smart guy okay sure you should make educational videos alex it's like a gift ah do you have those scissors what are you doing cutting it oh my goodness okay can i have that please no not that that's the sixth what do you want oh can i have that the tubing kind of looks that can you be less of a downer clear black different kind of black luckily the same color black is this black oh these are way too long you cut this one well yeah i was just doing a test to make sure that it fit on the thinning what did you it's like kyle these are way too long and you grab the one that you freaking cut well i put you in charge here unless you want this to cut tubing well you see i will say line is possibly the scissors which are these how many times did i say scissors editor do you have those scissors okay can i have that please hey look at this though guys [music] we're freaking installed i want to see some performance out of this thing that pump is freaking going though hey that pub is pretty ridiculous i'm pretty happy it'll go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go okay now don't don't turn it off whatever you do this oh no the block the good news is that the computer is not powered on which means everything should be alive we weren't supposed to do it until later but i do have a water cooled 49er right here that we're going to swap in if we felt the need i think we're swapping this in oh i found some of your radiator schmoo oh yeah that's a pretty gross i know the problem look it's not straight so the o-ring was sitting on this scene it's very obvious what went wrong and how to fix it i have a lot of jb weld on my fingers which is probably not the best thing for an o-ring oh it's pretty bad yeah that's that's not turning back on today all right no problem guys we might have got away with one the heatsink for the ssd is very wet but i think that the ssd itself is dry hey the good news is by the time you buy a gpu block you are still not that far off what you would have spent on that top of the line aio you're an extra maybe 40 bucks inch yeah that's the upgradability of a custom loop yeah and your sanity don't worry about that new gpu upgrading all right are you ready i'm ready do it [music] is okay we're good that was the problem missing clear o-ring that's fine okay hit me with another thank you so much good sir the motherboard is very clean now especially the 490s very cleanly washed it can i have some side cutters you mean flush cutters i mean a thingy pass me that okay let's do it let's do it you ready yep there's a lot of air bubbles in there that's okay because we have the reservoir right above the pump and because we have the fittings for the radiator at the top the bubbles have nowhere to get stuck so they'll this will bleed extremely quickly it's a submersible pump so they tend not to be that quiet although it's not very quiet it's pretty it's not bad now that it's got the air bubbles out of it and like we have really got some water moving in here you guys ready okay do it three two one do it do it oh press the wrong button it's probably knocked up come on baby i haven't checked anything else 24 pin plugged in i'm getting postcodes and stuff it's doing stuff are we are we up are we up we did it yeah jank water cooling save 50 bucks we did yep well minus the gpu this is moving yeah that's on finishing touches it actually looks pretty fine from the front that classic blue led 120 mil fan look though all right in summary then we probably downgraded our radiator a little bit more surface area from the front tends to be better than more thickness overall plus these are probably better fans than what we put on this but we upgraded our block our pump is probably fine we actually have a reservoir now at all and we did it for 50 60 bucks less so we could have splurged for premium fans and we would still have a system that is upgradable that we can grow into we will upgrade the fan but what we're looking for here the biggest thing is cpu package power i'm guessing this is going to hit 95 degrees because amd targets that yeah but if this drops below about'4 watts we're doing worse if we're able to get above 200 we like killed it when we did the test before we just had the aio cooling the water block not the gpu yeah correct so now we're cooling both cpu and the gpu yeah yeah so if we have the same package power not only are we winning we are super windy yes but we also blew the budget with that gpu block so are you hitting it okay cpu 85 90. yeah so we have 200 watts can we sustain it you're not hitting the gpu are you no no that would be pretty unfair it's already got a little bit of extra load on it from that and more restriction in the loop from having to push water through an additional block i think that we're still already ahead of the aio really yeah that actually makes sense because aios use extremely rudimentary cold plates so that's your bottleneck rather than the temperature of the coolant you can throw all the fans and all the radiator you want at it if the cold plate can't move heat fast enough it's just not going to be as effective oh we're down to 92. what 192. yeah 190. that's still more no 192 is kind of like where it liked hanging out before okay well i guess we don't need to get good at high-fiving then the thing that might be pulling it back is like the vrms and not the cpu itself it's without a doubt as good or better than the ai and upgradable should we upgrade it oh god if you must i i think we just do it right now right now we're doing it we're just we're just sending it oh we can do it can we yeah no way okay let's put some real airflow on this thing if you're finding yourself asking did i just watch just know that you're not alone there are other people like you and they all shop at lttstore.com all right okay i'll be good i think we're good okay hold on can i just yeah it's great great is a strong if it takes off just get out of the way okay what can possibly go this is basically like driving down the highway at 100 miles an hour we're up from'0 to'7 . this is moving some heat out of that heater core boys'8.'9. oh my 190. all you need is the right fan configuration this just keeps going guys we're all the way up to 194. the fans are spinning fast enough that the leds turned on i gotta confess i'm actually a little surprised that the heater core method is still a viable option for pc water cooling oh yeah it's great to be clear there are more economical ways you could use proper pc water cooling parts to beat an aio and maybe that'd be a good idea for a follow-up video oh yeah you don't have to buy your radiator from the most premium brands like ek there are more affordable options just like there are more
