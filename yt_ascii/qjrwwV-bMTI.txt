ladies and gentlemen welcome back to your favorite series on the internet guess the elo and if this is your first time watching well i don't really know what you've been waiting for this is a series where i analyze my subscriber games from start to finish blindly and then i predict their chest strength and compare it to that of chess.com this is our first episode in a while but this is a big episode because i'm pretty sure this is episode number 69 which is the universally accepted nice number without further ado we are going to witness spectacular blunders brilliant sacrifices and checkmating attacks spectacular guesses and disastrous guesses and we are going to have a great time here we go all right e4 and we're off e5 knight f3 knight c6 okay symmetrical italian game castles is not the most accurate move c3 threatening to move d4 is an accurate move but castles is fun okay a3 okay casual what casual chest today at yo why are you advertising a low a local address dude what what are you doing a5 oh my goodness oh my goodness a3 trying to go b4 black plays a5 that's wild stuff c3 okay yeah can can we just play this move here can we can we just do this this what it come on y'all what it wait what not even d4 rookie one bro he's not even playing d4 what is this opening you gotta go d4 now there's something called a center fork trick knight e4 rookie 4 d5 which is when you take in the center and then you you know something takes back and then pawn to d5 but okay all right d4 there it is yep now white immediately goes wrong this is a bad move because even though it attacks the knight then i just rotates the bishop is now blocked and you've reopened black's bishop in a closed center position like this you're always looking at f5 this move should be played at some point because what it does is it opens up a lot of lines over here you don't have to you don't even have to acknowledge that okay take take we need two knight g6 nice f5 knight e5 now put the knight in the center oh i like that bishop h3 oh bishop h3 oh got him got him got em's got ems got ems got ems got em's good oh it's checkmate wow wow wow this is my last time subbing because i realized you're a narcissist shout out narcissist af queen takes g3 is game over queen take this hero bishop pinning the pawn to the king oh my goodness now i'm expecting pawn takes which by the way is not even a bad move you hang your queen but you take with check and then you make a new one so it's not even okay black plays queen g4 black misses both of those yeah black plays one square and the queen g3 again oh no why would you leave okay take on g3 fg okay this is a very very very rare exception where f takes g6 is the best move because you open up the rook oh but now bishop takes h7 is also in between move and it's a desperado okay now we have a now the queen comes back oh that's a good move oh my god the hero king oh the knight oh or vicious queen buchek it's the best move that's the top computer move the king is running what is this hung the rook he hung the rook but queen g3s queen g3 is winning oh my god oh my god queen g3 took the rook but he's covered he's covered he's covered nah he hung mate again bro oh my god rook h3 oh my oh my god yo he took the pawn at the wrong moment rook h3 now has just made it now white is winning again rook h3 oh my goodness rook h1 and rook h2 wins the queen holy smokes black is winning if you have the endgame's master class you would know why black is winning this would be in the end game imbalances chapter or the rooks chapter black is winning here because of the pawns and the fact that white is extremely passive here on the back rank let's see if black is able to win this ah i would not rush with the exchanges but yeah you have the pawn yeah now yeah there you go i get the pawns in there get the pawns in there nice and easy easy game beautiful beautiful it was made in one like two different ways here but all right we took the rook and we we get the dubski okay so we're we're those were those uh yo stop selling out my brother you're gonna get permanently banned and clowned on in a guess the elo episode i'd like you to write one final message to the stream and one final message to the beautiful youtube audience what would your what do you want your last message to be before we hit permaban youtube let it happen youtube i know this is rough this is like watching a kid get get yelled at by their parent at the playground you want to step in and help no no we parent the way we parent here he said loser he went out with a bang nice we are going to ban this young fellow but we're not going to ban him because we are offended we're gonna ban him because it's summer and rather than spending time behind a screen go outside school's out you know we're all losers you know what i'm saying we're all losers we all gotta we all gotta go outside at some point i feel like you are italian more than american all right we're gonna perma ban that no i'm just kidding what all right let's let's guess the elo it was a decent opening i mean sometimes people who are like 12 1300 play like obscure opening lines it was in admittedly a very interesting game a very back and forth game how much do we deduct for missing this checkmate like seven times i mean i mean this is definitely a four digit game right definitely a four-digit game there was some sophisticated stuff here but man queen takes g3 i mean i'm gonna say 1100. i i just don't feel like there was enough control of the game to be any higher than that i'm gonna say like like 11 1200 like high 1100 maybe 1180 1170. because i just feel like there was a complete lack of control this is not who played this game 1100 1160. okay black is 1260 but that's what i said i said high eleven hundred i so i said high 1100 and 1160 i mean but okay black was 12 1260 i guess black but black won the game so i guess you know yeah black was a little bit higher than my estimate but yeah i probably looked beforehand oh you got me surprise guys i've been cheating against the elo for over 60 episodes and you've been falling for it that's why frequently i'm off by 500 points no that guy got me oh my goodness he got me oh my god it's a surprise surprise guys i've been lying to you the whole time oh my goodness goodness gracious how did i get discovered that's crazy stuff all right let's go back here oh i just realized we actually recorded the first we recorded the first game on a slightly different overlay yeah i i will check the i'll check the chess.com estimation on the next one i'm a little bit worried about crashing my computer right now it's been getting it's been getting all funky with me recently all right e4 d5 scandinavian i feel levy can be gm in seven years if he tries that's fine we're all entitled to opinions even if they're bad okay so this is like the scandinavian declined but the problem with putting your pawn here is that black has not yet played a french defense you understand like e6 d4 is a french that's an advanced french the problem with doing it this way is black is going to play bishop f5 and c5 so you gave black a really really good french and a really good caro so you shouldn't play e5 on the second move against the scandinavian no way okay never mind well black just voluntarily went back to a french so yeah that's yeah cool stuff it's good let's see d4 c5 c4 bishop g5 okay already things are quite weird yeah things are already very very strange here okay knight a7 wow wow sensational b5 b3 all right we're a little thing over here on the side of the board f6 very very mysterious pawn pushing going on g4 okay this is a triple digit game for sure mm-hmm very ooga okay we took bishop h5 check no bishop h5 check oh bishop h5 check oh now you can't even oh we found the fork he took the bishop with check which actually might have even been the best move he went back for the rook yeah typical 25 move castles all right incredible should be three i i can't really there's i can't really all pawn to b2 oh how do you even what is even the best move now this just looks hopeless rook takes e6 oh my god oh my god that's the best move because king takes bishop f4 discover check what what and now white has this and if you take oh oh that's what happened rookie eight oh my god rookie eight no take the queen he can't take back because queen f8 is big queen of fate is maids yo this dude playing white played an absolutely terrible game i am not capping this was not good by anybody black played worse probably this was a very very back and forth affair okay are these two moves cheating are they brilliant and this whole time white was high rated or are they an accidental brilliant combo what happened what happened how did homie sack the rook and the knight double brilliant how did that happen cheating accident actually was 2400 and just played the whole game deliberately poorly what is going on here i mean now i gotta i gotta look at this game and consider both these players as just two thousands mindlessly shuffling their pieces back i mean g4 h4 is crazy okay nobody rated over 1200 should be playing g4 in this position it's just an insane move but bishop h5 is just winning i mean like bishop h5 even here is winning all this focus on the yeah geez like any high rated player here goes bishop h5 which makes me think between 8 and 900. that's that that's what i'm thinking unless these people deliberately through this game i just can't like like no high rated player plays c4 here no high rated player plays c4 it's just not a good move i think it's like around 900 that that that's that's what i'm gonna say what do we think 1300 oh my god a 1300 played c4 oh and white has gm in his username why would it oh no oh i did not no y'all y'all know i i think they knew i think they know each other i think they know each other i i i i think i think they were on a phone call or something nah i don't know i don't oh what does chess.com think right chess.com thought white was a 1300. and it thought black was a 1050. man shut up chess.com shut up you don't know anything stupid just like i'm stupid i don't even that's crazy desperate times call for desperate measures and i guess black delivered oh my goodness damn we can send our games you could send anything you you want i mean i'm not gonna look at your games but you you could go ahead gotham sub playing with the black pieces in game number three okay d5 g3 okay why does warsaw move two and three in the cairo nice oh okay 500 right gotta be queen h4 game over just literally game over on the spot you win by force block to play win by force queen h4 king e2 bishop g4 pins the king to the queen knight f3 you actually can just take it king comes forward queen slides back x-ray king to queen and that's game over so here here and there is a major difference between this position and this position if you try to do the same thing in this position white has this did you see what happened on anna kramling tournament some bug turned stream during game oh i don't what is that some bug turn stream during game but what so the pawn on c6 covers this check very small detail but very very underappreciated detail a bug crawled on the camera oh i would have been if if it was a b a bug unmuted the commentary that's crazy wow that's that's one of the reasons why did i just switch to the other game that's one of the reasons i i i i cannot do comment like i cannot i i would just be embarrassed i i have way too much i i just would be so embarrassed i i can't even anyway queen h4 check was winning but okay c5 knight c6 what good queen h4 nice all right black is gonna win this game this is gonna be one of those games that a user submits where yeah they just completely destroy their opponent okay uh oh my god i think queen b5 might be a draw very soon oh my goodness what is this position whoa oh oh what did the only reason that this is not immediately winning for white is because 97 is check oh wait a minute wait a minute not only is 97 check after that you can castle in its mate [music] 97 and oh oh mate oh the legendary tactic wow there it is out in the wild this only comes around like once every decade but there it is short castles and it's made on the back rank white absolutely devoured here by the towers the rooks just look on peacefully or run away oh that's absolutely sensational imagine booting up a chess game pushing all of your pawns out then moving your queen and bishop like out like that losing all of your pieces and your king gets like a three mile run in before getting checkmated on the opposite rank i don't foreign how does okay this is like a 5 600 game right i mean i i i i i i don't i think if white is any higher than 600 i i don't i'm gonna have a really big problem with that it's got to be like five six hundred what is 900 nope and what does chess.com think 300. nope yeah yeah no no no no nope yeah no wow that was bad yeah you you know what when i start thinking that the players know each other and they colluded to make a game that's bad that's very bad i'm the only non-vtube streamer in your in your well if you want i can act like a v tuber i can do this whole next game with this voice e4 c5 e3 no it's okay i'll i'll do my normal voice i i could if you want but i feel like i feel like people are gonna unlock something in themselves that they were not comfortable unlocking all right a3 sicilian to put the intention of playing b4 b4 what yeah see this this this is why y'all gotta like not buy courses if you're like not just the fact that white play d3 thank you board detector there you go board detector just unlocked something inside themselves so they give the 10 subs yeah so like look i i feel as though somebody probably bought the e4 course and then just like didn't actually study it whatsoever so yeah i i i okay okay now we're just playing a normal game of chess but the pawn on is on a3 no problem okay oh oh zipping around over there oh wow oh my oh my goodness why when bishop g5 then decided i'm gonna go bishop h6 and then decided i'm gonna go bishop g5 and then lost the bishop okay that's just okay now now right oh little creepy crawly knight d4 is a nice move here h4 aggressive h5 aggressive a g okay don't take this because then you're gonna open up the center okay very nice slide the king over punchy three gotta go for it rook h3 okay the knight was just trapped with a6 because it actually couldn't go anywhere oh look at this this is big boy stuff i'm not trying to call you fat i i don't i don't know how much you weigh i'm just saying this is like you know oh look at that confident march forward oh rook h7 is 100 gonna get blundered it's a hundred percent gonna get blundered now queen g6 is made and they're taking on it it's still made by the way it's still made if you sacked a queen you might have some sort of checkmate or rook h7 or is he gonna play queen f6 take the knight take the knight violent king hunt oh no oh no you let the king escape oh my god no no no you lost all your pieces no you're gonna lose your queen oh my goodness he did lose the rook he did lose the rook what is going on he lost on time i think he lost on time oh no it was just mate it's just checkmate all he's gonna do is take the knight with either piece queen f6 is made in one like nine different ways afterwards oh my god wow white actually did a lot of stuff right in that game and then just lost immediately i mean like white did not play well white is obviously still very much a beginner but listen there were signs of logic like h4h5 is very clever this was very smart just this kind of game planning alone but then like kind of a lack of of detail makes me think like 700 no i i mean i think for white to play like ver okay obviously you're gonna make blunders but then to come up with this h pawn attack and then like this all all of this like to play pawn to g3 get the bishop out of the way play a foreign big brain stuff this was all very logically planned out i'm gonna say a high 700 i think because i i just i just don't understand in what universe and 1100 would blunder this and then there was just a lot of like very very one move style chess and then i mean missing maiden one is crazy there's no way it's 900. yeah i mean if they're the same level then then maybe like maybe like 900 but but i think black overperformed for sure but but i but i want to say around around 800 but let's see let's see oh my god oh my god white is 5 30. and black is 9.85. damn bro okay well you outperform bro i mean listen you outperformed i said you were like seven eight hundred you play you 500 you got you got you got promise you i promise but four weeks later i studied a3 sicilian and i got plus two on move nine against the 1700 well look at that i mean look at look at that look at that look at the gotham opening repertoire getting you a winning position against the 1700 oh my goodness 500 elo getting a nice little nice little cook going on the board oh damn i like that that was a that was that was a good game that was a nicely played chess game i have to give credit where it's due we have one more game today chess.com estimate the chess.com estimate was i'm looking now bring us back there the chess.com estimate was that white was 750 which is what i said and black was seven that's crazy i said seven eight hundred yep yep the reason weep all right we have got a we've got a final game here this was a a nice and quick game now i'm just gonna i saw the first three moves of the opening this is what they are so we're already off to a really good start blocking in the night blocking in the bishop the triangle attack it's like a london but much worse because you don't actually develop a bishop you block both of your pieces you also weaken your king which is something you don't do in the london it's like the london but worse in every single sense black is playing fantastic now black shirt castle play d5 those should be the next two moves your opponent allows you to put two pawns in the center that's what you should do because the trade benefits black here and castle here's what i think i think this is a bullet game hear me out i think i'm sherlock holmes i think black was playing normally but saw that white was pre-moving every move i think this is what white does white pre-moved all of these moves white pre-move c3 to go here so that you prevent knight d4 and then black at this point was like wait a minute white is pre-moving every move so i'm gonna take the knight because they're not gonna pre-move this is that crazy i like are you see okay never mind maybe these are just like 400s h5 huh wow h5 is yeah h5 is is is yeah yeah yep okay now here come the queen before check now why would you go there why would you go there why would you not put the knight in the center and then go queen before check and just take everything and what is this take the pawn good move you can't take the knight now oh okay nice little combo here knight d4 check can't take the queen because it's check knight d4 take the queen work play this first tempo winning move then you attract the king to e3 and then you play fork but okay this is fine knight f6 c5 knight g4 that's it that that was the game okay pretty gangster you know i i okay i mean you killed him i don't i guess we're we're ending today's episode was just was just a murder like i feel like i feel like cops are gonna get called in my on my house now but you know it is what it is foreign i have absolutely no idea i how much info do i have for moves like knight h7 and d5 i think this is a bullet game played between two 1300s can i say i'm gonna guess the time control okay this is either 1300 bullet if it's anything above bullet if this is like a rapid game that i'm gonna say like i don't know 600 700 ah twitch is getting advertisements now that's very funny we're gonna we're gonna reveal it and they're not even gonna get to see the big reveal but you will on youtube all right i'm guessing those are my guesses let's see 300 blitz game i thought it was i thought it was a 1300. yo y'all are 300 y'all are good for 300 bro that's crazy i thought you guys were 1300. oh my goodness what does chess.com think you i is chess.com gonna guess like based on your ratings is chess.com gonna be like or what is it gonna say oh i thought black is 700. what a beast and how much time was spent on no there wasn't even pre-moving nah that's crazy oh my god oh my god he spent he bro he spent five seconds on that move
