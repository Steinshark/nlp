i think it's very clear you know that harvard kept harping on me over and over again about the idea that well we only use race to help you not to hurt you it's a zero-sum game so you know a penalty for one group is equivalent to a bump for the other group you know we could always write it write it that way and you know i think robert sort of summed up the decision well by by saying the solution to eliminating discriminations to eliminate all of it [music] foreign [music] hello everyone watching and listening today i'm speaking with professor researcher and econometrician peter arcidiocono we discussed the recent landmark decision by the supreme court to end race-based affirmative action how peter's research was instrumental in that outcome why merit has repeatedly proven to be the best indicator of success and what merit is by the way how compassion is used to cloak racial discrimination and what might actually yield results in service to the under-resourced communities across the united states so peter let's start with this the affirmative action has been in the news a lot well for a long time but particularly in recent weeks given the new supreme court decision i think we should first of all alert everybody watching and listening to who you are and why people should consider you a valid source of information and and and what you do so fill us in about who you are and what you do and why this is a topic of interest to you so you know i'm an economics professor who studies affirmative action and higher education and sort of as a result of that got the opportunity to be an expert witness in the two students or fair admissions cases that were recently decided decided in the supreme court one with harvard and one with unc and i took the cases in part because you know for someone who studies affirmative action we've never had the data to really look at it well universities typically hide their data probably as a result of these lawsuits so you know there's a large gap in racial preferences between it being a tiebreaker and being what somebody like a braum candy might be in favor of of equal outcomes so understand exactly how big the preferences are to me would move us in a direction thinking about optimal policy now as it stands you know the way the rulings went we're we're not supposed to have affirmative action i think universities are probably going to look for ways to get around that but the thrill was the ability to actually see harvard's admissions files you know i got to actually see their full database across six years i got to look at the actual applications themselves look at the reader comments for a subset of these things you know all the alumni interviews it was an amazing experience a frightening experience but an amazing experience to be able to see all that okay so let's let's start with two things why don't you outline the cases for us you said there were two cases and then maybe you could step people through the typical admissions process at let's say at harvard and the uns and unc that's going to be similar for many universities but everybody watching and listening needs to know how universities do how they claim they admit how they actually admit and how they should admit those are three obviously separate questions but let's start with what exactly why exactly were these universities in court to begin with so there's actually two different reasons on the harvard side it had a lot to do with asian discrimination we think about affirmative action and it really is designed to help african-american students and somewhat hispanic students but asian americans is a population of doing incredibly well academically and also in other areas and so harvard was a good place to look at the ancient discrimination side side of things so in the harvard case he had both asian discrimination you also had our racial preferences narrowly tailored you know how big are these racial preferences at harvard so those are sort of my two parts of the case there was another expert uh rick kallenberg who covers race neutral alternatives because that's the other thing the supreme court has said is you're supposed to look for ways to get diversity without using race explicitly on the unc side we didn't have the asian discrimination claim it was more on you know how large the racial preferences coupled with these race neutral alternatives but then there's another aspect too which if you look back at the two michigan supreme court cases the one on the undergraduate side said you cannot use a formula but on the law school sides you can't use racist part of a formula but on the law school side you could you could take into account holistically i mean as an economist and i'm sure for you too if i just hide part of the formula now i'm holistic you know so the question is you know how how formulaic were the admissions and you know my models could predict unc admissions incredibly well so that would also sort of speak to you know what does it mean if we don't write down the formula is it okay you know but you don't if you don't write down the formula and yet you couldn't derive an equation from analyzing the outcome all that means is that the admission process is random not that seems i mean you could go to a random admission process right you could let every hammer in and then you could fail everybody who doesn't do well in the first two years and let it and the survivors flourish and i mean you could make a case for that it's somewhat inefficient because all those people who fail have to go there and fail and that's not necessarily so easy on them but there are certain advantages to that because there will be surprising successes as well that isn't generally the direction that we've chosen to go and then if you do have a more rigorous policy so that would be one you could hypothetically model well then in principle in fact this is actually by law as far as i understand the law is that my understanding of the law with regards to hiring and selection at least and i don't know if that pertains to academic admissions is that you have to use you are required by law to use the most valuable valid and reliable current means of evaluation available that don't produce counterproductive and illegal racial differences and so and no one knows how to do that because well because no one knows how to do that it isn't obvious how you can do both simultaneous in fact it doesn't look to me like you can and that's a major conundrum so okay so back to you to back to unc so you modeled their equations and you did the same thing for harvard and you found and you you phrased it in these terms too is that for every advantage that's given to one race let's say or one category there's going to be a commensurate disadvantage applied to another and that's particularly egregious in the cases of harvard and and also i believe the unc that's particularly egregious in relationship to asians and and how big are the advantages and and what do you think they signify oh i think the advantages are enormous you know i went in a lot more optimistic about holistic admissions than i came out you know to me it really looks like we give very large preferences across the board it's not just on race but also on legacies whether you're gonna be on the whether you're gonna be on the sailing team you know right right legacy athletics and race anything else oh so they also have children and donors which and children and faculty and staff those the last group isn't that big but the children writers right it seems sort of odd because they're supposed to have like need blind admissions but then there's a special list where we have children and potential donors okay so so let me dive into that momentarily so i spent a lot of time delving into the selection literature and by a lot of time i mean like 15 years i mean a lot of time we developed selection tests for for corporations and for academic institutions and so like i knew the literature and one of my students did an excellent phd on selection mechanisms in general and developed an entire battery for selecting students but and we looked at this initially i was an ignorant canadian i didn't know this was a politically charged domain i was curious about something very very practical which was well are there efficient ways of selecting the best candidates for different positions academic creative managerial and the answer to that is well yes and they're very well documented and they're relatively objective and so i started looking at the data on objective testing personality and also cognitive let's say there are other you can measure interest you can measure creative ability there are other objective ways of getting at this and then i looked at the history of objective testing and i learned that it was the socialists that brought iq tests to the uk and then they spread from there into the rest of the western world and the re the reason for that and the army did this as well the reason for that was that the hypothesis was that if you used objective tests that you could identify people of disadvantaged economic background who had the ability to succeed academically and professionally and that would be good for them and fair but it would also be good for everyone else because why the hell not draw on the full talent pool if you're trying to move people along the educational ladder off the education ladder and so my conclusion from all this and this is before all this became politicized was that there was absolutely no better way of serving disadvantaged communities than to stick 100 to objective tests not because they didn't produce differential outcomes because they still do but because any other system you could possibly produce would produce much worse outcomes and then i read adrian wooldridge as well you know and adrian who did it he said he was an economist journalist for years a very very careful historical researcher he showed very clearly as far as i'm concerned that the alternatives the historical alternatives to objective testing have been dynasty and nepotism not equality of outcome so the prob the thing about objective tests to me is well first of all they actually predict they're reliable and valid they're better than any other method by a large margin and and this is the crucial and there's no way that you can do better than that everything else you do will be worse okay so now we have this mishmash at universities that you just pointed out if you're a child of a faculty member you get preferential access that's usually a hiring perk for the faculty members an amazing one right and it keeps it keeps them at private schools because right state school can't do that but the private elite schools can do that right right so you can see what the rationale is there and then children of donors well you can also understand the rationale there but basically what that means is that rich people can buy preferential access now you could argue that that's acceptable if one of the things that the rich people are doing is donating like 100 million dollars to establish an entire new research complex you could say well perhaps that's a price worth paying it's not fair at the admissions level and then well the next one is athletics and you know i worked for the u.s naval academy for a while that's a whole story in and of itself and i found there and this was quite shocking to me as again as an ignorant canadian that they had a walloping preference for athletic ability at the naval academy and that struck me as you know pretty damn counterproductive given what they were training these people to do and then you also mentioned racial preference and so there's a variety of ways that these admission systems get gerrymandered do you see a solution that's even possible you know holistic i think that's just complete bloody rubbish that's just hidden prejudice and discrimination do you see an alternative to the catastrophe of objective evaluation because it's also a catastrophe well there's a clear alternative but we won't be pursued you know basically every other system has test based admissions and i think the key to pushing on four more for test-based admissions is exactly what you said we think about the tests as favoring the rich but the other stuff favors zurich's even more well right that's exactly it yeah you think the athletics you know harvard actually offers more varsity sports than any school in the country you know when we think about sports as being an equalizer you're thinking about football and basketball we're talking about sailing that's an entirely different matter so if you get rid of racial of athletic preferences whites go down african-americans stay the same and asian americans hispanics go up i'm sure that if you took football and basketball out of that it'd be only whites who are going down and that fits in you know because harvard also has an athletic rating as part of their admissions criteria beyond just the athletic preference so everybody gets an athletic rating and the people who do the best on harvard's athletic rating are white legacies then legacies of other races then white non-legacies you know how does that work one it's the sports that harvard offers like sailing and such but sports actually favors people who go to small private schools so i went to suburban public school no way could i make the soccer team my kids they made the soccer team at their school because they don't cut anybody you know those types of things are all work to favor people people of needs yeah well this is the thing that that's why i want to reiterate that for for people who are watching and listening like if you use an objective selection system that's based on merit so let's define merit first you tell me if i you think i've got this wrong so here's the definition of merit all right so in principle the enterprise you're pursuing has an outcome so at university the outcome would be grades and graduation if you go to work the outcome would be job performance and that can be evaluated a variety of ways if you're an entrepreneur it would be success at business and so that's the outcome now merit in relationship to that outcome would be the documented relationship between a trait that you might have and that outcome and so one of the things you see on the academic front is that one of the biggest predictors of academic success is general cognitive ability and the reason for that is in part because there's actually no difference between general cognitive ability and academic success right they're the same thing now it turns out you can measure general cognitive ability in with incredible rapidity very accurately and they are the most accurate tests ever designed by social scientists they're much more powerful than almost every medical test that we use and they're very predictive not only of academic performance as evidenced by grades but also then long-term life performance and they're even more predictive of speed of learning and again that's because general cognitive ability and speed of learning are the same thing so you know there is a debate about our society whether or not merit is in itself a let's say a racist and prejudicial construction but that's that's an idiot presumption because that's the same statement as what any enterprise is for is not relevant and that's completely preposterous because an enterprise exists because it's for whatever it does that's its justification so you can't get anywhere by claiming there's no such thing as merit and you actually can't get anywhere by claiming we can't measure merit because if you accept that that means we'd have to throw out all of medicine and the social sciences because we can actually measure merit better than we can measure anything else and then you add to that if you don't measure merit whatever you measure is going to disadvantage the disadvantaged people even more and that's the crucial issue as far as i'm concerned because it will revert to these invisible forms of prejudice that are always associated with nepotism and dynasty so do you think i have any of that wrong so i'm in total agreement with you i think the point of contention that the universities would say is that their objective function is different they want to create the future leaders of society and maybe that connects all with the cognitive ability but they're so vague about what the objective function is that actually getting pinning them down on that and being able to actually measure is tough i also know the leadership literature okay fundamentally it's rubbish and the reason for that is that first of all there isn't any such thing as leadership like it's not a unitary phenomenon and it's partly because there are different ways of leading people and different circumstances call for different say styles of leadership or different abilities now having said all that you can say that in general people who are highly intelligent who are conscientious which means they'll do what they say they'll do and they stick to the task and who are somewhat extroverted tend to tilt more towards being approved of leaders because while they can figure out how to do things they'll actually do them and they can communicate about them enthusiastically but if you take that as a base definition of leadership you're still going to find out that con that general cognitive ability and conscientiousness predict that and that is also the same two sets of traits that predict success at universities so all that gerrymandering by the universities that hand waving about the notion that they can't measure their outcomes is that like that's that either means they don't know anything about how to measure or that they're just obscuring the situation to their own for their own purposes whatever they might be well and that's the thing that drives me most crazy about universities is their unwillingness to use their data you know if you take covid as a perfect example of this notre dame had a very different coveted policy than the ivy league schools we should know how that worked out we should know how the mental health rates were different across those things and then so we know how to do it better in the future we don't do that and you know the other thing it's just i find hilarious is that a lot of universities have randomized roommates that's great for the purposes of studying what the effect of different roommate characteristics have on you and and what the max component might look like but they don't do that they just keep having the randomized roommates they don't actually look to see what pairs might actually work and how could we construct policies that might actually help their students well you know it's really it's really it's really sad that universities don't do that because universities spearhead the social sciences research enterprise and the fact that they don't capitalize on their own expertise either indicates that the expertise isn't there or that it's untrustworthy or that there are other reasons they don't bother which is either you know incompetence or some some hidden agenda and none of that is excusable and so it's crazy so let's go back to the to the court case if you don't mind so what magnitude of advantage are we talking about with regards to these different categories we have athletics we have legacy students we have racial preference that was that was the main three categories apart from children and faculties what what kind of differential advantage are you looking at with regard say on the racial front well so by far the biggest is the athletic preference oh and then that's the biggest one oh by far yeah and you know part of that you could think is they negotiated ahead of time that they're getting in so maybe you don't see the full applicant pool for them but the characteristics of admitted athletes so i mean the the athletic admit rate is you know over 85 percent and the average athletic admits has academic characteristics that are much worse then the average applicant to harvard and the average applicant to harvard has a very low chance of getting in so you know we're really talking about massive preferences there so so so could you outline the advantages and disadvantages to the athletic preference because you could say well the the kids who've been good athletes they are stellar at something so they've they have a demonstrated track record of so to speak track record of accomplishment and i think there's something to that i think you could infer although it would be nice to prove that having developed the ability to be a discipline specialist in a sport might make you a better team player and potentially a better leader i don't i don't know of any data pertaining to that you might say as well that for a school like harvard that faces an embarrassment of riches on the applicant front that using additional criteria of achievement is a useful screening mechanism why does this athletic preference exist now you said it favors the rich too and that's a very interesting thing to look at but why does the athletic selection advantage exist and what do you think the pros and cons are well i think it's a backdoor way in harvard's case of getting people from rich families and i say that primarily because you know over 16 percent of white admits are recruited athletes that's actually way bigger than what you see for african-americans hispanics or or asian americans and that's because you know they're choosing sports like saline skein fencing all these things that are associated more on the the upper end but i think you end up with the way you know more university governance where you end up with these handouts why why isn't it the case why would you have an athletic rating and not a music rating you know it it's it's a very odd thing to me that we have this tie when you go to the restroom you always close the door behind you right you don't want a random passerby looking in on you so why would you let people look in on you when you go online your online privacy is important that's why i use expressvpn and you should too using the internet without a vpn is like going to the restroom without closing the door how is that well your internet service provider knows every single website you visit they can sell this information to ad companies and tech giants who then use your data to target you expressvpn creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet so your online activity can't be seen by anyone it works on phones laptops even routers so everyone who shares your wi-fi is protected and all you have to do is just fire up the expressvpn app and click one button it's as easy as closing the bathroom door get an extra three months of expressvpn free by going to expressvpn.com jordan that's expressvpn.com jordan for three extra months free express vpn.com jordan [music] so so at places like harvard they do they do look at additional forms of attainment and you'd know more about this than me but i i used to know the dean of admissions at harvard and we talked a lot and that he was a very interesting character and you know they do they basically pick kids who were at that point that was back in the 90s they picked kids who generally were stellar academically a lot of them were valedictorians or or the next best thing then generally they had to have at least one other relatively stellar talent and that was sometimes athletics but it was it could be it could be proficiency in any number of other domains but you're saying that the athletic preference far outweighs any of the other criteria that are applied that's right because they don't even have like a field in the data for these other things you know here we have athletic you know we know you get a score for that the other things are going to matter it might show up through your extracurricular rating or things like that but you can see in the court record the conversations that happen between athletic coaches and the admissions in a way that i don't think happens in other other areas right so so athletics is considered separately from extracurricular and everything else is love that's right that's right right yeah well you see that also seems to be very careless you know because you'd think if you were going to set up an equation to admit that you do some work in delineating what other stellar performance features are actually associated with academic success and and later even for your own financial interest because i mean one of the things the the ivy leagues are trying to do is to pull people in who will become rich enough to become alumni donors and they're actually pretty good at that and and they have the reasons for it but you'd think that that would be of sufficient economic interest to actually try to to actually try to model but i think even those athletic preferences why they had that was not so pure emotive as that but more relating to jewish discrimination you know i think that's part of why we have the holistic missions in the first place okay so that's another so you think not only the athletics admissions not only privilege the rich but they're also way of tilting the scales against jewish applicants that's right and so then we have a oh yeah that sort of carries forward to today you know right and that but it would be the asians who are more in that position now or is it still asians and jews the thing is we wouldn't know about jews today and part of that is harvard actually doesn't download that information so on the common application it actually asks your religion harvard doesn't download that information in part because of the history of jewish discrimination and i think that's one of the remedies in this these cases is don't download the racial information that's not going to totally get rid of discrimination they may still discriminate against the jews based on their last name you know those kinds of things but it's not as easy as being able to point to the the jewish box on that on the application now on on the athletic front again do you know if so look one of the problems that place like harvard is that if you let students in who aren't academically prepared one of two things inevitably happens three things one is it's not that much fun for the student right i mean i saw when i was at harvard the consequences of being less intellectually gifted than your peers right and that and that's that's not fun and especially many of the kids came from places where they were pretty stellar in their local environment and then they'd come to a place like harvard which is hyper selected and they wouldn't be so stellar and that was salutary in some ways because it kept ego down but it was devastating in other ways and it's no fun to be selected to a place like harvard and then to fail and if you're not selected on academic grounds and that would be for general cognitive ability and you come to a place that's full of people who are hyper-sophisticated cognitively that's gonna be a pretty damn rough goal and the probability that you're going to fail is is quite high and be demoralized and maybe even end up concluding that you're stupider than you actually are because it's such an artificial competition at a hyper selected school and then the other remedy of course is that if you admit people whose general cognitive ability isn't up to scratch then you're going to decrease the academic requirements because otherwise everyone who's admitted who on these somewhat fallacious grounds let's say everyone's going to fail and then it's going to look like your institution is prejudiced so that's right did the athletic do the f do the athletes how did they do how do the athletes do in terms of dropout and school success so unfortunately the lawsuit didn't give us outcome data but i will say i don't think dropout's an issue i think harvard always figures out a way to graduate you in ways that might not be true of other other universities what they graduate you in you know you're not you're not going to be getting a computer science degree coming to that right right right and that's what so you've been slotted it you'd be slotted into one of the disciplines that require a somewhat lesser degree of sheer intellectual horsepower that's right that doesn't build off your previous academic backgrounds and that's the beauty of this right because i actually think what's happened over time is that the returns to your college major matter more and more and so now you have fields where there's very little demand for the subject it having the athletic preferences those other preferences for the people who would really like to be an econ major but it's a ton of work given their background then they end up switching into this other fields whereas that same person might have been an econ major at a less prestigious school they could have cut it there right right right well that's the other thing i think i i observed both at the harvard and at the university of toronto like if you have a child who could be a star at a state school but was the third tier performer at an ivy league you're probably better off sending them to the state school that was my sense because compared to the general population they might still be stellar performers but if you put them in with people who are hyper selected especially when they're young they're going to draw the erroneous conclusion that they're not particularly talented now compared to you know people who are one in ten thousand the person who's one in a hundred isn't particularly stellar but compared to the other hundred they're more than perfectly capable so i would say to parents and i don't know what you think about this i would say to parents you know you should put your kid in a place where they're going to be challenged but where they're not at the bottom of the pool that's right and i think that that's more relevant in some majors than others so the bottom of the pool i think is sort of all relative to the sorting that happens within college and there's massive sorting tons of people come in wanting to major in the sciences and such and then they switch out and it's very predictable who switches out right relatively lower on the math sides tend to yeah yeah yeah yeah well that okay so so what up from what i've been able to derive that's particularly true it's like i think the the the the discipline where general cognitive ability horsepower is most necessary is is physics and mathematics then there's a hierarchy down from that and so now i guess you could also make the case is that well it's not so bad that in universities there's a range of disciplines to match different levels of general cognitive ability but i would still say that at elite schools that that have all those resources that their resources are best funneled towards those who are most able to benefit from them and that's clearly the people who have general higher general cognitive ability so and sort of related to that what also bothers me is the they're not honest with their students you know so if you told somebody up front yes we're admitting you giving your initial major interest in your test scores and grades here's the probability you're going to complete this degree here's the problem right you're going to complete some other degree here's probably you drop out now at least you've given them full information yeah yeah to me it takes away a lot of the mismatch argument because you know individuals can make up their own own mind at that point say well i'd rather go to harvard and graduate in some non-science field then go to unc and graduate in physics if that's sort of the way the the trade-off works yeah yeah well you could argue you could argue that you know there's going to be kids that you don't think will do very well on the basis of your testing who will go there and actually do quite well and so it would be okay not to inform them because that way those exceptions can flourish but i've thought this through and this is my conclusion and you can tell me what you think about this which is that yeah but for every kid like that you're gonna do like eight kids to failure and it seems like an inefficient use of that kid's time and the school's resources to have a failure rate that high to have the odd exception i mean and i see this if you're recruiting people for a management position too you might say well why not give this person a chance you know maybe they'll succeed and the answer is well yeah but probably they won't and that's going to be really hard on them and not only that if they turn out not to be able to do the job it's going to be really hard on everyone that they're supervising and working with and setting someone up for failure from compassion is not advisable as a management strategy it's a bad idea it's not it's not advisable as an admission strategy as well i totally agree i also like being able to tell people look it doesn't look like you can cut it because some of the people then can respond by working hard for myself i was the guy who just floated through thinking i had it all together then i got to graduate school and learned humility and learned i had to work a lot harder but having somebody tell me you know you're not good enough for myself that was actually a push you know i wasn't internally motivated enough i needed somebody to to prove wrong in order to to do well now i know i'm sort of weird in that way well but yeah but but not but not not like not absurdly weird in that way i mean you see lots of smart kids who have floated by who hit a wall where they're now competing with kids who are just as smart but like 10 times as disciplined and some of them fail and they're bitter as a consequence but some of them like pull up their socks and think oh my god looks like i'm actually going to have to work and there's nothing about that that isn't good for them right because then not only then they're more like asians right because the asian advantage i looked into the asian advantage a lot and the asian advantage by the way the asian performance advantage in the u.s disappears by the third generation so it turns out the more that asian kids are like american kids the less they're like asians so to speak can asians have this hyper focus like jews i would say they have this hyper focus on academic success and academic success as a status marker at home and in the community and and and you know that is that's actually i think something that in principle might be remediable because it implies that if you can teach people at any given cognitive level to work harder that is one pathway to genuine success but it's also appalling that the asians get discriminated against because you know they the ones who are being discriminated against they're hard workers and that's not a good thing to discriminate against being an american i wanted my kid to do sports you know that was just part of the thing and he was uninterested in sports and he kept telling me that and he kept kept putting him out there in soccer basketball whatever and he kept saying i want to do karate eventually did karate it was fine the kid was just different in that regard if if he'd been in a society where the norm was to do something else to do science i think you know that would have been very nice for him socially and and so on i understand he's in a place like hungary they're much more centered on math in america we're much more centered on sports that sports craze i think is actually you know it does build some good skills but i think it's we're too obsessed obsessed with it to the detriment of these other these other things and i think asian american families have sort of figured out not to be obsessed about that but to be obsessed about other things the bible is the root of all wisdom inspiration and

are given their due weight right and so so why were you called upon to testify specifically so i've written a lot of papers on affirmative action and with mixed results so i think that there's actually a lot of pressure to say good things about affirmative action and i didn't always say good things and in fact in 2011 there was a protest over one of my papers it was sort of i thought a very innocuous paper we actually use duke data and we're looking at persistence in science and economics and what you could see is that you know african-american students came in wanting to major in those subjects at the same rates as white students but they were leaving at a much higher rate so like over 50 percent of black males who started in the sciences and economics switched out versus eight percent of white males right well the the advocates of systemic racism as an explanatory hypothesis would say that the racism is so deep that not only does it discriminate on the admission side but it also discriminates on the performance side and so all those things disappeared as soon as you control for academic backgrounds you know you control for the test scores you know other duke ratings and such you start off with these big great racial gaps where asian americans were most likely to persist in the sciences and african-americans release likely once you've conditioned on differences in academic backgrounds driven both by affirmative action and what you know the educational experiences prior to college that just disappears and i i think did you control for grades or for sat scores or for both do you remember can kill them for a whole different specification said different controls but it goes away fairly quickly and you could look at in suggest performance in first year classes and look at the yeah and that that wipes it so for for everybody who's watching and listening to make tell me if i get this wrong so you could imagine that if you're doing a statistical analysis you could determine whether race was the predictor or academic ability was the predictor by modeling both of them and seeing which predicted dropout better and if it's if if academic ability destroys the ability of race to predict dropout but not the reverse then you know it's academic ability and not race and in principle unless you assume that the academic ability markers are also contaminated with what would you call it systemic racism then you eradicate the racist argument so so what the you know what the radicals do is they just say everything systemic racism and it's virtually impossible to mount an argument against that but then we have the other problem which for all of you who are compassionate who are listening you know it's not compassionate to put people into situations where they disproportionately fail right it allows you to look good on the admission front but it's not good for the people who are involved as far as i can tell do you think there's anything about it that's good for the people that are involved i i think it's tough you know we could actually say more because they ask the reason why you switched your major and one of them was the difficulty of the courses or feeling not as prepared for those courses and again you could see that black students are much more likely to say it was because of course difficulty and once you controlled for the sat scores and such that all went away so really point pointed towards these academic measures really mattering for your experience in those classes now on that systemic racism front saying well look the test scores are biased to me i think that does such a disservice because then it sort of says what's happening to prior to college like in the k-12 education it's really not that bad because the test scores are just misrepresenting it's you know when in reality the fact that you know one percent of black students score above 1390 on the sat that's eight percent for whites and like 24 for asian americans that's reflecting something that we could fix that's what that's where we need to spend our our time on is fixing that okay so so let me let me make a case for the for the universities and what they're doing so what would rapidly happen if we went to a purely objective evaluation system is that at elite level universities there would be a disproportionate compared to the population there would be a radically disproportionate number of asians jews and a radically disproportionate dearth of of black americans that would happen very rapidly and the universities are concerned about that and now and and it's it's it's definitely a very difficult not to crack right and so now it doesn't seem like the appropriate solution to that is to disadvantage extremely competent asians and i would say partly because well they deserve their shot at the target but also you know there there aren't that many hyper exceptional people on the cognitive front right and if we're greedy as a society and sensible in that greed we would say we should set up our institutions to capitalize on every available bit of brain power and persistence so it's better socially if we can put the smartest people where they have the greatest opportunities to learn and contribute so we're not just hurting the asians let's say and the jews we're also depriving ourselves in principle of what they could offer but then we're going to have the problem of of this disproportionate racial and ethnic mix in the universities and so what and and maybe this isn't a fair question to ask you because it isn't necessary that you have the solution to this it isn't obvious to me that anyone has but you were testifying on behalf of you were making a case that the affirmative action system says presently constituted are very badly flawed and probably illegally flawed but what do you see forward if anything as a way out of this conundrum so you know really i view it that i wasn't actually saying it was flawed someone just saying how big the preferences are yeah i hate actually being characterized as an opponent of affirmative action because you're just laying out biased i'm just trying to show you what what the data show to me i think it allows it works affirmative action works as a band-aid where it covers up all the inequities that are happening prior to college and then we don't focus on those things roland friar i think has done a lot of work on the no excuse charter schools showing that those are actually pretty effective at closing those achievement gaps i think the work sort of shows it doesn't translate as well into college but it's a start you know unfortunately they ran him out of town but you know he was you know the most prominent black economist there came from nothing and and you know what i think has happened to him is absolutely horrible and he's one of the few actually shows how to close the equipment gap right so and that was roland roland roland fryer all right yes yes yes yes i've i've been seriously considering him inviting him onto the podcast oh he is absolutely amazing his story is amazing and what's happened to him is yeah it's a criminal shocking it's terrible yeah well so so this this issue here i think you you touched on something very crucial which is that right if we pretend that the achievement tests are the problem that enables us to ignore the underlying problems of course that gets muddy and ugly very quickly too because one of the things i would say perhaps as a i've studied the development of anti-social personality for example another forms of psychopathology that would interfere with educational attainment and lifetime attainment over the long run and it's certainly the case for example that fatherlessness is a contributing factor in a major way right unstable destabilized families and so if you don't allow the achievement tests to be the villain you have to look elsewhere for the villains and that becomes extraordinarily complex and murky and troublesome you know we tried to prevent anti-social behavior for example in in quebec and what we learned was that if children are anti-social by the age of four most of those kids would have been aggressive at the age of two most aggressive kids are socialized out of their aggression by the age of four if they're not socialized out of their aggression by the age of four it doesn't look like there's a damn thing you can do about it afterwards or it's extraordinarily difficult at least and so that would mean you have to remediate it at the age of two but then if you start producing government programs let's say to remediate anti-social behavior before the age of two you're in people's households right it gets very invasive right so some of these underlying systemic problems let's say are extraordinarily difficult to address without falling into a kind of colonial neocolonial overreach that's one way of thinking about it and they're very precise because you know as soon as you would propose something like that you'd be accused of victim blaming you know but the reality is this there's been some great work done in other countries where you go into a place like india and they're talking to the mother there and the mother's like so i should be talking to my child like that wasn't passed on to them that they should be talking to their child regularly that's not not judging you that you didn't get that information passed on we were saying how do we fix this this problem i've i've i've also been interested in precursors to literacy you know and if you look at the data you find that kids from literate homes are exposed to books and a wider range of vocabulary at a differential rate that's staggering by the time the kid is like two and a half you know and it is the case that most poor families if you interview poor mothers and fathers and you ask them what they want for their children and you put educational achievement into the mix they will indicate in a fully committed manner that they would like their children to be educated but the problem is is they don't know what the say the non-verbal precursors are you know i had friends where i grew up i grew up in this little place and where the hell out in the middle of the sticks there were no books in the house like zero right and that's way different than growing up in an environment where like my kids children at' months old they're already dragging books around behind them and sitting down and pretending to read them right they have all that literacy pre-literate literacy skills are already built in they value books they know what they are they've made friends with them they'll ask their parents to read the books and you know in a in a family that's very deprived and very poor without a history of literacy nobody in the family even knows that that's a possibility that's right and it's such a shame because i think there's now a way of packaging that because well you've revealed is you know the parents love the kids they love them they want to do right by them but they're either under resourced or don't know what those steps are how do you if if it's presented more that way maybe would get around the victim blaming into something where you could actually help them i worry about that because actually i think one of the you know i used to be think that affirmative action for doctors that seems like the worst idea to place to have affirmative action but there is actually an argument for it in that if you look at whether black patients will follow the instructions given to them by a white doctor versus a black doctor they're more likely to actually follow the instructions of a black doctor so that actually makes the case there's two ways to fix that problem one would be to somehow rebuild the trust so that when the white doctor gives the script they they find it credible or the the short run fix is to get more black doctors so that we have people following following the scripts somehow that trust needs to be restored so we don't have this well we're the white saviors coming in and telling you how to parent your

literature for a long time because that was head starts a very interesting program for those of you who are watching and listening it was part of the american war on poverty that started in the early 1960s and it was actually a program that was optimistically viewed by conservatives and liberals alike right and because first of all you know who likes poverty and the answer is nobody so everybody's against poverty that has even an iota of sense and so the liberals were happy because there were you know steps being taken to remediate poverty hypothetically as a source and the conservatives were happy because well wouldn't it be better if you know poor young people were educated so they could pick themselves up by their bootstraps and you know make their way in the world and so everyone was hoping that head start would be a success and fundamentally it wasn't so and and here's here's how it wasn't the goal was the theory was that if you got to kids early before school and you gave them an academic boost that that would not only catch them up to their peers but it would give them the kind of permanent advantage that would grow across time right because now you're prepared to go to school you can do better in school and the advantages would just accrue and that was a pretty good theory but it turned out not to be true because what happened and this has been studied to death and there's no doubt about this and people of every political stripe analyze the data is that the head start kids actually did do better in grade one and two and three their grades were higher they were more likely to attend school and so on but all the other kids caught up to them by grade six so the cognitive advantage didn't accrue and it didn't multiply in fact it disappeared and now what head start did do was more kids graduated who were head start alumni and fewer got pregnant in in teenage in the teenage years and there were fewer criminals in the head start groups and the reason for that apparently was that some children's environments were so toxic that just taking them out of those environments for some period of time allowed them to be more socialized and because they behaved yet better they had better outcomes but there was no effect whatsoever on cognitive performance and that's very disenchanting eh because that was a major league program and people put a lot of time and effort to it and there were every reason to hope that there would be some gains on the cognitive ability front that were permanent but that didn't happen so i thought the kids who went to the head start kids who went to better schools you did see it continue but maybe i'm misremembering it sort of continued to be like you couldn't just stop the investment there if if they kept going on that track that but i'm not an expert in that literature i'm sure you know what's better than me well noel not necessarily i don't know if i knew the the differentiation at grade six between the kids who you know went to better schools and the kids who went to worst schools what i did know was that overall the cognitive advantages that had been accrued disappeared it didn't have it didn't seem to have a permanent effect on iq for example which was really disheartening right because now i looked into it even in more detail part of the issue was you know head start was also used as an employment program and so it wasn't necessarily obvious that the kids were actually learning anything at head start they might have been being taken care of reasonably well and it's also very difficult to take a group of three-year-olds and teach them anything in an hour and a half because there are three and you know you have to you have to give them juice and you have to give them food and you have to stop them from tearing each other into bits and like yeah and then you have to be trained enough to actually educate them and so it isn't obvious that head start was set up optimally as a cognitive retraining program but but then it's very expensive to set up an optimal cognitive retraining program so that's also a major league problem so so let's go back to the let's go back to the judgment so what exactly did the supreme court determine and what are the cons what have the reactions of the university's been and what are the consequences of the decision so you know the supreme court i mean there was some sense of vindication because i really felt like the lower court rulings abused the statistical evidence now i think the statistics played a role in all this but you know there are other aspects besides justice the statistical side i think it's very clear you know that harvard kept harping on me over and over again about the idea that well we only use race to help you not to hurt you but it's a it's a zero-sum game so you know a penalty for one group is equivalent to a bump for the other group you know we could always write it write it that way and you know i think robert sort of summed up the decision well by by saying the solution to eliminating discrimination is to eliminate all of it you know so you're not supposed to use race directly in admissions now they left this bit of a loophole in terms of being able to talk about your experiences the prejudice and such and i you know i think that could be a good thing but if it just gets abused the way i expected it might yeah it will then yeah then we've got got a problem yeah my my okay so they they they eradicated so they said straightforwardly that you are not to use race as a determining factor that's right that's right race can enter in only through your experiences what that means for what college admissions places actually do is going to be interesting i mean i think what what california did you know we had prop 16 prop 16 tried to put racial preferences back in place it got voted down in california by wide margins despite trump being on the ballots and the reaction of the uc system was we're gonna no longer require the s.a.t because we want to figure out a way you know i think that the idea of a university throwing away data you know it's just beyond comprehension you know it's to take the sat for all of its flaws is a pretty damn good test of general cognitive ability and that's a great predictor of the potential for academic success and it's also an equalizer across schools which is crucial right when you're trying to contrast rich kids from great schools with poor kids from dismal schools you know at least the poor kids from the dismal school with a great sat can get into university and likely succeed you throw that out man what are you left with you're left with these i don't know how they entered criteria yeah i don't know how the uc admissions could possibly make decisions you know like if you're going to use the high school grades grades are all relative to whatever high school yeah right you know you're attending this is again where if you use the data you could actually show and build that trust with the data so you know if the sap is biased in favor of the rich and it's over predicting the performance of the rich right we could correct that you know well we can point this out with the sat too so this has to be done on the racial front because if the sat was prejudiced against black test takers it would under predict their performance and it doesn't it doesn't right and that's a that's a killer statistic right i mean it's quite the shock because now you could say the only way to get around that on the systemic racism front is to say as we alluded to earlier that the performance criteria are just as prejudiced as the admission criteria but they would have to be exactly as prejudiced it seems right right right right which seems you know extraordinarily extraordinarily unlikely and you just roll it forward to the next stage every time to say well then the next place is exactly the same level of racism as the previous stage you know it's it's crazy well i've you know the conclusion i came to and this was a painful conclusion in some ways it it wasn't necessarily in accord with my moral sentiments let's say is that we we simply can't do better than actual race and ethnicity blind objective tests of predictive merit and those should be established those should be applied uniformly and because that's the best solution even though it still has its flaws now i don't i still have no idea what the consequence of that would be given that the elite schools would rapidly fill up with asians maybe the consequence would be that the other relatively underperforming ethnic groups including whites would pull up their socks you know that's a possibility and say well those people are obviously doing something that we're doing right that we're not doing that was my reaction and i was looking at the numbers thinking i want to know what they what they're doing you know because it's it's incredible yeah right right there's a lesson to be learned there in principle knowing what those best practices are would be incredibly helpful and i and i don't i don't have a good sense of it yeah so what what has been the consequence for you of being involved in this line of research you said there were protests about your work in 2011. i guess you were lucky it was 2011 and not 2016 because it didn't take you out and might have later so so what have many people wondering how i survived you know yeah well i'm curious about continue exactly yeah yeah and you know that whole experience really prepared me to take the case it was actually one of the most spiritual moments you know of my life because when people are protesting and you know it just made me realize how much i care what other people think about me you know somebody writes an article from some satellite state school in an ethnic studies department in the state of washington calling me a racist that really hurt at the time yeah yeah it's really hard on people you bet and phyllis you know a week or two of like no sleep and then i woke up one morning and i view it by grace was free and felt like i was able to love the people who were coming after me and saying okay you know i think they're missing to everyone i'm saying i'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and explain what i actually what i actually mean and i think that that i don't know whether that's been what's i'm sure the horrible stuff could still happen to me but you know if somebody gives i i can take a punch and respond in love with and i feel like that might be seen as wimping out but i don't feel like i'm compromising on the truth you know i'll try to go as far as i can to meet them where they're at without compromising on what i know what i know to be true and i think it makes a difference you know i do you know i try to treat people well in my interpersonal relationships right right right and that so you're not you're not adding being generally dislikable to the raft of sins that might be utilized let's say to take you down so far that's right so far yes so far right no kidding no kidding but i've been amazed maybe this podcast will change all this but i've gotten zero hate mail since the supreme court decision okay so you made reference earlier to the fact that this supreme court decision overturned a number of lower court decisions and it's also the case that so obviously the lower courts were persuaded by evidence that wasn't the same that as the evidence you were bringing forward and it's also the case that at the supreme court itself there were other experts with the pedigree as credible as yours let's say who don't agree about the interpretation of the data so if you had to make a case against what you were offering as a witness how would you make the case and how did the people who were brought in as experts make the case and what were they claiming so actually i would say they have a much higher credit pedigree than i do you know david card was one of them and soon after the case he actually won a nobel prize he was the one on the harvard case and carolyn hawks hoxby at stanford was my counterpart in the unc case well it's interesting to say i had the benefit of working on both cases so i could be reasonably consistent across the two they actually attacked me from other sites so card's opinion was that i needed needed to control for more things and in particular the personal rating was an example and i you know i actually estimated models of the personal rating showing the asian bias but the way he would argue it would be we need to take sort of our resort for it that this is not a biased a biased measure so that was that was one aspect to it the other aspect to it is right but you showed it was a biased measure so so i don't understand his claim exactly so your your claim if i get it right is that the prejudice against asians so to speak was making itself manifest as invisible variables so in within the so-called personal or personality ratings now there are objective ways of measuring personality which we could also point out which are quite valid right so harvard could take that route and they don't they they do subjective evaluation but your point was that well that was hiding as substantive anti-asian bias so how do you how did your opponents mustard muster an argument against that so it's very convoluted how you how you do that because you don't actually look at a model the personally any model of personal rating shows that asian americans suggests as well sorry on the observables associated with the personal rating asian americans have observables that are just as strong as whites or or stronger and yet get worse personal rates often with discrimination things you're worried that oh every time i had a variable the discrimination goes down what if i keep adding variables that it it may go away that's the amazing thing about this case is with asian americans you put in more variables it often goes up you know the discrimination because they're they're stronger on those those measures so in order to get there it's pretty convoluted the first thing you have to do is take those special groups the athletes the legacies the children of donors and you have to to say that the discrimination has to be happening against asian apple applicants that are there as well it actually that turns out not to be the case so 98 of asian american applicants are not athletes legacies children donors the two percent that are they're not being discriminated against there's not not evidence of that i think that makes sense so it's not pers okay so it's not precisely asian discrimination or if it is it's not pervasive enough to cut across all categories that's right and i would say the same thing on affirmative action so zion williamson was an amazing duke basketball player he didn't benefit from racial affirmative action he benefited because he was an amazing new basketball player you know when you're talking about those things that's just not relevant you know for a long time they would talk about discrimination against black quarterbacks we shouldn't be able to say we're not discriminating against lineman so therefore we're not discriminating against black quarterbacks that doesn't make any sense so he's basically so all you can say is that the discrimination isn't universally pervasive you could say that some forms of discrimination will trump others that's right we discriminate against the asian americans who don't have those connections to harvard through the legacy and the recruited athletes process so that was sort of how that that case sort of worked and much of the focus in the harvard trial was all about the asian american discrimination i actually don't think david cardin and i had very different things to say about the racial preferences i would say that it quadruples their chance of getting admitted according to cards results it would the cancer being admitted for for black applicants what was interesting to unc case is things operated very differently in harvard i wrote a report then card saw my report and built off of that in the unc case we wrote simultaneous reports and then did that two more times so our starting places were completely different and the other expert basically took the position that we can't really model harvard's unc's admissions because it's holistic you know and that model sort of of admissions failed to predict predict the decisions well now i think that the criteria that she used to evaluate that was nonsensical and that if we started with me writing the first report we wouldn't we wouldn't have got to that position but in this case you can just keep doubling down doubling down i mean as an example you know her criteria was based on what's called the pseudo r squared these are non-linear models so in r squared in a linear model sort of tells you how much of the variation the data is explained when you have a pseudo r squared it doesn't really work that way in in quite the same way you know so one of the comments that was made was a pseudo r squared of 0.5 means that we get half the admissions decisions correct well that of course is nonsense right because by flipping a coin i could get half the decisions right right right right correct you really need to be looking at accuracy and if you look at accuracy you know the models would predict the correct decision over 90 of the time so it's it was a very funny experience in the unc case they basically thought i didn't control for enough things sorry that i controlled for too many things in the harvard case they said i didn't control burn up things it it wasn't uh coherent okay so so why do you think okay so okay fair enough so why do you think that your arguments so to speak or the side of the cases that you were testifying on behalf of why do you think that that carried the day at the supreme court level and not in relationship to the lower courts and what do you think of i mean the one of the response patterns especially from the radical types is that well you know the supreme court is stacked with reprehensible conservatives and of course that's how they voted and that was why the anti-affirmative action say pro merit that's another way of looking outside carried the day what what's your sense of that i think that you know i certainly came out of those cases a bit cynical about the role of this the statistics here you know both judges at the lower court could have called in a third expert to say you know which one of us is right but that would have limited their ability to rule how they wanted to rule so we it's funny how that works right where we say well it's a conservative court they're going to rule however they want to rule based on the statistical evidence i feel quite strongly that that was what happens at the lower the lower court case and then you're left with a really bad record you know in terms of what was admitted as evidence and do you think do well do you think you're do you think that your political affiliation how do you control for the potential consequences of your political affiliation which i don't know by the way how do you control for the potential consequences of your political affiliation or viewpoint on the outcome of the studies that you've been running and the testimony that you provide like how do you how do you protect yourself against your own bias well i'm very cautious on this front partly because of that protest you know so my burden of proof is you know i know i can get in big trouble so i have to be very careful how i'm going to be talking about these things and set a very high bar for coming to particular conclusions i mean i feel this way sort of in general like right the cost is high that's right so the evidence seems to be much better in that regard yeah yeah yeah but my intent was always to get peer-reviewed papers out of this so i've published five peer-reviewed publications in good economics kernels out of the case and right on asian american discrimination i want to elaborate on that for a second too because for everyone who's watching and listening it's like the social science domain is overwhelmingly tilted politically towards the left that may be less true for economics than it is for psychology but it's true across the social sciences and so what that means is that if you publish a paper with so-called conservative implications in a decent peer-reviewed journal the probability that it's robust is extremely high because if there are any reasons to thwart its progress forward those reasons will make themselves manifest i think that's right on and you could really see it in my view with you know i published one paper on legacy and athlete preferences and another paper on asian american discrimination the same commentator will trash the asian american discrimination one and laud the legacy and athlete one and it's the same model right right it's the same model right right right right yeah and that and that was was actually funny harvard the evidence against harvard was so damning they had their own internal research team that had estimated models of harvard's admissions and they found a big penalty against asian americans and harvard's like oh well we don't know what to do with that but in that same model they found that they were giving a bump to low-income students and they knew that that was true it's the same model you can't interpret it one way when you get the result you like and another way when you get the result you don't like you know it doesn't make any sense and if anything based upon the strength of the applicants you should disbelieve the low income result not the asian american result because all the observable factors are pointing to asian americans being stronger they're probably stronger the unobservable ones as well right right okay okay so you protect yourself against bias first of all just by fear which is actually a good way of well it's a good issue i used to tell my students look guys you don't publish ed reproducible data right to further your career well why well do you want to study something that doesn't exist for the rest of your life that's stupid don't do that and you're going to be motivated to do it because it's hard to admit that a research project was a failure you're going to try to scrape something out of it so you have to be careful but then the and so that's another you know use of fear it's like be careful because you'll convince yourself of something that isn't true and waste your life that's stupid your situation is well if you say anything even vaguely untoward or inaccurate you're going to get slaughtered for it and then and that's a fair that's a fair protection and then also well if you have to publish these in peer-reviewed journals you're going to hit the ideological vanguard and and have to argue your way through it and if you can do that well obviously the data has to be so credible that it can't be dismissed by people with an ideological bent okay so that's good so harvard in the unc and unc were hit hard by this ruling practically and i would say morally too they got walloped how have they reacted and how have other universities reacted well the the public for reaction is to send out emails how disappointed they are in the supreme court decision how they're going to abide it but our commitment to diversity is unchanged so i i think that they're going to try to figure out legal ways or illegal ways where they're not going to get caught to somehow put the preferences preferences back in right right right well that does that open them up on the liability front now i mean they've been told in no uncertain terms that they can't do this anymore it's not this is pretty black and white so it seems to me that if harvard continues to gerrymander their admissions processes that they're setting themselves up for a pretty wall-upping fall i don't know what that would mean on the liability front for example i mean there was a class action suit at one point right yeah and it but it really wasn't about getting damages so much as changing the system but i think harvard would have a very hard time because they just went through a whole trial of thing saying that we need to explicitly consider race in order to get these levels of diversity if they somehow kept the same levels of diversity now then when they're supposed to not being explicitly considering race that it shows they must be kidding somehow in order to in order to get there so you almost have to see a drop or the whole record in their case was was off right right okay okay now how do you think that universities should select in the aftermath of this decision well i think they should select just based on test scores but even within tests just with objective tests yeah i mean the problem is is that the sat for a place like harvard doesn't test at a high enough level we actually need to go the test's like getting the college in chile are at a much higher level than what what we have in the u.s right so they should refine them and and make them more demanding so they can discriminate so listen for everybody watching and listening you know imagine that you get people who score 95th percentile on the sat and people who scored 99th percentile and you might think well you know what what the hell's the difference and the difference is this if if you score at the 95th percentile you're the smartest person in a room full of 20 people and if you score at the 99th percentile you're the smartest person in a room full of 100 people and then the difference is just as big from 99 to 99.9 it's one in a hundred versus one in a thousand and so forth all the way up the scale and there's no indication that i can see in the psychometric literature that that ever stops being relevant and so it is import important to differentiate at that upper end you know and so i mean we've put together models to predict academic performance and you can predict academic performance quite accurately with general cognitive ability and trait conscientiousness and then low neuroticism helps and if you're looking to expand on the creative front you could you could look at measures of creative ability and there are good measures and you can look at performance and and and you can make a formal model where you specify exactly what weight you put on all of those variables and you can easily test that against actual university performance which is what you had recommended earlier yeah i mean clearly for math you want to put more weight on your math background maybe less so in english that's not taken into account at all but i think those tests right now are too easy let that distinction at that top level could be like i just made a stupid mistake that's too bad you really want to test much deeper you bet you bet yeah okay okay now we just outlayed outlined how university should select this is how businesses should select too by the way and there's huge economic advantage in doing that by the way like if you don't have to increase your ability to select top people very much to benefit in a staggering manner from the consequence of that improvement i tried to convince corporations of this for like 15 years i went on the road to sell to you to corporations which turned out to be absolutely 100 percent impossible that's when i first ran into hr departments by the way and that was back in you know the early 2000s but we talked about how the universities should select in the aftermath of the decision the the lurking question is how will they i saw uc davis for example at the medical school they're trying to produce an adversity quotient which i think is just an absolutely catastrophically dreadful idea i mean i can understand why they're doing it but god that's a dismal contest right to match your misery against someone else's and to try to rank order you know who had the hardest lot i mean okay that's it well and it's so proud of the political adjudicate man it's so prone to political as well that adversity i experience at a pro-life rally where people are harassing me i don't think that's going to sell you know fundamentally right yeah it introduces ideological conformity which yeah i think a real outstanding question is does somebody like a roland friar bring more or less diversity well you know he's not a progressive black not a progressive to me that in some sense brings war diversity we want to we don't want it to be the case that the conservatives are all whites you know yeah but that's not really how i think it's seen i think it's just gonna end up being yeah well the thing i think the whole the whole diversity shibboleth is a front for posers to attain status they don't deserve fundamentally because i don't think you can do better than merit to find the way we already define marriage which is you're a meritorious candidate if you're the features you bring to the position match the desired outcome of performance in the position and fundamentally as as we we also pointed out earlier you're actually bound by law to do that especially if you're an employer you know now the law is tricky because it it contains self-contradictory aspects but it's a one counter example for that you know there's a guy that passes so far university of michigan he does amazing work in my mind and he's from he's a muslim from pakistan and he's able to go to these madrasas these fundamentalist schools and interview them and get get data to me that's actually that's the kind of diversity that i think is good in the sense it actually he's opening up these new areas of research that there's no way the madras would ever give me data so there might be some but it's a limited scope for for you know getting certain questions answered that you might argue that you could argue that as a form of competence like if you were going to hire someone and the person said look one of the things i bring to this position is that i have access to an ethnic group say or an anthropological group that another candidate will have i mean i i and i do think that that is actually a a measure of merit and could and could could be put put under that rubric yeah the key is not to have that measure of merit just be because i'm a particular race right because that that's effectively how it's argued now is that by your race that gives you that you you do marriage it because you've got a unique insight into the into that community right right well and that's also a strange that's also a strange claim too right is that merely because you have a very what would you say low resolution feature that you're somehow an emblem standard barrier bearer for that group you know like i've never thought of myself as a representative of the white community you know it's preposterous because well first of all it's preposterous because we know as researchers into individual differences that the differences within any give given ethnic or racial group are much larger than the differences between groups right which is actually the canonical non-racist statement right within group variance trumps between group variants it even does that between men and women in in almost all domains in fact i don't know of a single domain where that's not true even in interest where men and women differ most widely the difference is one standard deviation there's still way more variance within the group than there is between the groups so so how do you think the universities will respond we said how they should respond well how will they respond well i'm hoping it will be a heterogeneous response i think some schools will go the uc route and get rid of the test scores and they'll do other things like diversity statements and such i'm hoping that other schools will focus more on you know addressing some of the pipeline issues i think you will see a big movement against legacy admissions i was surprised at actually how quickly that happened so i think that sort of stuff is is is going to go to me i'm you know what i'm really pushing for is for them to use their data to be able to say look i can tell you that you're going to really succeed here you know and we've set up our program so that you can succeed here because the competition for those students is going to be fierce well right so what a university could do you know hypothetically imagine that they set up actually rigorous objective testing models so a university could say to a given candidate your probability of succeeding in this discipline here is x percent and so that would mean that qualified students could look at a range of universities and they could say for example if they were slightly lower performing on the academic front what we're interested in sciences they can pick a university where they had a say a 70 chance of graduating and so then they'd know that if they worked they could pick the university that was the most challenging that would give them some reasonable opportunity of success right that'd be a good deal right because there's a very wide range of universities and objective testing could establish that across time and you can see that happening in a state like florida you know where the governor said you know some of the red states could move towards that model for their state system at least so that that's where i think the the best path forward is i think there are other ways to you know the whole tie to all this in terms of racial preferences was losing your government funding obviously on the admissions front you're sort of stuck there but if you look at how these the way we're paying college athletes now you could either easily have a separate organization that was sort of we're giving scholarships to black students who attend duke you know they're not tied with the government funding you can see like a huge competition emerging for that where things happen more on the financial aid side not associated with the university so there's no scope to saying that it's illegal because the organization's not there right right you see any downside to that i'd have to think more about that i mean to me that's the market there's no they're not obvious yeah yeah yeah yeah it's not there's no there's no downsides that leap obviously to mind so now is there anything else that we we're running out of time here on the youtube side i'm going to flip over to the daily wire side for everyone watching and listening and and talk to peter a bit more about how his interest in this domain and in economics in general made itself manifest so you could you're welcome to join us there if you're inclined to is there anything else that we didn't cover today in relationship to the supreme court decision and and in relationship to affirmative action it's complexities oh i i know what i know we include with perhaps you've spent a lot of time studying affirmative action do you have what would you say in relationship to its putative advantages has it has there been any manner in which affirmative action has actually been a policy success well it certainly has increased the share of minority students at top schools and i think those when as applicants are graduates even as graduates because i think at places like harvard now they will graduate great year they will graduate you so that's always been sort of the gamble right that by yes there might be these costs associated with it but by getting them to harvard great things are going to happen later on in society you know and that's you know we they'll they'll be the supreme court justices to get to those very top of the top positions that would be the argument to me that's a little stoppish but but i understand the argument do you and do you think there's any merit to that argument i mean you see my the counter argument would be giving less qualified people a pedigree that indicates their qualifications and then putting them in ever more important situations that they're not qualified for is not a net good right that's a rough argument to make and i i wouldn't necessarily say i'm making that argument but that is the counter argument that's right so on the one hand we our supreme court is more diverse because of affirmative action on the other hand i think that that is you know clarence thomas would say that send him a serious disservice because of being viewed that way and you don't know and that's that's the problem right is you know yeah well that's one of the really ugly things about affirmative action as far as i'm concerned is that it it the question is then begged and that's not good and that's particularly hard on people who are truly qualified right because what a bloody catastrophe that is to have to face that additional level of doubt like who are you really jesus brutal brutal i mean you take something like glenn lowry i think you've had on he's one of the most brilliant people i've ever met you know i think he's just fantastic and yet he had to endure all of that you know yeah yeah that isn't something you'd wish on your worst enemy that's for sure to have your genuine competence in question yeah all right well i guess we should wrap up on this side so as i said to everyone watching and listening i'm going to talk to peter at some additional length on the daily wire plus platform about the development of his career and his interests and so if you want to join us there then you'd be more than welcome to do so it's not a bad time to funnel some support the daily wire way by the way because youtube for example has been pretty assiduously at war with the daily wire contributors over the last month three of my podcasts have been taken down and i suspect there's more in the pipeline that will suffer the same fate and that's not good and the other people who are using youtube on the daily wire side have been hit harder than me by quite a substantial margin so if you're ever thinking about subscribing to the daily wire platform this isn't such a bad time to do it let's say on the moral front in any case you can give that some consideration thank you to the film crew here in manhattan today for making this a pleasant experience and technically feasible and to the daily wear plus for facilitating the conversation peter thank you very much for talking to me today and for very much well your efforts on the research front you bet man good good to see you ciao everybody till next time [music]
