hello everyone and welcome we are sitting inside of the all-new mclaren arturo and this vehicle has a very interesting and unique electric motors that's one of the things i want to focus on mclaren says this is the first series production vehicle road vehicle that is using an axial flux motor so axial flex motors are nothing new it's very old technology but it's very rare for them to be used in production course there's only a few doing it today and the vast majority out there are using radial flux motors so what's the difference between a radio flux motor and an axial flux motor well i think the easiest way of thinking about it with a radio flux motor which again is the norm it's what most electric vehicles out there and combustion cars that are using a hybrid powertrain they're using these radio flux motors it's basically think of a cylinder within a cylinder so that outside cylinder is your stator and that is creating a rotating magnetic field that is rotating the inside cylinder which is your rotor so the rotors the rotating port stator stationary part with a axial flux motor instead of a cylinder inside of a cylinder you have basically a disc next to a disc so one disc is creating that rotating magnetic field and then the other disc is rotating with the rotor so what you actually have happening with mclaren's motor which you can take a look at is there are two rotors and there was one stator in the center so that stator in the center is creating that rotational magnetic field and then both rotors on the outside are forced to rotate so it's a different methodology of creating an electric motor then there are unique reasons for why you might want to choose it like this application of what we're sitting in right now so there's two real reasons why you might choose to use this style of motor the first being it has a great power and torque density so mclaren says this motor has a 33 better power density versus the electric motor used in the mclaren p1 so this is just a 34 pound motor it's a tiny little motor only weighs 34 pounds and yet it's producing 94 horsepower 166 pound-feet of torque so a really compact little power unit here the second reason why you might choose to use this style of motor is for the packaging reason so you can see looking at it it's kind of a pancake shape rather than you know a longer cylinder so there are specific scenarios and specific vehicles where that is advantageous for the overall packaging design so let's start off with why does this motor have a torque and power density improvement versus a radio flux motor so one of the advantages there's three real reasons for that torque density advantage the first one just being the size of the motor where do you have that moment arm occurring right so torque is simply force times a radius if you expand the radius of that rotor then you're acting torque as at a larger radius so you have more torque that's very easy to understand force times radius expand the radius the other real reason here is that your magnetic flux has a very simple short path so the magnetic flux being that force that you're creating that magnetic force that you're creating by having a current go around a copper winding it creates a magnet an electromagnet and so the path for that flux where the magnet wants to attract itself to this electromagnet that you've created it's very simple and it's very short and it's very direct in this axial flux style motor so because of that very direct very simple path you have a torque advantage you don't have to use as much iron to create the same force so you can pull some weight out of the motor and you can have this very small very dense good packaging or you know at the same weight you can create more torque right so you can pull weight out or you can create more torque it's kind of where you're playing with what is your goal for the motor so we have better leverage we have a better magnetic flux path and finally we have better windings so with a traditional radial style motor you have these copper windings that come out of the stator then they loop back and they go back in the stator and i want i don't want to say that these end windings are wasted material right like it has to be there you have to have that continuous loop it's like if you unplug you know a light switch you don't get power to the light switch but you need all of that cable to get power to a light no you know you can make a shorter path so those end windings that come out of the stator and then come back this is kind of wasted material where you're not creating that useful magnetic flux within the stator it's outside of it so with an axial flux motor all of those windings the entire winding the copper winding is within the stator creating that useful magnetic flux so it's easier to cool because it's not out there you know just doing its own thing where you can't really have good cooling for those windings and it is all contained within the stator it doesn't go outside of it and then loop back in so you have a more efficient use of your wiring with these axial flux motors so for those three reasons you get a better power and torque density now there's of course a downside here right so with these very large radius motors you have a lot of inertia as you put mass towards the outside further further away you know you have a lot of inertia in this motor so they tend to be lower revving motors in this case the engine reps up to 8 500 rpm there's a direct coupling with this electric motor with the clutch so the max rpm for the electric motor in this case is also 8 500 rpm whereas in you know electric car applications especially you know in racing things like that you can see electric up to 20 000 rpm where they have these really small very you know low inertia rotors that can spin up really fast so that leads us to the packaging reason for why it's done you know it's got this pancake shape and so why is that done here well if you look at the overall architecture of this vehicle that mclaren has designed they went from a v8 you know a four liter v8 and now it's running a three liter v6 so you've got a shorter engine and you want to include something between the engine and the transmission well that pancake style motor is a great way of doing it without adding much weight and it doesn't take up you know extra space so you've lost one of those cylinders so you have some extra space to work with and so when you put that pancake motor between that and the transmission overall with this vehicle versus say the 720s you actually have a shorter wheelbase so even though you're sticking a motor in there you actually do have a reduced wheelbase making this a smaller car and helping to pull out weight from the car so let's talk about this engine this is a clean sheet all new engine i mean pretty much the entire car is all new the engine the transmission carbon fiber monocoque the motor everything's pretty much new on this vehicle the engine is also all new so it is a 120 degree 3.0 liter twin turbo v6 your combined output with the electric motor 671 horsepower and 530 pound-feet of torque so what's interesting about this v6 why not 60 why not'0 why did they go with 120 and so with 16 you can kind of think about it you know you're going to have a high engine it's going to have a higher center of gravity if you go to that higher angle that 120 then you're lowering the center of gravity it does make the engine wider but why not go all the way to'0. well you still have to have manifolds underneath that engine so if they were to go to'0 and have these large intake manifolds underneath the engine well then that pushes the whole engine up and it kind of defeats the purpose of having that lower center of gravity right so in their case what they've done is they've gone with the 120 degree v and the intake manifolds fit perfectly above the bottom of the engine but still below those cylinder banks so the packaging if you look at it from the bottom it actually looks really cool how they've incorporated these large intake manifolds and yet you know it doesn't force the car to ride up any higher or force the engine to ride up higher within the car and so you've got the turbo's up top mounted within that b hot b super short distance that these exhaust setters are traveling to get to those turbos so you know the idea there being you just minimize the amount of delay that you have in spooling up those turbochargers it's a high boost engine so when you put your foot down you still do you know wait a little bit like until start getting into that boost but you know they're minimizing that path to make it as short as possible these are single scroll turbos and they are symmetrical so you know they're kind of spinning it opposite directions if you look at them from one side which is kind of neat you know it looks kind of cool and it means that your cylinder banks have you know the exact same scenario so there's no difference between you know the flow and how the flow exits for either cylinder back there since these are symmetrical another big change for this engine versus the four liter v8 is that instead of using you know iron sleeves within the cylinders they are now using a nicosil coating it's a low friction material allows for you to use you know larger bores you don't have these fat heavy iron sleeves and we're using aluminum black aluminum heads and aluminum pistons in this engine so right behind me we have a fuel tank on top of a battery pack behind that we have the engine and it's a bit flipped around from what you traditionally think the front of that engine close to me does not have timing chain it's on the other side so that you can make this passenger compartment you know a bit better and you can take some of that noise and put it further back you don't necessarily like listening timing chains that sort of thing so the larger part of the engine where you have those you know the timing chain controlling your camshafts is further back helping with packaging up here from that engine we go directly to the electric motor from that electric motor we go straight to the transmission so this vehicle can drive in purely electric mode up to about 11 miles so we go from that electric motor directly into a new eight-speed transmission so previously they were using seven speed transmissions now an eight-speed giving them closer key ratios kind of group it a little bit closer together and then have that eighth gear for highway cruising and also there is no reverse gear you're simply using the electric motor in reverse you pair with that same first gear i guess technically you could do like eight gears in reverse if you wanted but yeah you're just you know limiting the top speed in reverse and using that electric motor in first gear seeing back the vehicle up just by simply spinning the opposite direction the transmission is a dual clutch transmission that's kind of like a nested one clutch on top of the other clutch so you can keep again the packaging really short so you can shorten the wheelbase this does have a shorter wheelbase than the 720 as i mentioned you know using the transmission as much as you can and this is a shorter transmission than used in like the 720s for example dual clutch extremely quick shifts the only time you'll really notice say that there's significant delays is if you know you're in comfort mode like i am now it's in the wrong gear i put my foot down you wait a little bit and it finds the right gear and gets you going but if you know you're on a track or if you're actually spirit of driving you can get through these gears very quickly you can downshift very quickly it is a very fast reacting transmission so moving on to the battery this is using a 7.4 kilowatt hour battery again as i mentioned giving you 11 miles of range in electric only mode the european rating is 19 miles of range so it's probably going to be somewhere between those two numbers it's the same battery regardless of where you're buying this car and one of the interesting things about it is actually cooled you circuit for the hvac system so you have the hvac system is designed to not only handle cooling this cabin but also to handle cooling the battery so you've got that chiller where you can go within the battery cool down within the battery and make sure the temperature stay down for track use so we can maintain maximum performance on a track so neat that they're using you know the same hvac system you've got one condenser one compressor up it is used to cool both the cabin and the battery and it is you know sized so that you can do both of those simultaneously for whatever duration so from a performance target what they were trying to do with this battery is make sure that you could do 10 laps or 40 miles on the nardo handling circuit that's where they tested it without any degradation and performance so they want you to be able to do 10 laps and not notice anything with the battery right you're not being limited on power in any way with that battery it's able to maintain enough charge as you're going around the track and recharge itself as you're going around the track to make sure you can always deploy full power for 40 miles you know if you're obviously going in a straight line that doesn't work right but on a track where you're braking and things like that you can use that to regenerate energy so that was their performance benchmark to target and make sure you don't run out of you know that performance from the battery as you're driving now tires of course can go away within those 40 miles that's a different story now one of the things i really like about the fact that this is a plug-in hybrid is that you have multiple modes that you can choose from and so you can drive an electric only mode and unlike what some manufacturers do with electric only mode if you switch into electric only which we'll go ahead and do right here and i put my foot down it does not kick on the engine if i'm in the eb only mode and i floor it i get full power from the ev from the electric motor and that is it so i like that they do that some manufacturers will have it so that it always kicks the engine on in that scenario you have different modes here if you want that to happen so in ev mode it allows you put your foot down and you know it's not a very powerful motor so it's not like you're going to be driving it like this to have fun in your supercar you've got 94 horsepower again but it is cool and you can go up to about 80 85 miles an hour somewhere in that range in electric only without having the engine kick on and then i simply bump it over into comfort and then you can hear the engine kick on in comfort mode kind of balance between using the electric motor and using the engine if you go up into sport mode now the engine will always remain on and it makes sure that it has a certain level of reserve in that battery and then if you go into track mode it makes sure that it's always trying to fill the battery all the way up so it gives you a little indication of where your limit is for trying to charge that battery and in track mode it's always trying to charge it back to maximum so you can always have maximum power to put down now another really interesting thing about the car this is the first time mclaren is using an electronic limited slip diff so all the modern mclarens are using open differentials why well mclaren was very focused when they're building their cars on lap times and so their thought is maximize lap time at all costs right and with an open differential which is less weight and using brake torquing so you can use brakes in order to kind of mimic the effects of a limited slip differential they were able to get away with open differentials and so their thought was you know why would we put in this complex differential that adds weight adds complexity when we don't need it for lap times there's two real reasons for switching now weight has kind of come out of it complexity they've got a whole new clean sheet designed for transmission so this differential is housed entirely within that transmission so you choose you know at that point hey what diff do we really want to put in here they feel like the weight penalty isn't that bad now but also so in combination you know some people just want to do a little slide and not think about you know a one tire spinning up and again you don't have to have that happen with an open differential you can use brakes to make sure that both tires end up spinning and then you know you have that slide happen but it's of course easier if you just have a locking diff make sure that both of those two tires are forced rotated at the same speed and you get your nice slide in so this also has their variable drift control where you can kind of set the angle you want to allow the back to kick out at and so in combination with that electronic limited slip div if you want to do some sliding around this is the mclaren that's that's been designed for it not necessarily hey this is what's going to get you the best lap time yes limited slip differentials have their performance advantages but i wouldn't say they're absolutely necessary and i think previous but clearance kind of proved that really well so as mentioned all new carbon fiber monoclock new aluminum architecture that pulls out aluminum new electrical architecture that pulls out weight from the electrical system so overall this car weighs just 3 300 pounds about and that's considering you know the electric motor and the battery battery pack that's about 300 pounds the v6 engine is about 350 pounds you know that is about 110 pounds lighter than the v8 of course you've got the added weight from this electric system so really you're kind of focusing on hey if we're going to put a battery in this if we're going to put an electric motor in this and you know add all this additional weight we need to make sure we can pull out weight elsewhere and make that weight worth it and yeah overall 670 horsepower and you know 3 300 pound curb weight that's very good now even though they've gone over to this plug-in hybrid design here overall architecture of this vehicle they are still maintaining hydraulically assisted steering so mclaren is a big believer in hydraulic steering and when you drive their cars versus other supercars back to back you do feel that in the steering there is more feedback coming through this wheel and whether or not you think that's good or bad i think it's debatable but you get a lot of feel from the road coming through the steering wheel so there's certainly other approaches out there porsche has you know very good steering in my opinion but it's a vietnam as far as the feedback is concerned this you know you're going to feel everything as you're driving over the road so different choices if you like you know feeling everything through the steering wheel mclaren has a very specific you know taste towards that style of driving so the biggest hybrid style system would hear really real throttle response see and i just put back by that motor you immediately have all the torque from the electric motor then while that's happening you're giving the turbochargers time to spool up so you get that additional boost so as you put and then those turbos pull up and it just keeps going so it goes boom you kind of get a step at a certain amount of torque the turbos keep going and then that torque just built so it's really really experience you know you know it's one gear here putting your foot down and then having it build as those circles look which is very unlike a traditional turbo engine because traditional turbo engine you're just waiting for that boost to split up right you don't have that electric fill that helps you you know immediately get some acceleration while you're waiting so that's the big advantage and truthfully in daily driving scenarios now when you're on a track you know where you've got the engine up in high rpms and it's ready to get those turbos just like that in daily driving scenarios if you want torque immediately right like that's what electric cores are so good at so if you can take that advantage and bring it into something like this which makes it you know so much more responsive for daily driving scenarios have that immediate torque from the motor but then also you can take this thing out on the track thrash it keep those turbos pulled up and just have to roar from your engine you know you kind of get the best of both worlds from a performance standpoint any delay in a car whether it's braking or acceleration or steering any delay whatsoever whoever makes you feel disconnected so the more you can reduce delays which is what a hybrid system does the better the overall driving experience so it is a neat implementation of you know a new electric motor and this battery pack here with this new v6 engine to create this kind of cohesive unit that gives you you know driving joy thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
