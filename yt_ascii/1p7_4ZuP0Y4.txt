this past week has been wild there have been so many new announcements coming out and i'm really excited to catch you all up with it i mean from meta releasing or sharing about their new ai glasses with rayban how first of all we'll dive into this in a second but how is it going to be controlled people recording you you can now record with these glasses you're never going to know if you're being recorded we'll get into that in a sec here and another one i want to share with you is about humane ai pin it made its debut on the runway in paris fashion of course and this company fun fact was founded by someone who used to work at open ai can see there's competition there also two amazon just invested billions billions with a be of dollars into this company as they are working on a new model for ai which they are saying is going to be 10 times more powerful than anything that exists today i'm telling you we got to dive into [music] this [music] all right you know i got to give you the whole spiel before we get into it make sure to hit that subscribe button for more tech coding career related topics leave in the comments any other videos you want me to create let me know if you are enjoying these tech news it seems like you are but give me feedback let me know what you like about them what you don't like okay enough of me talking well i'm going to talk more but let's get into the tech news meta recently had their event and there was a ton of different innovators creators seite individuals who attended one of the biggest announcements as i mentioned earlier on was about the collaboration between rayban and meta now these glasses are not the first of their kind we've seen many variations of them even from meta and rayban this is not the first time something like this is being released it is more so the improvements which they are saying improvements on audio and cameras they also are saying there is 150 different custom frames and lens combinations so they're lighter and more comfortable now at first i've seen some videos circulating online of people who have gotten their hands on these i'm like that's really cool you can create a lot of interesting content but is that line gone where there's anything private nowadays and my mind automatically goes to how these could be used to record people without consent what if you didn't know about these glasses or you didn't know or recognize that there was a camera in there that could cause a lot of issues i'm curious to hear your thoughts on this is this something that you would get i mean the flip side is this you know i i could see these being really helpful for a variety of reasons kind of i don't know i need to get your thoughts on this all right we are moving on to humane the new ai pin which made its debut on none other than the naomi campbell during paris fashion week and earlier in this video i shared with you how one of the founders used to work at open ai even to make it more intertwined if you will is one of the main backers for humane is none other than the sam alman i mean no surprise here it's all very closely intertwined so this pin can sit on your jacket we've also seen photos of it sitting on your your pants and the whole thing around it is it's this piece of hardware that you don't need to answer you don't need to physically interact with so it is sitting on you but it will then shine if someone is calling you or texting you and you can use your hand to actually read or interact with it actually let's insert here a little clip of the founder of humane and giving a little demo of what it's capable the legendary tech journalist walt mber wrote in his final column that he felt that soon one day technology would become invisible and that the computer would disappear and we agree sorry this is my wife i'm going to have to get this hello hey babe hey bethany how's it going good are you a ted yeah i'm on the red circle right now actually oh great good luck and don't forget to mention me i won't babe thank you love you love you too bye bye it's going to get different in a minute so there's been no announcements as to when this is being released to the public but i do expect it actually to be pretty soon i've seen this in the works for i believe it was last year last year it feels like last year that i first heard about it so it's been in the works for a while now i'm sure many years prior and they aren't saying when it's going to be released but they do say that privacy for them comes first so one of the things that i thought of is okay so this device is going to always be listening to me it's kind of like a wearable device so it's even more it feels more invasive than say like alexa or any of these other smart speakers so they go on to say that there are certain words that you can ed to ensure it is not always listening you can turn it off essentially by saying words such as a no wake word so you can pick what that is and their vision is building products which place trust at the center so they are really trying or they're saying they're really trying to put trust first and i'm really curious to see how they are able to do that with a device that needs to be listening to you it's very curious would you get one of these i'm also wondering if these have the power to replace iphones i really do think they might but curious to hear if you disagree with me all right tesla released their new model their cheaper or cheapest actually model this actually didn't really make big news and i'm curious if it's because it literally just was announced or if no one cares anymore but they released their new electric suv that doesn't necessarily need to break your bank or that's what they say anyway so here is the cost of this so they are saying the starting price for the rwd model y is $443,000 which is 3,700 less than the awd model that was recently discontinued they say or went away was it discontinued i think it was also too the good news is though it does qualify for the federal ev tax credit i'm canadian i don't know these tax credits but apparently you get one for $7500 if you purchase this ev electric vehicle i don't know it doesn't really do it for me i'm kind of i'm all about the idea behind electric of course but tesla just kind of leaves me with this like doesn't excite me very much i'm curious though for any tesla owners out there am i missing something next vehicle should i switch to tesla let me know all right the last thing i want to touch on is more of an interesting thing that i've been reading a lot about not necessarily hot in the news right now but i think something that you'll find very interesting which is around quantum computing so we've seen quantum computing the topic of it the subject of it in the news a lot lately because we are making great leaps and balance with it which is really exciting i mean it still takes me a minute to fully comprehend that quantum to to be able to this like combust my brain i'm used to computers being able to do zero or one true or false but having this quantum computer being able to have multiple scenarios at once is really i don't know it's mind-blowing maybe it's just me but i think it's really cool but the downside or the flip side to that is around encryption so i was reading a lot about this recently here on forbes actually it says quantum computers could make today's encryption defense less and honestly this could be done in a matter of seconds so let's go into it a little bit here what they are saying and this isn't just from forbes this is just research i'm just reading this specific article is that because encryption relies on complex mathematical problems that take an immense amount of time for traditional computers to be able to solve i mean almost impossible it's not but it just feels that way it takes so long when you're able to use something like quantum computing this could break encryption in a matter of minutes they are saying so now there is the flip side which is great which means they are working on putting up guard rails for these quantum computers to not be able to do that but i've just really gone down this rabbit hole when it comes to quantum computing it's really fascinating to me i know there's a ton different more work that needs to be done around quantum computing we aren't where we are you know but i do think there's going to be a boom just like there was with ai i think there's going to be one around quantum computers and i just really hope it's in the near future kind of maybe i shouldn't be hoping that but it just seems it's very fascinating to me curious to hear if you have done any reading up on quantum computing your thoughts on it i'm really geeking out about this right now so if you have leave in the comments and let's have a full-on conversation about it all right that is it for this week's tech news it was kind of a lighter week for the number of things that have happened but the things that did happen made a big impact make sure to leave in the comments your thoughts feedback questions on anything we covered today and i'll see you very soon hit that subscribe button so i will see you really soon bye [music] everyone down
