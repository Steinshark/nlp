- i'm about to ask
somebody one of the most ridiculous questions ever. would he rather have $100,000 or one of the most rarest
diamonds on the planet. but the $100,000 on this
cheque will be covered up. let's see what he picks. you are about to make one of
the most important decisions of your entire life. - it's true. - john, would you rather have this $38,000 diamond ring, dead serious. or this mystery cheque that you can't know what's written on it. - come on. (sighing) - $38,000 ring or what's behind this tape on this mystery cheque. - i gotta go with the ring, dude. - you're going with the ring? - i gotta go with the ring
cause that's guaranteed, dude. - you're going with the ring? congratulations. you just made 38 grand. - whoa. - no. like this is like, actually real? - it is real. i promise. i wanna show you what you could have had. - oh. - if you would've picked the cheque, you would've got $100,000. but all you gotta is, what's $38,000? - darn it.
- that's like nothing. - let's head to the next bit. - joe, if you guess how many
jelly beans are in this jar, i will give you $1 million. (laughing) - yeah. - it's so epic, i bought smoke machines. - i can't... - no, you cannot take the lid off. $1 million is a lot of money.
- it is, it is a lot of money. - i can't let you collect intel. 10, 9- - wait, wait, wait! can i call
in, can i call in like help? - 6, 5...
- can i facetime somebody. - 5, 4, 3... - uh, 72,368. - 72,368. 68. you know if it ended in
68, we'd put another one so it ended in 69.
- you would do me that dirty? - this determines if
you make $1 million show and if my mom hates me. - ah! (all groaning) i was so way off. - 8,171 was the guess. - you almost got one of the numbers. - what if i would've guessed it was jimmy? - you probably would've won. - no, he wouldn't have. (all laughing) - this is andre. here's some solo cups.
i want you to lay 'em. (money tinging) you just made $5. (chuckling) every single red solo cup you lay, i will give you a dollar. if you cover the entire floor,
you can start stacking them. you have the entire room and unlimited cups and
you have the whole day. andre, i'm gonna leave
you to go do your thing. we're gonna go give away more money. - peace out.
- all right. see you in a bit. (chuckling) - there's no way that this
is going to be this easy. - this is going to be
one of my favorite bits. seriously, this can
determine whether or not you win 10 grand. pick a number between one and 20. - 15. - you picked 15, which
means you get 1-5 swings of this pickax now, you might be wondering, what do you swing the pickax at? - big reveal. - [mrbeast] it's a
briefcase covered in ice. we literally took a
briefcase full of 10 grand, put it in water and froze it. - what? - and you have 15 swings
to get to the briefcase. (ice smashing) oh. all right. i think
you pierced the suitcase. - [grant] i did, i did.
there's a hole in it. - give it your second swing. - all right. (ice smashing) (all cheering) (rock music) oh, no. oh, no. i'm still alive somehow. (buzzer) - oh, picked it. i picked it. - well, thanks for coming out. - [man] yeah, man. - since grant couldn't break
into the giant cube of ice, we have another contestant. felix, come on in. - [man] yeah, felix. (guys cheering) - yeah, felix. - if you can break the
briefcase out of the ice, you get to keep the 10
grand and you get 10 swings. - [man] i'm gonna help
you real quick, felix. (guy farting) there you go.
- thank you. (all cheering) (ice smashing) (all cheering) - well, you can now
carry it home with him. (chuckling) - it's still covered in
ice, but it's not dangling. if you can carry it out, i'll
let you keep the 10 grand. eventually the ice will melt.
- [felix] i got it. i got it. - [man] oh, cheating! - [felix] bye. thank you. next bit. (upbeat music) we made a wall of basketball goals. and i have a ton of cool prizes. for every shot the contestants
make, they get an item. they can shoot as many times as they want but if they miss, they
lose all their items. and this challenge is a little different. we have brothers competing this time. - wait, is it a competition? - actually, you're working together. - oh.
- oh. - which one of you wants to shoot first? - me. - which means he should
shoot first. here you go. (slapping leg) - oh. - feel free to shoot whenever. only 20, 30, $40,000 in
prizes are on the line. - yeah.
- [mrbeast] it's fine. oh... (all cheering) all right, he made the shot which means you get a claim
a prize from this shelf. so you're choosing the macbook pro. if you miss, he loses his mac
and the challenge is over. (suspenseful music) oh! (boys cheering) so you want an oculus rift? - i, i guess. - you can risk your macbook pro and his oculus or you could end it now. - okay. (all laughing) - don't mess up. (buzzer) - no! (emotional music) - [mrbeast] well... - let me show you how easy it is. (pinging) three prizes. you could have done that. - that's more prizes in one go. - now we're going to do the
same thing but with chandler. win as much as you want. - let's go! airpods. - airpods?
- airpods. - [mrbeast] do you wanna risk them? - yes. (all cheering) let me get the beats too.
- yeah! hey! oh... - switch.
- yeah. woo! - ipad.
- woo! - okay. - i don't miss. theragun. - chandler, you're risking a lot of stuff. - [chandler] i don't miss. - he don't miss. - let me get whatever that is.
- yeah. (guys cheering) - macbook, oculus. - woo.
- okay. yeah!
- woo. (buzzer) (rock music) (guys laughing) - [chandler] it didn't hit the ground. - chandler, you had all this cool stuff but now who do you think
would win in a race? carl or chris? i'll give you $10,000 if
you pick the right winner. and if you pick the loser, you get $0. - i pick this guy.
- oh. - head on down to the finish line. we're gonna have them race. let's see if you win 10 mcflurries. - i feel like such a jerk if i win. - why? because then you won't get $10,000? - yeah, it'll just get
ripped out of his hand. - well, how about this, carl? if you win, i'll give you $5,000. - oh, i don't mind taking
money from him then. - so i get to help somebody win money and take money away from carl? - yes, chris.
- yes, i'm in. - i didn't tell you
this, but if carl wins, i'm gonna give him five grand. - if carl... why'd you tell me that? - 3, 2, 1 go. all right, they're off. they're off. oh, chris looks like he's in the lead. - let's go, chris! chris! - go carl.
- chris! - oh my god, carl. - let's go! let's go! let's go. (indistinct chattering) - why is he so strong? yo, you get a hug too, buddy. come on, man. jump up here. come on, man.
- okay. - come on, bro. come on, bro.
- you're really tall. - oh my gosh, andre. holy crap. this is crazy. look how many cups he's laid. roughly though, how many cups
do you think you've laid? - 1000, 1500. i don't know. - you still have plenty
of time to lay cups. make sure you guys watch to the end so you see how much money he made and let's go give away more money. i have a blue bucket, a red
bucket and a yellow bucket. one bucket is full of mustard. - oh, no. - one bucket is full of slime. - oh my god. - and one bucket is full
to the brim of money. - hey, can i get that one? - isaiah, i'm gonna let you pick. who do you think should be
under the yellow bucket? - i feel that chris should
be under the yellow bucket. - all right.
- okay. - who should be under the red bucket? you or carl? - it's gonna be red for carl. - carl, go under the red bucket. - oh yeah. - are you sure isaiah, that
this isn't mustard or slime? - no, this is the money bucket. - chris, what do you think
is in this yellow bucket? - 10 grand might be coming my way. - yeah for sure. i'm gonna back up. - oh, so i can be safe. - chris, congratulations
on winning $10,000. (all laughing) oh, i lied about the
$10,000. it was mustard. - why is it spicy? - well i couldn't make it easy. (all laughing) - carl buddy, it is now your turn. what do you think is in this bucket? - i really think it's slime now. - why?
- oh, because i'm next. and i feel like you wouldn't
do the money in the middle because we have a bunch
of mustard on the ground. - yeah! (all laughing) - at least the slime was warm. - which means, isaiah, you won $10,000. - what? - i'm just gonna get...
- group hug. (guys shrieking) - it only got on isaiah. all right. (upbeat music) this is our first ever
relationship challenge on the mrbeast channel. - i thought we were the
first relationship challenge. - this is matt. this is elizabeth. would you say you guys
know each other very well? - oh definitely.
- absolutely. - how long have you been together? - two years and three months. - okay. i'm gonna split you two up and put your relationship to the test. so i'm gonna ask each of you questions and if you give the same answer, i'm gonna give you a mystery prize. - okay.
- wow. - [mrbeast] but, i'm gonna
split you up to make it harder. now that you two are separated, we can get into the fun stuff.
so i hear you want to take it to the next level with your girlfriend. - i was planning on
proposing earlier this year before i lost my job. and we're just not really
sure how to move forward. - if you and elizabeth
give the exact same answers to all questions, i'll give you $15,000 to put towards your wedding. - wow. that would be life changing. - let's begin. carl, ask the first question. - where was your guys first date? - town common. - okay.
- town common. you stay here. we're gonna go see if she
gives the same answer. and of course we're not gonna
tell her what the prize is. - where was your first date with him? - at town commons. - really?
- all right. all right. you both gave the same answer for the first question. we'll be right back. she gave the same answer. - figured she would. - it's almost like you both
went on the same first date. chris, i'm gonna take his
$15,000 for his wedding and put it in your hands. - what is your significant
other's middle name? - cerelle. - cerelle, okay. - what's your middle name? - cerelle. - that's correct.
- he said the same thing. how serious are you
about proposing to her? - i will do it right now. - okay, we talked a little bit off camera and he was telling me that he wanted to propose to her on camera. and i just wanna let you
know, it's 100% your decision. do you want to? - absolutely. - well then if that's the case, the final question is you
asking her, "will you marry me?" - okay. - before we do it, can
you show us the ring? - yeah. - oh my gosh.
- ooh. - [carl] oh my gosh. - this is going to be the final question for the mystery prize. this is for all the marbles,
all the enchiladas, all the... - marbles again. - now turn around and face each other. (elizabeth crying) i didn't think this through too well. (nervous chuckling) oh. - elizabeth, will you marry me? (pinging) (guys cheering) - oh my god. - the mystery prize was actually $15,000 towards your wedding. - wow.
- oh wow. thank you. (guys cheering) - hug, you guys- (guys cheering) - can have pizza at the reception. (lively music) - we should all hug. - yeah, why don't you
guys hug me like that. - you guys wanna get married? (cups popping) (cups falling) - [andre] no! (theatrically crying) - the next giveaway is two
cars and this one is real but this car right here
is made outta ramen. i'm giving you the option
to pick which car you want. - i see rims. that looks disconjumbled a little bit. - disconjumbled? - you're picking this car? - okay. reveal the car she could have had. - all right. - a mini coop. - please reveal to her the car she chose. - all right, you ready? (guys laughing) - so really did that. - chandler, i'm gonna let you take over. i got, i got a phone call i gotta take - [woman] gorgeous. (cups popping) - andre, oh my gosh. this looks insane. - [andre] wild, huh? - [mrbeast] look at this.
they just never end. you laid these all by yourself? - [andre] i did it all by my lonesome. very, very solo. - so genuinely, how many
cups do you think you laid? - um, i could say about 3,500, 36. - well, according to
my people that counted all the cups that entered
this room, you laid 4,700. so we're gonna round up to 5,000. - i like that number. thank you very much. - and now that you made all that money. - yeah.
