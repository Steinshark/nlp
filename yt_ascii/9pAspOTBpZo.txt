hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be talking about why companies like chevy and dodge are still making push rod engines and you know these engines tend to get a lot of flack for kind of being outdated but there are actually some really nice advantages to them so we're going to get into five of those different advantages looking at a disassembled single cylinder pushrod engine as well as looking at a 3d printed chevy ls3 v8 pushrod engine okay so the first advantage i want to talk about is low end torque because pushrod engines tend to produce good low end torque and really all of this comes down to airflow so pushrod engines are using just two valves per cylinder that's the case for the majority of them and while this does create a challenge for higher rpm at low rpm it improves your air velocity so because the air flow is more restricted at low rpm where that's not as big of a concern it speeds up the flow of the intake air now when you increase the velocity of the intake air that means the air and fuel tend to mix better and as a result you have better combustion and you produce more torque the next advantage i want to talk about is just the simplicity of the engine and it's not always true that something that is simple will be reliable or something that is complex will be unreliable but generally speaking if you can achieve the same solution with a more simple design it's advantageous from a reliability standpoint okay so looking at the engine here you can see there's just a single camshaft and it's a very short distance from what's driving it the crankshaft so you could have a geared relationship you could have a belt or chain but it doesn't have to travel very far to rotate that camshaft versus if you're using a dual overhead cam solution on a v8 engine now you've got two camshafts above this cylinder head two camshafts in this cylinder head so four total and that means four drive gears so two drive gears on each end and it requires you using two separate chains so one chain for this cylinder head and one chain for this cylinder head so you can see that this is a much simpler solution than a dual overhead cam head on a v8 engine now the camshaft design leads us to our next two advantages which are both size and weight so as you can imagine just using this single camshaft down low in the center of the v rather than up here imagine having two of these camshafts now placed at the top of the cylinder head so this cylinder head is significantly smaller than on a dual overhead cam v8 engine and as a result not only is this engine not as wide as a dual overhead cam engine but it's also not as tall now having an engine that's generally more narrow and shorter than dual overhead cam engines gives you more freedom within your engine bay and so whether that's improving the suspension design with more room or pushing the engine further back in the engine bay because there's the space to do it to get that center of gravity towards the center of the car there are advantages of having this engine smaller in size now the smaller size of these pushrod engines often means that they weigh less than a similar displacement dual overhead can b8 engine not always the case but usually these are on the lighter end and also it's important where that weight is so you've got the camshaft down low you don't have the big dual overhead cams up on top so the center of gravity of the engine is lower and also because the engine is shorter in overall height it means you can place it lower within the car so you can get the center of gravity of the engine relative to the car much lower with a push rod design than using a dual overhead cam design and finally our fifth advantage of these push rod engines is cost and so in an interview in 2004 between car and driver and gm's chief engineer for the small block engines the engineer estimated that their engines are about 400 less per engine versus a dual overhead cam design and 400 may not seem like a massive amount but when you start multiplying that across tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of engines you start to realize how much money can be saved by using a simple design like this ultimately the advantages of this engine its low end torque its simplicity its size and weight and of course its cost help keep it alive in today's cars so if you enjoyed this video i will include links to some other videos that you may find interesting and if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below thanks for watching
