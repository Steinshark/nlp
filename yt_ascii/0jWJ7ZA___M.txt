ladies and gentlemen i have some very upsetting news in the world of chess the mittens chess bot is gone and this video will be a ceremony of its existence will be a celebration of all the incredible memories that we had playing against this fuzzy little demon which tortured us for the entire month of january mittens was single-handedly responsible for bringing in millions of views not just for chess creators like myself but also for chess in general a lot of people did get into the 64 squares because of mittens including some of you watching this right now so in this video i will share with you the final epic battle that mittens played and that was against the megan bot the megan bot was dedicated to that movie that came out it was like an ai and megan went through all the bots of cats and then played against mittens which was the final boss of the felines and that's it and this is how we will say goodbye to one of our most cherished chess memories and hopefully mittens returns for a second season unlike the queen's gambit terrific let's jump into the games oh friendly reminder all my courses 50 off and we just launched chesley plus link is in the description amazing training games for you to try out and take your chest to the next level e4 so they played a 150 game match i will not be showing you all 150 games but like always i will take you through a recap of some of the most exciting games the storyline of the match and yeah this was the final bot battle you know what i mean this was really really tremendous stuff and this is how we will say goodbye to mittens and now there are new chess bots let me know if you want me to play the new chess bots or if you're over a chess bot so match began with a nice little carrow cam all right megan played the advanced variation mittens played the bishop f5 variation and megan played g4 with knight c3 this is known as the should of variation of the karo khan trying to stop black from playing the bishop here and then chasing the bishop with h4 knight f4 and so on black responds in a very kind of chill way which is just knight e7 h4 h5 oh sorry sorry not h4 f4 h5 more often than not the move h4 is played in this position and then the machine will oftentimes put the knight on f4 anyway black often times will even sacrifice this pawn and it's just a very complicated position overall but we have f4 we have h5 we have f5 sacrificing a pawn and now locking the bishop behind its own pawn so megan very aggressive early not wanting to get overwhelmed mitten strikes back in the center develops its knight develops its queen and white castles and castling here is a completely insane move because mittens plays h4 which does two things prevents anything from going to g3 but also opens the door for the bishop which then opens the door for the knight which then opens the door for this bishop all right but also on the next move mittens plays c4 c4 is basically an analogy for you know ufc octagon fighters you can talk all the trash that you want but when the cage shuts you are locked in there with one other person and wait till they get their hands on you alright c4 now b5 now b4 takes takes and the attack has arrived all right megan has not been successful in thwarting this this is not mate but no worries mate is coming now i would love to play e6 here as a human being alright break open the center with the intention of getting in here with the queen causing some problems that's a decent move but the computer is not afraid of it so instead the computer plays defense black brings the rook now rook c8 looks extremely stupid seems much more normal to go rook b8 but then you would actually walk directly into this so that is why rook c8 gets played here comes the bishop here comes the knight and notice how megan just runs the king back to the center and it looks like you know white's got a really solid wall of pawns here but in this position mitten sacrifices the night with check knight takes c2 forcing the king to capture the knight and here comes another night and here comes another night check and here comes a queen check and here comes the bishop check absolutely ravaging the white king knight c3 and now super chill queen b3 because now this pawn falls now the queen just drops back like nothing like absolutely nothing relaxing now we take the knight and i got news for you you can't take back not because i'm gonna go here no no no no no no no but because i'm gonna check you and get the king away and then i'll take the rook and then i will demolish you so what i love about bot games is they never resign they like always continue fighting so the game actually was kind of complicated like i think most beginners here would still find a way to lose with black because i don't know they play f6 and then take and then take and open up their king and you know get mated like it really like these games we take for granted just how good bots are and most of these engine games do make it to an end game and mittens use that b-pawn and just kept walloping i mean it just kept going knight takes d4 now was a fork and when all was said and done it took the bishop and it's up at night so we can just observe how a bot wins an end game it takes the remainder of the pawns it's not afraid of any exchanges there we go and rookie eight and queen and it's kind of bm now you may ask yourself why did the bot sacrifice the knight oh because it has a sense of humor yeah these bots actually throw a little bit back and forth to each other to give the other side hope it's actually the funniest thing ever like these bots try to like not end the game completely immediately and now we have you know the king is going to arrive and yeah takes queen game ends a few moves later mittens got off to a good start but then megan was going crazy mode demon mode goblin mode megan started running away with some of these games megan here with the black pieces plays a nimso indian puts the knight in the center all right saxophone first of all you'll notice megan just sacked upon for nothing now puts the knight in the center and now starts throwing its king pawn forward all right so it just plays g5 why does like borderline winning according to stockfish but look at this position for black the cannons in the center the pressure on the white position the more stockfish thought about this the more it was like you know what i'm not sure that min's actually has a good position oh you're gonna castle oh that's adorable c5 a6 b5 exploding the queen side oh we're getting some deja vu here as megan is looking to strike back all right knight d7 now the knight ramps around the night just went from f6 to b6 saying hello to the queen side takes takes unpinning but the pawns are falling apart we trade rooks queen c3 knight takes pawn takes all right material is equal black still has some very annoying questions to ask of mitten's king rook c1 queen b5 and black sacrifices the a pawn to open up the king completely now stockfish evaluates this is equal as a balanced game and a balanced game it is but in a balanced game you can make mistakes alright and after locking down the queen side megan started firing on the queen on the king side too what is megan doing oh my god bishop back to g6 a lot of questions are being asked of the white position can you can we just do an instant replay look at this rook mittens completely malfunctions here just starts moving its rook back and forth because it literally can't do anything it can't move any pieces all of its pieces are tied together and under fire rook h1 rook c1 rook h1 and finally mittens like i gotta do something takes rook b1 rook b7 bishop c8 hitting the rook and defending the pawn this is ridiculous queen f5 rook h3 and suddenly suddenly black started taking over the game rook h2 queen f6 blocking all the threats and just like always engines will send it to an end game just like magnus carlsen and this is all you need to win you need one outside pawn supported from far away by a bishop and that pawn is going to go and you just can't stop it you just can't stop the pawn you're gonna be down two pawns now bishop comes right back and why does look at look at what mittens was reduced to in this game all the pieces in the corner and megan marches for i told you by the way there look at this white is trying to stalemate themselves rook d that's a drop that's still me the knight can't move and the kid can't move look at this i'm telling you these bots are trolling rook h1 is defended by the bishop check and finally rookie won and just rook d3 king d6 and how disgusting is this megan doesn't even queen megan doesn't even make a queen it just goes for mate oh my goodness and it was all tied up and throughout this match megan was pulling ahead and it was quite clear that that megan was was probably going to win this match it seemed like megan was finally going to be the one to eradicate mittens from existence and you know it was a little bit conflicting because mittens was our kind of final boss and it was weird to have megan come along and and trounce it megan was super aggressive with his king's indian play queen f6 all right firing away with moves like h5 and this was a this was a fight to the death this third game and it was more of the same i mean it was megan just completely paralyzing mittens look at this look at this attack from black queen f6 g4 just marching all the pieces onto one onto white's king side rook a2 look at this attacking from both sides this is nuts i mean bot games are completely ridiculous but anyway this whole queen side is just disintegrated all of this is what it's reduced to white is trying to make three queens bishop d1 knight h5 c6 there we go we take on h6 we take on g3 and when it's all said and done it's black with three powerhouse pieces all staring and ready to go in some capacity toward the white bishop h3 oh my goodness if you take the bishop you just can't stop me you can't stop the plethora of maids bishop f3 stops this rook cc2 you can't stop me i got 19 points of ammunition pointed at your king it's never gonna work so bishop f3 rook cc2 and black still says good luck bishop takes g2 a brilliancy from megan sacrificing the bishop and now rookie 2 and all of white's pieces are reduced to ashes bot doesn't even take the bot doesn't even it doesn't even take the free night because this and this is on the way and black's king is safe queen b3 rook f2 rook b2 and mittens had to sacrifice its queen and play desperate defense but it's not good enough black now hunts all the pawns down and that's it you just can't beat a queen with a knight in a bishop it's not gonna work all your pieces are lost and a brutal conclusion to this game megan was pounding all right was pounding the kitty throughout this match i mean it was oh it was brutal i mean it didn't really matter e4 e5 in this game this was probably the most ridiculous beatdown of the entire match this is a kozio rue lopez it's anything but cozy oh though d4 damn rap god gotham tay d4 and mittens attacked the bishop this is why bot games are completely ridiculous mittens attacks the bishop on b5 and white just goes here white gives away the bishop for nothing now sacrifices the night also it loses a bishop in a night but it gets two pawns and it gets an attack on the queen and it gets its capture of a third pawn and it gets a capture of a fourth pawn and the black king is stranded in the center the point is i can get your rook and i will get the rook in the future but black cannot castle black cannot castle that's the most important thing i get you a rook it's gonna take you a little time to get the rook but most importantly i have more pawns and your king is in the center instant replay real quick all right one time for the one time knight d5 the point was that after this this would be a problem for black so we have ab5 and megan gives up like the house but gets it all back and this was a vicious brutal beatdown all right it this was if your kids are watching you gotta tell them violence is not the answer all right unless it is queen h5 check queen h7 knight g6 mittens has one pawn left 22nd move move folks you get eight pawns to start the game how do you lose seven of them by move 20. this is the only pawn remaining bishop g8 queen back to h3 that is a sacrifice of a knight but rook d1 that's mate megan is giving up all of its pieces to mate black this is unbelievable and this just continued i mean the king hunt all right queen h3 back white is up six pawns six queen e4 five but it doesn't matter because the attack is so strong you're going for that b7 pawn now and the king is still being hunted rook takes knight takes stripping black down of the last bit but what what is this it's night night bishop which is nine for rook and five which is ten so white is up one point queen g4 queen f4 b3 g4 counter attack on the rook the rook slides out of the way rook c1 okay black has given up a knight because there was no way to deal with the pressure and here come white's pawns here come white's pawns here come white's pawns and the rook in the corner and the the pawns just keep going pawns just keep going trading rook c5 it's just a matter of time folks until that b7 pawn also falls black is going to be unable to defend the position any longer rook c1 back rook c7 check rook d7 but instead white goes for the glory white doesn't go for the pawn king g5 f4 and slowly look at i mean once again if you take it's a draw don't blunder a stalemate king f5 and that pawn may fall and fall it does after 72 moves r.i.p to the b-pawn white advances white knows how to checkmate with a king in a rook trolls a little bit but we get down to rook h8 and it was looking like this was the end of it but if you had the patience to survive 15 minutes it all started turning around something roared inside the kitty and it went from being a little orange tabby cat to a lion mittens was not to be denied e4 a sicilian defense the this was part of the last 10 or 15 games that they played this was an absolute barn burner of a sicilian this is a paulson khan sicilian defense bishop e3 black is going for a hedgehog structure with everything on the third rank f4 take take and as you see b6 now the way you take down a hedgehog structure where everything is like this is you gotta attack f5 is the thematic way to play because if black ever does this what you do is you come back that square is yours forever and the attack will rage forward but bishop d7 rook c1 b3 a4 now black finally played this move and that was the last move that megan played in this game because the rest of this game was mittens you see one two three four five six seven all pawns on light squares to counteract this bishop and white doesn't have a light squared bishop so white fills that gap with light squared pawns completely shutting down black look at this position mittens becomes a snake in this position restricting black's oxygen completely i don't have a light squared bishop so you're a light square bishop literally will never be able to breathe and when the center is this closed then i have such a space advantage you can either convert it by trying to win material or you can convert it by getting to the king because black is unable to bring help and that is exactly what happens in this game knight h5 queen goes to g4 take take h4 i am the one who knocks queen c7 c5 sacrificing the pawn c5 is a brilliant move booking to create counter play against the king of king it says choke on this fishbone you have to take my pawn because if you don't i will march even further and when you do take you will no longer be able to breathe you can ignore me i'm still gonna take bishop e8 g6 suffocating dc f6 bursting into the position take stakes queen of seven and the hunt continues but now it's all over i'm up at night i'm up at night you would beat megan in this position too queen h6 knight e6 you can't take that's mate come back grab the rook and from here it's just a matter of technique as mittens slowly marches forward wins the queen is going to win the rook but just delivers made in the center of the board and probably the most ridiculous game of this entire why is megan isle of man in whatever you know what it does whatever the most disgusting game of this entire match was this one this was the final game that they played the final game this was one of the most disrespectful games i have like the conclusion of this game heinous disgusting oh my god it was so bad let's watch d4 knight f6 a locked center this is known as the czech benoni not to be confused with the checkmate benoni yeah you just forget that ever happened e4 and black plays a very locked structure right so we have knight g3 developing f4 now from the opening megan is better megan is better because the check benoni is garbage this is under fire white is always threatening with e5 h4h5 stuff queen d2 rookie one all black really has here is queen side counter play or if white messes up marching forward bishop d4 check b6 but the position is looking absolutely stunning for black who all they can do is just play like this just put the hands up and try not to get hit bishop back to e5 rook f1 bishop d4 and now a4 all right mittens kind of locks the position but megan takes too long and suddenly mittens plays b5 and generally in these positions if black can start doing something on the queen side they're going to have success b4 all right now a few moves later mittens plays g4 black locks at g5 now mitten says this is my final form h5 i am attacking you on both sides of the board all right queen g2 i slide my king out of the way you can take and go from my palms over there queen d8 my queen is going to come help and also attack your king queen c8 targeting your pawn and also targeting these pawns c5 but that's not the same pawn sacrifice you can give me the pawn but i'm sliding out of the way and hello i have a two on one so now mittens uses the a pawn as a decoy just saying hello to the black position to the white position hi you gotta deal with my pawn someone's gotta go monitor that pawn like this and the second that you do that in this position of course folks it would not be a gotham video an iconic send-off video a ceremonial video a celebratory video of the life of the mittens bots without in its final game it's sacrificing look rook takes c4 and the point is that black now has a friend the b-pawn and the a pawn team up to create problems for the white position but age going to decide over there h takes g4 back and in this position mittens plays an aggressive move with its king opening up the h file for the rook it's an avalanche it's an avalanche from two sides you're completely surrounded rook takes a2 hits the queen bishop takes bishop takes d4 sacrificing the queen for a check for a check and for a rook and the position became this mittens has three pieces for the queen this game went on for 100 more moves as black created an impenetrable fortress with its pieces none of the pawns can move forward the king is safe because this king can't get in these pieces all defend each other and the sea pawn goes forward this is completely insane i have never seen something like this and mittens slowly slowly maneuvered and maneuvered and in the web of complications megan was unable to deal with the rerouting of the black pieces you see this is only a draw because white can't win but this is absolutely winnable for black because black has three pieces that can do something including the pawn so that's four pieces and it took many many moves of maneuvering but slowly black found their way forward knight c5 and suddenly the pawn fell and suddenly the other night went forward and suddenly the king is going to come forward as well knight f3 knight h4 dancing among the white position slowly slowly uh-oh oh it's down to one pawn for megan's megan's plural mittens and megan's look at this this is completely this is mind-bending stuff look at this fortress and now white has to deal with two past pawns and that's all it takes and folks remember when i told you that the conclusion of this game was absolutely ridiculous it was the most disrespectful conclusion i have ever seen because in this position black marched forward with the pawns and the king the king became an aggressor look at this wall of pieces protecting the black king the king walks forward the pawn walks forward as well black makes a queen it's over but black doesn't just make a queen mittens ends up making a second one like this and it doesn't even take the queen it could have taken the queen made another one and one to disrespect megan in the most extreme way mittens created a second queen and refused to take the it had made into any move is made into it refused to take the queen it's respectful it left megan with a queen on the board and delivered a mate without taking the queen oh my god maintenance won the final bot match 81 and a half to 68 and a half mittens did not lose in something like the last 20 games and it went out into the night into the dust disintegrating like at the end of the avengers movie with queen b5 two queen checkmate leaving megan with a queen to its grave and that folks concludes the incredible journey of megan and mittens on chess.com what a time january 2023 was really quite a time if you manage to watch this video and you don't know what any of these bots are you miss chess at its absolute peak but who knows maybe you're watching in the future and chess is even higher than it was in 2023 january so goodbye mittens goodbye megan hopefully we see you again at some point in the future maybe when the bots have some sort of war among themselves now get out of here
