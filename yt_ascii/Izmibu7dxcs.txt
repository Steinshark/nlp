alright guys so we're at the site and what i told the guys we're doing is we're microwaving a microwave microwave and microwave microwave no microwave microwave microwave like those other microwave videos we have all the microwaves but instead i'm gonna send ethan out to go do something while he's gone we're gonna destroy his car when he gets back he'll see it then we'll go take him to buy whatever car he wants alright guys so let's go ahead and get the microwaves out this is the tarp and that we're gonna try to microwave a microwave microwave in a microwave bring out them over here we got the microwaves always supposed to have three microwaves yeah i think we are here we'll just pull them out they might be back there here put this one down i think there's a microwave in so where to microwave this microwave while microwaving this one but i do know we have a four even where i need you to grab the fourth microwave we forgot it okay if you could go get that real quick we'll just have other things while you're gone like you will microwave the dumb stuff all the way what car should take you can take mine since the microwaves a little big i don't think it's gonna really fit this far [music] alright guys let's start microwaving stuff bring them over here real quick before we destroy the car this is what we're gonna do we were going to put this microwave out of that microwave inside of that microwave with that microwave and then a bigger microwave but that let's go destroy his car by the way we grabbed his keys off him before you left if you if you roll down his window it when his doors alot it makes the door come open oh my gosh this car is worth $800 he hates it trust me right i would not destroy his car if i didn't know he hated it ok we drove a car through duct tape i don't know if you've seen the video yet but when we did that i asked him how much it cost for us to destroy his car and he said he'd let me do it for like a grand so we're gonna give him a $10,000 budget so trust me guys i know he will be happy i promise you i would not do this if i wasn't a hundred percent certain he would be happy all right guys let the destruction begin oh wait did that do anything [music] [applause] [music] hey mr. beast what are you what are you doing with that plate hey what do you don't don't for adults do that no come on man get back to me you proud of yourself [music] oh god quit like me hates with my friends drive around crappy cars that is why they're the sponsor of this video to make this happen i know a lot of you guys have missed quit it's been a while since we've had them but the king has returned for all of you guys not fortunate enough to already have quit downloaded let me just briefly explain what it is to you because it's a really fun app and i also have a really cool competition for you you see quit is an app where you collect cards and stickers from your favorite shows and you know you've heard this a lot of my channel before but today we're doing something different there's going to be a pack called destroy car which is going to be pictures and gifts from this video and i'll quit they have a leaderboard system and every time you open up a pack it will give you a number like 1 out of 10,000 or 9,000 10,000 these numbers are randomly assigned to every card you get so you could be the first person to open a pack and your card be like number 8,000 out of 10,000 so to get right to the point there are multiple cards in every pack this pack is called destroyed card there's leaderboards for every pack on quit and the leaderboard ranking systems based on who has the lowest number for each cards in the pack so it's kind of like when you're a kid and you collected pokemons or yugioh cards of baseball cards except for now it's digital and there's a worldwide leaderboard for recognition if you're really good at it so if you get a card and it's one out of 10,000 that's as rare as they come and let me tell you why you want to be number one at the end of this week sunday at 12 p.m. eastern time whoever is number one for the pack destroyed card on quit you will get to do the outro on one of my videos i will literally give you like 20 to 30 seconds to say whatever you want in front of millions of people you can pull up your twitter you can plug your instagram you could say mom i love you it doesn't matter all you have to do is be number one on the leaderboard on quit for pack destroyed car we're gonna act like we hit his car it's gonna make pretty sad but don't ever assume [music] don't ever assume me let's
