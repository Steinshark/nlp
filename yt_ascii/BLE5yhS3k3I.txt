we're here at cornell university and this is kirsten peterson's lab the collective embodied intelligence lab so in general throughout all the projects in this lab it's about creating large collectives of robots and minimizing the amount of manufacturing that has to go into into it so that we can manufacture a large amount of robots one of the projects is the soft sleeve we have a set of resistive sensors on a sleeve each of these black lines on the soft sensor are made up of a carbon black slash ecoflex gel where they're electrically conductive and when you inflate it around an object you can map out the shape of the object by measuring the amount of time that it takes for one of the lines of resistance to stop showing a change in resistance the end goal of the sleeve is to integrate it into vineyards where you could have a soft robot or a soft sensor go up to these grapes the grape clusters and inflate it around the grapes without damaging them and then be able to reconstruct the geometry and get other characteristics out of it like for example it's ripeness so you could also incorporate other types of sensors into this so what bits of kind of hardware and software are you using for this i mean is it fairly standard stuff so i guess one of the main takeaways of this soft sensor is that it's relatively easy to make it's basically just a couple of layers of silicone and then one layer of carbon black and equal flex gel and then you hook it up to the arduino and you inflate it and you can get some data out of it it's a pretty simple setup so the idea would be that people can manufacture these sensors pretty easily right here you have a bunch of output lines and basically you have an input and electricity on one side and then the output and you're measuring measuring the change in resistance by taking it out to an arduino and in the arduino you can map it out onto a plot where you can see the change in resistance as a function of time there's one arduino and then there's two multiplexers here to get the readings out and these are the one is to inflate the sleeve and then the other is to vacuum the air out oh you got a big compressor down there yeah so this one needs a a higher pressure to actually be able to inflate the foam is this stuff 3d printed no this is all molded so it has a good amount of steps in the fabrication process so basically it's several layers of ecoflex a type of silicone a molded around a foam and the foam gives you a given porosity 50 porosity like 50 open space for air to flow through it that creates an amount of fluid resistance and causes a traveling wave through the robot right now the demo is yeah for movement and basically it's inching forward by having a traveling wave across the robot but what we want to show mainly is that you can have a single inlet and then have a sequence of actuations enabled by the fluidic resistance from the foam inside the soft robot we have some kind of leak so you use the compressor to build up some pressure and then inferior it's hypnotic yeah i guess something that we can see right here is i'll turn this off so what we're trying to show right here is that you can have a single inlet of pressurization and then using the foam inside with a 50 porosity of 50 amount of open space then you can create an amount an amount of fluid resistance and then with that you can use it to create a sequence of actuations the neat thing about this is that it's embedded into the design of it right so the foam inside creates that amount of fluid resistance that allows for the delay between the first leg and then and the second line and the third leg i guess because it's here air is pretty invisible has a very low viscosity so you don't see the difference as much as if it was being inflated by water this was an initial project and then the next step that we're doing is creating a a program that uses these electrical circuit analogies to automatically design the structure of the foam inside so if you let's say i have a given porosity at the beginning and then a lower porosity at the end then i'll have a change in the amount of delay that certain sections of the foam give and then i could have a program even more control over the sequence of actuations that i have we have these fluid slash electrical circuit analogies where you can model each of these segments each component of the robot has a fluidically resistive and a fluidically capacitive region and if i assign a certain value to that then i can map out the amount of time that it would take the fluid to reach that part of the foam if i send an impulse of pressure of air or water the final goal of this would be to use that automatic automatic design synthesis program to say okay well we have this robot we have this general shape for the robot and we want an inlet right here and some outlets of pressurization at these points and we want the sequence of actuation and and that could be for a swimmer or a crawling robot and by using a foam structure and a single inlet pressurization source then you could have the sequence of actuations for the soft robot single wave we're working on more complex implementations and finally it can even perform something called concertina locomotion and so ethernet down to the the hex engine the control system which is around the side here we come around the side set up underneath the driver's chair
