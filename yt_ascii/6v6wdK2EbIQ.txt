what have you been up to since we saw you last well thank you for the opportunity to flog my own book sorry let me phrase that differently actually something that i was working on while i was here in england two years ago was a book on go which was published shortly after i returned most of the work i would say almost entirely the entire part of the work was done by alan donovan a colleague from google he's in new york now but he in fact grew up in salsbury so allan and i wrote this book on go which is in many ways a very interesting useful language i would not call myself a a go expert at all in spite of having worked on it in this sense allan is the true expert but worth doing the other thing that i also did in part because i was on sabatical for a year was to update a book that i wrote maybe six 7 years ago called ds for digital it's a book for very non-technical people u people who's interested in expertise is not in computing but other things but who would like to understand you know how do these things work how what does it mean to write a program what does it mean to use the web how does the internet work what kinds of risks are there to our privacy and security all kinds of good things like that so i had written a a book on that several you know at least five or six seven years ago like that and it was getting a little dusty because things change rapidly and so i did a second addition of that and the other thing i had done an and probably because my colleague dave braford the first book self-published he will i'm sure tell you that self-publication is a recipe for having things disappear without a trace and so that the first edition did sort of disappear without much trace the second edition was published by princeton university press who also has an arrangement with oxford university press and so i'm hopeful that the book gets a lot more publicity it's called understanding the digital world which is a much fancier title but okay so that's the that's the updated version of digital i'm actually intrigued to know cu we started computer file maybe four years ago what has changed you had today what sorts of things i think the most obvious one the first version was done i think in 2011 in 2013 edward snowden revealed something that people had suspected but not really realized just how extensively they are being sp i on by various government agencies like the nsa in the united states and gchq in england and presumably similar ones everywhere in the world and what snowden did was to make it crystal clear that there was an enormous amount of that stuff going on in spite of denials and in spite of legal restrictions in various countries on how information could be collected and used and so that was a big thing i think the other thing that sort of parallels it in some sense another change is the continuing growth of commercial surveillance how we are being monitored continuously as we use the internet and our phones and so on by companies like google and facebook and who knows who else and the enormous growth of the hidden advertising market there the the trackers that watch you when you use your computers and when you use your phones and then in some sense the commercialization of criminal threats against you that this is that people are out to get your money and your identity in a way that was i think much less so it was more amateur six seven years ago than it is today so all of these are things that are i think substantially different mostly in intensity they're much worse defenses are harder to come by although we do understand something about that so that was the bulk of the the sorts of things that changed in it and then of course some was just trying to clean up the places where i explained it poorly the first time around let's see if we could do better the second time around you keep trying it until you get it right i there are authors who claim that they write their stuff right the first time and it never needs work i don't think that applies to most people and certainly does not apply to me so even in the process of writing a book you work really really hard over and over and over again on on what you say and then you get it out and you realize there's a mistake or you could have said that much better or something has changed under foot and so what you said is no longer accurate because the world has changed around you so you pile enough of those effects on in a field like computing which is changing rapidly and it means that books tend to date relatively quickly and so some parts you know binary numbers work the same way today as they did when i know george bu was at them and but the explanations of those perhaps could be improved and the reasons why you should care about them may have changed as well so that's the genesis of the second edition when you come over here you don't fly do you and i i don't want to go into the details of this but i'm interested what it's like spending days on the ocean in this day and age when you're so used to being connected and can you tell me a little bit about that oh yeah the genesis my wife does not like to fly at all and we are at a stage where fortunately we can take a relatively long period in the summer so we have three times now we're in you know in the middle of the third time have come to england on the qm2 which fortunately sails from new york which is you know 50 mi from where we live and lands in southampton which is perfectly fine and so u the trip takes 7 days and you're in the middle of the atlantic and there isn't a lot to do out there except the qm2 itself is a very big floating not quite luxury but close to a hotel in some ways and they try to entertain their guests and they certainly feed their guests really well there's lots of good food continuously and entertainment put on one sort or another and they have a library and so on so but the other and really your question is you're cut off from electronics and so on and it turns out to my surprise you're not really what they provide is satellite internet you have to pay for it but my wife and i have sailed enough now that they give us 120 minutes free over 7 days so you can figure this is approximately 20 minutes a day of internet connectivity and so i use that to check mail and i found that typically i only use about half of it i log in check my mail in you know two three minutes maybe kill off one important thing if there is one and then just turn it off again and i don't miss it a bit it works well for me because i don't use a fancy mailer i am using an oldfashioned texton mailer alpine and so the fact that the latency is infinite doesn't matter infinite like some laughing in the room with that yes right so it turns out that you can get along very nicely with out connectivity for a week if if you have more or less arranged your affairs properly before you set off and and have told people yeah i'm not going to respond to you i'm guessing you still work though at that time you're still working it's just lack of connectivity yeah right you can still do things it's actually very nice for doing things like editing books or something like that where you have all the text on your your own computer and you can fiddle with it and then at the end resync with the world when you arrive fantastic and what's next then brian what's what's next for you what are you going to be doing are you staying in the uk for a while or yeah we'll be in the uk until the beginning of august and then we go back on the qm2 so we're in staying in lincoln at this point which is a town we hadn't spent enough time in the past and then we're going off into yorkshire for a while and then into northwest wales and then down to il forom and then down to dartmouth and back into salsbury and then all so kind of a week at a time oh and there's an oxford in there somewhere as well i forgot so so to us in the uk that's quite a big journey but perhaps when you're from the states it it fails not so far in terms of distances distances in england are tiny in terms of travel time distances in england are very long it took me an hour and a half to get from lincoln to nottingham this morning and i think the distance there is what 30 or 40 mil so because the roads are narrower and there a lot of people on [music] [music] them
