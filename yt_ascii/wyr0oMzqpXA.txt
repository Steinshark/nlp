christmas or if it's already december 26 where you're watching in the world or you're watching in 2024 and beyond well hope you have a good holiday season overall setting nothing but health happiness and all that good stuff tons of chess elo to you and your loved ones and your pets and even your enemies now here in the united states it's tradition on christmas day to avoid your family at all costs and minimize social interactions on a serious note there's a lot of sporting events on television basketball football like the one you throw and not the one you kick for whatever reason now to continue that tradition i'm going to show you a sporting event i'm going to show you magnus carlson versus hikara nakamura from title tuesday which recently completed concluded and magnus and hikaru when they play en title tuesday i know they're thinking about this youtube channel because they disrespect each other so viciously it's a spectacle i mean i mean the two of them play chess like nobody should play chess ever and i'm going to show you the game that they played recently because it was an other catastrophe that's that's that's it was ridiculous but it was also incredible to witness it's also christmas all courses are 40% off link in the description get yourself a present get someone you love or hate a present get something for yourself enjoy the holidays hope you're all doing well here we go e4 oh and speaking of christmas presents i got a book here on the table over 50,000 of these have been purchased since the book came out october 24th so if you got it for yourself or you got it for somebody you know i mean just really thank you from the bottom of my heart it's just unbelievable to see how big the book has tren is trending both in the uk us multiple other language editions as well and here is the position after one move from each side e4 a6 now recently hikaro has been playing a3 against magnus in the opening which is a move i mean it's a legal move and then you know magnus will play something like e5 or sometimes magnus will play also a6 or g6 but this time hikaru goes for a regular move and and magnus plays a6 now normally of course for white to take the center with if you have two an opportunity to put two pawns in the center of the board you should generally here magnus and hikaro when they're playing like this will put one of these pawns in the center and then they're going to try to fight for the center they're just going to try to justify this move as like a a first move that's disrespectful but then after that you know they're going to play normally no what magnus does in this game should not be replicated frankly it shouldn't even be observed magnus plays knight to c6 and as early as the second move of the game the game review is calling him an idiot this is called the st george wood chug variation i i don't think that's real i think somebody made that up and the point is that if you're going to put pieces in the center that can be attacked by pawns it's a very dangerous game you're playing especially if the side is not overextending for example now magnus could go knight e5 and hikaro could go f4 and then knight g6 but if you overpress black just gets the knight comfortably in the center then defends it and then is going to try to break apart white's position so with white you've got to stop your troops a little bit early now magnus here plays not knight e5 and not even knight b8 undevelop to the home square this boo plays knight a7 i mean if you if you have a role model in chess and you watch them do this that's crazy that's crazy this man man just played a6 knight c6 and camps out behind the pawn that's nuts now hikaru just takes as much space as possible puts three pawns in the center he wants his knights to go behind the pawns right now the thing is this is not completely lost it it's pretty bad for black but watch as magnus makes this work because he's half his name is literally magic right tech technically the word magic it it's three quarters in his name three- fifths not three quarters three fifths 60% of the of the word magic is in magnus's name so c4 and now he plays not a center pawn move not e6 trying to fight against the center like this or e5 no this dude plays b5 four moves by magnus have been made three of them are given dubious move that's dubious that's dubious and that's dubious as well that's nuts now if white takes you justify black's play black is going to take back with the pawn then he's probably going to attack on the queen side he's going to play c6 e6 and slowly he's going to get out of the position now after b5 white can also ignore this completely because you're you're defended you can just play knight f3 which is the best move or knight c3 you are a little bit concerned about this pawn just in the future just kind of lurking over there hikaru immediately makes a mistake and now now the computer here is at a high depth it thinks that the position's plus 1.6 it thinks that white has a very big advantage but it's actually not the stupidest opening in the world because black is going to just start striking at these pawns and like i said if you if you overextend with white suddenly you're going to get slapped around and then black is going to put a bishop out and he's going to put a knight out and he's going to start taking at your center and you thought you had a big advantage but you don't hikaru plays c5 which is a mistake and now magnus has a well-time strike at two pawns in white center and somehow his opening doesn't look entirely idiotic okay e6 hikaro plays bishop to e3 a natural developing move defending the pawn on c5 magnus plays knight f6 he's not taking there is just tension on the white center all the pawns that white put out now white has to take accountability for if white plays knight c3 he's going to get hit with this move b4 that stupid pawn that walked out there because of this completely absurd wood chug defense how many chucks can a magnus chuck if a woodchuck could ch i don't even i'm just going to shut up okay b4 is is going to be on the board so karu defends his pawns with his queen that's a dangerous game you're playing okay because the fact that the queen has to babys it you know that's not really i mean the queen's very valuable and very powerful and the queen's got to be very careful now magnus takes hikaru takes and and magnus plays d6 but d6 is a crazy move because he's opening his bishop but what about his knight his knight is completely locked away it doesn't even it doesn't have any moves now it can't go here it can't eat its own pawn you can't push the pawn because i'm going to take well it turns out magnus had the right plan all along and now all magnus has to do is actually just go g6 bishop g7 and castle and he's just vibing he is completely vibing vibing is in fact the official evaluation of the computer like black's just going to castle and have absolutely no problems and at some point bring this knight back into the game instead of that like i said these guys are out for maximum disrespect against each other so here comes knight g4 knight g4 defended by the bishop looking to get hikaru's bishop and then develop the bishop like this to this diagonal not to play g6 bishop g7 magna's getting provocative very early in this game now computer really wants hikaro to play a4 but hikaru doesn't feel comfortable sabotaging even more development so he plays knight c3 which is also given a fat dubious mark by the computer but the computer can you know go drink some eggnog bishop e7 played by magnus you cannot take this pawn this is so provocative by by magnus but you just can't take it because your queen is trapped what how does the queen is just completely trapped black has what whatever that is all right and a queen is trapped so bishop e7 now kukaru should probably play long castle or knight f3 but he he plays bishop to f4 he tries to get the bishop out of the way says you know what magnus you don't want my knight no problem magnus says like i never wanted your knight anyway bozo castles and suddenly suddenly you're like wait a wait a second remember i told you in the beginning of the game like white pushed all these pawns out but how do we know that he's not overextending yeah we don't know in fact these pawns are definitely overextended and they're going to be targets for these pieces and they're not actually restricting that much space because once black moves the the bishop he's going to be able to get the knight in the game very quickly he's going to zigzag it or come this way so suddenly hikaro is just in very difficult shape here comes magnus with the bishop here comes magnus with the rook on the on the straightaway he's got the knight playing the bishop playing the rook playing the bishop's getting out this pawn's coming and knight b5 is on the way as well hikaru blocks the check magnus doesn't give him any time to relax pawn to b4 activating that go that goofy knight the goofy knight is coming to b5 oh my goodness great pressure here by magnus pressure with the knight pressure with the bishop position is equal hikaru's knight goes back to d1 because he wants to cover up he wants to block the file and he didn't feel comfortable putting the knight on the edge of the board who can blame him who can blame him the knight has no return home right black is just going to play rook b8 bishop f5 knight b5 like it's a very uncomfortable position so he plays the knight to d1 and there here comes magnus's knight the knight that went c6 a7 is now on b5 and somehow the best player in the world is making it work from all three sides finally oh never mind i was going to say finally it's time to castle but clearly hear didn't like something about this move it's kind of hard to understand what though like maybe he didn't exactly see a plan but i you know i thought but he goes h3 he decides i need to play h3 now i need to kick magnus's knight out of the center but magnus's knight goes to e5 and now we have a problem we have a problem because you can't just trade why not because de and you've overextended you've overextended that pawn is not an asset i'm going to play bishop f5 by the time you castle i'm playing knight d4 and now nobody can protect the pawn we can chop chop and you can try to defend it but i'm going to win that pawn i'm going to play bishop b4 your knight can't actually get out crazy this is hanging but black is going to win both these pawns the two pawns hearu marched into magnus's position cuz magnus didn't take the center so it's kind of absurd knight e5 knight to e3 is a mistake magnus takes on f3 puts the knight on d4 anyway and is just better he's just better may i remind you his opening four moves looked like this b5 that is what you can play as a top player in the world against hikara nakamura 3240 rated and you could play like this and by the 15th move of the game somehow you maneuver i mean it it it it's bogus how these guys do this knight b5 sorry knight d4 this is the position hikaro has to play bishop d1 and now it's very instructive how magnus maneuvers his pieces because hikaru just wants to go here so really there is only one move in this entire position for black that creates what's called an initiative an initiative is a series of moves in chess where you create threats while also improving your position in the future for the future so how do you do that here rook e4 what a move putting the rook directly in the center and attacking white's bishop which seems easy enough to defend but the second the bishop leaves the diagonal black is just going to strike at this knight so black is going to play knight f5 and bishop g5 and black is defending b4 so rook e4 attacks it it protect it attack and most importantly it eat snack that's what it's going to do so caro plays here which is a losing mistake apparently he had to go bishop h2 apparently there was a difference between these two moves because now the knight no longer hits the bishop right that's i guess what the idea is but i mean magnus would have walked in and tried to eat on a lot of stuff bishop g3 knight f5 by by by magnus and now magnus is completely winning if he plays bishop g5 and sacrifices the rook really that like this and what about bishop g1 well apparently bishop f5 and then bishop h4 and apparently then knight g2 and you get out like king f1 knight f4 and and and black is completely winning so magnus has to coordinate his three pieces sacrifice the rook that's tough that is tough to play you trap your own rook and then this is apparently completely winning for black cuz white can't get off the back rank all of white's pieces are stuck the bishop is in the corner he has no threats magnus is not stock though so he goes here now karu is defending himself now magnus should have stayed patient and played a5 and brought in the sniper from the edge of the board a5 very very well-timed move if knight takes f5 there's bishop f5 there's a threat to the queen and if white castles their bishop d3 which is picking up material not to mention rook d5 is a free pawn anytime you want it but instead of that magnus goes for knight takes aara plays f takes rook d5 and now he castles so he caro's just a clean pawn down clean pawn down after that absolutely goofy opening okay the best plan for for black queen e7 put the rook there slowly get the bishop out get the rook out as well hikaro plays sorry magnus plays rook f5 okay he doesn't play rook c5 plays rook f5 makes sense he's up a pawn so he wants to trade pieces plays rook f5 now karu doesn't take the rook he wants his rook taken and he wants it replaced with the rook so he goes here with a little bit of pressure on black's king all right magnus is smart he's up material he trades here comes queen e7 now hikaru's down a pawn he's down on time and he's got a pretty bad position overall he's got a basically he's got to defend himself by playing only moves he does he absolutely does plays rook f4 that is the only move why is that the only move all you're doing doing is attacking a pawn why can't black just play a5 he can that's still the best move though the idea is to put the rook on e4 and create counterplay onto black's back rank so you can do that with bishop d5 you can do that with queen d3 which the computer likes a little bit less the computer like bishop d5 if bishop e6 you pin that's what you do but that's the idea rook f4 queen d3 and you put the rook like this hikaru immediately spots that he has to create counterplay on the e file now magnus can play d5 magnus is like bro i'm two pawns up i'm two pawns up i'm just i'm straight up up two pawns i am completely winning after playing a goofy opening like that iaro plays the best move queen b5 down 15 seconds on the clock but looking to apply some pressure maybe sneak into b7 this pawn is actually proving to be more of an asset now in the long term as it's two scores away from queening and in most end games white can even s to try to promote all right magnus plays bishop c3 hikaro plays bishop f4 it is now officially minus two black has up two pawns and it's minus two so the advantage is completely justified how do you convert that apparently a4 you cannot take this with the bishop because d5 and the rook is trapped so since you can't do that bishop takes pawn takes and i'm not really sure what's going to happen happen here i mean queen b7 black can already begin things like b3 you just got to not hang your rook obviously but let's say you play like queen f8 rook e6 there's b3 there's b3 there's a3 i mean you you are not stopping this pawn and hikaru does not have the firepower to fight back when a full queen lands on a1 so maybe that is the way to do it but instead of that magnus doesn't play a4 he turns his attention to the center and all of a sudden it just takes the pawn on a5 what what what is going on hikaro takes the pawn a5 magnus could just played a4 i mean i'm sure it was complicated but the pawn is falling and now the only move here that the computer recommends is like queen d8 you know trying to start trading these pieces magnus plays h6 which makes sense car plays a3 oh my goodness he's going to get rid of these pawns now he is only one pawn down and we're going to an end game which he's going to try to defend magnus plays queen d8 he spends 40 seconds 40 seconds realizing wait a minute i can't take because my bishop is going to hang and i can't take that because my queen is hanging so what do i do plays queen d8 he's down to 33 seconds clearly a bit rattled now karu is going to take and then he's going to take so magnus goes from playing a completely ridiculous opening then getting a completely winning position to messing it up slightly to bishop takes e6 rook e6 rook e6 rook e6 excuse me pawn e6 ab and now hikaru is playing for the win against magnus from two pawns down to two pawns up i don't know how these guys managed to do it how they managed to create these completely insane games constantly and now magnus plays e5 and officially officially hikaro is definitely playing for a win these pawns are very annoying so for example bishop g3 let's just say here here here here here white has pretty decent winning chances not at this level but like this is a very tough position for black at the intermediate level if the white king manages to get forward there are constantly threats of breaking apart those pawns it's a very tough end game so bishop g3 and magnus loses magnus loses the game to hikaru with the move king to h7 can you find the move that would beat magnus carlson in this position because i'll tell you right now hearu didn't find it iaru centralized his queen in this position and then immediately realized what he had missed he played queen d5 threatening a fork and also threatening bishop b4 queen e4 check oh queen e4 check right if bishop b4 which would pick up the bishop but hikaru completely overlooked and he immediately spotted it after playing queen d5 he has this and the bishop is trapped the bishop cannot go anywhere except there where it will be forked now queen a3 is like a is like a 1,00 level tactic if you just put this position on the board and say white to move and win you know we find this move and then queen g5 you just have to see this so queen a3 queen g5 you just have to slide the bishop out of the way apparently this is winning too this end game because of the same reason i told you because white can just sneak through there might be queen b1 check so actually after this you might need to go queen c1 first and then b6 point stands for example queen e8 b6 like this and you're completely winning so yeah queen a3 but instead of that queen here and now magnus gets out of the way and you're not trapping this bishop anytime soon if you try to come back the bishop will be able to run away for example queen b3 bishop d2 this is no longer right you try to trap the bishop i can take with check blah blah blah so queen d5 and hikaru misses the chance and plays b5 and now magnus plays queen b8 and is able to create a barrier create create a barrier on the dark squares but the game is not over the game is not over white is still playing this for a win e4 magnus tries to create a blockade still there is an outside chance that white could potentially break through magnus is trying to create a a fortress hikaru takes on b6 queen b6 king f1 maybe the white king is going to go on a journey for example if the white king can successfully get to d7 like this i i i understand i'm like walking through a checkmate but this oh this is winning because the king is so close you'll just get in there and take the pawn but as we saw by the time you you know walk you know like you're going to get mated so you can't just go on a walk you've got to be very very careful magnus plays queen e3 both guys with limited time on the clock queen d3 check hikaru chucks a pawn completely to try to pick up c7 and then he's going to be completely winning but it's very unfortunate because the king is stuck the white king is actually just straight up stuck in a vortex and even though c7 can fall which magnus is happy to give away he saves the day with less than 10 seconds on his clock with queen f4 check and queen f1 and hikaru can make a run for it but then there's queen e3 and then he could make a run for it this way again but then there's queen f4 now he could make he could he probably should have tried is what he should have done but you're you're never actually escaping i can even take with check but i'm not going to so white is completely stuck there is no way white can escape these checks check check check check and it's perpetual and the players agree to a draw i don't know how hikaru and magnus constantly manage to outdo each other every single week like the fact that magnus can play this absolute nonsense by the way i'm going to start playing this i'm going to play this idiotic opening and i'm going to see how i do just for fun i'm going to try 10 games of magnus's goofy a a6 b5 knight you know and i'm i'm i'm going to see how i faire in it and then he gets a completely winning position completely out maneuvers right look at this puts the knight promptly on the and and just gets this roaring initiative picks up a pawn he has a two- pawn advantage he's just cleanly up two pawns but hikaru never never stops defending he never stops defending he applies pressure and magnus moves his rook out of the way and just hangs his a pawn and then not only does he hang his pawn he gets a completely lose position cuz of queen a3 crazy the the the christmas drama is is incredible but you know winning and losing and ultimately drawing a game is is life and unfortunately today there was no winner there was no loser on the bright side though tomorrow like i said world rapping and blitz championships begin in samar in usbekistan i don't know if i said that i don't remember what i said 22 minutes ago in the intro of this video the world raping the blitz championships begin and that's exciting so i will be covering those if you're watching this at some point in the future then well hope you're
