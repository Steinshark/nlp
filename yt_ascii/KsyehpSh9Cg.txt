in this video i'm going to tell you the strategies that every programmer needs to follow if they want to use coding to build real wealth so many of us see the big salary numbers for software engineers online and they think well building weit coding is easy i just learn to code online get a high paying job and boom i'm rich but unfortunately it is no longer that easy and if you just do this and you don't consider the key factors that every programmer needs to consider when it comes to building wealth you are going to be stuck in the rat race forever like so many other programmers so in this video i'm going to share you the underlying strategies of wealth building from my own experience and based on what i've learned from having a lot of very successful friends because as exciting as coding is really what most of us want at the end of the day is simply a prosperous life and whether you like it or not money is a requirement for that and given my age range i think i've done extremely extremely well so this video i want to share some of these lessons with you and how you can apply them with a skill of coding so first of all when it comes to building wealth there always going to be different stages to this journey and assuming you're not born to wealth or anything like that by far the hardest stage is going to be the first stage charlie monga always said by far the hardest thing you'll do is making your first $100,000 although with inflation that number is pretty higher now but anyway and the reason for that is is that there's really only two ways to make money the first way is having skills and using your skills and trading your skills and your time for money and the second way is assets that means either owning property owning stocks or own digital products which we'll get into later on in this video that can give you returns and the problem is that in the beginning you have neither of those things you don't have skills and you certainly don't have any assets and so in the beginning if you have very little money to your name the only thing you can really do is to use the skill path which means you're going to have to learn some high income skills as fast as possible and of course in this video we're talking about coding which is definitely still one of the best skills that you can learn to make money but this is where people really trip up humans by nature are impatient and we want to start making money now but what you need to understand is that in order to get into the earning stages of your life you need to go through a season of learning that means right at the beginning your only focus should be on building your skills the asset of your skills as fast as possible and just focus on learning as much as possible because the thing here is that at any given moment whatever skills you have now you can go and take those skills and go and earn with those skills but the more patience you can have to learn higher value skills to get better and better at these skills the higher your earnings will be per hour or per day or per month or whatever and the thing is i'm not just talking about learning coding versus learning to flip burgers or something like that even within coding certain skills are much higher leverage than other skills so what do i mean by high leverage certain skills that you learn are going to essentially give you much better bang for buck for the time that you put in to learn them for example if you learn some very obscure detail about some obscure programming in language like schola that no one uses the time that you put into learning that skill is not going to give you a very good return so we want to focus on learning skills that going to give you a very good return for your time and i think the absolute highest return on your time the highest leverage coding skill you can learn is data structures and algorithms and coding problem solving sort of interview coding problem solving in general and the reason for that is that simply learning this one skill can give you access to the best jobs out there so i'd like to announce to you that i just created a new course called algo university that is designed to be a fast track course to teach you everything you need about data structures and algorithms to teach you to solve actual interview problems i used to be really terrible at this stuff so i simply figured out where is the exact list of topics that i need to learn to actually solve any lead code problem or any interview problem that i might be tested in any coding interview so i did it and then based on my process i created a framework for myself which i have now put into this course it's perfect for beginners you don't need to have any prior knowledge about any of these topic if you don't want to learn it from me that is fine as well but make sure you don't ignore learning these high leverage skills as a programmer so the trick here is that in the beginning you should forget about making money because eventually the skills that you would develop will allow you to earn much much more than the guys who don't focus on that so in summary your step number one is to focus on learning and forget about money and most people are not able to do that and that is why they stay poor right at the first stage so now assuming you've spent a lot of time and a lot of effort in the season of learning you're now pretty good at whatever skills you have which means that now you can move on to your season of earning with the caviat that you also should remember that your season of learning is really always going to be going on like you always should be learning new skills but throughout this season of earning there are three things that you need to keep in mind maximizing your income minimizing your expenses and investing as much as possible first let's go through the two paths of earning money with coding first we have the path of the employee so if you just want a stable 9 to-5 job and that is the best fit for your personality type then you are going to have the big advantage of having income that is going to be reasonably predictable like whatever company you end up working for and like however much people get paid in your location you can predict how much money you're going to be earning in a monthly basis or even in a yearly basis pretty well but the downside is going to be that your earnings are always going to be capped so talking about these three pillars in terms of maximizing your income you just want want to try to get the best possible job that you can get with your current skills and that doesn't mean having to get the best job straight away you might start off you can just focus on learning as much as possible like perhaps a startup and once you've learned enough you can use that experience to get to the googles or the facebooks or things like that so no surprises there but for software engineer specifically there's actually two other ways that you can increase your income even further one of these is going to be this overemployment thing basically because of the fact that software engineering is such an easy job at the end of the day especially until recently it was possible for people to literally work two separate jobs at the same time which means you can literally double your income this is not going to be illegal or anything but the companies might not like that so if you want to try doing that then just do it at your own risk but the other way is going to be doing something called freelancing now i mentioned freelancing quite a few times on this channel in previous videos but essentially the benefit of freelancing is going to be that the pay is overall usually going to be higher now this is going to be especially important if you're not based in the us or in switzerland where salaries are super high so for those people to like freelancing that allows you to work for clients in the us or in higher paying markets will allow you to maximize your income a lot more so then the second pillar of minimizing your income is the part that especially going to be a lot more difficult than for entrepreneur people that we're going to talk about in a second and the reason for that is that in most cases if you want the highest paying jobs you're also going to have to live in the highest cost of living location that's just how supply and demand works taxes are sky high in san francisco new york london and these popular places cost of living is also skyh high so the solution to this in my opinion is to do whatever you can to be able to work remotely luckily today it's more possible than ever a lot of companies are allowing you to perhaps work for a company in san francisco but live somewhere else perhaps the pay is going to be slightly lower but you should be able to save a lot more this way as well and now also the reality is especially in your earlier years you do not want to get into lifestyle inflation you want to make sure that you prioritize saving over falling out and eating out every single day and things like this no i'm not going to be one of those guys that says like oh you can never have starbucks or something like that but you need to prioritize your future self over having fun in the moment if you want to build wealth that is what i've been doing for years that is what i still do even though i'm making a bunch of money right now because as we will see once we get into the investing part of this equation the money that you're able to save in your early days is going to be so valuable later on when we start accounting for compound interest and all these kind of things lifestyle inflation is also a danger especially if you work in an office environment where you have a lot of colleagues that that may be starting to get nice cars or watches or things like this and you feel like you need to sort of impress them you need to make sure you don't get into this trap just focus on your process live comfortably but try to avoid the temptations as long as possible now when it comes to investing what i would do as an employee is have some money saved up on your back account usually people recommend around a 6month emergency fund so look at what are your 6 months of expenses and save that on your savings account somewhere somewhere that's easy for you to access at any time and the rest start investing aggressively into index funds or etfs and you can look at other types of investments but these are going to be the safest ones long term that are also going to allow you to get very good returns at least historically this is not investment advice this is just what i do now what if you want to start your own business what if you want to work for yourself now this is going to be a much more unpredictable path but if you manage to succeed the potential is going to be infinite and that is the first benefit of this path over the employee path your income is not capped but what i would very much caution you from is leaving your job too early i think just quitting your job to pursue a new business that's not proven in any way that's not making any money yet is one of the stupidest things that you can do do that 9 to 5 and then from 5: to 9:00 start your side hustle work on your startup your youtube channel whatever you want to do eventually you'll get to the point where both of these are making money and now you have two income sources that are bringing money and once you start feeling like okay the fact that i have to spend 9 to5 on my job is really taking away way too much from my business that's now already succeeding that is the moment to quit when you've already proven the business now this is going to depend on your risk tolerance again this is what i would do and this is how i did it when i left my job for my business but in terms of building wealth at least for me personally i can tell as an entrepreneur because your income is going to be extremely unpredictable it made me just try to save even more money because it made me even more c cautious of getting into lifestyle inflation because i don't have that predictability of knowing how much money is coming in and this is what i would recommend to you as well because who knows maybe your business is going to fail in a year you can never know that you want to make sure that you stack up as much money in your savings and your investment as possible so that if worse comes to worst you will have a lot of time to then figure something else out or go get a job if you need to in terms of maximizing your income as an entrepreneur in the beginning stages of your career you really cannot be thinking about work life balance i don't care what any of you say this is what all of my successful entrepreneur friends have told me this is what i've heard from everyone that i've listened to a podcast and on my own experience as well building a business is hard work but the hardest part is getting it off the ground in the beginning parts of your career you want to frontload as much work as possible to get that plane off the ground and once you get into those cruising altitudes once you get into the level where you're happy with it and you can start hiring people you can start automating things that is where you can start taking it easier in terms of investing i think the only difference is that the best returns on your investment are probably going to come from investing in your skills as an entrepreneur and on investing into your own business in other kinds of ways but personally because i'm very risk adverse i still put a lot of my money into these index funds and etfs just to have that security but this will depend on how capital intensive your business is and things like this but here the massive advantage of being self-employed is if your business is online which it most likely will be if you're building an app or something like that you can absolutely minimize your expenses you're going to absolutely minimize your taxes as well if you're willing to do what i call geographic arbitrage if you're not an american citizen you can simply just leave your high tax country to a place like dubai where i am to a place like southeast asia singapore to have much more reasonable taxes and in most cases you'll also be able to save a ton of money on your cost of living as well so you can absolutely maximize your income and minimize your expenses and that makes just a massive difference and this is why i think in the future being loc independent and utilizing this geographic arbitrage is going to be the way to make it and really build wealth in this world even if you're an employee this is something you want to consider are you able to work remotely globally from a different country that allows you to optimize for taxes and things like this as i observe what's happening in all of these major western cities i can see that it's becoming more and more and more difficult to build wealth if you're having to live in one of these places unless you're earning like a ridiculous amount or the amount that you could earn in those places is so much higher that it makes up for the difference of course then it might be very wise to look into if you're able to live somewhere much cheaper and with a lot lower taxes so last but not least we have the season of investing and obviously this season will also start during your season of earnings as i just briefly mentioned it but the difference here is that when you're still earning money and you don't have that much invested yet the returns that you're able to make from your investments are going to be far lower than what you can earn with your active income from your skills but this level which by the way even i have haven't reached yet the amount that you have invested in index funds in etfs in crypto whatever you're invested in is going to start to become so important relative to the active income you're able to make from your skills they make sense to start putting a lot more effort into thinking about where to invest as well i can't talk much about this yet because again i'm not at this level yet but this is really the final level but the other place where you really should be investing outside of these physical and financial assets is digital assets now digital assets are very interesting because they don't actually require to invest money they just require you to invest time for example this entire youtube channel is full of digital assets like every single video is a digital asset that is generating views and then via those views it's generating ad revenue and i've got my own digital products like my courses that are also digital assets that took a lot of time and effort to build but i'm now able to give me returns on a continued basis with minimal extra time that i have to put into them so if you go through all these steps you go through your season of learning of maximizing your skills and then season of earning of maximizing your income while minimizing your expenses while putting your money to work as much as possible you will be able to become financially free much faster than you ever thought possible and the value of financial freedom isn't necessarily even having money like beyond a certain point like believe me money will not make you happy the benefit of money is not the stuff you can buy with it it is the freedom that it gives you and even beyond that it's not just freedom for yourself freedom for your family your future kids the future you'll be able to build them coding is one of the most potent tools to build wealth and build an amazing life for ourselves and for the people around us so don't waste it and really prioritize understanding how to maximize your money because if you do that your future self will thank you now obviously for you the most difficult part of the journey is going to be figuring out how to maximize your income as a programmer if you want to learn how to make $10,000 a month with coding which is a really good target for anyone to hit then i recommend you watch this video right here where i go into the details of the step-by-step process of the four different ways to make $10,000 a month with coding as fast as possible so go watch that video next and i will see you in the next one
