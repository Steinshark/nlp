[music] well that's very it's good to see you for people who are watching this they probably don't know that we've we've exchanged quite a few emails in the past we've even had some phone calls and so it's it's kind of nice to have a public discussion yeah this is exciting so you might be really excited your book is when is your book coming out so my book comes out august 25th and it's called a cloud of outrageous glue it's put a copy behind me you know cuz you're supposed to do that you know you're supposed to first of all pose in front of a bookshelf you know to show that you're widely read and then you're supposed to like casual your copy of your own book among the canon you know you're doing everything right there you go you're doing everything right and so are you done are you finished yeah it's so here's the crazy thing about the book as you know it's a book about the great plague of 1348 so it's a pandemic book and i just so happened to have like wrapped it up and put a nice neat little bow on it in just after the new year like just in january got through the last pass of the copy editing handed in all the artwork and then the pandemic is so sort of relevant sort of timely i think we can have some interesting things to talk about today yeah so how do you how do you feel like i mean it must be a weird we always always use the phrase symbolism happens when you know you something all these patterns are kind of coming together in a way that wasn't planned but ends up looking almost as if someone playing cos says maybe you were in on the conspiracy and from the beginning you know yes so maybe we can talk about it start with that if you're interested and i mean i'd like to get a sense of how in terms of narrative how you treated the question of the plague is human relationships and how it relates to kind of what we're going through right now yeah well originally this wasn't the book that i was right i was gonna write a book about about the fluidity of time time and space the fact that land holds memory there all these other things that i was gonna write about these two girls that could see each other through time so nobody kissed nobody steal that idea cuz i'm still gonna write that book but my publisher because i had written a historical fiction book when i first came on with kanab they wanted to kind of keep me in a historical fiction vein for readers and so i kind of went you know squarely to the medieval part of the story and you know i've always been a medieval file i you know like i kind of cut my teeth on iconography like in more of an art historical sense than a faith sense i i'm not orthodox but so it was interesting to me but like i couldn't settle on a time period i was gonna i really wanted to write something from like around the turn of the millennium like the hildegard von bingen kind of era yeah right there just wasn't enough documentation but it seemed like right around the time of the plague all of this documentation kind of hit you know and there was just a lot more wealth of research available you know so that's kind of how i fell into the time period and i thought oh wouldn't it be interesting to write about a girl or anybody who was like who had these powers of perception but also was perceived as kind of a misfit you know as all this chaos was breaking out you know like how because like the subject of saints you know how does somebody become a saint and then how does somebody become labeled a heretic well sometimes that's the same person sometimes they're a saint one minute and then they you know get labeled heretic next and they're being burned at the stake or sometimes they're considered a heretic but then after they're burned at the stake they emerge as a saint you know so i thought okay well what would it be like be that a real person hmm right who's on the outside who's a misfit and has this way of seeing the world that isn't like everybody else doesn't conform as the world's falling apart yeah so that's what the book is about and her her kind of powers of perception really are there synesthesia so are you familiar with yep what's yeah so for i guess for those who don't know it's a kind of crossing over at the senses neurologically so that people can see sound as color you know playing out before them or they can taste emotion or things like that so yeah and how do you feel do you feel like the the way you approach that's a disease or or the plague time how do you see it do you see it connected because the thing about the time with the plague is we there was a lot of apocalypticism at the same time obviously it makes sense you've got half the population people dying off whole villages you know being exterminated by this plague and so you can imagine that there was a lot of conspiracy and a lot of apocalypticism going on kind of madness took over some aspects of european culture not everywhere some some places remain quite sane but you know this idea of the image of the jews poisoning the well or these this kind of idea of the stranger who is the one who brings about the plague so i don't know if you were able to deal with those ideas in your book as well this kind of weird apocalypticism that comes about yeah yeah definitely i mean that that plays out in the latter half of the book when the plague actually hits but because my first novel was about the post holocaust period and i was dealing with the question of how anti-semitism arises when it arises and one of the things that i discovered in the research for that was that these major persecutions of the jews emerge like clockwork like every 70 to 100 years so maybe like once a generation there will be like a major persecution of the jews the holocaust was not the first and certainly won't be the last it just happened to be the biggest but and that's how i discovered you know the persecution of the jews during the plague now in england where my book has set it's a little bit different because the jews have been expelled i can't i can't remember which king it was i think it was one of the edwards who had expelled them in the 13th century there wasn't like a tangible jewish community but in places you know more in central europe that was really a monstrous thing that was taking place so but what emerged in england and in other parts of europe was the the movement of the flagellants like the people who go through streets you know whipping themselves and stuff and so that is something that i felt was important was was important and was kind of of a peace with that kind of real thinking yeah and it's happening now we're seeing flagellants right now i mean i mean totally and it's kind of like every stage of this thing right from the announcement of the pandemics all the way through to like yesterday i saw a video of yesterday today of the mayor of minneapolis being hauled before a crowd yeah and told to defund the police an idea which is about light in the public consciousness which is about one week old so we're gonna like completely dismantle this whole system in one week and what was he gonna do you know like he had to the option was so flagellate or maybe we'll kill you or flee for your life yeah you know so yeah it's very it's a very it's very strange because a lot of people don't necessarily want to see or don't understand that there's a direct connection between what's happening in terms of the riots and in terms of the protest and the the kovat it's related narrative lee it's related in terms of of general apocalypticism right that's what's that that's most of what's going on the sense that either the this system is falling apart it's going to end or that the system has to end that we will be part of its dismantling and then there then what we haven't seen yet but which is coming and we've seen some hints of it actually in chicago there were some hints of it where it's going to be people resisting and saying no we don't want to dismantle this system and we're going to fight to stop it and so it's not it's looking it's not looking it's not looking like a bright like a bright future no and i was talking to somebody earlier today and i i said you know this could kind of go a number of different ways we could either like we were saying you know you never know that you're living in a moment of history until you look back on it right well everybody's saying this is a historic moment and i said well that's certainly possible i mean two of the options are that we could either you know find a great solution and move forward in this like way of peace and have like a 1964 civil rights act moment where things get healed you know at least enough for the moment to be able to move forward right or we could break out into open civil war the third option is the thing peters out and we look back and we're like oh remember that thing that happened yeah that was weird you know i mean i don't think so but you know i think the movement the fact that the movements whether it's kovat or it's the race riots that there's that there global is something that we haven't seen in our generation yeah yeah we'll see we'll see how it goes i don't think i think that because it's also an election year i don't see this changing at least for the near future so we're gonna have to strap on its i had it's a weird visit at the beginning of the year i said i tell people this year you guys get ready for this year because it's going to be crazy but i didn't expect all of it i didn't expect so much tick to come together so oh my goodness it i feel like i'm living in a movie i can't believe it you know well the images of the protestors wearing masks it really looks like like a science fiction movie like like like a post-apocalyptic movie so yeah we are definitely the story is definitely ramping up yes and so the thing about the plague is that it it came there was a lot of upheaval during the time of the plague and we don't people don't remember that so much there was a lot of peasant revolts and there was a lot of let's say people from the higher classes who were being you know killed just being stopped and stopped on the road and being killed and there were revolts like actual you know yeah civil war type revolts within the peasants after that during the time of the plague and especially after after the first wave right right like the peasants revolt of 1381 and and i think what's interesting is that i mean there's just so many parallels but you know you had in like 1315 you had the great famine right and so the parents of the people the parents of let's say the young people during the plague had experienced their own trauma you know with the great famine where like a significant amount of the population of europe died in that because of i think it was the end of the medieval warm period so you had this like climate change event and catastrophic famine like that oh an already kind of weakened population right and then into that comes the pandemic and then into that comes the civil unrest yeah you know and so it's interesting that you brought up the revolts - because one of the things that has been fascinating to me is the degree to which the plague was responsible for the birth of the modern world yeah very much so the renaissance is a direct descendant of the plague or a react - the plague as well because one of the things that happened during the plague is that a lot of the institution's also broke down you know the catholic church institutions broke down the level of of learning in the clergy went way down and so you so you can understand how at the time of the renaissance people also they'd forgotten the 12th century i mean they forgotten how glorious the 12th century was and they were like oh no where where this is it like this is the renaissance where we were being born out of out of his very very dark time which is mostly the time of the plague mostly the time ages so he's saying that like the renaissance was sort of a short-sighted i think so yeah so that like they were reading reading darkness into the whole time before then that wasn't there i think so well i mean the whole idea that real real darkness of the time before was more was came later during the enlightenment you know right the term dark ages and all this type of terminology came in but i think there was already some some sense of that in the time of the time of the renaissance you know because they were also unearthing all these things from the from the ground you know they were taking out all these statues they were kind of bringing up all this this very old past and you know and also they were breaking away from constantinople you can see in some of the writings of the renaissance artists that they talk about moving away from the from the like the eastern way of painting you know that they were doing it deliberately they wanted to move away from that type of painting so there was a lot of things there was definitely a lot of things going on but did like if you look at 12th century culture it was so radiant i mean it was really all the gothic i mean is there anything more european than gothic architecture and that's all comes from the 12th century i mean is there anything more like soaring of for the human spirit you know even now to walk into a gothic cathedral and you feel your heart just rise to something so much higher than yourself you know even just like your eyes being drawn up you know and you know what came after that was everything was was an imitation of that basically until the enlightenment and that's no than everything kind of yeah there's definitely the new clinical the new classical move is really a i hate to say but the neoclassical move was always a kind of a weird anti christian move kind of desire to return to the pagans returned to the greeks returned to the ancients and kind of forget all that happened all the glory of the you know of the high middle ages i'd say the artistic accomplishments that were there so that's i'm definitely speaking i'm not speaking objectively i'm definitely speaking from my my side of the artistic battle well sure and you know i was actually thinking of you when i've been listening to the the audiobook of giorgio vasari z-- lives of the artists which i haven't touched since high school you know apr 10 2015 a completely different set of concerns from the humanist renaissance concerns yeah but he treated it instead as a primitive right yeah and i think but it's interesting because we're in a way where we've reached the end i guess of this we've kind of come even the modern the modern period like the the 20th century period was already a breakdown of the renaissance idea and already a breakdown of the ideals of the renaissance and so you can see in modern artists an inkling let's say and someone like kandinsky you can see an inkling of trying to recover a different type of artistic language and more algebraic language and more typifies language and so i think that right now most people have the capacity to understand what iconography is about they they're not as blinded as they were you know during the period where it's like i don't think they could have even imagined what this was about like what was this stupid art about but at the same time it acts as a weird it's funny because it acts as a myth a lot as a mythological backdrop for even the renaissance in in making the middle ages dark and in making them kind of this dark past that we're moving out of they ended up making it also a mythological backdrop out of which they ended up existing you know just just like just like if you read if you read greek architecture er a greek myth and everything to have this sense of this ancient time you know these this time of the gods at the time these time of the titans or the time before out of which we are we were not that but we're still it's kind of like our unconscious past that we're our imaginary times right and so you have all the fairy tales all the folk stories end up looking way more medieval in their structure the king right the castle the prince the princess all of this stuff is although i did continue into the modern age it really does have a medieval you know medieval root the dragon the trolls all the monsters all of this stuff is definitely more medieval and it's still there today i mean all the fantasy is really just treating the middle ages as a as a dream as a kind of mythological dream world right right and i'm just gonna plug something here first of all the fact that you mentioned kandinsky who was also a sinister barian oh really i didn't know yeah he was a it makes sense things about yeah but you know if there's any anybody watching or listening to this now who's a fantasy fan i call a cloud of outrageous blue fantasy adjacent okay so it is historical fiction yeah its historical fiction for sure but it does have this because it deals with perception and it deals with kind of magical thinking and it's written in sort of a magical realist style i think that you know people who enjoy fantasy will kind of like find a way into that but so have you read i think it's kazuo ishiguro is that am i saying his name right the one who the man who wrote as it remains of the day oh my gosh anyway he was gonna be no no i didn't well he wrote a book that you should definitely recall the buried giants okay and it is written at the moment where i think it's probably supposed to take place in the year maybe 600 okay and it's this kind of transitional point from when from the the when the saxons had come in and sort of like assimilated right so you have like this conflict between the saxons and the britons you know the britons bri t ons yeah yeah and as like britain culture is kind of dying out and saxon culture is rising right but the cool thing about it is that first you think you're reading a book of historical fiction but then there's a dragon and these like mythical realities are just kind of taken as commonplace mm-hmm and they they go to find this buried giant you know and so the book really becomes like about the death of the old world and they're like the death of dream time the death of that time before and the emergence of like what then is modern yea modern world right what's the right time to deal with it deal with it because the way that i talk about the middle ages is also the way that the celtic past when it plays for the saxon invasion because in the end your king is still going to be king arthur you know hundreds and hundreds of years later your king is still king arthur he's still he's still a celt none know despite the four he's still from that world so there's a sometimes an idea that he's roaming about that right he's like that he's a roman but in that time and so none so despite the fact that you pushed that aside you push it into the margins you know it still remains as your kind of mythical past yeah yeah and the burry jayant is actually a post arthurian legend so it has characters you know some of the knights the r3 and knights who are like three who are elderly now and they're dying out you know and it's set among this backdrop of like where there's still roman villas around right but they're they're ruined they're crumbling it's fascinating you would really love this book it's the sixth century really is one of them for me one of the most fascinating moments yes you know when i when i think of a period of time that i wish i could have visited that's really that's when yeah i know yeah yeah i think sometime in the future i'm gonna wind up writing i think that a cloud about rageous blue i have in mind that it would be part of the trilogy with a modern-day version and then going all the way back to either that you know six hundreds time or maybe to like 600 bc you know like pre roman britain or or maybe rome madrid i don't know but i just i think that what strikes me about all of this like i get to england whenever i can it's it's my happy place and when i'm there i i feel the memory of the land hmm you know and part of what interested me about writing about this time period when it was going to be this other book was when you go to a place of worship in england you quickly discover that it it's always been a worship site hmm you know before it was a christian worship site it was a pagan worship site you know you'll have these healing wells you know these holy wells we're not just you know a saint is associated with it but then like a pagan figure is associated with it as well you know so they did a good job at integrating their you know their past but the romans and the greeks did too but then they just imposed it everybody else like the romans also did a really good job at integrating their past and then they they tried to impose it on yeah it's pride imposing on on england which is really insane it's so far removed it's like why you tried to impose this weird roman thing on us i don't know yeah yeah totally so so i'm interested to know you're more of your thoughts on okay so if we're if we look at the plague as sort of like the birth of the modern world and then this backdrop of you know what they labeled as the dark ages you know the time before and then i mean gosh you can just trace a straight a completely straight line from plague to renaissance to enlightenment to you know 20th century even 20th century genocide you know history the industrial revolution scientific revolution and all of that right even the birth of modern medicine from the plague you know are you familiar with gita sholay ack he so he was i think the pope's physician in avignon and he contracted the plague and he experimented on himself hmm try to find you know remedies for it obviously using like you know gallons poor humors you know hugh merrick method but he he survived right and the whole time he documented his experiments right i mean that's the birth of modern medicine in my opinion you know that like application of experiment and scientific method right so with all that being said that's straight line being traced do you think that we're like in another cycle of that and we're on that cycle do you think we are like you mentioned that in chicago like this is playing out exactly how you well no i i just said i when i talked about chicago which is good i saw an article about seeing some seeing because until now we've seen the protests and the we've seen the riots and then i there was also some articles about you know young men with baseball bats just hanging out trying to wanting to stop people from coming into the neighborhoods so i was like if that stuff starts to happen which seems inevitable at this point then it's just going to become like you said just can become a low-key civil war at first and then when the when the military the national guard the police are feel forced to take sides and it's going to get really messy so messy so it's a different it's a very different situation in that in that sense is different from at the time of the plague in the time of the plague you really i mean because of the plague and because of the social chaos then all of a sudden the serfs had flexibility right and they also because the the so many people died then there the value of their work went up dramatically and so there it's one of the times in ancient you know in the ancient times when the lower-class had the most money because they were so in much in demand you know all the know all the nobles were looking for serfs to work on their land and so they tried to keep them on the land because the serfs were bound to the land they just couldn't because it was like we are what are you gonna do you know it's like the world is empty of people right you know so it was it was a week and it's interesting because it's actually i talked about this in a recent video we tend to think that revolts happen when people are desperate and that is actually i don't think that's actually totally true i think revolts happen actually when when people are a little better off yeah i mean they have room to to maneuver in the middle yeah sorry so yeah so after the plague the peasants had more power than they that they had had in the last few centuries and that's what gave them the possibility to to revolt at least in that that situation right because you you have 40 years between the plague and the peasants revolt with 35 years maybe so it's not in the middle of the plague where everybody's dropping dead that's just the fear part that's the that's the crisis moment but then when you have some ability to reflect then comes in the racal yeah and also it's it was also it was also economic because they did have the possibility all of a sudden right now they weren't bound anymore the nobles didn't have the capacity to to kind of hold them to their land and so they had freedom movement they were making more money there was a lot of land like just veil of a land you can just take land and do stuff and so then they didn't want to they just didn't they wanted to have their own thing they didn't want to submit any more so which is totally understandable you know you can also see why that would happen yeah yeah i mean this is that's this is a whole other tangent but like you know i kind of think i mean with my limited knowledge i'm not a historian i'm just a historical fiction writer but it seems to me like that's the birth of the individual in western culture mm-hmm you know when we when well yeah well the revolt yeah the revolts like when the serf becomes untied to the to the community like to the communal structure and can branch off on his own you know go like seek his fortune in the in the kind of you know and then it's a fairy tale sense right but then you have like almost a theology of the individual that kind of emerges into the modern world right and the concept of individual rights or like bargaining for your labor for your wage you know think about it's interesting to think about yeah yeah we have to think about it more it's possible that it there's definitely something happening in the late middle ages which seemed to be sparking some of that you know yeah yeah i'm not saying it emerged out of nowhere but just that the conditions were right for that to kind of come to fruition yeah yeah yes but it's it's weird to compare the two to the two now because it's everything now is happening in real time and it's okay press and is so accentuated because on the one hand the let's say the disease we had it has nothing to do with the plague i don't care what people say people did die but it there's nothing compared to what what's happening in the place every other person right exactly it's not it's it's not even you know it's 1% of the population it's not through deep 30% or 50% of the population yeah and so that is true and then the the level of inequality is also nothing to do with socio-economic inequality than what we would have seen in the in the middle ages and so on the one hand everything is very everything nothing is as intense but it just seems very intense because of our media apparatuses and our social media apparatus is and you know i had to like i yesterday i'm like i need to get off twitter because it was gonna drive me crazy the girls gonna completely drive me insane it was poor me feels i feel like i was being pulled in all these different directions getting angry for both sides getting angry this side that side and then thinking okay no i need to stop or else i'm just gonna i'm gonna lose my mind yeah i dumped my twitter at the new year yeah and it was honestly it was the best thing that i could have done for my mental health i cannot imagine with the stresses that are on everybody right now if i were on twitter i might have a breakdown i mean it's already i've i've had so i've had a series of dreams during this whole thing i had a dream before the pandemic about the pandemic mm-hmm directly i mean it had to do with waves and you know the elderly and i mean everything was just like clockwork and i've been watching it play out exactly like my dream but i you know i've also how did you dream finished vesper how did it finish let me to tell you i'll tell you the dream it's go for because we need a prophet right now okay well okay so i was on a back patio which doesn't it's my dream house my fictional house right sitting on a back patio and i noticed this window box and it's full of these spring flowers like huge azaleas and daffodils and stuff and i i thought it was the middle of winter but all of a sudden its spring and it's this abundance of spring so i go and i stick my face in the flowers and i'm like awesome a zhing spring is emerging it's it's so incredible and then i go and take a seat on the patio and i noticed that next to my hat was a little beyond my house is a river that i never knew was there before oh how interesting there's there's a river and i notice the river starting to rise and i thought oh gosh i think it's gonna flood instead of flooding it turns into a tidal wave and it crashes over the patio and it's saltwater from a river mm-hmm and it's bitter you know and but it doesn't ever get into the house it tumbles the patio furniture around you know my mother and father-in-law were there with me we kind of got knocked off our feet a little bit but then it receded we picked up the furniture again and i looked over and i noticed that those flowers that had been so abundant there a minute before we're completely gone as if they had never existed mm-hmm right no sooner did we kind of dust ourselves off then a second wave comes yeah and this wave was not as severe as the first one but it still it came at you know flooded the patio and this time it did get a little bit into the kitchen where my father-in-law was cooking something and then i woke up and i told my husband about it at the time and i said what do you think this means because we we really do believe in dreams and we've been we've made major life decisions based on dreams we've had and it's been the right thing kind of when you know it's that kind of dream you know yeah and he had some thoughts about it for himself and i thought i don't think that's really what it means but i kind of put it down for a while and right when lockdown happened so i think that was in january sometimes that i had that dream and march you know 12th or 13th comes around because the lockdown starts and my kids go to out of school and i'm standing there doing the dishes and i thought of that scripture that says that the lord doesn't do anything without telling his prophets something like that you know and i i just kind of prayed i was like god why didn't you tell anybody but this was gonna happen and he goes i gave you a dream remember that dream i gave you that was that you know so i was like oh okay and i haven't gone around like trumpeting it or anything like that but it's been very instructive to me to kind of keep me calm and level mm-hmm know to say okay well this is what i can expect and so far it's played out exactly like that you know i think the spring flowers had to do with the economy you know things like that anyway so but at the same time that i've been feeling this sense of calm and you know things playing out as they are going to play out i found myself with like an enormous amount of anxiety and i don't suffer from anxiety or depression but i've had a couple of anxiety attacks in the stores some of it related to wearing the mask yeah you can't breathe yeah not only that but but you can't see people's expressions yeah and that's that is just deeply anti-human hmm you know to not be able to see anybody's expression or read their demeanor that's that's very deeply like wounding to the psyche of the populace you know what i mean so anyway yeah so for the people who are watching maybe we can decode some of the elements of your dreams so that they or you can understand it yes give me a symbolic well right so you're you're you're sorry the first thing is of course the the idea of the of the water you know and it's important that the water is salty because the salty water is different from fresh water and so you have this river an extra house but it ends up being ends up being salty bitter like you said and so bitter waters in the bible is exactly that it's the waters of chaos it's the waters that you can't use really that's why it's a sometimes i tell people salt waters it's an image of chaos it's not arbitrary it's it's the image of chaos because you can't drink it it's not it's not it's not it's not palatable for the human person right it's a waste it's just this chaos and so the obviously the wave coming in it's it's interesting that so then your house ended up playing the role of a little arc which is which mass which makes sense because that's what an house is in a way that's what the ark was as well it was like the preservation of of square possibility right of structure within a kind of uprising chaos right and so the fact that the the way didn't get in it just it's a very good sign you know like she said so he destroyed the fruits but he didn't destroy the structure exactly and let me just interject here for a second the only thing that it it did affect were the temporary structures right the patio the patio furniture which isn't even real furniture right that's also it's also the the idea of a patio or the idea of a patio report or something like that it really is this notion of it's kind of like the extension of structure into the outside but it's it's a marginal extension right yes it's kind of the effect of the structure but it's not it's not the house it's not where you you don't go there to be safe you want you you kind of extend yourself out into the natural world and so the idea of the of the flowers and of the patio you know it has to do with the fruits of of the structure so it's good to see that it's good to think because i also you know when i have the same feeling of when the the pandemic kid i had the same feeling because at first i thought i was getting ready i thought okay this is gonna be massive i'm gonna lose my commissions people are going to stop supporting me on patreon i'm gonna lose like basically i was expecting my revenue to massively go down because of the pandemic and then and i was like okay interesting i mean obviously some people who probably struggle financially kind of went away and some people put off their commissions for later but you know it didn't end up having a massive effect on on the like the basic frame of my life rom but for sure in terms of in terms of the fruits of civilization that's for sure that it definitely is having a major effect and it had a major effect on people's mental health that is for certain yes yes i mean i've seen i've been really surprised in the past few weeks to around me to encounter suicide suicide of people friends like a lot of suicide either directly or in people who know other people and also people mental breakdowns like yes real mental people who just go crazy and leave for three days i know and live in their car because can't deal with it you know a lot of that stuff going on yeah yeah i mean i like i said i don't struggle with mental illness thank god but i felt myself you know praying at the edges and you know one of the anxiety attacks that i had was i was in target you know and i'm walking around thinking to myself people are you could feel it palpably like people were so on the edge mentally that i thought it's really surprising that somebody hasn't cracked by now and there there haven't been like several mass shootings well this was three days before the riots started so ya call that prescient or call back you know reading the writing on the wall of what was kept what was happening but yeah i mean i know a few people who had expressed that they were having suicidal thoughts and these weren't it wasn't because they had lost jobs no it's more than that it's it's more of a kind of a weird breakdown of everything and and the social isolation yeah it's more like you said it's more than just economic it's it's actually has to do with the very like the fear and the very idea of self isolating and you we started now seeing some friends just in the past few weeks and oh my goodness i mean then you realize just how much you need to be with people like yeah you know because when you're you're just living your life and you see friends and you live your life you go to church you do this you don't realize just how much you need it in order to stay sane but when it goes away then ya feel the difference yeah and i was thinking about you too because i'm reading the book sacred pathways by gary thomas and he talks about you know different people having different spiritual personalities let's say right so you have the the naturalist who really finds god in nature and you know whatever and and the traditionalist who finds god through the you know the smells and bells let's say and then somebody like me who's more of a sense eight you know i really encounter god through the tangible making of things and but also a little bit of a traditionalist in that sense so i was thinking about you at one point during the quarantine in thinking about church and we haven't really been able to like we moved to where we live now like three years ago and we haven't been able to settle into a church and one of them that we did visit was in an orthodox church in my area and so i was wondering like without like it is so communal the orthodox experience and so sensory that if that were my normal expression i'd really just be hurting for that right now so i was wondering like how how are you functioning in your church community without do you have how do you do online shirt oh yeah yeah they do they do i was really i was really involved during the time just before easter like during holy week and leading up to easter i was very very involved but it's just very difficult oh i just find it very difficult and and alienating and so to be honest i i've gone to a few services since since pasca but not a lot because it's just so and we're not taking communion and so it's just very odd the whole thing is very odd and and so i really hope that this is going to end soon but just like in the u.s. i i guess here in quebec religious services are way down on the line of priority they don't consider them important at all so so i don't know how it's gonna and everybody is trying to be a good christian and obey the law and to be you know to be respectful of the authorities but it's it's pushing the limits yeah well i will see how it will see how it plays out we haven't yet nothing has we haven't had been having services at all even online or yeah they have online services it's like what exactly is that now yeah with it without the communal aspect of it then it's it's just no it doesn't make sense i wonder do you think that at some point people are started gonna start having clandestine masses masses i think they probably already are maybe no one has told me i'm sure the clergy are we know with people that are very very close to them and so i just haven't necessarily been in the loop maybe and dubai might be a little far from where i am even if there is so so getting back to sort of the symbolic nature of all this right like if you if you deconstruct the church gathering right where the communal gathering the ability to be together what do you think that does to us what does what's going on right now it does exactly that so one of the things that happened you know and is that the the quarantine the quarantines took away all the places where people were able to one come together because let's say we took away churches but those that aren't religious they still had things like restaurants things like coffee shops or sports as well where the place of identity and and communion and so they took away that then they took away also the the sports is important i know that people would think it's secondary but for me i don't care about sports i'm not interested in sports but for most for a lot of people sports are a a few a place to fuel your aggressive tendencies you you put in your aggression into your team and your team defeating other teams then therefore it sublimates your your aggression you know yeah and and it's been like this forever right it's right that's in a part with the gladiators before you know right sublimate your your aggression and so and then express a catharsis yes because it's a communal catharsis of violence right is really would but it ends up being and and you can criticizes all you want but if you take it away then you end up with what we've got now and so you end up with a pseudo religious actions where people are using all religious tropes right tropes of scapegoating tropes of catharsis tropes of violence of contrition all the tropes that i'm finding in religion are now the only place where it is permitted yes this is crazy the only place where it is permitted is in these in these protests and so in in all over the united states you have the situation where the authorities are telling people you still need to to self isolate you still you can't go to church you can't go to restaurants you can't do all any of this but but you can ban protests and yeah i'm sure it almost like you should go these things so it's almost you know i hate be looking like a conspiracy theorist but it looks like all of people's all of people's religious drive is being fueled into this thing and then people are going along with it because they need to vent that themselves and i don't think that that sounds conspiratorial at all i think that's natural human tendency to want to fill fill any vacuum right the politicians want to fill the power vacuum you know like you're saying people want to fill the religious vacuum so i i went to a protest in new york last week to stand with some friends and it was my first time out of my town in four months but i'm a native new yorker you know so going back to my city was really meaningful to me but i also felt kind of alienated from it so and i haven't spoken about this publicly because i am in a posture of listening right now i'm not well one thing's for sure i'm not going to say other people's words hmm i'm not going to say other people's words until i fully understand them and then at at such point if i feel that they're my words too then i will say them but i'm anyway i'll get there so i caught up with you know walked into the area where the protest was happening and this was a rally that was going to turn into a march and it was peaceful it was not there's no writing however riots had just happened that the night before so i walk into the crowd i enter the crowd and immediately i was struck with the sense that i was in this kind of movie type caricature of a catholic mass and i couldn't there was no there's in foley square where this rally was taking place there is a monument and i thought okay surely somebody must be up there on the monument kind of directing this right but i couldn't hear any there was no pa system or anything like that it seemed to be completely decentralized but out of the crowd would suddenly erupt this chant you know no justice no peace or f trump or whatever it was you know and but it was like plug it in say the phrase unplug it was eerie it was very creepy actually and then the next cue was everyone's fists went up unplug it's over the next cue was everybody kneeled and i thought this is weird just this is a religion this is totally enacting a religious right and just like if you're a cradle catholic or whatever and you you don't even meet you don't even need to be fully conscious of what the priest is saying you just intuitively know when to sits down and kneel when to say the our father when to you know that's what this was like and what really struck me jonathan was that this rally in particular was i would say in the end 85 percent white people and i i don't know what to make of that you don't know what to make of the fact that happening know that it's that it is it seems to me to be driven by white people yeah at least in my in my experience yeah and that's brought up questions for me of a lie ship like the definition of a lie and the meaning really the meaning of the word a lie i've been trying to sit with that and deconstruct it and it seems to me that an ally is somebody who's across is on the other side of a border from you right is across the ocean from you who you you you make a mutual agreement to come to each other's defense right that's not a friend though like that's not an intimate relationship you know and i think that the term of a lie has come to stand in for like a like a believed intimacy that isn't really there you know what i'm saying one of the it's one of the problems is one of the problems that day that the people in that protest like these 85 percent white people the problem that they have is that they have to enact their their their narrative they have to enact it and let's say yeah so the did upper class the upper class rule white guessin right yes they they have embraced the emancipatory narrative right because that's our narrative like the the emancipatory narrative of the french revolution of the revolution the revolution idea the idea of you know the underdog coming up and and you know rising up and removing the removing the the people above them and so this is not just it's not just a racial thing right now its rights happening in a with a racial overtones but it's not it's feminism it's yeah it's it's you know it's it's basically like a kind of communist id ideal let's say of the lower classes coming up and taking and taking power and so they they have fully accepted that narrative yet they're the rich they're the elites okay they interact their narrative they have to flagellate dad to sell flagellate yes it's the only way to it's the only way for their narrative to actually to actually make sense right yeah they give up their power which they're not going to do yeah or they just flagellate in public in order to to signal that they are that they agree with this narrative but that they're not going to give their houses to a black family you like that's not gonna happen right or okay i'll get there so growing up in new york is a very very very different experience than transplanting to new york from the midwest and i'm gonna i'm gonna make people angry by saying this okay but this is what i do there there's there's a certain type of person who moves to new york who's whose daddy pays full tuition to nyu or whatever school columbia a certain type of person who comes from the suburbs and deeply resents their conservative upbringing or what have you or feels deeply guilty that their parents were both doctors or something like that comes to new york to try to kind of shed all of that and like live this kind of authentic experience you know what i mean and i've been encountering more and more people like that over the years and i find it deeply alienating i because what they don't understand that they're doing is pushing out communities that have been there for generations some of those communities you know that i grew up in and and convincing themselves that they are allies or speaking for people who they may have met somebody from that community when they're for the first time when they're 25 mm-hmm you know and so the the thought that people would do this and enact not just i'm not going to give up my house for a black person but i'm actually going to take a brick and put it through the window of the black business and for the community if you want to know why twitter was driving me crazy it was watching those those punk antipa kids destroying that community like i just it just made me so angry you know i was like i so sorry that's one of the reasons why i twitter was there any crazy was just watch that happen and to thank again you're doing that in the news like what yeah you're insane right right and so and so isn't that in a sense what an ally would do in that like let's take it from a military perspective right an ally would come and drop bombs in a country that they may be trying to liberate yeah yeah yeah yeah right that's that's a good analogy that's what the us has done in the middle east you know to liberate countries they destroy them right you look at syria my goodness yeah damascus is has been completely leveled so yeah no i i agree i agree with your ear analysis and i but it's there's a blindness because it's ideological the thing about that's a problem with with the thing about the problem with symbolism and it's a problem with also with the way that i think is that the when you're dealing with symbolism we're dealing with categories with which coagulate right so you have characteristics which coagulate into categories and you notice them but you have to also be careful of its effects yes you know because what happens in when you idealize these idea it's like i'm an ally of black people but that there are no there is no black people you only encounter actual individuals you only encounter individuals there is no like you can't encounter the category you only encounter people and so when people get attached it's like you know it's like that idea of the of the common man or the working man and there's an amazing one of my favorite scenes in movies is in the cohens brother movie what's the name of the the barton fink where barton fink is like is a writer who writes plays about the common man and he's talking to a like a salesman and he's telling him about the common man and the common man the sales like yeah i could tell you some stories and he's like yeah yeah yeah yeah and this is exactly what's happening with narratives about the working class right yeah yeah although it's only hilarious because that a lot of the rich elite types they you would hate the working class they do hate the working class they do because the problem with the working class a lot of the working class guys are just regular guys they'll say things which don't at all politically correct all the time and so you on the one hand you want you want to defend them but on their if you actually met someone who's like that you would you would see only their faults because it right christine political correct rain so how do you how do you deal with that right and the working class is not just people of color and the working class is not just white people it's everybody it's most people most people are working class yeah it's just so disconnected reality yeah for sure that's definitely one of the reasons why we're seeing it happened but i think understanding this can really help you understand why it has to be it has to be symbolizing religious patterns and use as you know that people will act out these things it's the same thing like i hate to say it but it's the same thing with recycling like recycling is also taken on a religious overtone because all these people who are living like kings and queens which it's like i'm not even gonna criticize that but then at the same time they think that we're destroying the environment so how do you do it how do you do it well you need to have a way to to atone for your sins and so you have to recycle like if you don't recycle then you're evil because i it's not that i'm evil if those that don't recycle that are evil yeah so but then it doesn't make does it really make a difference like our like here in quebec i have a one of my family members he's really into in construction and works in this in that world and he says you know half those recycle recycling trucks they just go to the dump they just go straight to the dump and so it ends up being just a a kind of gesture of atonement yeah anyways so speaking of performance art what happened my friend steven roach says that you know you know that liturgy is performance art you know that we are it's it's deeply important that we reenact you know these things well it matters what you reenact this pose but so what do you think okay because i just started this podcast about artistic thinking and i'm trying to give people an alternative to the political worldview kind of similar what you're doing in terms of the symbolic world but i want to help people to to get in touch with their own critical thinking capacities right as coming from specifically from the point of view of an artist right so as a fellow artist what you think that we have to offer in this moment well the best things i think that artists have to offer is that their capacity to understand that the world needs image and narrative like that the world manifests itself through image and story and so we understand that because we experience it because when you're trying to draw something you have to make decisions about what you're going to leave out and what you're going to put in because the world is too big to complicate it and it's the same with a story when you're telling a story you you know that you know that there is no neutrality in our perception that our perception is qualified by narrative and an image you have to you have to decide which elements which which events are you going to choose to put together in order to tell a story and so i think that because of that if we are aware of that we we have a we're almost like magicians we have a magical power and if we understand it then we can we can probably use our magical power for good and not also also understand that it's not arbitrary and it and it does matter the stories we tell do matter and so you know a lot of you know it's because you can be a magician you can also you can tell twisted stories to to gain very very pointed attention because it works right just like passions are very pointed and will get your attention then stories that are extremely pointed and twisted will also get attention but i think that as artists who want to kind of be part of a healing process or help the world return to logos or return to the the idea of of god and creation meeting somehow then we have to be attentive to the story we retell and we can tell we can change the world with our stories yeah you know like i keep telling people about no let's say we as 20th century christians i say we have we have tokine and lord of the rings and what's interesting about him is that his is the imagination structure imaginal structure of our of the modern world it's the lord of the rings yeah all the video games all the comic books all the all the fantasy novels all of this all harry potter all of it could not exist without the the pattern that token gave the 20th century and so he told the story that was so big that it sunk and and and and one of the ways you know that it is that powerful is that elites don't like it the elysa really don't like lord of the rings they think it's a it's a badly written you know that it's kind of amateurish or whatever and that's even better it's like yeah yeah yeah just like they thought scripture was written in bad greek you know it's like that's fine that's fine that's that those that are able to connect the highest stories with the lowest let's say manifestations they're the ones who win in the end because they they sink into the into the pattern of reality and so i think that that's what the power we have we really have that power and we can see in the 20th century those that have used that power i would say for evil or to twist and to to make the problem worse but there are also a few shining examples of people that that are participating in the in the healing so that's what we should i think that's what we should be doing yeah yeah agreed i think i think that artists have been i mean artists have always had a political bent of course but i think what we've seen in maybe the last couple decades is that artists have really been co-opted by the political worldview like to an extreme degree but there are some of us outliers you know who are still staying connected to that narrative structure and i like what you say often about that you know that jesus or the logos like fills the whole narrative structure the whole hierarchy from top to bottom you know and that you can never get you can never exhaust that you know you never get away from that and those of us that are stay connect to whether were christians or not but to that concept that's just such a deeply artistic way to see the world and i think it's very hopeful yeah i think so too i think there's one little dream that i had last night that i wanted to share with you and get your okay so one of the things that i noticed in the protests that i attended was that there was no music and right so as much as it was following this very kind of religious structure there was no music and even the i would even go so far as to say there was very little creativity so the signs all said the same thing the signs were just the usual slogans there weren't i'm familiar with protests this is not my first rodeo you know and and i followed i i'm a martin luther king girl like dyed-in-the-wool you know so protest is not new to me signage marches these are not new things in my life so when i have been two previous protests i'm so used to the artists really coming forth and taking the opportunity to get creative with their signage now i understand that this is all very like sudden and raw and so we haven't had the time to process and come up with you know really creative like slogans and things like that but i just really was struck by it seemed devoid of a spirit of creativity to me right okay so that's the backdrop so i've been thinking a lot about like what made the civil rights movements so powerful and so successful in its aims at the time and one of those things was music whether it's you know the spirituals that would be sung during protests or whether it was you know protest songwriters like bob dylan you know or woody guthrie or odetta you know people singing these songs of protest and you can buy records so saw of protest from the 60s and stuff right i've been asking myself how is that going to emerge again like what is the song of this current movement is there one okay so that's the backdrop so last night i had this very brief dream where i was at some kind of like church dinner or conference dinner or something and people were milling around socializing it didn't have any real form and i sat down at a keyboard and i started to play this song this protest song called lift every voice and sing and it's sometimes called the black national anthem and it's a song that i grew up with a song that we sang in school and i was trying to figure out the you know i'm playing the music for it but i couldn't remember the words so there's somebody sitting next to me on the piano bench and i turn to him and it's dr. martin luther king and i turned to him and i said oh do you remember the words to the song and he didn't say anything he just sort of it's hard to describe it he kind of gestured with his presence to the fact that i had a stack of books in my hand and at the bottom of this stack of books was the book of poetry lift every voice and sing and so i opened the book and i put it up on the piano stand and instead of having the words listed you know on one page like that would make it easy to be able to sing it at the piano the words were running at the bottom of every page of the book so you'd have to keep turning the page and turning the page to get all the lyrics and then i woke up okay so jonathan pezzo which i think it means i don't know i'd have to think about it it's not it's not obvious it's not obvious at all right in terms of what you're saying yeah hmm i don't think about it because i nothing comes to nothing comes to mind one of the things though that i might want to say in terms of the fact difference between the civil rights movement and and now is it it is very different because in the civil rights movement there was active opposition to the goal the protest whereas today i don't i understand the anger of the moment because it was a horrifying thing to see you want horrifying to watch that and i can only understand it but the the goal i don't see anybody opposing it like i don't see resistance i don't see the authorities saying no we're gonna keep you down like all right so it's it seems to me it seems different than trying to remove segregation and jim crow rules it i don't totally so i don't understand there isn't at all a sense massive corporations are all coming in favor all the levels of government even though people hate trump trump came right away and said this guy should be should be arrested and everybody everybody agrees that what happened is horrible and that and he has been and the and the police officer has been right and his wife left him and and the whole his whole world is over right and so and so and so it's very different because it doesn't then look like the same kind of protest we saw before it really does look more like a kind of religious atonement of some kind some kind of massive religious atonement for something and so it's i don't know i just find a different and that might also be why we don't we're not going to find music that is let's say specific of this this protest because our whole culture is that i think our whole culture is aesthetically in tune with what the people want like this idea of racial equality of of the value of black culture of the value and so i don't i mean i there are exceptions but sure and there are all but i mean in terms of a thrust its it that seems to be the the culture and so i and so i struggle to see how there could be some kind of let's say graffiti graffiti rebellious art that could be there that hasn't already been expressed right right it's like public enemy made millions of dollars selling their albums and that was in the 80s and that was a long time ago and kendrick lamar is a multi multi multi-millionaire and and the people and and his movies are and marta his music is in marvel movies right so the images that would maybe represent this movement are not marginal anymore yeah i wonder if the work that you're doing and to some extent the work that i'm doing is actually the work of rebellion you mean you know what i mean the i mean doing work from the work from meta-narratives like three and and figurative work and i wonder if that is that is the rebellion well i i tend to think that i mean i tend to think that a restoring restoring a fuller world view yes is in a way as the is the most it's both the most it's both an act of restoring a form of order but also restoring the possibility of transgression you know i always tell people it's like i understand the margin better than you guys do yeah and i understand it i understand its value and its role and i talk about it all the time yeah but i also understand the problem with the margin and the difficulties that are there just like i understand the problem and the the the value of authority and so i think that restoring a more fuller vision of the world can maybe help us but you know honestly it might be too late that's as i say that but i mean iii right now i'm thinking a remnant it will be enough you know but i don't see i don't see massive i don't see it having a massive effect at least not at this time yeah yeah i'm i think your work on the margins has really helped me to understand i mean i've i've never left the margins i've lived on the margins my whole life and i don't there's nowhere that i fit i'm politically homeless and all of that but i said in one of my episodes recently it's like living always living in the lobby and never the sanctuary but i have a deep connection to the sanctuary and i have a deep connection to the parking lot you know but i'm in the lobby yeah yeah but but there's a place there's a deeply important place for the margin and for the lobby and for the the narthex you know for the ability to people for people to pass through you to one side or the other and i've come to very deeply appreciate that that that is who i've been made to be and who i'm called to be as an artist as a christian because the other the other structure that lives in the margin is a bridge yeah and hey i welcome that totally that's great that's great well we have we've been going for a while i think i think this is a good place to stop i think so yeah i wish you the best with your book and i've started i started reading it i haven't finished but i but i definitely kind of dove in and so i'm looking forward to seeing to sing to learning more about it and i wish you the best maybe when it comes out and everything we could have another conversation oh that'd be great and hopefully the world may have taken a deep breath by then yeah let's hope yeah all right vapor is good to talk to you youtube thanks janitor right okay
