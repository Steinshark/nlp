stop transferring things to me i have like 15 people in my queue something's ringing i hear noises holy crap this is a nightmare i don't have a fish cutris is asking me to solve his wall of text problem it may be hard to believe but it has been a full year since colton got a real job i want to hire you oh i can pay you in nft nfts karen gave some great advice whatever the problem is just throw your computer out the window and then you won't have any more problems also you can try microwaving it i mean i'll do that right now and i personally answered your tech support troubles one-on-one through 3cx's phone system and guess what we're doing it again but this time it's a head-to-head competition between me and jake to see who can solve the most of your issues in just one

with oh damn it i typoed it bad service phone keeps turning on and off have you tried not pressing the power button it doesn't turn on the apple logo appears on a black screen but it never boots on and it keeps cycling have you tried contacting apple about the problem yeah but what they say don't work they wanted to go to recovery mode but that don't work it don't really connect to my computer what do i do you don't connect it to your computer but it's iphone could i fix the brick it's possible but that would be something apple would have to advise you on i'm afraid this might require new hardware can i put it in rice no that's not going to do anything unless you dropped it in water and even then it probably won't do anything sorry there's not much else i can do for you can i mark this issue resolved the challenge is to solve people's problems but we will accept a no solution answer if the customer is satisfied unfortunately andrew was left still hungry for answers at least he had some rice to solve his hunger issues my nzxt aio makes loud clicking noises on my cpus and are having lows i think it's an air bubble i'm not sure how to get it out i tried putting this still water but it did not help sounds like your aio is starting to die your best bet is going to be contacting nzxt i guess i've had like so many aos die on me are you satisfied with this i'm done i've done one i've done one yes oh i got a new fish oh crap i typoed it again i only have 2.5 of my five acres blanket in and wi-fi i want to add long range outdoor access points to the front and rear so i can do yard work while streaming tech tips do you have a poe network switch no where's your main network switch in my house i have ethernet plumbed to most of my outbuildings and they all have google wi-fi points in them i have tp-link cp links to use to connect to the barn in the back and then i have a tp-link armada ac1200 that i want to install i've just been too lazy to do it okay i need another ac 1200 to run to the front yard okay give me a minute to think about this one okay here's my full street address you can check out the layout of the wi-fi points on google maps everything except a small barn in the back has an ethernet connection back to the main house and we have a total of six mesh wi-fi points but it's not enough okay the way to deal with this unfortunately is going to involve a commercial solution what's your budget are you available for a call timothy was not available for a call oh i got one do i have to read it like verbatim yes hello connor i would never say that be like what's up connor what's up connor my mouse always double clicks i've updated the drivers and tried different mice but it's the same result different mice in getting the same result huh that's a hard one you get double clicks even with different mice yep well brother this one this is hard have you tried the mouse on a different computer yes i have and it didn't have the same problem there is it every time or only occasionally not every time but it happens a lot not every time it happens a lot hmm oh weird usually when you have a double clicking issue it's because your mouse switch is broken or maybe like a firmware issue in the mouse but it's weird that he's having it a multiple mice do you have a spare disc somewhere disc as in cd or dvd it really does sound kind of like a driver or software issue so to rule it out you could reinstall windows on a different drive like a hard drive or an ssd and see if the issue persists huh i'll try that thanks so much i am satisfied with the solution yes cool okay i got rid of that one oh my gosh this is stressful there's so many chats i haven't even opened setting up port forwarding to host games for my pc the ports have been opened in the pc firewall and the router correct the same ports in both of them if your system has a firewall on it you will open the port it's called port forwarding so you can forward your external port so you pick one three three seven you could forward that to port 50 if you wanted that's why it's called forwarding most tutorials say to use the same or simplicity i'd probably follow that huh things are not looking for linus oh crap i'm gonna get a little overwhelmed here i'm gonna need a macro for hi what can i help you with how do i get back to stock android what the [ __ ] i think i have to transfer you to someone more transferring a call to your opponent gives them a point linus is hoping jake takes the bait odds are this will waste more of his time than it has of mine hi there isabel yes hello hi okay isabelle has two problems but she needs a bit of guidance first she's trying to uninstall mcafee an easy task that is made faster by assisting her through 3cx's video chat feature you were wondering how to uninstall mcafee have you ever uninstalled the program before a long long time ago i was maybe 12 messing around with a computer or something perfect okay so you're just gonna press the windows button okay windows button yep and then just start typing the word program it should bring up add or remove programs in the control panel all right so now what okay now click on that right below app list i see a list of apps i have perfect so you're gonna search for mcaf e e oh i found all three of them that i apparently have yep so there should be three little dots that's called the hamburger menu so you're gonna click that and there should be an uninstall you're gonna do those one at a time here uninstall okay one of them's taking its time but they're all good now you might have to do them one at a time because sometimes it can be a little bit fussy about uninstalling multiple programs at once awesome okay so sorry where are you at isabelle oh now that they are gone it's gone now okay so magazine's gone perfect okay you guys gotta stop transferring things to me i have like 15 people in my queue what was your other problem again i just wanted to see if there was anything i could do to help my laptop just not be like so hot all the time not really much i can do about that what model of laptop is it g5 dell something i don't believe dell has any kind of tool for adjusting your fan curve so that's just how it runs unfortunately do you suggest buying one of those cool things i used one of those metal a cool air gets conducted you know no they don't really do anything i'm afraid ah darn okay well i'm gonna have to let you go you have done an amazing job i don't know how to do everything so you do and thank you so much and thank you for all you do for everyone thanks isabel two problems two points we're counting it let's check in with jake and his transferred call i mean might need to refer this person to like google support line is transferred carson who rooted and flashed their pixel with pixel experience they're trying to get back to stock android but still daddy chips no way i don't care what his problem is if he can't solve it i don't even want to try [music] what is dr cutris doing here cutris is asking me to solve his wall of text problem tldr dr cutris is having issues booting into windows properly and when he does he can't use basic things like windows explorer the the risk of me providing tech support to you is that if i get anything wrong you're gonna totally call me on it if i had to guess i would say it's time to pull all the data off of that drive as quickly and safely as possible and never use it again because what i suspect based on that you've got some kind of very small very selective probably corruption is that it's either the drive or and this is this is a much worse case scenario it could be that your pcie controller on your cpu is getting out errors into your data which is not impossible but less likely i can go in through the login screen and i just get black with the mouse cursor open task manager and through task manager i can run every program except any of the fancy window those 10 windows the fact the os is still booting at all but you're not able to launch particular functions i used to be getting about one blue screen every two to three months for the last few years it sounds a lot like what you'd kind of run into if your storage got disconnected outright kind of temporarily and you could interact with anything that was in ram but as soon as you tried to grab anything from storage it's just like irk not there i am diagnosing bad controller but this is based on the very limited information that i have can i mark your issue resolved i'm not satisfied but you've done the best you can but you want me to send you a free ssd or what ian no i've got tons of ssds that my problem that you are as qualified if not more so than me to diagnose this issue do you think i've got it right i mean yes i would have accepted it go build a new pc maybe if i'd use our dims instead of consumer memory and then that's a conversation for zenfor absolutely all right thanks dude good enough rampant thermal issues i've been dealing with for a year and a half top-end system but i can't play anything that requires 3d rendering as the gpu overheats and shuts the pc down i wish i could like screen share with these people okay he's got to call me hello okay let's see this computer you shouldn't be having airflow problems i'm gonna be honest does that fan blowing into the side of it fix the problem it's a stop cap it allows me to play my mmo from a 1999. whereas even that would cause power issues so it's it is cooling it to an extent have you tried downloading like hardware info or yeah i've got hardware info nice background i like it oh yeah thanks so if you go to your gpu what are your temps like right now not really doing anything gpu 53.7 53.6 53.8 on value men and max if you scroll down a bit more you might be able to see the fan speed as well all right 97 and 995 if that's not nothing is it really hot in the room you're in it's very hot in here i live in texas 93 fahrenheit outside that's only like 34 degrees so that's not bad your computer shouldn't be overheating because of that if you load up a game have you watched the temp graph yeah it jumps to high 80s real fast because 80 is not that bad and they're going to start creeping into the 90s and and then by the time i realize that my system shut down so what's your cpu temperature at right now 59.1 59.00 you've got a huge fan blowing at them at this point if you're still having problems it seems like there's something else in the chain that's causing you issues that's why i want to check the temps of both your cpu and gpu while you're running and if what you end up having is a crash could potentially be power related i've actually seen people like have their computer on carpet and like when it heats up it chokes the power supply which causes it to shut off clearly you don't have that but if your power supply is under specked for the build that could cause problems and you said you tried a different gpu right yeah i've got a 6900 xt and the 3090 and you have the same problem on both exact same problems on both do you have anything that you could open up to like put a load on it maybe the heaviest heftiest game you got i mean again it was doing the exact same thing with the 6900 too maybe you're having an issue with precision boost overdrive it's kind of like automatic overclocking and certain chips that if you if you got kind of unlucky with the silicone lottery silicone silicon lottery you can end up with a chip that can't handle pbo i had the same issue on my 5900x go into your bios it'll be like a pbo setting or performance mode or something like that try setting that to off actually we could do this live but oh but we're gonna lose their call aren't we pro tip try not to call for tech support on the computer you're using tweet at me if it fixes your problem we'll do man we'll do all right i got a bunch more people to help thanks for talking derek yeah yeah sure man jake scores another point but he spent a lot of time on one call let's see how linus is doing hi there so mad or matthew you can go my man matthew pays for 400 megabit internet but he's only getting 90 on multiple wired devices his roommate's xbox has no issues and speeds over wi-fi can reach 420 megabit per second nice he he's changed out his network cable trying both cat 6 and cat 8 but to no avail so your xbox series x how are you testing that speed you're using like a built-in speed test or are you downloading games but downloading games and then also i just go into the system settings and then run the speed test on there what i suspect then is that you could have bad ports on your router have you tried switching the good port that's fast and connecting your xbox to that port that was my next cause honestly at that point regardless of the outcome it sounds like you might have some bad ports on your netgear router which is not the end of the world you can still use it as long as the wi-fi is good and as long as the routing functionality is working which it sounds like it is because your wi-fi is fast what i would do is i would just buy a cheap network switch and then you take that good port that's on your router plug that into your network switch and plug everything else into your network switch and then your golden nope it'll share that fast link all right thanks matt awesome thank you that was easy holy crap okay that's a scary one frederick is experiencing audio dropouts through his audio interface even when his core i7 is only under medium load he's changed sample rate buffer size cables even different audio interfaces but it's always the same result the only thing that helps is resetting his audio interface hello there hello the first question i have for you is have you tried different ports on your motherboard i have tried both different ports and i have tried a pcie usb 3.2 card as well oh boy 5960x should be able to handle this just fine yeah it's it's decent it's also overclocked a little bit not too much it's overclocked a little bit have you tried disabling your overclock at least temporarily to see if that solves it unfortunately it doesn't it doesn't and then you've tried reformatting is that correct yes i've tried that too cool it stumped me for like a long time i reached a point where i'm just like yeah i'll just live with it now have you contacted the manufacturer and explained the issue to them they couldn't find any good reason that it would happen they did say that they would put out a new driver that might fix it then i installed the new driver and of course it didn't have you made sure that you have the latest bios running on your motherboard latest bias latest drivers latest firmware on the interface as well you say you're using usb 3 but is this actually even a usb 3 device i think it's only usb 2 but it's a usbc plug so you never know i might have a tech tip for you theoretically usb is forwards and backwards compatible but in practice it is not always necessarily the case i would actually like you to use a usb 2 port and maybe a type a to type c adapter it says it comes with an adapter cable though that may resolve your problem i don't actually think that i have any usb supports then not have to use some converter for internal headers maybe can you get that even yes you can you'll want to find something similar to this frederick well fingers crossed i'll give that a go all right i'm gonna mark your ticket as resolved and thank you for calling in thank you very much and appreciate your videos it's great take care bye-bye minus is catching up foreign potter is this actually colton colton what are you doing bud i just saw the tweet i was on twitter and i just i have an issue with my workstation you're on twitter aren't you supposed to be at work oh my god what do you want sometimes my workstation some of my audio sources will just disappear i like playing music or videos outside out of my speakers sometimes but if i had my computer on for too long those audio sources just disappear your audio interfaces disappear yeah i don't understand so right now select playback devices i've got real tech digital output and i've got corsair void pro usb gaming headsets but if i restart my computer i'll also have my predator monitor and my other monitor that i can output and then over time they go away yeah after probably about like a week of my workstation being on okay then what i would probably try because those are going to be running nvidia's audio driver that's a separate audio driver what i suspect is that if you do a clean install of your video drivers it may actually resolve this intermittent problem failing that i would probably try to grab a new hdmi cable because it could be that something is going on between the output of your gpu and that monitor to make that audio and interface kind of disappearingly i'm going to mark this resolved thank you bye thank you for the tech tips big fan of your channel what a nice young man we should really give him a job hello you've reached the tech tips well i built myself theater which is super fun and my usb devices kind of decide to disconnect all the time and i stream but i would recommend if you have a bunch of devices specifically like webcams can take up a lot of your usb bandwidth is you can go on amazon and you can buy like a separate usb card if you're not looking to buy something what i would recommend is try to take some of your devices did they just hang up they hung up how close were you to a panic attack there well when i asked for a queue of about five tickets and i ended up with a queue of about 15 tickets oh i had like 25. did you like that who wanted help unrooting his android phone that i forwarded to you somehow my aura which is much better than your aura managed to help him fix it really he fixed it how many people do you think you were able to help yeah i don't know we're gonna have to see because it's gonna come down to the judges the guy on twitter never got back to me oh i'm still gonna count that i have to you're counting that oh we'll get to that in a second oh so minus in the first 13 minutes of competition you did not get a single point in fact you gave a point to jake when you transferred carson i was like what you can transfer i transferred a few to him that's where i had all the hard ones your first point came after a nine minute phone call with isabel look i had to help her get mcafee uninstalled ah yeah you're doing god's work however you did manage to solve two of her issues so you did get two points for that is your computer just run hot or something it was something like that yeah yeah i was just like sorry that fixed the issue whatever you managed to solve your first question in just two minutes and 36 seconds however you did not take many video calls we're trying to make a video here today halfway through you did actually take a video call you took a video call from derek yes derek received your undivided attention for nearly 15 minutes skip talking sorry derek jake you ended up receiving a total of 12 points oh that's not bad points okay linus received a total of 17 points i want those two wiped off to sleep did you count some of the ones where i was just like hey are you still there can i mark this resolved and then i marked some resolved there were a bunch that i did not count because of that honestly meant seeing the kinds of tech problems people have though like you said i wish that i could just like help more people like business idea ten dollar tech tips would you pay five bucks or ten bucks if you could call into a line and know it would actually be good that is actually staffed by actual people who know theirs yeah
