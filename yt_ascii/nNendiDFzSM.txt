hello everyone and welcome i have been driving the 2017 volkswagen golf all track and i've been quite enjoying it but one of the things that pretty interesting about this car if you pop the hood and check out the engine this is the 1.8l ea888 from volkswagen   it's a turbocharged engine and one of the really interesting things is that if you look at the turbocharger you'll notice it's right next to the engine itself. so a very short distance in between the engine and the engine block so what does this mean? well what this means is the exhaust manifold is located entirely within that cylinder head now why would volkswagen do this? well basically what they've got going on is a water cooled exhaust manifold and it's a very cool setup; how it works is very simple you're just looking inside the engine at the cylinders themselves you've got the two exhaust valves dumping that exhaust out into the exhaust manifold which is all located internally within the cylinder head you've got coolant jackets going around that exhaust manifold helping to cool that exhaust manifold and then it's dumping that air into the exhaust portion of the turbocharger spinning up the turbo, creating boost, etc. so why would you do this? why would you put the exhaust internally in the cylinder head? well one of the huge benefits comes down to cold starts so what this allows you to do is get the engine up to operating temperature very quickly that's not only efficient... but if you need to heat the cabin you're going to be able to do it sooner because you're using energy from the exhaust to help warm it up you're also going to have less engine wear because if your engine is cold for less duration you're not going to have that cold start up where you don't quite have the protection you have at operating temperature so you can help with engine reliability by getting it up to operating temperature very quickly now one of the cooler benefits of this is actually the fact that you can cool the catalytic converter so they were able to measure the temperature difference between the exhaust gas when it was coming out and reaching that turbocharger and and they are able to cool it by 160degrees f once it reaches the turbocharger and what's neat about that is that when you're at high load you don't have to have as rich of an air / fuel mixture typically you're going to have an air / fuel mixture that's pretty rich to reduce gas temperatures in the exhaust and the reason you're doing that is so you don't burn up your catalytic converter you don't want to get too hot you do want to get it "hot enough" for it to be able to do its process and get rid of the harmful emissions but you don't want it to get too hot and so typically with turbocharged engines or just engines in general you can run a rich air / fuel mixture that will cool the exhaust gases and it won't harm your catalytic converter as much whereas this engine is actually going to be cooling it with the coolant jackets themselves wrapped around the exhaust manifold as a result volkswagen says they are able to achieve 20% better highway fuel economy by cooling these exhaust gases and then running a leaner air / fuel mixture at these higher engine loads which is pretty neat to see that they're able to achieve 20% is a *huge* number now are there any disadvantages to doing this? well the obvious thing is that you're going to have a higher cooling load placed on the engine itself so you're dumping a ton of heat into that engine block and you're going to have to cool that with an engine that's only producing 170 hp you know, this is a fairly low power engine you know, "relatively speaking," so the cooling load isn't that big of a problem certainly not something you're going to have a challenge dealing with you put a nice size radiator up front and this will be no issue the other thing that came to mind is tunability you can't swap out the header, so to speak and -- you know -- go get crazy with this i don't think that that's that big of an issue i think that companies should design the best product that they can and let the aftermarket worry about the aftermarket but that's just something to kind of think about if it's all internal you're not going to be able to change that out you're going to deal with the exhaust after that portion but i think it's a pretty cool setup what volkswagen has done and let's just check out some images of what this actually looks like so here we can see the engine and you can see the turbocharger put right up against the engine block there so this is the cylinder head and as you can see the exhaust manifold completely internal spits right out into the turbocharger spools that up and you're good to go and you're creating boost so pretty cool to see here's a more detailed look at the cylinder heads so you can see you've got your exhaust manifold in here that's coming out into these two ports you know it looks like it could be set up to support a twin scroll turbocharger (this is a single vane turbo) but you could theoretically, if you wanted to, do that since you've got these two separate exhaust ports right here and then basically behind these you've got coolant so you're going to have coolant flowing in here and helping to cool that exhaust manifold and here we have an exploded view of this 1.8l engine you can see the exhaust valve right here so your piston comes up presses out that exhaust gases they travel through there and directly into the turbocharger and then you can see in *blue* and blue is the cooling jackets that are going to be cooling this exhaust so everything is red is the exhaust manifold where that exhaust air is coming out and then here in blue you can see that there is coolant jackets wrapping around that to help keep it cool and finally this is a low quality image but great for seeing what this looks like, internally so you can see in red the entire exhaust manifold wrapping around for each of the two valves at each cylinder and then you can see the coolant water jacket for the cylinder head coming in here and wrapping around and then you can see the exhaust manifold water jacket in the darker blue here wrapping around kind of, you know, curving around with the exhaust manifold itself making sure to supply coolant to that area and cool down that exhaust manifold so neat how they're exchanging heat here between these two and a pretty interesting design which allows for the benefits mentioned earlier so pretty cool what they've done with this and pretty neat to see such a compact exhaust manifold so, thank you guys for watching, and if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave those below
