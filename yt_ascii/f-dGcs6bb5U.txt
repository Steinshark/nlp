lately i've been mr unpopular around my house and i'm sure a lot of you can relate whether it's buffering on the mrs netflix or a lag spike on junior's game or an oh so important video call that i can't miss when there are problems with the wi-fi the first thing that happens is and the issue that's plagued me for the last few months turned out to be a doozy see i've got these speakers in my family room that use a standard called wireless audio specification 4.0 which isn't wi-fi but it uses the same spectrum as wi-fi meaning that it is susceptible to the same kind of interference and because it streams high bitrate audio with very low latency any small amount of interference can sound a little something like this okay whole family movie night ruined thankfully we got to the bottom of it you guys are never gonna believe what was spewing rf interference out into my house and as you come along with me on this journey of discovery i am sure you're going to pick up some tips and tricks that'll take you from wi-fi zero to wi-fi hero all we need is a little bit of help from the contents of this pouch and from our sponsor see sonic if you're in need of a power supply look no further see sonic offers high quality power supplies with a variety of options for any build learn more at csonic.com [music] like any other problem these days the first thing we did was google it to see if anyone else was experiencing the same issue and we came across an owner's thread over on avs forum with over 400 pages which is either a really good sign or a really bad one and as it turns out it is chock full of users complaining about exactly the same audio cutouts and stuttering that i'm experiencing here at home the good news is that thread was full of useful information that ultimately set us down the right path sony's hta9s like any other wireless device are not truly wireless i mean they've got a wires coming out of them right here so that they can be powered by the wall but they receive their audio stream wirelessly rather than through a traditional speaker wire they use the same five gigahertz spectrum as the wi-fi devices in your home which can be both a good thing and a bad thing on the one hand five gigahertz wi-fi is great for high bandwidth communication so the audio quality from these things it's actually great the problem is that while five gigahertz was really clear back when it came out it was the perfect way to get away from all the interference in the 2.4 gigahertz bands these days almost everything that's using wi-fi in your house is going to be on five gigahertz which means well you see a lot of the same problems of course we don't know yet that that's the problem so one of our first troubleshooting steps is to find out what the wi-fi environment around us looks like and you can do that with one of those wi-fi analyzer phone apps that are often available for free these will show you visually what ssids or wireless networks are around you what channels they're occupying and their relative strength as measured by your phone's antenna they are super handy and what we're looking for is an unnamed ssid that could be being transmitted by our sony transmission box here and i think we've got it there's some weaker signals from my outdoor access point but there's this really strong one i'm right here next to it that pops up once in a while and then goes away called hidden ssid could it be as simple as just taking the rest of my wi-fi network and moving everything off of those channels here in my wireless dashboard you can see a lot of the diagnosis for this happened on a completely different day when that hidden network was occupying different channels that i was trying to clear out so we're still going to go through the process for you guys let's go ahead and just wipe out everything in that range and okay theoretically you clear out the channels should be crystal clear right yes but only temporarily within a couple of days the issue was back why because that hidden ssid had jumped to a completely different channel but believe it or not that's not a bug that's a feature because most people are going to have all of their wireless devices configured to automatically select the best channel well they actually all end up hopping around depending on what else is going on in the environment around you so sony in their wisdom has the ability to say hey that's not quite working for me i'ma sit here and standby and passively scan which channel is most free and i'm gonna jump on to that so the next time you power me up i'm gonna be good to go and unfortunately while you can disable that channel hopping if you want to manually manage all of your channels there's no way to tell it which channel you want it to stay on sony let me pick it and then i could have solved this problem because as it turns out even if you disable it if for whatever reason the unit loses power it could automatically select a different one and then you gotta go back on the dashboard again and the sides as it turned out even with this set manually to a separate channel for my wi-fi the problem wasn't solved anyway it's time to bring out the big guns or about small but effective guns which is totally a thing this is the y spy and long time viewers will have seen something like it before it's a spectrum analyzer which combined with meta geeks software allows us to see in real time any legitimate traffic or unwanted interference across both the 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz spectrums i went with this because i'm familiar with the software already but you don't have to for as little as 20 bucks you can get yourself set up with an sdr or software-defined radio that with awesome free software can be used to do anything from wi-fi analysis like we're doing today to amateur radio to building your own gsm network and so on and so forth they're super cool and we're going to put some learning resources in the video description down below for now though let's compare what we see in metageek software analyzer and what we see in our free cell phone app our ssids have very similar relative strengths and positioning in the different five gigahertz channels but what we can't see in here is all the traffic and there it is our unknown ssid with a whole bunch of traffic this is color coded according to the intensity so blue would be the lightest red would be the most intense and this is all yellow with a spot of orange here's the thing about wi-fi it can transmit over top of this kind of background noise but it's slow and it's unreliable so what wi-fi devices are designed to do is weight their turn nicely in order to optimize their use of the available spectrum that's one of the reasons that you always want to make sure that you center your 2.4 gigahertz networks over 1 6 and 12 rather than using the in-betweens which will just cause unnecessary interference making them not play with each other nicely but because this is wireless audio there's no such thing as waiting to send a packet you don't have a ton of time to buffer data because otherwise the user is going to notice the audio and the video being out of sync so we pretty much can't use any channel funnels that the hta9 is occupying and yet it went and it picked channels that have ssids on them or so i thought i've never been so disappointed to have something working perfectly because here's the thing even though those ssids are broadcasting on the same channel as the sony audio system well you're not actually transmitting any data unless you're doing giant file copies so it turns out that wasn't even the problem thankfully when you step up your game to one of these antennas you can identify interference from all kinds of different non-wifi devices meta geek actually provides this really helpful little graphic to show you what signatures of different interfering devices might look like they don't include a microwave but that's okay i can show you that we're on 2.4 gigahertz ever had your bluetooth headphones cut out when you're trying to microwave something in the kitchen well i'm gonna show you guys why see this waterfall over time it goes from traffic on the established 2.4 gigahertz channels to this is a good opportunity to show you guys why that's not a problem for five gigahertz though look at that nothing well we know there's something we just gotta find it this is the point in the video where things start to look a little more like a ghost hunting reality show than tech tips but i swear to you what i'm doing is legit we found the best results are from wrapping the entire y-spy box and then making ourselves kind of a cone around the antenna in this way we can turn our omnidirectional antenna into a directional antenna which is going to make it a lot easier for us to zone in on smaller sources of interference now i already alluded to there being some movie magic in this video we absolutely nailed it yesterday we found it we screen capped it it was a fluke i don't think we're gonna get it again but we're going to give it a shot and failing that we'll show you guys the recorded footage let's go for the doubters that i'm sure are out there yes our directional antenna does work you can tell because when i point it at our source of interference rather than away from it boom look at it light up then watch i'm going to turn it around and that red zone is going to go away of course this is not a very granular tool in its current form but we can fix that because we're specifically looking for devices that are interfering with our wireless audio setup we only care about this narrow little slice of spectrum right here we're going to use a feature in this software called device finder so we're focused in on this and basically we're gonna go around and look for problematic spikes that's not the cat oh oh we did actually get a little spike there hello hey christmas interferes oh guys can you it wasn't christmas the kids turned the tv back on and the tv's over there the christmas tree is clean oh interesting this is sending out pulses printers oh we have some z-wave lights i got a little blip really anything that plugs in is a possibility smart thermostats smart lights i know i told these to use the 2.4 gigahertz network oh oh there's something going on here this is so far away from the family room though see the thing about five gigahertz is that it's limited transmission range can actually again be a feature rather than a bug because it's much less likely to interfere with another device that's far away even if your wi-fi reception might not be as good as it was on 2.4 this is quite substantial though wait even after i walked away i was getting these spikes yeah these govi smart lights are definitely kicking off five gigahertz oh we are getting all kinds of interference in the mechanical room i don't know that it's from these guys specifically because what's interesting is when i move back a little bit all of a sudden it's all over the oh no it's really because calm down a little bit whaler bueller you know what it is i know why there's so much in here come on over here brandon yeah oh that's spicy i know why there's so much in here it is what you found yesterday it looks like the issue is my z-wave network as i walk into the room and trigger motion from my z-wave switches yep there we go look at them go oh man that's why it's so hard to nail down where the interference is coming from because i've got a hundred of these bloody things all over my house to be clear it may not actually be jasco's fault specifically i had some really weird z-wave issues recently that i was diagnosing with one of the developers of z-wave.js for home assistant where he said and this is a direct quote i haven't seen some of these log messages before and i've seen a lot of logs so it could be these devices but it could also be some of the other z-wave devices on my network that are causing in particular some really sticky non-optimal routing that means there's a lot of hops going around anytime anything's happening on the network we managed to resolve it enough temporarily that i'm able to actually you know configure devices but it's clear that it's an ongoing issue that i need to resolve with my z-wave devices so the good news is that i know what the problem is but the bad news is that the long-term solution is probably an upcoming switch from in a value that doesn't even exist yet or maybe even going all the way back to dumb switches for now kids i think you're stuck with bad audio sometimes up here can you maybe use the theater instead yeah yeah you don't want to teachers but you don't like the theater you didn't finish your snack today you

don't know six gigahertz wi-fi is opening up more spectrum to wi-fi so that there's going to be less congestion but flip side is that as soon as you open up that spectrum and everybody like piles into it you're bound to run into these sort of problems yet again if you guys enjoyed this video who knows maybe you'd enjoy the original video i did taking a much more in-depth look at the y spy and
