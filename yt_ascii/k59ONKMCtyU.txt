ladies and gentlemen it's currently march 2nd 2023 and in this video i'd like to make a very special announcement i just became a billionaire but not in the financial sense because if it was in the financial sense trust me i would not be making a video about 200 elo chess players however i became a billionaire in terms of youtube views this channel has crossed 1 million viewers and every single time we hit a milestone i want to say thank you to all of you because anytime a subscriber excuse me anytime a creator talks about subscribers reviews or whatever they're talking about numbers but it's not just numbers it's folks like yourselves those of you in the comments those of you watching liking interacting with the video sharing it with your friend getting somebody else into chess playing against the relative i've gotten so many incredible notes from people reconnecting with relatives going through tough times and mental health issues and chess for them in in particular this channel was a very important part of their life so thank you from the bottom of my heart whatever your journey was on this channel whether it's new whether it's old i sincerely thank you very very much and i understand that it's not one billion unique people because that would be quite crazy and i am not mr beast but it's it's a lot of people and we're gonna celebrate the achievement by taking a look at a catastrophic game of chess i have a how to lose a chess playlist on my channel and this game was sent to me and normally what i do you know is i take people's usernames and i give them grand master titles no these folks are just rated 200. this is a good old-fashioned battle of two toddlers at the playground who are fighting for the same spoon i i mean yeah this this was a wild wild game of chess it was sent to me by the person playing with the white pieces who opened the game with e4 and actually from an early stage it does not look like 200s are playing i mean to be honest with you if 200s were playing i would have expected queen h5 i would have expected the queen to be lost did you guys know that this position has been reached like hundreds of thousands of times online and scholars made is the next move here and it just doesn't get played like white goes here i mean imagine getting the scholars made on the board and then not playing it anyway we have a four nights which is obviously very standard now here i don't like what retro does playing this you got to get the bishop to its most active square so now retro is like oh wait yeah that was the idea copies off of his opponent you guys remember those days in school when you were sitting you were sitting next to somebody and you had to take a test maybe you're in school right now don't do this don't copy off of the person next to you because maybe you get caught and also maybe they're just dumb all right and you're not actually gonna get the answer right so retro is now basically playing black why is retro playing black because now black has a lead in development now black is the one who is a move ahead in development because white made two bishop moves in a row so there you go now castle's castle is good stuff and black plays knight h5 so 200 elo chess is characterized by something very important it's characterized by the fact that almost none of their moves look like they make any sense but you know have you ever been to a museum an art museum and you just absolutely do not understand what you're looking at but other people do and they tell you the history of it and to tell you the influence so when you don't understand 200 elo chests like the move knight h5 just be patient because they're gonna show you exactly what they want now the best move here for black is to play d6 and to get the other bishop out like this and pin and so on but this is actually a problem this is one of the things i try to stay away from i don't like to teach beginners to play symmetrical positions because they're very hard to play you need something to look at something to attack the idea of knight h5 is very simple it's to just bring the knight a little bit more forward i actually love what retro does here this is excellent now black plays knight f4 and white captures on f4 now why is it already plus two it's plus two because this is a bad exchange for black this pawn is very weak like queen d2 and also you gave white the center you gave white the center and you also gave white time so for instance bishop d6 e5 will shove all the pieces backwards you really should not be surrendering the entire control of the center because it's going to be significantly more challenging to defend pawns that are on f4 alright so we have takes takes d4 actually played in the game and bishop b6 incredible and white played queen d2 i mean is this guy cheating this is it's unbelievable stuff queen d2 is a ridiculously high level move but there's a twist you actually don't want to play queen f4 i know i just brought it up you want to play that if it's possible but first you need to defend this pawn your queen is currently responsible for the defense of the d4 pawn and if it takes you're gonna lose this pawn so you should go here what this move does is three things number one it attacks the pawn with a knight so you don't have to take it with the queen number two it attacks the bishop so the bishop when it gets captured no longer it takes d4 number three it opens up the possibility to put the pawn on c3 instead of the knight in the pawn c3 would be defending the pawn of d4 from the knight on c61 b6 which you can take with an item d5 rap god that's gonna be a youtube short right there however queen f4 and now if you're gonna take with anything in the center of the board of course it should be the knight because in more often than not cases you should preserve your bishop your bishop is a better piece in the long term but black plays bishop a5 which i can't really understand i think again bishop sees knight but it's defended so now what white should do is probably bring the rooks so probably a rehab so one of the rook moves is a top engine move and then maybe go for an attack you know go here here try to oh my god what is with my arrow drawing and so on white goes here so white was not happy losing a pawn on d4 white decides to lose upon on b4 two different ways i i don't understand the i i don't get this move i can't lie to you you know what i think again going back to like trying to understand 200 elo chess you can't you got to do your best but you can't i mean i i basically think that white went here and was like i'm gonna take the bishop and forgot that just because you're attacking a piece if you are attacking a piece more often than not they can see you too unless it's a night okay but if you're attacking a piece like this can't see that but in this case when they have the same ability of moving diagonally right so i'm i'm just saying like when you have a very powerful piece as long as you have the same ability you're gonna see each other so the pawn attacks the bishop doesn't see the knight it does see this and there you go okay now white plays knight d5 getting the knight out of the way of danger good move black probably did not see this move at all and just played bishop to e6 so i was very fortunate that knight takes bishop does not lose a bishop but you know you can actually take either of these two things now so just the golden rule of thumb nine times out of ten when you're like a total beginner even if you're an intermediate the best move is not going to be to go backwards for example in this position one of the best moves is to play rook b1 rook d1 but those are not backwards moves those are actively adding pieces to the game for example you can play a3 that is not a backwards move you can play knight g5 you can play you can try to play c3 this is kind of a backwards move but the you're trying to go over here right goes knight d2 like if you have a reason to play a backwards move you can tell me right now that move attacks this i'll i'll allow it however knight d2 doesn't do that knight d2 in no way shape or form attacks anything in fact it takes its eye off of that and now knight takes d4 wins a pawn there you go now bishop c3 played bishop c3 attacks the rook and the pawn but now you can take the bishop so in this case going back is good because you win a full piece levy you told me never to go backwards that's not what i said you can explain it to me i'll allow it but don't go back just don't do it so knight d2 bishop c3 of course white doesn't see that white plays rook do you want and white loses the pawn so as of right now if you here's the thing if you allow your opponents to play like geniuses they will i mean if you allow them to get away with things like this they're gonna look like they're gods bishop c3 bishops i mean right like bishop b5 like look at this black is a genius but black was losing the pawn there now white plays bishop b5 all right so it's just kind of a very slow maneuvering game now bishop b5 played with the intention i guess of taking the knight right so black says okay take my knight and now white goes back to c4 again so early in the game white played bishop e2 and then bishop c4 a little bit later white plays bishop b5 and bishop c4 here's the thing if you have made like five bishop moves in your first like 15 16 turns that's 33 you have spent one third of the game moving the piece and it's just on the same square that means the other guy is going to have an advantage look at this so in this position it's minus point eight that's the evaluation minus point eight just this small inclusion of a6 and bishop c4 it's now minus 1.9 a full point it's not fascinating right so this position is only slightly better this position is only slightly better for black but this one is already almost borderline lost for white meaning black is completely winning that's crazy and it has nothing to do with the pawn it just has to do with time so it's black's move whereas in this position it's white's move so like everything right you're giving black extra time so bishop b5 and now knight d4 i love this this is excellent stuff now that knight comes in it's attacking this i love it the engine doesn't love it it finds like f4 but f4 is come on it's beyond the pay grade knight b3 which targets the knight and now the knight can finish its journey okay so black got a little bit distracted here right black's inner 270 kicked in black completely just forgot about the existence of all these pieces and was like me attack rook me rook me so here's the thing if you're gonna ever attack a piece number one you gotta think what happens if it moves now the rook can take the knight and if you just do a little bit of math this is clearly a beneficial exchange for white it's six to five however one move attacking moves need to kind of be removed from your arsenal because even if the rook went to d2 it would be fine if it went to d3 it would be fine if it went to c1 it would be fine if it went anywhere it would be fine and on top of that you have f3 this is not the best move but you have that and you would be attacking the bishop if you want to make moves that are more like powerful threatened mate it's not the best move the engine i mean you know it's gonna say here and then it's gonna say but if you want to make one move threats just go for the whole thing don't just do this because now when you crunch the numbers knight takes knight white you know allows this the white just gets two pieces knight and bishop for the rook nine bishop for the rook is not something that you want to give away now black plays rookie eight and white is completely winning why is white completely winning because white has two nights for a rook and since white has a massive peace advantage meaning look at all the activity here in the center the engine finds moves like knight f5 the idea of knight f5 is that why doesn't a prime situation to just create a big attack rook f3 queen h3 and that just doesn't think that black can defend the position what stockfish doesn't know is that it is evaluating a position it's looking at the position i will stress that one more time stock which is looking at the position it's not looking at the players stockfish should come with a feature who is playing this game if it's a couple of two hundreds the position is equal stockfish at some point they should make an ai version where it adapts the evaluation this is a genius idea by the way can we just suggest this i have a genius chess idea in the future we should allow stockfish and some of the other best chess computers in the world to adapt their evaluation of a game based on what elo was playing because let me tell you something right now this is a complicated game at the 200 level all right queen c3 and you can see that right away as white plays a move that literally walks into a pin and now c5 wins the night i mean it just took one move it took one move in a better position and white immediately lost the knight now of course c5 is not going to happen so c6 happens and then i'd still volunteers tribute knight to b6 one move capture how much time did white spend on that move three seconds and this is why you guys are in elo hell because you play a move and you go me attack rook what if the other guy just went here and then went here and then won your knight and then checkmated you right and then you go ah dang chess is hard i'm just gonna go watch that gotham guy so rook b8 the knight is still hanging and now not only does black not take the knight on b6 black instead attacks the knight on d4 white is just going to lose two nights two nights two nights two nights two nights i just really wanted to highlight them in colors counter attack f4 and now bishop takes is gg so his queen takes because you're gonna win a couple of nights instead of that black goes back okay no problem i can't hate that move so now white did something in this position white is rated 270. white did something in this position that every 270 rated players should be familiar with here's the situation white's knight is pinned to the queen it can't move this knight is under attack by the enemy queen it can't move so in order to prevent yourself from losing one night and then a second night white said no problem i'll just lose my queen in one move i mean really like that's the easiest solution i'm gonna lose one night i'm gonna lose another night so let's just give up the queen let's say you know how long did we spend on that move six seconds six seconds and how much time did we have on the clock 374 seconds six divided by 374. i'm gonna do that on my computer real quick six divided by 374. one person one percent nice i think i think it's something like that like 1.6 terrific terrific queen is gone all right it's over it's so as usual it's over all right let's watch the conversion rook takes d6 what what was that on purpose did black think oh i'm winning i'm just gonna simplify this ain't simplification i mean you're still winning because you got two rooks for two nights it's obviously winning not at this level though let's do that stockfish eval this is definitely not winning at 200 it's winning at super gm level what keep the queen safe are you insane if you're up a queen why what are you doing losing it go there trade the rook get rid of the knight take the pawn i mean are you kidding me the only thing you have to protect yourself against here three things one clock two checkmate three queen you lost the queen what are you doing and then it goes from bad to worse knight f5 rook d1 here comes black all right now i like how black is doing this white doesn't have any targets so white is lost i mean right like white the only way that white wins this game is if black blunder is a rook or if white wins a bunch of pawns and promotes so white is trying a4 i mean what are you gonna do right rook d1 i don't know where rook d1 is going personally the way you win this i think if you are refusing to simplify the pieces what you need to do is take the pawns and either go checkmate the king so for instance rook c2 a5 rook d2 knight d5 and it should just be a mate very soon like if the king walks forward there's f6 i think there's got to be some sort of made some it's minus 11. rook d1 all right there's you're not taking the pawns or attacking the king and now you're repeating moves okay good i like that nice back to the winning ways rook b2 excellent move knight c8 is ridiculous by the way this board vision is so clever and that move probably rattled black a little bit what black should do now is rooks on the second and white would probably think it's a four can get mated admit it you probably thought it was a fork too so rooks on the second rank right kind of an end game concept but all right rook d2 knight d5 here move the bishop out of the way and start pushing yeah excellent bishop d4 and that's it just c4 c3 and that is exactly what black did rook b2 and then c4 and of course that's a blunder but they didn't see that bishop b2 c3 and again that that's a hanging knight so you could have taken the knight but c3 black is doing everything right black has three minutes on the clock the game is over knight c3 played and it is completely lost i mean black has done a really nice job converting here really really nice skills knight c4 and now rook takes bishop is just gg up two rooks take that take that when the knight moves but okay black plays b5 black blunder is the rook which i get it you know knight takes b2 but fine you just take back with your bishop and you're still okay all right you didn't take you spent a little bit of time on that move you didn't take but the crazy thing is the knight is trapped so you're gonna take it anyway you got lucky the bishop is hanging you're gonna win everything and the pawn is gonna promote all right so you still win all right terrific take the knight there you go take the pawn beautiful stuff and that's it and black converted the rest of this game very easily by advancing their a pawn by going after the bishop and converting black won this game in a few moves by allowing white to promote the e pawn to a queen and delivering a back rank checkmate
