what you're about to see is a discussion that i had with father siloan justiniano father silawon is a hieromonk he is also a priest in the orthodox church but mostly to us he is really an artist in my estimation father siluwan is one of the most important artist visual artists in north america today in the sense that his understanding of traditional iconography his attention to detail his mastery of color his capacity to bring in strains from different traditional arts but also from contemporary art into a sacred art which is powerful and is present while also being very traditional and i think that he offers us a vision of what north american orthodox sacred art could look like but not only that i believe that he can also point us to a direction in which you know sacred art can be a model even for secular art gallery art but also popular art as well and so in our discussion we talk about visual art we talk about the traditional doctrine of art as was formulated by an art an art historian ananda kumar sami at the at the beginning of the century and so we go through much of contemporary art modern art and also how it connects to iconography and so it's a very rich and powerful discussion and i'm very happy to be sharing it with you today this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] so what i want to do is i i definitely want to talk about art i want to kind of revisit the conversation we had a few years ago that i didn't that i didn't record well this one should be good because i know what i'm doing now and so that's what i mostly want to do and i want people i want you to talk about your art and your approach you know i had aiden hart on and i had other other people and i'm trying to kind of create communication channels between secular art world and the sacred sacred art and it's working like i i'm getting it's crazy like the people that are reaching out to me is it's nuts like in the secular art world and the amount of catechumen that are coming in from the art world it's it's exciting because that's very important man because that what you just described like the bridge or like the conversation beginning that's all that's like we've been we it's been a need that's that's that has not been addressed at all at least in the anglophone world as i have come to to to understand what has been happening in like you know late 20th century you know 21st century like orthodoxy unfortunately has a treasure of things to offer but it tends to suffer from isolation or a a insularity that that is is counterproductive and one of my my concerns for many years has been how do you engage in that conversation with nuance but without compromise and it's a hard one it's a hard one and sometimes i think i got it grasped and and then it slips out of you know out of control i don't i don't it's hard to to to to to engage it but one of the key factors that i found that like helps to to deal with the problem is having a cognizance of the historical paradigm of fine art as as we have come down to understand it since the'th century if we if we come to an understanding that something shifted in terms of what was what we tend to in our community call the traditional doctrine of art from that to to the fine art paradigm then you have a better sort of like feel to to to you know to place things into and to to come up with better answers i think because if you don't have that then you you're more muddled it's more confusing so maybe maybe we can start with that maybe you can lay that out for us i mentioned it a few times on the channel but i would really love to hear your take on what is what happened what is the change between the the kind of traditional vision of the arts and the fine art paradigm one one thing that i think is important to keep in mind is that we could become a bit too abstract in in sort of like isolating this idea of the traditional doctrine and in separating it from like historical developments that occurred and i'm mainly primarily thinking of like you know the industrial revolution the development of the of the the middle class the development of capitalism you know all these technological advancements and like the the the paradigm shifts in terms of like government political all these things played a factor in in in creating the environment in which the change occurred so the traditional doctrine of our as you've mentioned multiple times in your lectures and like in in your your channel basically you're dealing with a functional art you're dealing with function that is not or symbolism that is not separated from function and it is aspects of or understand understanding of beauty that is not separated from function either so it is an art that is meant to address both physical and and spiritual needs and the art that we're talking about in a way did not make a stark distinction between sacred and secular spheres as much as we tend to okay so you could have a a courtly art that used what we consider to be a sacred theme or vice versa and you and stylistically there were no distinctions between how you would depict things in the church and how you would depict them in the court or in in the folk context in the village they they were more closely linked you you could have levels of refinement of that art but but ultimately it was an art that was geared towards an way that i would put it some people might not like the idea because it comes from a a 19th century art critic it's an ideaistic art it's it's an id the idea comes first so to speak and then you you embody that idea with representational forms but the representation is not confined to an empirical assessment of nature it's not based on an empiricist understanding of nemesis or imitation of nature so so kumaraswamy would at times use a phrase i think that derives from aristotle art imitates nature in her method of operation or something like that so so in other words our in this case is mother nature or actually is is is god creating okay so so so the the it touches on the idea the christian idea that the lord has specific like divine wills or a pattern paradigm and then he actualizes this paradigm in his creation when he he names it he calls it to being and they are created based on this idea yeah and so the art would be something like there's a purpose for the yes exactly and then that purpose is now embodied in body yes is aimed at that purpose exactly is embodied meaning okay and so so that's that's a very important thing and that's always plugged into a metaphysic because because prior to philosophy as we understand it philosophical questions metaphysical questions were dealt with in a traditional society in terms of symbolism and so so the art that was created used a symbolic language in order to convey the cosmology or doctrinal meanings that they held to be valuable for the health of the community or for the overall ordering of the community and so that has to also be kept in mind so so so there was no separation between religion and art and so you know so and there was no such thing as the are as expressive of individualist ideas it was expressive of metaphysical doctrines or the meanings that the community held to be of pivotal importance for its well-being and so that's one that's one abbreviated you know understanding of of of look a more traditional vision more traditional yes and and also bear in mind that this was also the artist worked within a continuity of traditional forms and and iconology so all traditional forms are iconological insofar as the meanings are contained in specific compositional formulations that convey these specific meanings and of course you could never escape yourself insofar as like you will always handle these forms in what in a way that is unique to yourself so that you could trace stylistic differences within a traditional culture but the stylistic differences are the accidents not the essence of the art as kumaswami would put it so so this is you know so anonymity tended to be the norm where the artist didn't sign the you know the the the art and and it wasn't really looked at for the sake of deriving some biographical understanding who the artist was yeah and so so so these are all important distinctions and the contrast they say they help to create the contrast between a post between traditional and post'th century paradigm and after the uh' you know during the'th century we have to keep in mind we have the development of aesthetics as its own discipline as a discipline within the realm of philosophy and of course his aesthetics is like a is pertaining to things of sense but it was like a philosophical inquiry as to what that could be in terms of a form of cognition and so it was analyzed philosophically and of course it also had to deal with the judgment of taste and so how can we explain our cognition of what we consider to be beautiful and or along those forms of inquiry you have what is considered sublime okay so you have like edwin burks the inquiry into the ideas of the of the beautiful and the sublime and then you have the critique of judgment by by kant and then you have i forgot the the initiator of actually the term aesthetics the german baumgarten i think it was that started you could you correct me if i'm wrong but i forgot i'm not sure i don't know that actual last name but i think he was one of the first ones it makes sense that it's a german that's for sure right right right it was like germans were like the in the forefront of our history too so that's right so then you have you have that development plus also the development of the museum which is very important and one of the things that people forget is that the museum was partly developed as a consequence of the french revolution you know the there were museums before then if i'm not mistaken in austria if i'm mistaken because there were the development actually from the cabinet of curiosities right exactly yeah the cabinet makes total sense yeah that's what museums are cabinets and curiosities so so you would have like all this like whatever a king or prince considered to be worthy of his curious attention you know chemical things like you know like archaeological things like relics precious objects jewelry you know whatever i mean they would have this as a chamber where they could go and pass their time study manuscripts they would have there and then it was it was pretty pretty all-inclusive it wasn't as like you know as demarcated as we have it in museums now and it was a place where you could invite people that you respected to go and talk about these items but then that developed into a public form later on and it takes off really in like the french revolution aft because they basically faced the dilemma the aestheticians and people who value these works independent of their political or religious implication they were like well we don't want to because they were destroying all this stuff right it's like is french revolution iconoclasm right so we're destroying this as like representative of the old regime world right exactly and so so then they decided oh well i forgot who it was like called up the attention all right we can't be destroying everything so what are we gonna do so basically they decided to actually move these items to a museum in a gallery space that became independent or was a was was meant to be independent of any ideological political implication and so the the the excuse was we are putting these here because of their aesthetic value not because of its religious or political value so it was an attempt to inaccurate the the artwork from its religious and political content and to and to have it be that's sort of like a a a an example of a a social way in which the the theory of the autonomous artwork begins to take hold right yeah and so then what you have in the fine art context is the idea of the autonomous work of art you have the idea of the artist as independent from any patrons like demands it takes more and more hold of that you know that becomes more and more stronger as as we go along and move on from the'th century on you have the beauty as a form of taste as different from beauty as a theophany of the divine you could perhaps find in aspects of romanticism traces of that because i think one of the things that you have to keep in mind sorry to like you know digress is that a lot of these things are are distortions of christian doctrine that's right yeah exactly and so so you do have aspects in which perhaps a romantic painter considered beauty and the sublime the sublime by the way is the experience of grandeur in nature where you feel your limitation and you experience all or your utter like weakness in in in the face by the forces of nature standing at the top of a cliff exactly feeling that yeah exactly so it's different from beauty and so far as beauty is something that is more that you could handle that like or is more is closer to you and so burke would say like like the the the sub curve soft curvature or like soft skin and things like that that we all usually associate with the sensuous and it's not threatening to us it's actually comforting for us as compared to to the sublime which is like actually a storm the the cliffs you know and the alps or you know or the the ominous feeling of like you know a forest you know where you're like small and you're like surrounded by this like you know indeterminacy or like you're you're you don't know what's gonna happen when you enter it you know and so it it it's related to horror or terror and things like that so it's like the it's related to the idea of the divine as the all terrifying you know the the numinous notions of like otto what's his name that guy that wrote the ideas of like the of the numinous anyway so so you have these and so these are these are like vestiges of christian ideas you could say that are still playing out in like a post-enlightenment context but they are then channeled in a different direction and they mainly become channeled through an individualistic form of expression now yeah and that that takes off on on the on the on the romantic period but we have to call him in mind also that the romantic period is a rebuttal of rationalism of the enlightenment yeah and so what they do is okay we cannot go to religion in its usual like traditional forms so we're going to actually the subjective becomes a realm through which and the imagination becomes the venue through which we actually very privately encounter the divine and so we are going to rebuttal the limitations of rationalism is mechanistic and kind of like you know cold approach to reality it's limiting approach to reality in a way that it emphasizes they thought like emotion as related to the spiritual and mainly being an alternative to the religious communal context as you would have it in traditional religion and so so then that became the seedbeds of what would eventually become the ideas that gave ground or the foundation for the 19th century subjectivist tendencies that lead up to abstraction and so so what am i missing i think there's so so you you do have you do have what i would say is this getting back to the whole thing about bridging the the the the conversation between orthodox the orthodox context and the the art world i think some of the narratives that we've used in the past have been too simplistic in terms of creating too stark of a dichotomy between a christian worldview and a what we think of as a secular war view what i mean by that is this if because what could happen is we create this like box okay these are the ideas that gave rise to these forms so then it becomes difficult to see exceptions to the rule or to like actually see how even within the post'th century context you still have vestiges of religion vestiges of the spiritual you know what i'm saying so so what we need to do in my opinion is to find a theological way of teasing this out to discern these tendencies that you cannot you cannot do away with because we're all human beings and although the the the main current might be an anti-religion or current or it might be a current that like actually contradicts a lot of the aspects of orthodoxy nevertheless human beings are human beings and and they will even inadvertently aspire towards the divine or aspire towards a humanism that is christian within that context and i think you've done some of that in your critique of some social social how they call it uh popular arts yeah you know what i'm saying like and you're using you're doing exactly that with the way you're like revalorizing the the the the uh what is it graphic novel yeah okay so so so i think that's that's because for example i don't know if you're familiar i'm sure you are the only thing that i heard about uh you know art treating it philosophically or as a critique from a christian perspective was francis schaefer how shall we then live for example yeah as protestant theologian you know very famous for his like critique of like western civilization and like but the problem is that it became too simplistic and and the artwork then either was it fell under like you know he would deprecate it as either nihilistic or existential or like whatever you know or anti-christian values and so so the artwork was not approached as a thing you experience in a participatory way or an opportunity for communing with embodied meaning even with it outside of the realm of like a traditional context or christian christian ecclesial life but but rather it was considered to be purely a channel for a world view and if you didn't like the world view then you dismissed the artwork yeah yeah yeah i mean that's why the tr that's why the art downstream from shaffer is just propaganda it's just it's just it's just really very shallow that all those christian movies that you see you know are are are very weak and they're weak in their structure they're weak in their narrative they're weak in their in their visuals and they they're just basically a vehicle for a message basically yeah so getting back to what i was saying about the whole issue of the beautiful like the like you've pointed this out in some of your lectures about how you have now like the the complete separation between function and beauty but you know in the in the finite in the fine art paradigm so so the fine art paradigm is usually you know you know you have sculpture painting uh poetry architecture dance for example music you know so these are all different categories or different realms or practices disciplines within the larger paradigm of the fine art practice but the thing is that after the 60s as you know but but beginning like in the very big you know the 20 the 19th century already in the yeah already in there yeah like well you know with with dusha for example which you know i hold dear although he is infamous you know for because of a specific reason and these i explained he basically critiqued the fine art paradigm so this is you can look him up if you don't know who he is he's very important yeah where we are today right so so he basically then like created like began he was like the initiator of a questioning of the finite paradigm so so contemporary are as we know since the 60s okay with pop r you know neo data conceptualism all these things even aspects of like minimalism you know all these like actually all these movements tend to be anti-aesthetic yeah they're not concerned with notions of beauty anymore okay and so so we have to keep in mind that that that as well so so he is an initiator of that that tendency because he says okay our till now has been retinol because he's basically critiquing the 19th century tendency of like for example the impressionism post-impressionists you look at nature and then you have you have a sensation or or you you you filter it through your temperament and then what you produce although independent from nature is an autonomous object nevertheless it's based on your sensations right and so so he says well but even that has an aspect of idea because they are actually experiencing a sensation and then ideastically and this is i'll get back to that but this is a connection between modern and traditional art yeah they are idealistically then translating this sensation so he said forget forget about the forget about the sensation he says you know because art is its own thing it is a conceptual framework and we're forgetting that and we're so getting trapped wrapped up in our sensations and beauty and the whole institution of fine art that is not allowing us to actually address what art is or could be the ontology of our so to speak and so he begins to explore that okay and then that opens up a whole kind of worms you know that leading to like you know the rabbit holes that we you know of course would not you know be inevitable you know we would be we would not agree with but yeah well i mean just the the situation of art now you could say like the situation the post-modern our the art market it's the most fascinating thing about dusha is how he was totally recuperated by the system and actually and actually his ideas it's like now there's a massive you know guggenheim bilbao that is like this multi-million dollar complex to house all the children of marseilles you know and how expensive all these art pieces are yeah and so the thing is that that he then also inadvertently opened up the avenue for the expanding of the aesthetic because now people do similar things and they're looked at for their aesthetic value or even most people go to the museum and look at his fountain for aesthetic values you know what i'm saying and so it's like so so you know so things are like all over the place you know it becomes more and more like uh like an amoeba of like you know phenomena no no and and it's like it's because what you have is like you don't have a let's call it an imaginal like the imaginal horizon so to speak like in a traditional context the imaginal horizon was very specific based on metaphysical assumptions and and it it ordered based on this metaphysical assumptions first of all by default it was man's relationship to the transcendent the divine the gods or whatever and then based on that then how do we shape our our lives yeah based on the heavenly pattern as above so below and so but the stories in the art would also be grounded from below at through function yes that is the fact that you have objects that have to have a function in the world would would connect heaven and earth basically whereas with contemporary art because you've unmoored the the ground even and now you're also on more at the top you just have this amoeba it's a great way to get it just have this free-floating chaos exactly that is just a kind of expression of variation itself you could say yeah so what you have now it's like a a or you know another way of putting it it's like you know how like you have foam and foam is composed of this little tiny like bubbles or like you know you know of of they're like little cells composing this so you can imagine the art world right now as foam composed of all these little like bubbles which are like you know the the the like they're independent semiotic like fields of meaning like so so each artist has to invent his own his own symbolism or his semiotic like you know uh interpretation of of reality or how he engages with the the social cultural sphere or if he's addressing aspect of like ontology how he like interprets our humanity or whatever and so so then when you encounter it you're at a loss because you don't you don't you're not part of the same imaginal horizon and so so what is hard for most people is that by default if you're going to engage with that you have to become versed in history you have to be become versed in art theory you have to be conversed in the specific work of the artist and how he actually plays into this whole foam of cross-fertilized meanings and that's a very hard thing to do it's like it's ultimately is an interpretive critical act that is very difficult to engage with but it's it's sort of like its own it's like it's in it's it's it's its own for example i like to i like to compare these i have to use this contrast i think from a christian perspective an orthodox perspective there is a tendency we think that it's easier for a person to go into an orthodox church and to understand what's going on than to go to a museum and understand what's going on okay there is a sense in which this is true and it's not true yeah because i think i think it i think it's i think it's true in the sense that the let's say the the it's ramping up is as difficult that is you have to you have to kind of gain a world view but once you have it then everything lays it falls into my thing is the initial encounter is an initial encounter is difficult because if you are not versed in the iconology you have to learn that language and you will have intuitions that are perhaps more immediate because you know they they are using we are using forms that are universally relatable so far i mean human faces exact figures like these things are all right right deeply connected to our experience yes yes and so in that sense it is more accessible but there is a similarity not one to one similarity of like the challenge of actually immersing yourself in the theology in the cosmology in the symbolic structures and patterns for you to be able to interpret what it is that you're seeing in a more in-depth way yeah and so so so yeah so that's and there's a difference too like there's a difference because because there is this hierarchy in the language and there's a communal aspect to it and there's a notion of kind of bringing you up towards higher worlds the the let's say the effort you put into learning the language will lead you up towards virtue will lead you up towards exactly and that's much because in the contemporary art world you just nihilistically move from bubble to bubble and and it's like this infinite and you're you you have to kind of get used to idiosyncrasy as an experience it's like sometimes you think that people that go into museums get some kind of coherent experience but they don't they just actually are used to idiosyncratic let's say collage and they actually see that as a reflection of the real which is a deeply nihilistic nihilistic act in itself that's that's actually relates to to to what i was doing which parallels the way what you were doing when you were in in our school so i want to i want maybe that's a good time to back up a little bit yeah because we kind of jumped right into the conversation which is great but maybe you can tell people a little bit about your own story that is how you kind of moved into the contemporary art world and then moving out of the contemporary art world into iconography and ultimately trying to find ways to to maybe enrich the language as much as as is reasonable or yeah the how how should i frame this i grew up as a protestant my my parents were pentecostal and and so throughout my youth i pretty much struggled with that because i didn't really you know i didn't really want to be part of it but eventually to the grace of god i had to confront what i really believed and that was during my undergrad during i went for one year at a the maryland institute college of art in baltimore and there that was a reality check because then it really became like a confrontation between world views yeah me talking to people and like you know like for example i took for granted the existence of the soul and i would go to a party and talk to people that like were totally denying the existence of the soul i'm like you must be crazy and then i stepped back and i said all right i'm trying to argue for something that i'm like i'm like rejecting my parents what does that what does that mean about you know what do i really believe you know what i'm saying and so that precipitated the whole process of like you know at that time i like i encountered for the first time like that little treatise by vasily kandinsky considering the spiritual in art that was like a big eye-opener because i didn't really know that there was a slice of the modern art world that dealt with spiritual matters right you know they questioned what that means but you know but it leads an effort to like yes like yes a lot of these these artists were actually were actually spiritualists were involved in ethiopia and all these kind of fringe spiritual things but it but it wasn't just pure materialism exactly exactly so so then you know moving forward i decided to commit my my life towards following christ in the in his gospel and but that was before i came to to orthodoxy my dad bumped into an antioquine priest in his high school with the high school where he was working and then that precipitated conversation my dad told me about it i went to visit the antiochus church and that was my first instance of like actually looking at a liturgy and like and the incense and the icons and i couldn't really i was all i know is that i was like i was digging it but i don't know i couldn't really put my finger on it intellectually it took years for me to like actually piece it together but i was like i would go to the to the bible studies wednesday nights in the protestant church where we attended and i was like i want to go to liturgy this sunday man i mean i want something more like you know experiential you know anyways so eventually when i went to grad school then i became orthodox i was received into the church and so during undergrad i was doing you know abstract expressionist kind of work and then towards the end of my undergrad i shifted focus and i started to do more like geometric based work from collage compositions that i would uh put together so so which relates to what you were saying about the fragmentation thing right so i would take clips from magazines and you know and and evocative kind of like suggestive kind of like imagery and then combine it in a in a grid like structure and then i would execute it in oils then that's in the mid 80s right this was in the no man at this 90s sorry midnight yeah this was in 1990 four okay 96 i went grad school you'll be a combination of death of the author a critique of greenbergian modernism and um the ideas of the simulacra body yeah and and the pivotal influence for everyone at the time was gerhard richter yeah i was looking at like so i was i was basically doing what you could call conceptual abstraction and it was it was related to pop too because given that it was a critic of the author it was predicated on appropriation so so i was taking taking images from from popular culture fragments of photography i would even photograph a tv screen of garble channels yeah and and then i would i would put these images together to resemble computer screens but it had a dimension of illusionism because it was photorealistically executed and it had a connection to geometric abstraction so so it was both geometric organic illusionistic it was it was sort of like imperial painting imperial abstraction which was a the critique of greenberg because greenberg had this idea that for painting to become is his true self like or or to it was a modernism was sort of like a gradual progression towards the culmination of the true identity of painting and part of it involved like the rejection of illusionism the inherent properties of painting as flatness and so which ended in absolute nonsense like rolls of canvas with like right like splashes of color exactly right right so so i was i i actually i was into color and and and so i was i was playing with all these ideas and but the thing is that and by the way a digression which i think i have to mention my my my professors at hunter college where i was going for graduate school where there were a very interesting school they they were colorists they they they're if you look it up you know they're like they're they're considered the hunter color school right so they but but their work had it influenced my work but i was also rebelling against it yeah because there was i used this very thin stripe kind of like uh surface for for my images were it created an optical effect the images hovered so to speak and so because i would i would put contrasting colors hues like green red like orange you know and blue and and so given that it they were put together in in very close proximity stripe like forms you know structure it would create a hovering effect and a vibration but this was partly related to what sanford warmfeld was doing he was the chair of the art department at hunter and he he he he had a course called the color seminar that i took that was very important and and i derived a lot of you know good influence from that but i thought that their approach was too scientistic and it was still part of like the continuation of what was happening in the late 19th century with surat and like you know the the color theory that was happening at the time they you could you could say that they are a current form of that or they can they they're closely related to that history and my my advisor my thesis advisor was robert swain and he also did work based on color very much about finding a a system a color system based on the color wheel that and so he has you know developed a color system that he very systematically arranges he's got like 400 and maybe like i don't know if it's 400 4 000 i mean thousands of colors that he has arranged and he has to systematically numbered in his studio and he moves these around in like to create compositions and like so to me it was like you guys are too crazy to to too scientistic anyways but yeah so there was the environment and so but at the same time i was like really appreciative as as to to me they call that painting based on warfare's like theory they called it presentational painting instead of representation it was presentation right a presentation of a color phenomenon yeah and to me that was very evocative very and and has a lot of potential because in my view it's presenting a phenomenon that is offered to us by god but the this painters are like actually focusing on it and bringing it to you so you can experience it and to me that dimension getting back to what we were saying about how we could interpret something as having a theological implication although people who did it might not even have that in mind to me if you look at that work along those lines you could actually interpret it in a very fruitful way in any case so i was surrounded by all this stuff and i was doing sort of like a partly a critique of that and partly going along with the spirit of the times in terms of post-modern painting conceptual painting and my thesis was a look into the mechanics of visual pleasure so given that i was by default always interested in the spiritual dimensions or dynamic in modern art i was continuing to do that so my view was part of the fine art paradigm is you're redeeming things by decontextualizing them you bring them into the realm of art and by default is a higher a higher context okay in this cultural sphere okay so you experience it as somehow insofar as it is no longer part of the real world it is higher right so so so in my mind at the time i was like taking all these advertisements decontextualizing them putting them in a context of geometric abstraction which was by default in his history related to aspirations towards the transcendent and creating what i called a pseudo spirituality within the realm of a contemporary painting right and i was using fragments of visual fragments of culture that in my view were a material a spirit a materialistic spiritualism if that makes any sense yeah because when you look at advertisement they use for example a they use color light notions of purity and they try to exalt the object they're selling towards almost making it into a saint right make it putting it in the realm of the transcendent so i was basically using that kind of reference material bringing it into painting and questioning aspects of the transcendent value of painting and how ultimately if it is a commodity object it is planned into the whole pseudo materialistic spirituality of the market that was in my mind part of what was going on but that was at the same time of me becoming orthodox finding out about monasticism and so there was a transition that was taking place and i was getting closer to the probability of entering into the monastic life and i was like playing with the idea and i didn't know meanwhile i finished up graduate school i was i'm just one question like at any point did you experience a kind of schizophrenia in the in the let's say in the contemporary art world and this movement towards orthodoxy i say that because i was experiencing that in during my degree in art which is at some point i was doing these things here and i was doing these things here and i was and and it was just ripping me apart like i don't know if you had that experience yeah so yes that was definitely part of it i mean because it was you know not to be you know not too down or the the the protestant protestant brethren out there but but i was like and at a time i was like thinking to myself you know our world is like protestantism it's like you have different different denominations of like of of of of doctrines and and i'm i'm part and me participating in this it's like i'm like in in another i'm trying to like come up with like ideas that like for what purpose i was asking myself i mean i have i have the orthodox faith and so that already is is is all-encompassing it's like everything is is is is put in order there is a structure of meaning that like i don't need to be re in reinventing the wheel but meanwhile i'm doing this artwork that it predicates always reinventing the wheel because you have to always come up with an idea that moves the ball ahead somehow or whatever that means whatever that means right so so then it's like and then i was in a dilemma it's like do i want to just create beautiful objects for people to be gratified and but what does that really mean and even if i come up with good ideas are they even that good or helpful in the ultimate goal of our existence here in this world and so then when i when i looked at things in terms of like priorities i was like well there's a priority i have to say that a liturgical art is by default higher than than the paradigm that i'm experiencing it yeah i was thinking in in graduate school because it it it leads man towards it's he's his intended ultimate goal the ultimate good and and it's it's it's it's more all embracing because this is functional it's symbolic it's it's got aspects of beauty but it's not solely predicated on beauty and it's is is is leading man towards god so what else should i mean why why would i do anything else right but at that time but what you're saying is so interesting because there and i think this is going to lead us towards the way in which we can bring some of this back in yeah what it feels like is that there's an aspect of a lot of the contemporary art world and a lot of modernism which is almost like a hyper focusing as you said let's say hyper focusing on color like a hyper focusing on the sublime hyper focusing on these different aspects of experience and whereas the liturgical experience has it all there right and so it's like if you think there's no sublime in communion you're not paying attention my friend it's like it's there and and if you think that you know if you think there is in beauty all these things are there and so but there's a possibility interesting possibility to look at these hyper specializations in almost as like these in their heresies but see how they can they teach us something about that aspect also right it's like the the work on color that was done in the modern the modern era it's something that the ancients didn't have access to which is yes amazing work this is important what you're saying is very important that we have to i think as orthodox christians learn how to engage with the contemporary art world in an honest way but in a more nuanced way i think taking into consideration exactly what you're talking about for example i was looking at donald j i was looking at a doc another documentary an interview of the daughter of donald judd who was interviewed for the occasion of some big exhibition of his work he's a like one of the greatest minimalists right so or he probably wouldn't have liked that term but in any case and as they're talking to her they have this footage of like some of his sculptures and it dawned on me the guy was total empiricist he was like totally non-religious atheist and i was looking at his work and i was beginning to notice myself tracing his ordering structure and and and experiencing myself in a way contemplating the ordering system that he brought into this and how sometimes you almost grasp it but then it slips out of your your your your grasp and i'm like this has you could analyze that in a way that actually you could do a critique a a an interpretation that that is exactly what you're saying looking at this hyper approach to cognition or or our mind's capacity to order reality in a way where it brings out of the viewer a contemplative experience of an object that in a way serves as a parallel to prayer it is a gathering experience because you become aware of like you know how like you have seen denise's your epigod he's got the linear prayer and then the circular prayer and then the spiral prayer right right so i think some works can be seen and partly even even inadvertently even by people who don't even believe in god they create a situation in which you become aware of your capacity to have a higher level of cognition yeah and and to me that is like the same thing with the color painters that i mentioned that i'm indebted to from hunter college so and so so i think that's an important thing to keep in mind because if we just always approach it as this work is illustrative of this false idea or illustrative of this decadent period in history or illustrative of a worldview that is destructed to man it's like the reality is as orthodox christians we have been given the capacity to see christ in everything and we have to not forget that the logos is always playing in fields and places that we don't expect he's playing and so let's just look for him and have more of a of of an openness to to not ignore when things are clearly spiritually destructive but also realize that not things are not always so so starkly you know black and white you know yeah and the way the christians what they did to roman art they did exactly what we're talking about which is that there's a there's let's say in roman in roman in in hellenistic and roman art there's a kind of there's a kind of glorious human that is that is put on in front of us and that that tendency tends to become excessive in the sensuality in the kind of sexual aspect of it and and or even in the extreme of the warrior like there's these extremes that appear in roman art in the desire to kind of to lift up man and so the orthodox christian said okay we can take that no this is our this is our this is the stuff we've got to work with that's fine let's work with that and then keeping all the positive aspects of roman art but then taming them you know reorienting them having some contrapposto but not the excessive one we see you know both in roman and in the renaissance post-renaissance time having you know emphasizing the this kind of beautiful beautiful face for these kind of simple beautiful faces all of this is something that we ended up bringing back in you know and so you can trace roman art right up to the up to the post iconoclasm work like if you look at those carvings i love those ivory carvings that come after iconoclasm i mean all the tropes of roman art are there but they've all been reoriented the clothing has all the same forms but all all very the sensuousness is kind of tamed in and so why couldn't we do that again like you said with some of these powerful modern contemporary artists that have been that have been investigating some aspects of human experience that's a very interesting problem and it is one that i think is unavoidable and important one of the things we have to remember is i think we have to take this back jonathan the revival and i think we are heirs of the revival of icon painting and the sacred arts in the orthodox church okay that's really important to understand that yes the iconography almost died like it didn't die but it came very close people tend to think that orthodox iconography is just this thing that blazed on for since the beginning of of the church but that's not true right in the in the the starting in the'th century 19th century and then by the early 20th century it's a trickle like it's almost gone and so we have to understand that we are the children of a revival in the post-war period of of iconography and we are we are the the heirs of that for all good and ill that it had within its seed you could say right and that's that's the important thing because i think in the i think it it hasn't been until recently that the problematic dimensions of the revival have been considered i know as when i first became orthodox it was by default that the work of aspensky and kanteglu for example it was it was considered by default to be the authoritative traditional perspective on iconography yeah and and and they have served a very important catheterical role in in bringing people to a cognizance of the importance of traditional iconography but at the same time it has suffered from oversimplification the way people have taken their their thought and also they themselves i don't think addressed or were as honest no no that's not right to say they were not as upfront up front about how important their modern context was to them being able to even frame the questions that were different but do you think maybe they were more they're actually just unaware because they are often not we are unaware of the frame in which we say yes we exist and that frame becomes apparent you know as time goes on then we can look back and say oh okay this is what was going on and so i think that we don't have to blame them in any way but but also understand that they were doing a monumental insane work that we need to be you know eternally grateful to them for yeah but that in that desire to lift a mountain they were bound to to to to frame things you know a little often to make some mistakes to to over emphasize certain things like this is what's bound to happen well you know what to give credit to ospensky the the the remember that article i wrote about like his i mentioned where where he in one of his lessons mentions matisse yeah and and and and so he was he was aware of how the icon played into modernism and and he did not and and he he referred to matisse in a positive way when he's teaching when he was teaching his students so so so you know yeah you you also mentioned how close he was to and that whole kind of neo-catholic art modern neo-catholic art that was happening in the early that was the context that was totally the context and you know what was that article the autonomy of the icon yeah i think so where i basically tried to show the parallels between the symbolism of the 19th century that was articulated by maurice denis and how it pretty much i mean it's when you look at when you hear him speak and then you hear uspensky speak or contact you speak you're like oh right so they're coming from the same attitude towards the capacity of painting to embody something more than meets the eye that is related to an inner experience of nature but in the case of aspensky encounter glue it's like given that the orthodox they place that level of cognition above mere feelings they place it in the realm of the noetic apprehension of things okay so so anyway so but i say that to say that there there we have to look further into the interesting convergence that existed as you know as as the revival was happening between the revivalists and modernism yeah and so so if if we look at that honestly then we realize that we cannot escape our own moment yeah and just like the iconographers of the byzantine period felt like they were in continuity with with the the hellenic past yeah with the roman are they felt completely like they were continuing roman art right and so so they did not see themselves as in any way or form breaking away from it they saw them as they tell themselves as take like you describe taking aspects revalorizing them for the purpose of ecclesial function and so so similarly what we need to do is take whatever it is within our context revalorize it and re-employ it for the function that we have liturgically as iconographers right so but the thing is this and this is where i think it's important to make a distinction between iconology and stylistic form because the iconology is is a more complicated matter because in a way you're dealing with formulations visual structures that convey specific semiotic meanings if you want to call it that way yeah might not be you know i might not be using that being technical about it yeah yeah okay so but but what i'm talking about is the formal aspects of the icon that are in the realm of experiential connection with the art object yeah so color coding line four exactly so all these things either will complement augment the iconology or it will actually work against it yeah distract us from distracting so the key is to there is in that sense a lot of freedom within the formal dimension because by default when i'm like going to paint something i have to start making decisions i have to i can you know it is it is a false understanding the traditional iconography is predicated solely on mechanistic slavish copying of older prototypes yeah okay well there are some people that do it that way but it's a dead end exactly it has it's definitely a dead end yeah so so there is a value in it in you know it it's a there's a value in it in the in in the training process but eventually what we want to do is that actually create works that come from a living experience of the prototypes that we are handling the the the the final work has to be a witness to our living encounter with what it is that we're depicting and if it is not then we are not actually witnessing to the continuing life of the holy spirit in the church and what we're doing is that we're creating environments that counter our call to spread the gospel because people are gonna look into their churches and they're gonna be like all right so these people are like they're stuck in the middle ages and they just want to just basically perpetuate this like romantic like you know idea of themselves nostalgia you're right that's not like we want i always say tradition without nostalgia exactly that's my motto no because tradition is it's it's that one thing it also goes into the fact that something is old doesn't mean that it is traditional exactly but also i want to i want to bring something up just like because i think we're right there is that i what i've said until now is something that i taught i believe in all the things that i've said but i think there's also a caveat which is that i also notice an another tendency in the kind of the world of iconography which is a desire for the experience of novelty itself right the desire to be titillated you could say by novelty and i think that that and so so i think that there are some iconographers that want to use this freedom that we talk about to let's say because what you're saying make what we were saying until now makes total sense if we are focused on the basic idea we mentioned at the outset so it's like i can integrate this or that aspect of matisse if i'm my purpose is to create objects with a specific teleology that are there to to to exist within the communion of the church that are there to to to bring us you know to not call attention to themselves in a disproportionate way all this stuff okay but that the flip side all is also true where there's also people there's also some iconography that i'm seeing around that seems to to want to almost idolize the novelty that as if the idea of wanting to be in line with the traditional forms is somehow useless it's it's it's boring it's not interesting and even that language of saying like we want to make it interesting we want to make art that is that is contemporary in a in a very kind of vague way so i think it's inevitable we're going to make art that's contemporary but it seems like we always have to sub subject that to the ultimate purpose and the participation in the life of the church and the liturgy and all of that so i don't know if you have any thoughts on that as well i think that is always the thing to keep in mind it is a crucial point to to to not like ignore because i agree i mean there are and i encountered this myself because it's the temptation is that you know i don't want to do this because it's boring because it's been done so many times that like you know after a while it's like how many times are you gonna do it you know but the reality is it serves a function and you have to do it but but then at the same time it calls you to be more creative if you're if you're sick and tired of like you know look at but be creative in a way that is a service to the community not a self-indulgent yeah i want to have some fun so so you have to like you're saying keep in mind the telos the function the purpose of what it is that you're doing is ultimately as i like to say for aiding people's process their struggle towards deification and if if that is kept in mind and you're using your discernment and you are actually harmonizing with all the various voices of the tradition then you will produce something that is authentic and something that is within the spirit of the church that will have a creative dimension to it but it's not going to be like excessive in its affirmation of either yourself or or the our objects for its own sake and so that's so but my my my contention my my fear is on the other side of the same coin that you're yeah yeah yeah which is which is let's not i think aidan has also pointed this out let's not be scared and then being scared like bury our talent in in this in this very you know crucial like process of of creative the discernment in the creative process you know on top of what we've been saying about the viability of using things that have come out of a modern painting i think it's also important to [music] not ignore the parallels that exist between the iconographic tradition and other forms of traditional art for example persian manuscript illumination yeah the work of the indian miniaturist like the rashford painting and you know bahari painting and things like that and the tibetan taga tradition for example the the chinese and japanese painting traditions and when you really start looking at this you realize okay man this is my hubris speaking right i look at some of our icons and then i'm like come on we have to we have to step up we got we got to do something better man and so i'm like you know when i think like i think that anybody when we look at your icons i think this is like my greatest compliment maybe not my greatest one of my compliments of your work which is that when you look at an icon one of your icons for most people they get just this this sense of wonder and beauty and then for someone who knows he's like like i know where he's pulling these threads in from but they don't they they're like a tapestry they don't they don't they don't call attention to themselves as threads like they don't jar like you see i've seen some kind of very kind of subversive type of of icon painting you know where you it's like it we're not subversive but like but it just looks like a japanese prince like it's just a japanese print with a halo okay i mean yeah it's kind of interesting i mean somewhat interesting but i definitely wouldn't put that on iconostasis but there's a way to dr to pull in some of the patterns in japanese print some of the composition some of the line work for example that is that is that is subtle enough to not call attention to itself as a as a weird string that's poking out of the tapestry but integrates itself into in a way that creates that sense of wonder i've watched people like father shiloh like i've never told you this but i've watched people stand in front of your your icons and i watch them and and they just they like go into a trance they're just like standing there and they just look at it and you and you and you're trying to like figure out what's going on in their mind like what's happening but i don't think they even know like most people don't even know what's going on but i think that that i think touches on what we were saying before about the the importance of form having an effect that is experiential that people will not necessarily you cannot you cannot codify it or quantify it in a in a semiotic way yeah you experience it it it it aids it aids the function of it can aid if you can yeah there you go that's great aid to augment the function of the icon as a support for contemplation and that and and and what i like to say is that this contemplation embraces both feeling and intellect and when i say intellectual of course we mean like no no i don't really know what i'm saying right right so so so you have you have the doctrinal message that elevates you intelligibly but you are also experiencing a static to the aesthetic form also an elevation that puts you in the frame of mind that contributes towards stillness towards a contemplative entering into a participatory connection with the work and so and so this this i think i partly have i'm indebted i believe from looking at at modern painting because to me like okay for example like ad reinhardt man yeah i mean some of rothko's painting some of even even kenneth nolan paintings i mean kenneth nolan it's like bordering on getting a little bit too fabulous yeah you know what i'm saying but in his best moments you're encountering a a color experience that you're like how did this guy come up with this vision and and and it puts you in like you're saying a zone you know right so but this zone has to be actually brought it has to be something that brings you towards the ultimate like it's a vehicle for higher things not for the zone is not enough yes it has exact service of god exactly no no totally totally but that's the that's the key but that is very important because otherwise i think my my my concern is that unfortunately there is perhaps i'm exaggerating maybe not you tell me how you feel about this there is a tendency of using iconography for philotic purposes what i mean by that is given that orthodoxy has experienced trauma after trauma historically collapse of constantinople turkish right the the communist revolution you know what i'm saying all these various instances that have contributed to it's like like you know yeah i think yeah constantly beaten on the tendency is then for people and also other other issues of like during the turkish europe for example like the the the patriarch became a an ethnic leader right yeah so so so the the the the the ottoman authorities used them as a legislator of these specific ethnic groups yeah so then then orthodoxy became closely linked to your ethnic identity and and also the whole issue of patriarchy throughout the history of orthodoxy have inculcated a sense of like a ethnic identity and the almost like undiscernable or undifferentiatable like you know connection between ethnicity and orthodoxy right but that's problematic yeah and it seems to me that in the realm of iconography what happens is that local churches tend to fixate on specific forms visually that they deem to be appropriate in embodying their sense of ethnic identity yeah and my advantage is i'm not greek you're not part of it i'm not russian i'm not puerto rico never had a patriarchy right or america you know right you have the oca but then there's that's the work in progress right yeah like the idiocephaly and things like that so so we are in an environment or i am in an environment as you as well like we live in a world that is more it's not less of that of that temptation you could say exactly so we have we have access to all this wealth of visual reference material that we could use as a means to strengthen like uplift like make iconography more flourishing and and instead of thinking that if i don't do it this way then i'm betraying my nation where i'm between you know the church because i have such a close like i make such an close connection between ethnicity and and religion you know so so i think i think it's important to emphasize that iconography is not greek iconography it's not russian iconography you know one of the problems that aspensky and kanteglu had when they were having their conversation the letters they wrote to each other was all right what are we going to consider to be the classical form the best to follow and of course kanta glu thought it was cretan you know folk like you know 16th century yeah greek works and while you know it was the you know the 15th or 16th century you know what i'm saying russian right and russian stuff and so and they didn't they didn't agree but the thing is iconography is not set in stone we follow a tradition and the tradition is there to keep us focused on primary concerns meanings that we are trying to embody through the iconographic tradition that that kind of graphic form in music similarly you know and so architecturally similarly right so we have this this this variety of of of things that forms aesthetic tendencies that we have received that we have to work with that we don't cast out because they work and they already serve as a context where people come in and they already know where they're what they're inhabiting yeah and so we are to take this and elevate it more and more and more and more by our putting our contribution not out of like some like selfish kind of like you know self-aggrandizing purpose but as a service to the community and so that means that your talent my talent aiden hearts talent you know cordis talent torador's talent whoever it is around we have been given a very unique capacity and we use it for the service of the church we have to use it for the service of the church but to try to somehow stomp it because we interpret it as being self-assertion or or or buying into the self-expressive theory of modern art i don't think it's that simple i think i think there is a a a uh room for the uniqueness of the person and this is one pivotal critique that i don't think has been addressed has been made before with the work of kumaswami because komaswami was excessively platonic yeah and and his notion of tradition was predicated on the hindu vedanta philosophical tradition which completely denied the importance of the hypothesis yeah the person there's no sense of the person in and so for him when he sees us at the tendency in traditional art towards anonymity he interprets it from a vedantist point of view yeah an excessively platonic view where like we will shed our bodies and we will shed our personalities and we will identify ourselves with the one and or the atman the self with a capital s and so all the illusions that the suffering cost because of us constructing this false notion of self that would be done away with and we have bliss no we like saying makari is the great i think it is and his muhammad ali's it's you know say saint paul remain saint paul say peter remains saint peter all the saints remain who they are but they are they're they reach their true identity in christ without completely losing their their person yeah and so and so that's an important distinction to make and i think the contemporary place in which we find ourselves today as iconographers is one in which we have to make that that distinction and clarify that in emphasizing the personal dimension of iconography is not buying into self angridizing self expression in the individualistic sense if anything is a way of rebuttaling tendencies that could be excessively platonic yeah or excessively hindu that have come through the amazing help without him even realizing of people like kumar swami yeah and and i think that it's like it's similar to the when we talked about in terms of national imagery that you just have to find a balance there's a balance it's like we love russian iconography we love greek iconography we love serbian iconography georgian it's beautiful it has its wonderful particularities that we celebrate and maybe the same also in the sense of great iconographers who have some particularity that we celebrate we just have to find the balance between understanding how that coexists with this move towards unity and it really is the christian story in the end it really is it is this balance of unity and multiplicity which we find already in the trinitarian theology and ultimately in the way the church exists it's the is the story of pentecost it's it's is because you know it's a continuum in pentecost i think that's that aidenhart has put it before one of his articles where like each nation has something to contribute each nation is is united in christ they don't lose their identity but the catholicity of the church presupposes that it is the healing of the confusion that happened in the tower of babel and so they they we all come together and even if the you know each person has a flame on top of their head right each each apostle right so it's like individual tongues of fire but they they still is still the same holy spirit this diversity of gifts but the same spirit so so similarly with different temperaments different capacities artistically these are prophetic is you know the the the prophet prophesies like saint paul says but this their spirit is not taken away from them they still have they're cooperating with divine grace and so we are to cooperate with divine grace and that means that whatever is healthy good will flourish and what is not good that we could put aside we will for the service of the church but the individual and the the temperamental uniqueness that each person or nation offers is for the world like the the the wealth of the church and so that's that's that's that it makes a manifest and witnesses to the catholicity of the church in the holy spirit i think that's that was a that was an amazing way to to end our our discussion with that last that last encouragement and so father sylvan thank you so much as you know i love i love your work so much and i think that thank you you know for people who don't know i have one drawing from father silawan we did an exchange several years ago of a drawing which is one of my favorite things in the world it's in my living room now but but i'm also very fortunate to be able to receive hopefully soon an icon from father siluwan and so i'm really excited to i'll show everybody when when i receive it so so i would say go to his website i will put a link in the description to the work he's doing to his articles he is a he is a shining light in the world of of american iconography but honestly also i think in the iconography in in the world period and so father siloan thank you for your time and thank you for giving me the opportunity it's been we tried to do this a while back but i'm glad we finally got it and it's been actually you know providentially actually worth the wait because it was a good conversation and thank you for giving me the opportunity as you know the symbolic world is not just a bunch of videos on youtube we are also a podcast which you can find on your usual podcast platform but we also have a website with a blog and several very interesting articles by very intelligent people that have been thinking about symbolism on all kinds of subjects we also have a clips channel a facebook group you know there's a whole lot of ways that you can get more involved in the exploration and the discussion of symbolism don't forget that my brother matsuya wrote a book called the language of creation which is a very powerful synthesis of a lot of the ideas that explore and so please go ahead and explore this world you can also participate by you know buying things that i've designed t-shirts with different designs on them and you can also support this podcast and these videos through paypal or through patreon everybody who supports me has access to an extra video a month and there are also all kinds of other goodies and tiers that you can get involved with so everybody thank you again and thank you for your support
