[music] my conversational partner is jonathan pagio i'm really excited jonathan well it's great to meet you yeah it's great to meet you i'm so happy man he's here so i figured that place i'd love to start this conversation is a few months back we had douglas murray on the show and when he was on the show he talked about how in the modern age we've really pushed forward say science and religion and he talked about these kinds of collapse of grand narratives in particular religion he mentioned was one and he sort of mentioned this kind of push towards secularism almost so i would just have to just start with a broad question and say if it let's say in the last 100 years that religion has kind of taken a backseat to say science and religion how do you analyze where we are as a society right now like how do you analyze where things are right now well i think that i could say this is going to sound dramatic but i think we're at the end of something there are certain ways to understand when you come to the end of a story let's say or the end of a pattern and it seems like we're at the end of some pattern we're in a crisis maybe is the best way to understand it and so i think everybody is we could say that the world in which we used to live has kind of broken down and we feel that not only in terms of a breakdown in meaning but we see it as a breakdown in society as well as we see fragmentation in discourse we see groups rising up against each other in discourse for now but obviously we know that if this continues then it leads to actual physical violence at some point where you know irreducible opposites start to appear positions that just can't coexist with others and so this is what we're noticing in terms of the society but the story as well there's a fight for the story like what is the story of our world and there's a there's a fight to know what it is let's say and so all of this is a sign that we're in a crisis john vervicky the cognitive psychologist from the university of toronto he he talks about a meeting crisis i think it's a good way to understand what's going on and a lot of it has to do with what nietzsche announced let's say how the the death of god or the death of christianity was going to bring about massive amounts of chaos but it's been going on for a while and so we could say that world war one world war ii were part of that and since world war ii we've had a little reprieve it's almost like a it's almost like a shock or let's say a post-traumatic you know moment and now it feels like the momentum which led to those words is happening again the same kind of patterns the same the same patterns in terms of extreme let's say a desire for extreme variety and degenerate degeneracy and then at the same time we see these kind of totalitarian moves and culture happening at the same time so that seems to be where we are where we are i wonder if we are say perhaps close to the edge of something do you think that is is it possible to go back like is it possible to save things like i this is i hate being the apocalyptic one but i feel like things are going to play out let's say and they can play out they can play out really bad they can play out bad but i think that we're going to go through a difficult time where things aren't just going to go back to normal and it's like it's not just going to happen that things are going to get better just like this there's going to there's going to be a difficult time and hopefully i mean one of the things that let's say my hope are the things that i'm doing and people like douglas marie and there are other thinkers out there who i think hopefully are trying to create enough of a of a bastion to survive the flood something like an arc like like a let's say a many enough people that have a better understanding of history and a better understanding of what makes a person a human all of these things brought together so that we have something to to survive the flood with i really like that i really really like that analogy if we go back through history i was thinking back through civilizations perhaps the romans or the greeks have they been perhaps any signs in that that you're aware of throughout history of civilizations that a civilization is on the verge of collapse and are there sort of any patterns with where we are today yeah there are several patterns so you can see that at the towards the end of the roman empire during the crisis right the let's say what do they call the third century crisis there were certain things which were appearing certain manifestations and they're pretty universal they there's a for example there's a reduction in birth rate people stop having children they become interested in in strange aspects of sexuality they become interested in strangeness in general so there's a there's an interest in the the the bizarre and the perverse in the upside down let's say the carnivalesque of society the idea of roman civilization and the and the this the kind of orgy culture you could say that was there in late roman civilization and then it leads also to a desire to how can i say this it's a there's also a fetish fetishizing of the stranger and so for example young roman people in that time of crisis would dress as barbarians they would take on the tropes of their enemies basically and so there's this there are many things that that kind of signal the end of a civilization and it's not a it's a it's kind of like a universal it's a fractal pattern right reality has a has a fractal structure you could say and so you can understand for example that at the end of a year in a traditional calendar you would have a carnival and this is something that jews for example have at the end of their year called purim and in in christian cycles you would have something like mardi gras or you would have the saturnalia in the time of the romans so all in and during the christian middle ages around the time of the saturnalia they would have something called the feast of fools or even the feast of the ass like a feast of the donkey so all of these upside down type of behaviors and you can understand it also in the society as well so think about like a town and then on the edge of town the circus will come or a affair and then there'll be all this aesthetic of the of the carnival right and so if you want to understand what happens at the end is you can understand it just in terms of how though the end of a year would manifest itself in a carnival you'd have upside-down behavior you'd have lewd behavior all of this kind of stuff that usually isn't permitted in the society would kind of come out for a day and parade around and then after that you would move to normality and so that is so that's a good way to understand you can say that our world is a carnival right now like there's a lot of the aspects of our world as a carnival but it's a carnival that's reaching towards the end and so you know in the saturnalia it was actually crazy because what they would do is they would elect a slave and they would make the slave into like an emperor figure and they would he would spend a day of feasting and and kind of all these sexual stuff that would go on and then at the end of the day they would just kill the slave and it was like that's the end of the carnival and now we move back to normal and so what it feels like is that we're towards the end of the carnival and the axe is whole is like is right there above our heads and is getting ready to come down but and we can see that with cobit as well like the the types of measures that are being taken with kovid look like a a kind of authoritarian clampdown which is on the horizon and it's being justified it doesn't matter it almost doesn't matter how it's justified right it's almost like it doesn't matter how we justify the fact that this is happening it's just happening as a natural procession of a cycle which is that after a carnival comes the shutdown comes the say the hammer falls let's say and so this seems to and that's what you know if you understand world war ii that's what happened just before world war ii during the during weimar germany like varma germany was we're like weimar germany times 10. that's a good way to understand what's happening in our society you know all the aesthetics of weimar germany we are imbibing them but like you know at a much higher level and so then what comes after that is a clampdown sadly which might seem like at a much higher level than even what happened in world war ii it's not i'm going to frighten everybody but that my per my purpose isn't to frighten people but i'm just i just wish people could be able to just see the patterns and to notice that these cycles like i'm not making it up like this is something that happens at the end of civilizations and i think that it's very it's very eye-opening to see those patterns and kind of see where we are today like one thing i've been thinking about is just how much meaning throughout centuries people have derived from religion and i wonder perhaps what your thoughts are on this that as perhaps as we talked about perhaps religion has kind of taken a backseat to science and reason have people tuned towards other means of instantiating meaning like social justice for instance is that where they've turned to no that's definitely right and so one of my contentions is that what we call religion that term it has problems but let's say what we call religion is inevitable what you could call something like the ritualization of of existence the the desire to let's say move together towards something which transcends you with something which is bigger than you and to do it ritually and to do it through certain mechanisms which is the definition of an inside and an outside you know this idea of processing around the important thing all of these things are just inevitable and if we try to get rid of them they will come back and and that's what we're seeing right now so 2020 was a year of the return of the religious he just flooded back in through you know a weird a weird fasting right at the beginning of covid and then a kind of ecstatic moment of communion where everybody went into the streets and started to protest and having these communal feasts and there was everything that was religious there were people processing and kneeling and chanting and so there was everything that you would find in a religious setting was being happened was happening in the in these events but there's also something else which was happening which is scapegoating and that's also very important an important part of the religious pattern which is the scapegoating because scapegoating is what defines you right is often what defines your identity because you you identify the the foreigner the outsider the thing that is a kind of a disease and then you want to eliminate it and so now we have this weird moment right in the in the floyd protest we saw that happening where there was this idea that like in the entire world like the entire world was was based on racism and every evil could be just like plugged into this one thing and if we could just like even put it in one person an orange-haired guy and then we could just all put it in this guy then if we could just burn him alive then everything would go away it was it was like and this is a religious this is a religious ceremony it's a we're noticing a religious pattern and it's a it's frightening because it's it's it's kind of an out of control religious pattern it's almost like a it has something of the mass to it it has something of the of almost like almost if you think of a penteus you know in the backy who who who who faces this out-of-control religious manifestation gets ripped apart by it you know that's what we're noticing that's at least that seems to be what's happening around us it's it's crazy when you put them in terms like that and you realize just how deeply ingrained these values traditions ideas are i wonder do you think that we'll ever be able to lose those meanings that we did instantiate from it possible for them to go away no i don't think so that this is also one of the things that and you also don't want them to go away because true the way that i try to help people understand is that let's say the religious stories are religious just patterns they're actually your they are your mechanism of perceptions like they're the way that you perceive value in things and so science has is great science is a wonderful tool because it's able to count it's able to predict it's able to to like accurately quantify phenomena in order to understand it and like i said even reproduce it which is which is amazing but it doesn't offer you quality it doesn't offer you value right you can use science to create a nuclear weapon and you can use science to to make medicine which will help people but it's the same science right there's no there's nothing in the science which tells you what is valuable and and that is the religious instinct the hierarchy which would call the hierarchy of values is instantiated in the the the hierarchy when you say god is in heaven right and hell is below is below all of this is actually just an instantiation of hierarchy it's it's so when you say that something is better or something is superior to something else you're participating in a religious pattern because you're saying it's closer to god and you can't avoid it like you can try to avoid it but you you would just be running around in circles because you have the idea of a good and every time you give value to something you are pointing towards that good and that's the religious pattern right that's what that's why we say the gods are above and you know the demons are below or all this imagery that we use it's all it's all that's the same thing as any type of valuing has that pattern i love that man i love that one thing that i was thinking about i come from a relative scientific background and i was thinking about this when i was entering this conversation i was thinking that there are just so many things that science kind of can't tell you like science can't tell you if you're falling in love with someone science can't tell you if you're a good person what do you think that the kind of limits to science are well the limit to science is really it's the impossibility of identifying quality so scientist science can only describe and sometimes we think that science can identify quality but that's because people don't realize that the quality is something that we we add to the science right and so let's say you could think of let's say you could think of science can help you make beautiful flowers but the the beautiful flower is not doesn't come into science for the science there's no difference between an ugly flower and a beautiful flower there's no difference between an apple that tastes good in an apple that tastes bad it's just different chemicals but the idea that you would use science to make an apple that tastes better or that it's more resistant to germs or that is whatever that is based on a value system right it's based on a hierarchy and any type of hierarchy cannot be given by science and i would go even further than that and i would say that there are no identities which can be given by science even the identity of something like even the fact that we for example say that a city is one thing that cannot that doesn't come from science we need something we need something higher to imagine to tell you this is a city and then we can tell science to study it like we can tell we need something higher to tell us this is a mountain and then we can have science study it but science itself can't even come to those definitions can't even understand how multiplicity emerges into unity you know how different like how different phenomena actually appears to us as one i always give the example like the simple example of a chair it's like a chair it's a bunch of stuff a chair is not one thing a chair is a bunch of things it's a million things it's it's an indefinite amount of things and so why can i see it as one thing how do i do that and that cannot be accounted for by science i mean science can explain the mechanism let's say that happens in your brain but you can't explain the unity of the chair right you can't explain it away it comes through a gestalt like this this sense of unity this jump into unity you could say and you can almost and like in a spiritual way you would say it's something like a little epiphany or a little like a little like really like a little vision right how things come into one and and it's it's easier it's easier to dismiss that like when it's at a level of a chair but it's a lot harder to dismiss it when it's at the level of a city for example or the level of a country or the you know or or these these let's say larger or even the level of a family or the level of anything that is beyond the the you know the simple things but the simple things have it too it's just sometimes people don't see it as well but if you go up higher into the let's say the hierarchy of beings then you can't avoid it you know you see that that unity is given it's not you can't analyze you can't analyze to the unity you can't get there yeah man i really love that i really love that and i definitely think that there is a kind of there's a domain of facts and there's a domain of values and i completely agree that you know i wouldn't want to put all my faith in a civilization in the hands of science you know there has to be values too type of thing there's something else going on it's really important to see is that there because you can't avoid it because you can't avoid the value what happens is that when someone says it's just science they've got a card behind their back and sometimes they don't know and i will give them the benefit of the doubt sometimes they don't even know that they have this card hidden behind their back but i think sometimes they do and so they say something like follow the science but the science doesn't lead you anywhere i'm sorry that's not doesn't happen there's something else you're following so if you're going to pretend that you don't like there's a there's a strange magic trick happening where you tell people to follow the science but you're actually telling them this is the value like let's say safety is the value in terms of kogit it's like so absolute safety is the value and we're willing let's say to sacrifice these this and this and this value towards safety and now follow the science but at least like we have to be honest about that right we have to be honest that it's actually not about science it's about a competing set of values and so we we should be able to discuss it at the level of values rather than then have this idea that if you don't agree with me then you're anti-science that's that's a that's a rhetorical that's a rhetorical game that's being played on you definitely definitely i would love to kind of pick up on this sort of science rhetoric you know so i i'd like to think of myself as as a kind of a critical thinker so i i would say that i'm extremely open-minded as our audience is i think that i i'm with always open to hear kind of all sides i think that one issue that i've struggled with is that i kind of do hold beliefs about evolution let's say the evolutionary nature of the world darwinism i listened to a lot of your content on this and i really love your viewpoint on this how do would you best conceptualize your viewpoint on let's say darwinism on evolution and like how how do you kind of take that aside from obviously the values and the beliefs which you do hold about the world yeah i mean i think that let's say darwin exposed some very important let's say patterns of being right in terms of how things come together and how they function and how they they persist in the world it's a good way to understand it it's like they're val let's say darwin identified certain values which is like there's a certain idea of necessity like there are certain things which are necessary in order for the being to then continue into the future right and that's actually it's almost like it's almost there is a philosophical aspect to that and there are certain things which are less necessary and those things that are less necessary will tend to get move out of the way like they will just naturally kind of happen to move out of the way and so i'm totally fine with that like i have no problem with that my problem is the problem of narrative it's the problem of story i don't think that darwin offers us a story that we can properly live in and that and that darwinism offers us the right story to to exist in and i can and i can give you an like i can give you a simple example is this that so so let's say that i let's say that i talk about a a work of art like i talk about michelangelo's david and i tell you that the origin of michael's day of michelangelo's david is the stone and then i explained that all the how the stone came about and all the different pressures in the in the ground and all of this that happened and so but it's like that's not that's not that's not the story of michelangelo's david right just like if i would tell you that music comes from you know like that that beethoven's music comes from you know pieces of wood hitting on on on chords it's like that's not that's not the story like you can't we as intelligent beings like we see the value in things we recognize it like you can say you can argue with it all you want but when i look at an apple i am evaluating it i'm deciding if it's a good apple or if it's a bad apple i'm constantly everything every identity is actually teleological that is every identity is actually our perception of the world is based on value and this is something that is actually coming out in the science itself it's like when you look at a cliff you don't first of all see cliff you see a place that i can fall from right if you look at a rock you think is it a rock i can pick up is it a rock i can sit on is it a rock that i could build with that's what we're seeing when we're looking at the categories of the world and those are real right those are real categories and so the problem with the darwi the darwin story is that we can't live in that story yes we can live like so religion what it offers you is a story that you can live in it's a story that is taking into account the fact that human beings are are meaning beings and it puts that into the story so if once and then when you read for example the story in genesis like that then you realize that that story is all about that right it's all about saying god speaks the world comes into existence god sees and recognizes it is good right that's how god the world is created so it's all about meaning value and an act of consciousness you could say like this recognizing of of the phenomenon right and then the same thing happens at the level of adam and eve it's all about knowledge knowledge of good and evil you know and then and then once you enter into the world of opposites you start to tumble and you start to fall into multiplicity so it's all these it's so you realize that that's the story that's a story you can actually live in because it's a story about meaning and about consciousness and about how we engage the world and so that's been let's say one of the works that i've been trying to do is try to help people understand that like say the narrative the religious narratives they're not the same kind of narratives as the technical description right so the difference would be something like i can tell you how your car works right i can tell you how the carburetor works and i can tell you how the oil goes through this tube and how there's this and that and that's that's fine like there's nothing wrong with that but what you really want to know is how to drive the car and that's what you really want to know and you want to know like why you would care about it it's because it can get me to the store faster than my feet it's like that's the story you live in so it doesn't deny that it doesn't deny the other story like it doesn't deny the other aspect of the of the car which is like explaining how it works and how all the fluids function with each other but it's it's lower on the hierarchy of of what we are right what we really care about is what we can do with this and and also how it relates to to our story let's say and so that's how i tried to differentiate the religious stories from the the more scientific descriptions or or even you know natural selection but there's value in in the idea of natural selection you can actually use it to understand some some mechanisms of meaning as well but it's a dangerous if you try to attach yourself only to that because like i said you can't really live in it and you can see it happening it's not hard to see like a good example is brett weinstein right now is that brett weinstein says he's a materialist says he's a scientist and is he an evolutionary biologist and constantly is telling you we have to escape we have to escape the story of evolution and it's like okay well where are you getting this idea like where is it does it come from evolution like where does this idea that you need to escape the story of evolution come from and and it's and and you right away you're now you've jumped into a religious world and you just can't avoid it because you're talking about value you're talking about these mechanisms that aren't enough just like the mechanisms of the car aren't enough you need to escape into what's the point i'm driving my car to the store not i'm thinking about the carburetor and the and all these aspects of how it's actually functioning right i completely agree it it is absolutely a mechanism it's an explanation it's not a vehicle like you wouldn't want to guide your life with the you know with charles darwin on your wall as a as a kind of prophet i kind of love to tie all this up this sort of opening that we've had by you we've kind of gone back in time we talked about kind of where we are as a society you give a a very very very coherent answer about darwinism so i would just you know kind of think about my generation so maybe a younger generation so i'm 25 now particularly people i've noticed in generation z and kind of more contemporary generations that i've spoken with this seems to be kind of a dismissive attitude i would say towards religion and religious values or you know whatever it is and i feel like perhaps it's that they starve the purpose i i'm not too sure you know specifically why i think that like one thing that like we can't deny is obviously that religion was is the birth of right and wrong that's like how we know that we can opt towards secularism so i would just love to just kind of just ask you for the person listening now what would you say is like the real value in familiarizing oneself with the history of a faith or religious values like what would you say like the even if they don't necessarily believe in it but just to kind of get to know the sort of literature and stuff on it yeah i want to answer just first your first point that you said and then i'll get to your question please one of the one of the things that has happened and this is something that we need to really acknowledge is that christianity in the west became a materialistic religion it it it abandoned its mysteries let's say and that's the reason like i have a lot of sympathy for nietzsche honestly like i have sympathy i have a lot of sympathy for atheists because if i look at the level of the 19th century 20th century christianity it's pathetic like it's a pathetic thing because they they're materialist and they try to lay over on top of this this weird story about some guy dying on a cross and like what are you like what is this doesn't make any sense like these two things don't don't stick together and so and so i have a lot of sympathy for for where people are in terms of their understanding of religion and so what i what i've been trying to do and i think there are a few other people trying to do that is to try to go back into the roots of the christian tradition to go back into the the highest thinkers of the christian tradition and try to bring back a kind of metaphysical vision let's say or bring back a cosmic vision of what it is that christianity was presenting as a coherent world that you could exist in and and so that's really what i've been doing and and that is ultimately let's say the answer to the second this the your question which is that one of the problems we have let's say the nihilism that we face is that we have no story we can live in we have we don't have a grand narrative that's exactly the problem and so because we don't have a grand narrative we have fragmentary narratives which start to appear and they become completely silly at some point right they become as silly as fandoms right so it's like all these stupid fandoms that everybody has and they're all attached to all these fictional worlds and would even like compete amongst each other in their fictional attachments and so it's like you're not gonna get you're not gonna get rid of like religious conflict it's just gonna kind of devolve to stupid things where it's it's all these these strange things that people are looking looking towards and people want to become people get obsessed with star wars or harry potter or all these fictional universes because they have this desire to to to participate in a story which transcends them something which shows them a little more about reality and so i think that that's really the key is to is to go back and to reread let's say or to look back into christianity in a way that helps you to see how you can live in the world and how you can exist how you can be part of a of a story but not just a story like a body and that's you know when we talk about the church as the body of christ we can totally understand that now it's actually a good time to understand that as we talk about things like emergence and the problem of how things have identities and you know the idea of complexity and complex beings we can understand then what it means for let's say a body of believers to be together to love each other in communion and to look towards the same goal or the same purpose and therefore to become a community and that's what human beings are made for that we're we're made to be communities we we're community communal beings and so that is really that's a that is the solution that going back into a religious way of seeing consciously will bring you because if you don't it's gonna you're not gonna avoid it it's gonna come back in all these weird ways it's gonna happen anyways it's gonna it's gonna happen through all these weird fetishizations that people have you know and these weird ideologies that people adopt and who that become religious to them but they don't realize that they are and they're more dangerous because of that you know it's like social justice is way more dangerous because it it doesn't even see itself as having some kind of religious structure it just sees itself as this is true this is real and everybody else anybody who doesn't just completely agree with me has to be eliminated basically since it has to be canceled and right now it's just right now it's just canceling online but that that stuff boils out into the real world pretty fast and we've seen it happen it's people have there have been you know i agree people that i don't agree with but people have lost their bank accounts have lost their access to certain financial institutions and that's going to continue if this culture continues and it's gonna it's gonna create a new a new outsider like a weird new scapegoat mechanism so one thing that i would love to pick up on that you mentioned there is you talk about these kind of grand narratives how religion gives you a kind of story to live in and a clearly defined set of you know set of instructions to follow i wonder i was thinking about this earlier i was thinking kind of why people get so hooked on video games and the one thing which i think about with video games is that they have bright lines you know what to do to get to the next level they're clearly defined you're not thinking about anything else is there kind of parallels between that and religion oh definitely there's definitely a parallel between video games and religion because also really video games exist in a religious world they they exist in so one of the things that i talk about for example is like the basic structure of a world right as the idea of like the earth as a as a flat that's a surface and then the heaven has a dome above and this kind of and on the edge of the world is usually some kind of chaos or some kind of limit that you can't go beyond you know something like the ocean this idea of the great serpent around the earth right that you can't sure you can't tran you can't go beyond and so so you have this structure in usually in a video game and because of the game dynamics you end up having to create centers right you have to have these these kind of central spaces out of which identities or stories will happen and then you move out into the wild right and then you come back to these to these centers where it's quests whatever kind of game you play will will often have these this quest mechanism where you get you get something someone something is asked of you and then you go out you do it and you come back and then you receive the reward all of these this is all these are all religious tropes they're all religious patterns and so obviously they will give you a certain sense of satisfaction let's say to master some element of the game and so they have some value but the value is limited right because it is it is this broken off world that it that you know when you take your headphones off and you you you move away from the screen right then then it doesn't connect to your life like it's a disc it's like a strange fragmentation of reality and so that is let's say when you think of when you think for example of this idea of like the heavenly ladder let's say and you see these images in dante of these of these heavenly spheres or the spheres of of of purgatory moving up into the spheres of heaven that's exactly the same structure but it's the same structure as a video game it's like you have these levels and then you you attain these levels it's just that it's not it doesn't it's not artificial in the sense that it's actually about acquiring virtues and acquiring transformation in your transformations in your being it's not just about getting the magic acts of whatever i like whatever it is that you would do in a video game like acquiring some of some some virtual object but it actually is a transformation of the person so you could see it that way like the purpose of life is to go up the levels it's just that these levels are actually levels of virtue and not just levels of you know random these things that will go away and you'll forget about it in the next few years so i really like that one other thing i was thinking about when i was coming into this conversation and you know i wouldn't kind of describe myself as a as a particular believer of a faith i would say a more kind of a spiritual type of land type of world view anyway but one thing that i've realized that i was thinking about was even though i wouldn't necessarily subscribe to a god or a particular person one thing that i thought about was that during hard times during really tough times i've prayed you know surprise yourself i'm surprised i was thinking about this i i've prayed and i've prayed on many occasions you know do you think that even people that don't necessarily subscribe to a religion should pray i mean it's yeah it's better than you know it's definitely better than killing yourself or whatever or like you're taking you know taking a hit of some drug or whatever yeah i think so and that you might also be surprised at what happens if you take that seriously you know i was surprised to hear even sam harris say that he prays basically you know in a conversation with jordan peterson jordan jordan talked about you know like calling out and you know and speaking out into the world basically something and then seeing how it responds and he's like yeah i've done that and it works and like what did you just say that you pray that's hilarious but but but then the idea let's say of praying to god right in the in the monotheistic sense is that you are you're you're you're attending to the highest thing right that's the idea it's like we're trying to attend to the highest thing not not just these lower things because if you you can pray to all kinds of things and that will bring the fruit that it will bring like you can you can pray to the god of money and people do all the time and then they get money but then they get money but that's all they get and they don't necessarily find satisfaction in that money or they or the god of the god of sex and they pray and they pray for sex and they get sex and then they're like hey actually this is this is pretty shallow like at some point and so there's there's the idea that if you let's say the christian vision or the monotheistic vision is that you aim your prayer the highest you can so that the transformation of your being will go beyond these secondary things we'll go beyond just getting more of this or more of that or all the little gods what the little gods can offer you but rather this idea of this infinite love let's say that god is that's what we're aiming towards and obviously we're not gonna get there most of us but but the idea that at least if you're aiming towards you know infinite love the the being of infinite love then it's like that's a pretty good goal to aim towards right compared to all the other little gods you know it's like you get like you said you talk about a video game like you can really pray to the god of you know whatever game you're playing because you want to really succeed and you can have this you can focus and you can kind of send out your desire to become excellent at it and it'll work but you know i mean what is like it has very limited value let's say sure sure one thing if if we sort of head over to symbolism and your work over there which i really love the other day i read this book i should have it by you but you think it is this one by uranus the return of the prodigal son by henry nowin and and i loved reading this book it's called a story of home come in and one of the things that i was thinking about i read that book and it's clear that art music like music can like deeply like affect us right like even like a single note can make like the haze on your arms stand up yeah why do you think that like why is it that great art great literature great music can completely like just so deeply affect us like why is that yeah well it's because we're we're pattern pattern beings we are we are patterned and not only pattern but we are producing patterns like that's what we do that's what differentiates us from the animals right is that we we participate and we produce patterns we recognize them and we recognize them at many many levels and so one of the things that art does is it gives you a synthetic version of that right so it's like you can you can you can participate in the pattern of of a meeting right and it takes for several hours and it's and it's and it gets a little off and it's kind of crazy but if i can tell you a story then all the facts are neatly organized right they are they've been chosen and in a way that is that is really in the pattern and so then when you see that and you're you when you recognize that then it gives you it gives you this almost this little religious experience and music is the same because music is almost pure pattern right and so you listen to a bach fugue and then you listen to the to the let's say to the first statement and then all of a sudden you're like okay and then okay where's what's happening what's going on and then you feel a little bit lost and you're not sure where it's going then all of a sudden you see the pattern again kind of coming towards you and then the restatement comes and you're like oh my goodness like this is what this is what's happening right i'm exaggerating i mean some people might have that reaction to bach i have a smaller reaction but it's there it's like this little kind of recognition of the pattern which is returning then you can play with that like you can create longing by bringing you into a mode where the pattern isn't coming back and and you feel this longing and the suffering almost that it's not happening and you feel lost right but all these things are condensations of what makes us human you know and so so that is what i that's what i think that's why art because it's such a condensation of the pattern of being you know and that's what we strive for we're being we're we're meaning beings we look for meaning that's what that's what that's what gives us value i love that we will definitely come back to that i'm sure i was going back through a podcast which i did before and and on one episode i said that for me hell will be when the person that i could have been meets the person that i end up as and i kind of said a tongue-in-cheek but i would love to actually ask you what would hell actually be like yeah like what would it be like well i'm i'm from the orthodox tradition and there's a there's a particular view of hell which is quite it's not 100 but it's quite prevalent in the in the orthodox tradition and it's something like hell is it's similar to what you said but you could say it's something like it's the person i think i am right which faces god which faces the infinite the infinite good let's say and so you let's say you think you're this you're have a certain amount of good in you and you think you're pretty good and you think you've got it covered and you think or you think you've been pretty sly because you got away with this you got away with that and it's like you know i you know i'm pretty i'm a pretty shrewd person and then all of a sudden you face the infinite good and this this facing of the infinite good can cause two reactions in you right it can cause you to recognize what's wrong with you like it can cause you to recognize what's off about you all the things you've hidden all the thoughts you've had but you would never admit all the you know all the things you did in secret but that you thought no one noticed that you did this all of this stuff that you've done or that you thought or that you've engaged in all of a sudden it's like it's you face it to the infinite good and so either you can leave let those things go away and you can drop them or you hold on to them and you close off and so that's hell that's what hell is and so a good like a simple example of hell is you you do something extremely evil to someone like something malicious something really horrible and then that person answers you by forgiving you completely and just like opening up their arms and saying i forgive you i want i want to be in communion with you again and then you have two there's two reactions again you can have you can say you can you can melt down and you can accept this and you can you know you can see what you've done and you can enter into this communion or you can say screw you yeah right and it can make you even worse than what you were before because it shows you your yourself and you don't and you just clamp down like you grit your teeth you know saint paul talks about this as this idea of having calls shoveled on your head right and so that's what that's what hell is and so the idea like c.s lewis talks about how hell is locked from the inside right you hold the key to hell and it's and and when you're when you fall into those states you it's you that's holding yourself there because you don't want to give up the stuff that you hold on to right these bad habits this these these these thoughts these things you've hidden all these secrets that we keep all of this you don't want to let it go i don't know if that makes sense to you in terms of understanding what what what the how love can cause you to burn let's say that's a good way to understand it it's like hell is actually the infinite love of god facing someone who doesn't want it that's really interesting and i would love to kind of flip that and ask about heaven then is is heaven utopia or is it something different well heaven is a it's a comp that's a complicated concept and so you could say that heaven is the hierarchy of beings itself right it's the hierarchy of values that's what heaven is it's the invisible patterns which call us to the good right heaven is that which makes you recognize that it's a good apple and and i say like not even in a moral sense but there is also a moral sense which is that you recognize what is good okay those patterns that are actually you could say extensions of god we call them the logos the logos of the world the logi the different aspects of god which are upholding reality that's what heaven is and so and so the but the the human person is the idea that we go to heaven is a really distorted idea about what about how this works how all of this works the idea is that we're actually meant to embody heaven yes yes right so it's not the idea that we go to heaven although you could say that in a colloquial way but the idea is rather that we're meant to embody heaven that is we're we're meant to in manifest form you know manifest these higher things right so embody these higher values those are virtues right those are when you become virtuous you are going to heaven or you're ascending the mountain is a way to understand it you're actually ascending the mountain of being and then you come to a place where you meet god and you have an epiphany where all of a sudden the being you know the infinite of god manifests itself to you in that place where all the virtues come together all the hierarchies of beings kind of come together so that is right that is the spiritual transformation that we're called to engage in and so that would be what people colloquially talk about going to heaven but one of the problems like you said is that it's so it's become so vulgar that people think that it's like you die and you and you go to heaven and it's like it doesn't mean anything it's just it's just it it really it has sadly stopped to have meaning but if you read dante if you read anything that is before the and before the'th century then you'll get a good understanding of what that means like what this transformation is i i'm learning so much here i'm learning so much here one thing that i think that has confused me over the years that i would love to ask you about is god is would god kind of be like [music] an abstract set of values or would god be a person so it's okay so the way that christians understand it is that god is a is a is a communion of persons right okay so that's what the idea of the trinity is right and so the idea so the best way to understand that god is the infinite source of everything right that's the first thing to understand that's what god is and the second thing to understand is that anything you say about god is always wrong everything you say about god is always a compromise okay this is something that is completely orthodox like this is not it's not some new age stuff it's this is really what the church fathers taught is that god's god's being or god's essence or god's beyond being is not actually a being is beyond being is something that you can't talk about okay but nonetheless is the source of everything right the infinite source of everything which is beyond everything and so and it manifests it reveals itself to us as a communion of persons as this this communion of love between beings and they're not beings in the like i always say like if you think that when i say use the word being it's it's like the same thing as your car or as as a as an apple then then stop then god doesn't exist then i just i i'm totally fine and saying god doesn't exist if for you existing just means the things you can see and touch and quantify right but let's say god is beyond that level and so that is how god reveals this as a communion of love and and you could say that in christianity the infinite itself right and the expression of the infinite and the manner in which the the infinite expresses itself in the world is all part of of god you know and so that's what god is let's say to you because and knowing that even that is is a is a compromise in language and so so you can imagine that all of reality leads up to a point where it stops so think about think about any identity right and so it's like an apple right i can describe all the elements of the apple but no matter how many elements i describe at some point i have to stop and jump up and say apple right i have to jump up i have to emerge out of this quantity out of this multiplicity and jump up into a single identity okay and so that's it's like that for every being every being has that reality which is that its identity is above its multiplicity right it's it's higher than its multiplicity so now do that for everything so that everything so people like to say things like i pray to the universe right and it's like there's something dishonest about that because what how do you even how can you say that the universe is one like what is this unity of the universe like what are you talking about and so that's why even that has to jump up into something which is beyond just something which is completely beyond all ways of naming of manifesting anything that you can think of or or quantify and that and that is what that is what the divine is that is the the infinite source of everything right the ground of being you could say there are different ways of of trying to talk about this and then it and then for for christians especially it manifests itself as a communion of love and then that communion of love helps you understand how things exist in the world so it's like the fact that you can see that something is one and you could say you could go a sim even an apple you could say something like the apple exists through a communion of love and you'd say oh that's a stupid thing to say but think about it it's like the elements that make me recognize that something has being they're all multiple there are there's indefinite amount of them right a chair is even better like there are all these elements of the chair and then somehow they come together and they join a single purpose and then they exist as one and that's what love is because it doesn't also destroy the multiplicity right it doesn't doesn't stop the chair from being multiple things at the same time it's still legs and a back and it's all those things are still there but somehow they're able to kind of come together and become one and that's that's what that's how the world exists that's how everything exists basically i listened to your podcast with john peterson i think by this point i think i still got over a million views by this point it's got something crazy crazy it's crazy really really resonating with people one of the things in that conversation which jordan said was that he acts as if he believes that god exists or something to those to those to that extent which i may be getting messed up good what do you think about that as a as a kind of concept do you think that that's a reasonable concept well i think the way that i the way that i tried to phrase it with jordan is that because he's he takes it as a moral like as a moral imperative yes yes i act as if god exists and that's what holds me together morally but it also is this heavy weight that he carries that is almost unbearable for him and so the way that i was trying to help him understand is that this has more to do with the way things exist more than even just morality and so the first thing that acting as if god exists demands of you is not a moral code it's attention right because that's how the world exists the world exists you this capacity to attend and to recognize unity and recognize phenomena for what they are so if you attend to god then that looks like all the things people hate about religion it's worship right it's singing it's processing it's facing the same direction it's being in a group and all saying the same thing at the same time it's like that's what that's actually what acting as if god exists that's what it looks like because like i said the the most important aspect of god is how god becomes the source of how all things exist together so if we're going to act as if god exists we have to participate in how things exist together and we have to we have to participate in communion we have to commune together and exist as bodies and form form unit form communions of love and that's how we will act as if god exists and that if you do that like it won't even matter like honestly at that point will it even matter if you say that you act as if god exists like it becomes it all would almost become like a semantic thing yes because saying that god exists it's like i i've said it on several podcasts where i have no problem saying that god doesn't exist in the in the sense of exist as a as a phenomenon in the world like obviously god is not a phenomenon in the world god is a super existence it's beyond existence so even there it's like anyways [laughter] why do you think that jordan peterson has resonated so deeply with peters with people in this era in this generation i think that i think that the really the deepest part of that i think the really deepest part of that is that is that he actually cares and people can tell and i think that that really at the basis of what what's going on is that he he really does care about people and about the world if you you have to just see him talk to people like i have been a taxicab it's been hell it's hilarious i've been in a taxi cab with him where the guy didn't know who he was yet because he wasn't famous and the taxi cab just started telling him all his story like his whole story and i was like like who does this happen to and and it's like really deep conversation started right away and there was something about jordan his capacity to attend his capacity to show that he cares about what you're going through and empathize i think that that's at the core of everything and then he's also acting as a as a bastion of just normal things against an insane world because the things he says they're like the things your grandfather like or your great grandfather would have told you right it's like you know clean your act up do you know make up your room you know get a job marry someone found a family it's like just basic stuff that everybody should think of but our world is so insane that we don't even recognize the value of that and so i think that that's really what that's what that's let's say the second reason i would say why people have have been so attracted to him i love that and it's so so good to have the great man back it's been we missed him we missed it yes yeah well i'm happy that he's back too i hope i hope his health will hold up and i think that's the biggest that's the biggest hope absolutely man there's there's a couple of quickfire ones which if you've still got the time i'd love to go for it i think that one area which i've been really interested in is ai so one thing which i'm kind of worried about is giving machines the power of let's say gods that just to be hyperbole like let's say we give machines a power of gods without the wisdom of gods what do you think about this sort of emergence of ai and do you have any worries about it going into the future i have many worries about going to the future i think i think we are going to we are going to witness things that we haven't seen in thousands of years and this is what i think we're going to witness we're going to witness some pretty crazy phenomena and it's going to look it's going to get wild because so let me give you let me give you an just a little image of how so in in it's like in an ancient world what they would do is they would build a temple and then they would make a statue of a god right and then they would like dress it up and then they would open its nostrils and the idea would be that they would like breathe in the spirit of the god into the into the the statue and then the statue would become the center of the civilization and civilization would kind of turn around that statue and so this is what we're doing like we're building a body for a god and and everybody almost weirdly almost recognizes that's what we're doing even if they don't have the words for it but we can see it appear in fiction we can see the story kind of emerge in fiction whether it's like marvel's vision for example is a good example of that where you have an ai that is more virtuous than everybody else you have different versions of this that are kind of popping up in culture of this idea of an artificial being who is actually your superior right and so this is it like you're this is a it's a very so it's a very scary time it's a very scary time because this infinite powered machine like you said people will just inevitably start to reverence it it's already happening we already reverence it because we view reality through it right we the first the first page of google searches defines reality right your facebook feed your twitter feed defines reality already and so it's already acting like a like a body for an intelligence and and so there's a there's an interesting like there's an interesting story that i've been thinking about i did a video on it recently in the revelation the book of revelation there's a there's this image of a beast of a dragon right this this like this dragon that that that is that it doesn't makes a revolution in heaven and casts all the stars to the ground like all these casts all the angels to the ground and then through a different process there is someone who makes an image of this beast through different proxies and then it makes the the the beast speak and when the beast speaks and everybody worships the beast but it's the if there's someone making it speak let's say so this is the danger of ai is that it's never going to really necessarily be general intelligence or even if it is or not we won't know you can't verify someone's general intelligence like i can't verify your consciousness there's no way to do that and so we'll never be able to verify the consciousness of the machines but with if we act as if they're conscious that's enough and then there if there's a puppet master behind then people will just fall in line and that's what's happening now the fact that google and these companies are being taken over by woke ideologies so they're being taken over by work ideologies they're framing our vision of reality and they're telling us that they're objective they're doing all those three at the same time so that's a scary moment like that's a scary that's a scary reality that there really is this problem of like this idol that is being propped up and that everybody is looking to and everybody's worshiping and they don't realize that there's a puppet master behind that is actually defining the miracles that say that is actually directing the miracles to what it to what it wants so i don't i don't have a lot of hope in that in that direction especially with what we're seeing now and you know because because donald trump seems to have let's say unleashed something which was already there but it wasn't pointed yet and now it it's like as if he he showed us what was happening right donald trump by his kind of bombis way of being or whatever exposed what was already happening but it and accelerated it and it's basically what jordan peterson dealt with like what happened to jordan peterson in 2016 is what's happening to all of us in 2020 in 2021 it's just happening it just jumped a level so what was happening in the universities and what jordan was speaking out against has now jumped to national levels and and government levels and so it is the emergence of a god like i'm sorry it's and it's and the fact that it's coupled with ai is yeah be scared for your children is all i can say you know yes yes i don't have children at the moment i think thank god i haven't been praying to the sex god so i haven't gone so i would love to to kind of finish this sort of segment and one thing which i would love to give thoughts on that's been a real kind of emergence in recent times perhaps they've been around for for a long time i'm not too sure but psychedelics they've sort of come to the fall what are your thoughts on psychedelics well i've never i've never done psychedelics and so i don't i don't have a first-person experience of them i'm a little worried about psychedelics i'll be honest with you like i've had because of some people that are coming to me let's say to my videos into my world are coming from jordan peterson who is who is a proponent of psychedelics to a certain extent not maybe not like a just all-out proponent but he's definitely talking about it and i've seen some people like lose it to be honest like i've seen i've seen i was in contact with one person who who while he was in discussion with me and was were involved in the discussion went to to to to do ayahuasca and some weird new age thing in south america and a few months later when covet hit and last time i talked to him he was like he had been been home in three days he was in a panic he was like freaking out and and i haven't heard from him since and so i think that i think that if psychedelics has value i think that in a world of scientists that that don't understand the world of values it's like the worst thing ever because it's it's like if if it opens up this world to you and but you have no mechanism of discerning what is above and what is below like you can't tell the difference between an angel and a demon but all of a sudden you're like this scientific type person who's thrust in a world of angels and demons i don't see that really as being a good thing like i feel like people will be unable to discern what they encounter because they've lost the wisdom that that maybe i don't know and because i don't know enough about psychedelics but maybe in a world that has wisdom and has a teaching about hierarchies of of beings and hierarchies of values and the capacity to differentiate you just differentiate light from dark let's say that it might have not have been as dangerous as it is for us now and there's a reason why psychedelics are part of the reason why we're here right psychedelics in the 60s are part of the reason why everything's breaking down right now and and this this kind of psychedelic revolution where people had these experiences and had no means of understanding what was happening and then then started to destroy the hierarchies in the world just started to like attack any form of structure any form of of societal norm all of this was all bad because you know freedom man and whatever all the hippies were were experimenting and so it's like i'm not sure that all of a sudden bringing them back now is not gonna do something similar like i don't i it's just gonna cause it it's just gonna accelerate the the chaos to me it seems at least it's definitely going to open up pandora's box you know i would i would love to kind of tie everything off that we've spoken about today you know it seems like we are in a very precarious position societally globally how do we heal a broken society what can the individual do this is where i agree with jordan peterson like this is where i really agree with him and his his solution is to become a saint like and this has been the traditional christian solution is to to work on yourself first right to transform yourself transform your what you can touch like what's immediate around you and you know become a better person become a better father become a better mother become a better husband become a better whatever it is that you are right whatever it is that you're doing better friend all of these all of these things and then that will will start to reverberate around you you know and so that's in what we need to do but i think also reacquainting ourselves with the ancient stories and trying to see them through a lens which makes sense for us today you know understanding where we come from what are like how we are here having more on a better understanding of history which is something seems the modern world wants to erase from us having a better sense of history a better sense of of our stories and how we participated them is definitely definitely a way to to go i love it man i love it my last question for you today we sign off all our podcasts with before i ask you to sign off and tell our audience within connect with you my last question for you today what makes a life worth living this is gonna it's not gonna sound inspirational but i think i think that a life a life worth living sorry but what makes a life worth living is a is understanding the proper hierarchy of values which lead up to the highest it's like understanding where things are and then seeing all goods at the level that they are and so one of the things that makes us miserable is that we we try to put too much good in things that are relative goods right and so eating having a nice meal is a good thing but but we someone who puts all their their life in there is going to be disappointed and there's a hierarchy of that it's like having it being in a relationship with with your spouse is a good thing but even that is a relative good and then ultimately moving towards the higher and higher goods i think that that's what that's what makes a life worth living because it gives you like a track and a path and you can actually see your progress right it's like oh when someone used to say that before i get really pissed off and i'd like lose it and now it's like oh i can oh i can kind of hold myself in and i can i can you know i can stay calm and it's like oh wow that's awesome and then you and then you just keep going like that and you know move towards something beyond yourself you know man i am i've been a huge fan for a while i feel like i've learned so so much today please excuse my ignorance on a number of the topics but i really really do appreciate you coming on i feel like you were a force of good a force of good so man thank you so much for coming on the show yeah thanks i really enjoyed this and i appreciate your your capacity to like really great questions or insightful questions in the sense that i can tell that you thought about what you were going to ask before you asked it so i really appreciate that it makes you a good conversation
