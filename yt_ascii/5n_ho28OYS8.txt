ladies and gentlemen in this video i'm going to be sharing with you a very fun story that a subscriber sent to me one of my subscribers rated around 600 played somebody on chess.com and that person got banned for cheating and what i'm gonna do is i'm going to show you what happens when a 600 elo player doesn't cheat and then what happens when they cheat and oh my god it's hilarious and the last game of the video today is so brutal so stick around until then but first let me go grab that trophy folks i want to say thank you i just got back from california i first went to the youtube headquarters thank you so much youtube for having me it was incredible like 200 300 people from google from youtube came out i played multiple games at the same time i met a lot of great executives i'm gonna put out a little bit of content for that stuff let me just have a moment minute or two of your time and then we'll get into the video i won this i won the best chess streamer award for 2022 and i want to say thank you i want to say thank you to all of you because that's who voted it was you that subscriber number those view counts that's all you all right and you're more than a number some of you have gotten into chess in the last month or two some of you have gotten into it in the last couple of years maybe i got you back into chess maybe you're 40 50 60 years old whatever it might be you played it in your childhood but it was not interesting and now it is chess is ageless it's one of the most incredible things about being a chess creator is i'm not making content for age 12 to' i'm not making content for adults looking to do something with their retirement account and making content for anybody from ages 3 to 99 all right and if you're two or you're 105 you can still play chess so i am really grateful thank you so much for helping me win this award and i got no plans of going anywhere i still want to be the internet's chess teacher i'm working on a book i got the merch for the gotham knights by the way i don't know if you saw it but that's the pro chess league merch for our team you can support it there's a link in the description anyway that's all i wanted to say i it's only been two minutes in this video if you're still watching and you didn't click off because you know i just want to say thank you all right and let's put it back and let's have it in the background for this video in all future videos so there it is and it's beautiful and i got scanned at airport security because they thought it was a bomb or something i don't know also very much really i truly mean it from the bottom of my heart and i got no plans i'm going anywhere i have massive ideas for chess content in 2023 and beyond i'll let you know when my book is out for pre-order and let's just keep on rolling all right so we're gonna kick things off what happens when a 600 elo player plays like a 600 elo player i want to preface this by saying i'm not making fun of this person for being 600. i'm making fun of this person for being a lying cheating scumbag 600 okay if you cheat i will make fun of you when you blunder that's just how it works so this is how they played in the early stages of their career alright our cheater had the white pieces and late night h3 all right not very good opening principles you know what i mean this is not really what you're supposed to do in the beginning of the game then our cheater played f3 both sides copying each other by the way little knight f2 action you know a little exotic obviously you're supposed to be putting the knight on that square you're not supposed to be blocking in your own light squared bishop but there's 600 which is what 600s do when they play games that have an accuracy of i think this game was like 30 something accuracy all right so yeah we're gonna in the meantime though we're gonna you know take a look at at this all right f5 so black plays f6 and a couple moves later plays f5 our cheater captures on f5 bishop takes up five and what was the accuracy of this game it was 46 terrific wonderful 46 g4 all right well that's not okay i mean that's not a good move because you're again it's like a snowball of errors right i mean white has made many many mistakes already white needs to find some safety for the king finish developing you were just there instant replay instant replay now you're going back and you know black plays knight f6 blunders upon normal black plays h5 and now white captures and plays queen d2 and the blunders begin all right the blender is very quick black plays bishop e7 and knight d4 knight d4 attacks the pawn on f3 there's a couple of ways of defending the pawn obviously but it's all gonna be very difficult but instead of defending the pawn our protagonist antagonist anti-hero plays the move rook g1 rook g1 not only fully enables the move knight f3 it also guarantees that it's a triple fork so oh oh you you wanna you wanna do that yeah no problem oh you're gonna steal my car oh well take this playstation 5 with it take this nvidia graphics card with it too you know limited edition go sell that for like six thousand dollars somewhere see yeah you want the no problem okay i'll give you everything you can have everything you want you want to rob my house no rub my house no problem here's right so all right yeah knight f3 queen g2 now folks i have a question for you is it better to capture let's do a little math all right knight takes rook or knight takes bishop what's the better move let me just say knight takes rook no it's not it's okay to take the rook but then you're gonna lose the knight right is it better to take the bishop does it not matter in this case it's still better to take the bishop because you're you know you're never gonna lose this material i mean you're you're not gonna lose the same amount but actually in this case it doesn't even make a huge difference because the bishop is attacking the rook so our cheater here is just getting brutalized i mean peace is being captured left and right does not notice free nights themselves just rook g7 total pandemonium of a game you know typical 600 level stuff bishop f6 black is now completely lost because white has rook takes and knight f6 check and a knight c7 and then rook d7 ends plus it's a plus a million white is completely winning but then hangs a rook hangs a rook and then loses the queen and has no pieces left and not only that look at the time it's 50 seconds for white white is just losing the material oh my goodness c4 oh king c5 and and in this position white lost on time but of course white was already very much struggling white was basically lost in the same game but also was down four minutes all right i mean typical stuff right another game that are that are that our humble cheater played this time with the black pieces normal you know king's pawn type f6 i mean the knight is supposed to go there that's not supposed to be a pawn the king is all right g6 and just you know what what happens when two six hundreds play chess right it's chaos i mean it's complete nonsense right i mean bishop takes g8 just this is not even 600 level chess this this is like three 400 level chess these this guy's making a lot of mistakes look at that queen e4 counter attack now the queen goes down to g2 and it's mate mate into blundered on the 12th move by our cheater who is not yet cheating and some of you don't listen to me sometimes you sometimes i see the comments like timestamp 702 what how is he cheating if he's losing in 12 moves well i told you i was going to show you two games where he cheat didn't cheat and then right like listen to me don't just sit there and and ask things in the comments you can always go back anyway of course white doesn't see that these are 600s why are you sacrificing the bishop okay queen takes knight check rook g6 rook g8 looks like a checkmate but it's miracle of god it's not czech and now the black king starts running out oh my goodness just total chaos rook a seven bishop c5 i mean just just up and down up and down the entire game total panama rugby one haymaker queen b1 and in this position black black flagged like just just two minutes just lost on time even though it says 214 i mean the game ended like i don't know i guess they were really confused why they spent 30 moves of the game but didn't move a single bishop i think these games were chaotic very chaotic and this game accuracy was was 41. but then everything changed when the fire nation attacked yeah then then then then this game was a 93 accuracy 93 if you play a game that's 93 accurate you're not gonna get banned unless you do it like 30 times so let's watch alright e4 e5 wow so black is no longer moving the pawn to f6 they've suddenly improved the opening and they know theory the best way to punish the bishop's opening where white has not yet developed tonight is to play c6 not putting the knight there and oh dang okay all right well notice how in this position pawn takes e4 is a good move right well black is trying not to get caught so they're gonna play the second move of the engine which is bishop g4 so people think they're slick they're like i'm not gonna play all the best moves now what that move does is it either gets white to pin themselves or play this and weaken the king it's exactly what the guy did and then he went back to e6 so black created a weakness in the white position and took away a natural developing score for the night now white plays g4 and it looks like in this position it's going to be really difficult to break through the white position right and why it is playing poorly but really only poorly if the players are good and you know they know how to exploit the position and here black plays the best move what is the best move of course what like if i gave this position to a beginner what would they say pawn takes or maybe castles right a5 correctly and a well-timed moment taking advantage of the poor white structure and the weaknesses behind the structure we have bishop b3 and now you know of course a what's the natural follow-up to the move a5 right what's what what is the best follow-up it's obviously to take the pawn right that's why we played a5 nope knight g4 wait what you you just played a five what about this move well the idea is that if takes now black gets a devastating attack between h4 bishop g4 queen in bishop in pawn takes opening the position position completely winning for black knight g4 white blunders white plays queen d2 and now if you just took this with the idea of playing queen h4 knight f2 what would you play in this position some of you would play this some of you would play this defend it some of you would play this right some of you would give a check you know what art you know what the cheater played are you kidding me these people don't even realize it's like they're playing the piano with two hands at the same time but they've never played the piano before and they're playing perfectly what what kind of adderall are you on a5 knight g4 leaving the knight there to die and just a4 now you give the check and now folks unfortunately the execution is swift and very much painful check take the knight and now of course you know the queen has to maintain pinning the pawn to the roof so you gotta take with the bishop right no you take with the bishop folks it's only -20 and made a nine if you take with the queen it's made in five four now yeah of course which the shooter saw that makes sense that makes a lot of sense that makes a lot of sense yup check and now bishop h3 threatening queen f1 queen f2 in the future queen g2 bishop f2 and if you take this i go here and white resign because queen g3 and if you will notice folks all of the last moves were made between about 6 and 10 seconds so eight seconds on a5 10 seconds on knight g4 10 seconds on a4 7 seconds on queen h4 15 seconds on bishop f2 maybe white you know maybe you get those as well nine seconds on this move seven seconds on that move eight seconds on that move six seconds on that move and 10 seconds how long did it take oh they didn't even play this i would be very curious to see how long it would take black to find this move so very consistent time usage 93 zero inaccuracies complete obliteration of you know of a player who probably in the last game would have beat this person but you haven't seen nothing yet if you made it 12 minutes into this thing yeah buckle up e4 this is the most disgusting thing i've seen in quite some time i told you in the intro to stick around until the end that's not because i wanted to increase my watch times in there and therefore get more ad revenue although absolutely make no mistake i have full incentive to do that but i can do that regardless i would like to think that my content is engaging and entertaining enough and makes chess fun for you and that is why you would watch this far in the video as well some people will go on reddit chess and complain that i talk about watch time in my videos but you know a very wise person once told me if you're not offending people in your growth as a creator then you're doing something wrong if you're not making people upset making people criticize you and the person that told me that was aristotle so yeah g6 aristotle knew a thing or two about the youtube algorithm h6 okay i mean look this is what 600s play because they don't watch my content they play this uga stuff bishop d3 you guys like the merge by the way it's really nice i think anyway of course of course and and white is already much better why is white already much better because black did not put any center pawns in the center that as they're called they should be in the center of the board if they're not going to be in the center of the board then you need to play moves that will prevent your opponent from taking the center of the word because if you don't play moves that are going to prevent your opponent putting their pawns in the center of the board then your opponent is going to play moves that put their pawns in the center of the board and what i mean by that is e5 and then c4 and you're gonna get overwhelmed because if your opponent gets to just completely occupy the center you're much worse and while our cheater at this point rated 670 might not know that the stockfish or whatever other engine they are using that is probably five times higher than that rating does know that and so in this position white finds it so imperative to move away you know the best move in this position you know how many people in this position we just played this or castle because they would go that's defended yeah well the engine plays this because it correctly evaluates that the knight is now kind of stuck can't take the bishop and it's just you know this is on the way now the best move in this position for a beginner like if i gave a beginner this position probably castle right okay white plays queen a4 their own moves too you know but again 10 seconds look look every move right so let's see nine seconds that one was five seconds seven seconds eight seconds that was four seconds impressive six seconds every move like it's like a little time interval so queen a4 and yeah i mean of course the person with black is not playing great but a 600 cannot really show you why another 600 is not playing great all right sometimes it's very chaotic and as we see the engine is already beginning to march down the black position black cannot capture like this because of the pin and if black capture is like this well unfortunately the black king is gonna have to go for a walk of shame and white plays the top engine move which is knight f4 black plays knight c6 and i and and white here is balancing between playing the top engine move and not playing the top engine move so that move is played in seven seconds which fits our interval black plays knight d5 that's simply a blunder of a of a knight now how many of you in this position would play pawn takes knight because of course right any human being here plays pawn takes knight it's a free night it's not the best move pawn takes knight is only plus nine whereas if you play knight takes knight it's plus 10. which the cheater doesn't know anything about chess other than reading numbers and the idea is that after pawn takes pawn takes now the king loses an escape square that's actually what's important and after knight e5 it is now getting to that territory of force checkmate and this game ends in an absolutely heinous and brutal display of disregard for human life and capabilities as white plays queen h4 i mean how many people here would see the bishop hanging and move the bishop the pendulum maneuver by a 600 moving the queen on a transatlantic flight from los angeles to jfk i just was on one queen h4 check completely disregarding the bishop queen takes queen now a 600 here would still find a way to lose you want to see a way to lose this game how about this castles and now the queen is trapped and i got news for you it's still game on all right i mean like we still got to play and this is winning for white but not at the 600 level yeah well white proceeds to spend seven seconds it's like the magic number seven seconds queen f6 which is a triple fork really only the knight is under attack now queen takes g6 is plus 21 plus 21 but knight c3 check is made in four which of course the cheater is going to play in how many seconds six seconds amazing now black plays king c5 and the game ends in ridiculous fashion the fastest checkmate in this position the one and only check made in three there's made in four five six i got news for you it has very little to do with the queen the queen will not be delivering the final mate you know who will be delivering the final mate watch i told you this game was worth watching here you go bishop e3 check played in six seconds to c4 the only way to win in two it's made in two the only way to win mate and two in this position is to play the absolutely spectacular and disgusting queen f7 check seven seconds again by the way king to d3 long castles mate checkmate by castle and queen side because the black king was trying to go to c2 but this move takes away the remaining escape square and every square is completely covered and white wins by long castle's mate that was the only mate that could have occurred from this position in three moves and our 600 by spending six seconds seven seconds and 10 seconds found it completely completely on their own yeah they were bent they were bad they played one more game but it wasn't as ridiculous as this one anyway what a game don't cheat you look really stupid doing it because you do not realize yourselves how you go from this f3 [music] to long castle's mate anyway i thank you all very much once again if you did make it this far it's incredible you know three four years ago i was just a chess teacher in new york city i wasn't just a chess teacher i had a career that i think folks could only dream about i was working my own hours i was still getting paid well teaching chess in new york you can make a good salary but i had no online presence no online content and a couple of years later three years later to be visiting the headquarters of youtube to be meeting and shaking hands with the ceo of youtube to have two 300 people show up to watch me play and make some jokes and take some selfies with me and going to the streamer awards is is a ridiculous experience for a chess teacher from anywhere but a chess teacher who was just teaching classrooms of rowdy seven and eight year olds in after school programs so now i am your chess teacher i am the internet's chess teacher and chess is an incredible ageless game that i have no plans of dropping in the near future i will be here and i will be making videos like this for you but i will also be putting on and conceptualizing some very very cool chess events that i look forward to sharing with you this year next year and beyond so appreciate it very much and you know the drill already get out of here
