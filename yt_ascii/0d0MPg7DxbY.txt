hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about synthetic fuels and so synthetic fuels are currently being talked about as potentially the savior for combustion engines keeping internal combustion engines alive so can synthetic fuels do that and the science is actually pretty promising and i think there are applications where synthetic fuels make sense however there is a pretty big problem when it comes to passenger cars so i'm quite skeptical that we'll see large-scale adoption of synthetic fuels as it relates to the use in passenger cars and so i'm going to explain why in this video so let's start off with the basics what is a synthetic fuel so a synthetic fuel is a fuel that is created rather than pulling from an existing fuel source like crude oil beneath the earth's surface so in the example of crude oil what you're doing is you're taking hydrocarbons which are deep beneath your surface and you're taking those hydrocarbons and then eventually you're putting them into the atmosphere and into the ocean so when you burn gasoline gasoline being comprised of hydrocarbons one example being octane c8h18 well as you burn that octane you combine it with oxygen and then you emit co2 and h2o so carbon dioxide and water and so you're adding that carbon you're taking that carbon from beneath the earth's surface and then you're putting it above onto you know into the atmosphere and into the oceans so there's a problem there with adding that carbon to the atmosphere and acidifying the ocean and so instead of doing that synthetic fuels say well why don't we make a carbon neutral fuel and so how do you make a carbon neutral fuel well you take the co2 that already exists in the atmosphere you take some hydrogen that already exists above the earth's surface and you combine that in order to make hydrocarbons in order to make that see whatever h whatever certain amount of carbons certain amount of hydrogens so you combine those two and then since you're pulling carbon from above the earth's surface you're not changing that amount of carbon that total carbon in the atmosphere right because you're just taking from it and then putting it back through combustion so it's carbon neutral that's a good thing the other problem is eventually you know you're going to run out of crude oil so for two reasons you really have to at some point find a different energy source for transportation all right so you might say why bother with synthetic fuel why not just use renewable energy for everything well there's a couple challenges so for example solar it's not always daytime right so you can't always get solar energy at night you can't get it wind power well it's not always windy right so there are times when solar or wind may not be able to actually generate any energy so the challenge there is you need somewhere to store the energy while you are creating it so if during the day you create plenty of energy great as long as you have somewhere to store it it's not a problem so you need energy storage for for mass power use and then you also need energy storage at the vehicle level now there are many different ways that you can store energy you can put it in a battery you can put it in water and store in a water tower you know you've got that potential energy you can store it as hydrogen you can store it in a synthetic fuel so why would you want to store energy as a synthetic fuel well when you start to look at energy density it starts to make sense why so let's just start off with regular gasoline e10 meaning 10 ethanol which is what we use here in the united states so gasoline in the united states has an energy density of about 12 kilowatt hours per kilogram this will start to make sense as we fill out this chart as far as by volume about nine kilowatt hours per liter a synthetic fuel you know there's different kinds of synthetic fuels that you can make generally speaking they're not going to be quite as energy dense as gasoline but you could make it that way if you wanted but something along the lines of about 4 to 10 kilowatt hours per kilogram by mass and then you know about 4 to 9 kilowatt hours per liter and then hydrogen looking at hydrogen it has an energy density of 33 kilowatt hours per kilogram meaning tons of energy by weight unfortunately by volume just two kilowatt hours per liter meaning your tank has to be really big for hydrogen vehicles whereas it doesn't have to be that big for gasoline or synthetic fuel vehicle in order for it to travel a long distance and then lithium-ion batteries electric cars here's where it really starts to make sense why we're discussing this just .25 kilowatt hours per kilogram so really poor energy density in a lithium-ion battery now they're very efficient so we'll get into that later on but really poor energy density by mass and then by volume about 0.7 kilowatt hours per liter now all of these are an ish and this is certainly improving with time right here the lithium ion batteries are getting better on battery storage is getting better but as you can see there's a really big difference so for vehicles you know like passenger cars hydrogen and lithium ion can make sense you don't need all that much energy in order for these to go a good distance unfortunately for things like shipping massive boats for aviation planes things like that that need a lot of fuel and can't like a plane can't weigh all that much right so you're going to want to use things like a gasoline or synthetic fuel so that's an application where it might make good sense to be carbon neutral and still have really good energy density okay so synthetic fuels so far are sounding pretty good so now let's start to get to the process of how that energy starts out and eventually makes its way to the wheels whether that's a battery electric vehicle a fuel cell electric vehicle meaning hydrogen or an internal combustion engine so in order to start this off for synthetic fuel it must be a renewable source if you're making it from a non-renewable source this is an entirely pointless exercise the only reason a synthetic fuel makes sense is if that energy comes from a renewable source so let's just say wind energy in this example now it's worth pointing out that that's not necessarily true for electric cars electric cars can still be greener than combustion cars even if they do come from fossil fuels or the majority of that energy comes from fossil fuels so a distinction worth pointing out but let's start off with our battery electric vehicles the energy we're saying comes from a renewable resource so here we've got a little wind tower then you have to transmit that energy eventually you're charging the battery of your electric car and then the battery is sending that power to its motor in order to move the vehicle so there's an efficiency associated with this process now if we're going to a fuel cell electric vehicle where we're going to transmit that energy in order to perform some electrolysis we're going to use electrolysis to create hydrogen we're going to transport that hydrogen move it into the tank of a vehicle the hydrogen tank of your motor vehicle from the hydrogen tank it goes to a fuel cell which converts it to electricity and that electricity powers an electric motor which moves the vehicle and then for a combustion vehicle in this synthetic example you take that energy from your windmill you transmit it you create hydrogen using electrolysis then you add to that carbon capture technology so you're capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and you're getting that carbon to use for your power to liquid process so here you're combining that hydrogen in that carbon and you're creating a liquid fuel complicated process we're summarizing here in just one step to get through this and then we're transporting that synthetic fuel we're putting it in a fuel tank and then that fuel tank is going to power a combustion engine which will power your wheels now as i mentioned previously there's an efficiency to all of these steps right and so as you can see an electric car there's not many steps between creating that energy and putting it to the wheels hydrogen there's a few more steps and then with combustion engines there's even more steps than hydrogen so each time you do this your efficiency drops so what does it make the most sense to do the shortest path possible which is why electric cars make so much sense today okay so the big question is how much energy makes it to the wheels so if we start off with our energy production and we have 100 of our energy what percentage of that energy remains once we get to the wheels with these different options so i found a study published in the journal of society of automotive engineers in 2020 analyzing this question and the results that they came up with for battery electric vehicles the amount of energy that's going to make it to the wheels about 40 to 70 percent for a fuel cell electric vehicle hydrogen-powered vehicle that number is about 23 to 33 so as you can see not very good in comparison to an electric car this is a big reason why electric cars are more popular than hydrogen vehicles and then for power to liquid so using that synthetic fuel creating a synthetic fuel and then powering a combustion engine and then getting that combustion engine to move along how much of that energy makes it to the wheels about 6 to' this is really really really bad this is a big problem right here i found another study which said for diesel this number is about 7.7 if you're making synthetic diesel fuel the percentage of energy that actually makes it to the wheels just 7.7 so if we look at the best internal combustion engine at' versus the worst electric vehicle we still need over two times the energy in order to you know move that combustion vehicle that same distance if we're looking at internal combustion engines versus electric cars the potential is as high as 10 times the amount of energy required right this is insane so best case you need two times as much energy to travel the same distance you know it could be as high as 10 times so an electric car can travel so much further on the same amount of energy and that's the big problem here with synthetic fuels if we look at this diesel example from this other study that number's about seven times seven times the energy required versus a an electric car so so what are the implications of this well first of all hydrogen actually makes sense as a long-term energy storage source so one of the things that i found very interesting about this study that was looking at these percentages it actually makes more sense to take that energy convert it into hydrogen take that hydrogen and use a fuel cell to then transport electricity to a battery to an electric car rather than using that hydrogen and then turning it into a synthetic fuel and then putting it in a combustion engine it's actually more efficient to go all the way back to the start with this hydrogen and then go to a battery car than to take that hydrogen combine it with co2 and use it for a combustion car that is crazy so as a energy storage solution hydrogen actually looks pretty smart now for certain applications like shipping aviation yeah synthetic fuels make sense because they have the energy density the problem is they're just going to be very expensive so it's very expensive to do hence why it isn't really done today so let's look at an example to better understand the cost difference so we're going to compare an electric car versus this diesel vehicle synthetic diesel and so looking at the cost for one year of running an electric car let's say we drive 15 000 miles a year per battery we get 300 miles so we divide that we multiply that by the size of our battery divided by our charging efficiency we're going to use 83 percent multiply that by the cost of electricity we're going to say 15 cents per kilowatt hour so that gives us the cost for driving that ev per year 15 000 miles is going to cost us 675 dollars now we need about seven times the energy for a diesel so if we multiply that number by seven well the cost is then four thousand seven hundred twenty-five dollars per year so that's very expensive to run a vehicle like that and then when you look at you know let's look at the lifetime let's say you have the vehicle for 10 years 6 750 over 10 years in electricity versus 000 in diesel fuel you know that's the price of the electric car right there so you know it's basically like the car was free in this case if you're going electric versus diesel the fuel is just way way way too expensive and so if you kind of calculate this out and you're looking at you know what is the price per gallon in this example of diesel fuel well it's about 10 dollars per gallon which is quite expensive and so that's going to be you know the prohibitive thing of why people aren't going to be using synthetic fuels and why it's not going to be mass adopted another example i was kind of doing a sanity check to say you know how realistic is this 10 per gallon well porsche is one of the players in the synthetic fuel game and in an interview with hagerty porsche's ceo said their current cost of synthetic fuel was over ten dollars per liter in other words about 38 dollars per gallon that is insane so the cost is just absolutely absurd and i know someone's going to come and i know someone's going to say jason you know what if it means i can keep driving my combustion car i don't mind spending 40 a gallon here's the thing that's like saying i don't mind driving a lamborghini to get places it's like that's great but that's not realistic for everyone so the cost of synthetic fuels is just so bonkers that for passenger cars the energy requirement is so much more than electric cars that i don't see it making economic sense porsche says they'd like to get that cost down to you know about two dollars per liter but that's still in this ten dollar per gallon price range right and so it's just very very expensive that's the challenge here the efficiency isn't there the cost isn't there if you're making electricity it costs something to make electricity right you want it the shortest path the easiest path to use that energy and that's what electric cars offer so from a environmental standpoint yes it makes sense to do for like shipping and aviation it's just very expensive for those industries if they were to do it from a passenger car standpoint i think it's going to be a bit cost prohibitive for mass adoption so thank you all so much for watching and if you have any questions
