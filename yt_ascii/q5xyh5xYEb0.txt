so around june of 2021 i had just started learning the code myself i happened to be working for this company called deloitte as a consulting intern and during this internship i found out that the company actually hires a lot of programmers themselves which was interesting to me because this was the role that i was actually interested in long term so that is why during this internship i actually managed to get on a call with a really experienced web developer and this ended up being one of the most useful calls that i have ever been in on my life because he basically gave me just an exact road map to follow that in his opinion was the absolute fastest way for me to learn the code and get tired so i thought that in this video i want to share to you exactly what this path was so hopefully this video can be for you exactly like what that call was for me like this revelation moment that made me realize that i can do this other people have done this and i'll even reveal to you the one massive mistake that he told me that beginner programmers that speak to him make all the time and that to be honest i fully agree with him is the one mistake that stops most people from ever learning the code and getting hired what was interesting to me about this call is that what he recommended essentially was to focus specifically on front-end development and i'll talk in a moment about exactly why that was but the one thing about this path that was difficult for me was that i didn't have one specific resource to follow just follow these exact steps so that is why to make this even easier for you i have partnered up with coursera for this video to talk about the meta front-end developer professional certificate which is essentially the closest thing that i have found to essentially be a one resource for you to simply go through all of these steps master front-end development and even get hired at the end of it installed my meta stuff you get a certificate at the end of it and the instruction is really excellent and it teaches you everything that you need to know to master front-end development and get hired as fast as possible so you can either just take these steps and follow them on your own which is fine or you can simply go and take this professional certificate and just have everything laid out to you in one place but before we go into step one why exactly is front-end development the one thing that that developer recommended to you and that i recommend for a lot of people again like depending on your goals but basically if you know where the web has the front end and it has the back end the back end you have a lot of server-side code so things like authentication like storing stuff on a database and all this like complicated sort of behind the scenes kind of logic that is the back end and then we have the front end which basically everything that you see on our website how it looks how it's organized when you click buttons and what happened and the reason why i and this experienced developers on this book recommend front end specifically is that because for self-taught developers like myself and i'm assuming you to get hired you really kind of have to have portfolio projects on your resume and it's really difficult to have projects that only have a back end but no front end but it's really easy to have a lot of projects that only have a front end like just basically a website but no back-end like you don't need complicated back-end logic necessarily so the easiest way to get started with building a lot of projects is just to master the front end and focus on that first and if you take the meta front-end professionals they get the introduction section will go into a lot more detail on all of these what a day in the life of a front-end versus a back-end developer looks like all these details for you to really have a foundation on the web and this actually brings us to a step one of mastering frontal development what this guy told me is that before you do anything you just want to understand at a high level how the web works what is the front and what is the back end how do they communicate with each other how can you hook them up with each other you wouldn't want to have a high level understanding of all of these details before you move forward and that will be step only take the professional certificate again they will go through all of this in the instruction section and after you've done that you want to stop actually coding right so where do we start well actually the entire web uses these things called frameworks these are super super important but like for now we'll just put a pin on that and in a little bit i'll come back to frameworks and why we're sort of postponing learning them at the beginning you just want to learn html cs is in javascript html basically deals without a website is constructed css deals with how the website looks and then we have a javascript which is a programming language that you can use to make the website a bit more dynamic when you think about having like pop-ups on a website think about what happens when you click a button like adding different sections to the website dynamically and programmatically this is what you do with javascript and inside of the meta front-end developer professional certificate one of the first courses you do will give you exactly that and you wanna just focus on this in the beginning once you've done that you want to actually ignore html and css for a little bit and just get a really good grip on a javascript specifically why java scriptures for basically the entire front end of the web is built using javascript so if you're learning from a development your choice is kind of easy you just don't really have a choice at all you have to learn javascript whether you like it or not at this stage you want to make sure you master the three building blocks of programming which are functions variables data types program flow and conditional you can do this inside of the meta from the professional certificate they have a full course on javascript programming inside of it with exercises interactive tutorials and whether you take that course or something else you want to make sure that you really pay attention and really take your time with getting comfortable with the foundations of javascript writing basic programs building out basic javascript projects because again everything else builds on top of these foundations you try to rush forward you're really going to hurt yourself down the line so if you've done that your next step it's time to start understanding how software actually works what does it actually mean to be a software developer some important concepts here include version control what is the difference between git and github why do we use this kind of tools in general how do you use the command line how code revisions work how do we review code what is good code what is bad code so if you are serious and you actually want to become a professional these are tools and these are concepts that you will simply have to know but unfortunately most people ignore them and once again inside of the meta front-end developer professional certificate there is a full mini course on exactly this to make sure that you have these foundations and you understand this concept going into your career as a software developer okay so after that we can start to go a bit deeper the way the front end is actually constructed in the modern age where you learn is something called plain javascript plain html and plain css but you may or may not be aware is that in the modern age no one really writes these plain javascript like plain html css websites because with the modern world and with the modern websites that we want to build and all the requirements we have for them developers have noticed that using simply plain html css and javascript can become quite cumbersome and quite annoying to try to do all of the these things so that is why in the modern world and what i learned on my call with this experienced developer back in the day is that if you just learn these things it's really going to be tough to get your foot in the door as an actual front-end developer but what you want to learn is something called a framework make really dynamic websites and to make the development process easier and allow us to write more complex websites and the most common front-end framework is something called react react is essentially like a javascript and html combined into like one thing they have this special language that they use which is basically just javascript expanded with a lot of new things a slightly different syntax so you need to really understand html css and javascript in order to understand react but once you do you want to move over to always just using a framework because like i said this is actually what's used in the industry and once again the meta professional certificate will teach you react after these things that you've learned before so recommend learning the basics of it react is sort of like building website using these lego blocks and it'll make sense once you get into it but i would recommend building a couple of basic projects usually a handle of how react functions how it works and of that you can move on to step five which is in my opinion probably the most important one out of all of these but sadly the one that most people just skip you can probably relate to me that a lot of the time you have learned things but you haven't like properly learned you've learned something but then you've essentially forgotten about it like two weeks later the reason why this happens is because you don't put things into practice you need to find a project on your own that you're excited about which is what that developer recommended to me or if you're going through a course like them met up from them professional certificate they will usually have a capstone like this one does that essentially puts everything together and just allows you to follow along and build this big project at the end of it which is number one gonna allow you to have a portfolio project already that you can put on your resume and actually get interviews and it's gonna make you a much much better developer because at this stage you are essentially a software developer you are building a real front-end project using all these steps that we have learned before now after all of these steps at this point you should be reasonably confident with your abilities in front-end development javascript html css react and you should have great portfolio projects under your belt you can put inside of your resume and get noticed by recruiters which will eventually lead to interviews but before you can pause the interview you do have to prepare for that if you fail to plan for them you plan to fail you want to make sure that you dedicate time specifically for interview preparation i know it can suck i know it's not fun to prepare for interviews but it's necessary and i'm not just talking about coding interviews you want to make sure that you craft your story you want to make sure that you know exactly why you want to work for the company that you're applying for do you want to prepare for the technical part but also prepare to show your potential to show your passion to show your interest for programming at the interviews because at the end of the day these are the kinds of people that every company wants to hire and even if you suck at the coding part but you're a really amazing guy an interviewer really connects with you they might still give you a chance but that's not to say that the coding part is not important and the meta professional certificate concludes with a full section of full mini course on specifically learning to solve coding problems and preparing for those pesky coding interviews to want to make sure that you again pay special attention and really take your time to get good at the interviews because if you can get to the point where you're really comfortable with interviews i can tell you from experience that it's an amazing feeling to be able to walk into any interview with confidence and knowing that you are good enough but throughout all of these steps there's one massive problem that is probably the biggest reason why people still end up failing even though they do all of these things and that is that they simply choose to give up way too soon like guys try to learn the code getting high as a developer it's not an easy process i did it in like four months but there was a lot of luck involved with that i had a internship with a previous company and then i ended up getting hired at the same company i had to chat with the developer that was able to really help me again i hope that video right now has sort of been that eye opening moment for you that makes you believe that you can do it too but that doesn't mean that it's going to be easy it requires a lot of effort a lot of persistence and i can tell you from experience having helped people do the same thing the people who choose to keep trying that choose to not give up on themselves are always the people who succeed the people who just cannot believe in their own abilities to do something that end up giving up and if you give up well no surprise you won't get that when it comes to getting a job as a software developer you sort of just have to decide that no matter what i will do this like i will not give up i don't care how long it takes me but i really really want this and i will keep going no matter what that's the mentality that you need to have if you wanna actually do this it's not easy thing to do but if you do this and you follow these steps and you just keep going no matter how it is i know you can get there because i've seen so many people do it before again if you're interested in learning front-end developer and you want just one resource that you can just follow on the website you can go and check out the meta front-end professional certificate again taught by meta staff it gives you a certificate you can go and check it out down below in the description thank you for coursera for sponsoring this video and i've actually even used coursera to come up with a full computer science degree that i've essentially designed for me if you sign up to my newsletter you can get a full notion template with this online computer science degree that i am following myself personally and i also made a full video where i detail exactly how i did that so if you're interested i highly recommend you watch this video right now where i go through everything and how you can do something like this yourself i will see that in a second
