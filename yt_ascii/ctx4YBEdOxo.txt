[music] what's up guys mkbhd here let's talk about that roadster too so last night as many of you probably know if you're a tech fan at all you've watched these before there was a tesla event and this one was for the unveiling mostly as we all knew it for the semi truck so we finally got our first look at it you know elon rolled up on stage driving one got out of the thing looks like there's two versions of it comes in a sort of a space gray dark version one big one small 500 mile range zero to sixty in five seconds when there's no payload or zero to sixty in twenty seconds with an eighty thousand pound payload the thing will recharge to 400 miles in half an hour has a center seated driving console autopilot all these cool things about it looks really cool but and i'm not a truck driver so i'm probably never gonna actually even sit in one of those but that was the main story of the event and then it kind of looked like it was ending the lights dimmed and then they came back on and there was music and it became this sort of a one more thing tesla pulled one more thing and out of the back of one of the trailers attached to the tesla truck they rolled a tesla roadster 2.0 the new one the one that we all knew was eventually coming but didn't know we'd ever see you see tesla didn't have much of a reputation when the original roadster came out that was this two-door car that was essentially the body of a lotus but with the electrics of tesla the motors and the batteries and it was a sort of a weird frankenstein hybrid car not the most practical thing not the most comfortable but boy was that thing zippy and from what i've heard very fun to drive but it doesn't supercharge the way model s do it's not one of their flagship cars they had problems they didn't sell a lot there was a couple hundred or a couple thousand sold and that was it but then there were rumors there were rumors of maybe they'll bring that back maybe there will be a roadster 2.0 there are some elon tweets here and there there's some tesla hinting but we never actually see anything until last night so they rolled that thing off the truck and it looks in my opinion absolutely incredible it looks great it looks like a tesla in a lot of the waves and a lot of the curves but it has cues from others cues from porsche a little bit from aston martin it's got some some mclaren lines to it so it's a really aggressive really good-looking sports car it's pretty clear immediately that he's about to talk to us about the new roadster and he is and then he gives us the specs and i'm a spec person i like numbers but there's not a lot of spec sheets that can just make me kind of speechless essentially especially coming from someone who's driven and owned a p100d for a while which has a silly spec sheet by itself spec sheet of the new roadster 0 to 60 miles per hour in 1.9 seconds 1.9 seconds zero to a hundred miles an hour in 4.2 seconds it'll run out a quarter mile in 8.8 or 8.9 seconds i've seen both from their their website and their presentation but it's a sub nine second quarter mile it'll have a top speed of quote over 250 miles per hour and this all will come from the floor mounted 200 kilowatt hour battery pack so twice the size of the p100d it has three motors two for the back wheels and one for the front wheels and it'll do 620 miles or 621 miles rated for a charge so that massive battery is actually getting you not just awesome performance through motors but a really long range that'll be the first electric car to do over a thousand kilometers on a charge so that spec sheet just that list of things he said just if you look at the car and you hear those numbers it's like hyper car territory basically it doesn't sound street legal it doesn't make any sense when you look at every other car that's ever been produced it's nuts and i know we get caught up in the numbers about like you know it's just a straight line drag race like eventually those other cars will catch it those million dollar super cars that we constantly compare these two will eventually catch it but with this one it doesn't look like they'll catch it nearly as fast as they could catch this car like this is basically p 200 t in a way like if apollo is p100d performance 100 kilowatt hour battery dual motors then this roadster is a lighter body a 200 kilowatt hour battery pack and triple motors p200t so we get to this point in the event my jaw is just kind of on the ground where i was watching this and obviously there's a lot of comparisons naturally we just love comparing tesla's numbers to these million dollar super cars i actually looked it up a lot of these cars on the list of the fastest production cars 0 to 60 ever are doing like 2.5 seconds maybe 2.4 a lot of them 2.7 so for tesla roadster to come along and do 1.9 is disgusting and there's actually some videos from the event that we're getting some test rides out i'll show you guys them but of actual launches from inside the car the reactions incredible the views incredible i can't wait to see people doing like that gopro reaction test where they're just sitting with the passenger and they have the gopro up here and they do the launch from 0 to 60 to see the reaction can't wait for those three two one oh jesus honestly i didn't think i didn't think i noticed the difference between my p100 come on no i honestly didn't think it knows the difference there's a reason this one's called black oh my goodness i kind of wonder if you could track this car like i've talked to friends about bringing like a tesla to a track and actually you know racing a p100d against other cars this car is electronically limited to 155 miles an hour but you can only go that fast for so long before the battery starts heating up and it actually limits your performance and doesn't want you to do that for very long so even though it's an insane performer even though this car does 0 to 60 and 2.4 you wouldn't really race it on a track for very long against like a traditional supercar i mean it's also a four-door sedan so that's another reason but still i gotta wonder what the cooling is gonna be like in this 200 kilowatt hour battery how long you be able to get this insane performance can you actually go 200 miles an hour for some time before it wears out could you actually track this car and beat a lot of the others i want to see what motor trend does with it i don't know i have a lot of questions but one thing i haven't mentioned is this car is coming out in 2020 tesla roadster 2.0 will ship in 2020. there's gonna be a founder series version and a regular base model essentially is what he said i don't know how the numbers will defer or what the difference will be between the two but that's what he said it'll be a 200 000 car which is i mean it's still a fraction of the price of the million dollar cars we compare it to but the founder series will be 250 000 and there will only be a thousand of them made now there's a reserve button on their site and trying really hard not to press it but you can reserve it right now to get it in 2020 but there's plenty of other questions i still have plenty of reasons why you might not get this car like the fact that i've only seen the outside of it for example they haven't they haven't shown the trunk elon said tons of storage on stage but he didn't show the front trunk or the back trunk he also said it's a four seater so there's the two doors in the front and you see the front two seats but there's also two pretty small seats in the back kind of the way some other sports cars are four seaters you probably don't want people in the back all the time but then it's also a convertible so the top glass goes back into the trunk so how big could the trunk really be i believe it will have autopilot but that wasn't really mentioned or talked about there's a couple of other little things like i still have questions about this car but then again 2020 by then like this could be sick something i don't talk about a lot is this car p100d apollo is a leased vehicle which means i'll be giving it back and i kind of view tesla's as a piece of tech in that way so the fact that they offered a lease for a couple years where i could give this piece of tech back to them and they'll continue to develop other tech that i can pick up later when i gave this back was kind of part of my plan and it turns out apollo's lease is up at the end of 2019 and the roadster 2.0 2020. but this roadster 2.0 man that's something else that's a hyper car 0-60 that fast 0-100 that fast 250 miles an hour you can't you can't really argue with that i think i'm done i think that's all i had to say let me know what you guys think should i should i think it probably will
