it was at this moment he knew he picked up hello everyone and welcome in this video we are examining my mistake in talking money shifting what is it what happens when you do it and what are the consequences so first off what is money shifting well it's when you shift to a lower gear than you're trying to for example i was driving in third gear topped out and went to shift to fourth but instead of hitting fourth i unintentionally shifted to second gear alright so what's going on inside the car well we have a v6 engine with a 6800 rpm redline so let's say our engine is spinning at 6800 rpm it's sending that power through the clutch which is connecting it to the transmission here we have three gears shown and in this example i was driving in third gear so we'll say we're in third gear which has a ratio of 1.625 to 1. so what does that mean well it means the engine is spinning 1.625 times for every time the transmission output shaft spins once so we then send that power from the transmission output shaft to the rear differential which has a final drive ratio of 3.538 to 1. so what does that mean well transmission output shaft rotates 3.538 times for every time the wheel is going to rotate once so what this means is that our engine speed is going to be your transmission gear times your final drive ratio times faster than your wheel rpm and so since we know our engine speed and since we know our gear ratios for our transmission and our final drive ratio and we know our tires ultimate outer diameter then we can calculate what our vehicle speed is based on all of those things so we have our red line which we're at 6800 rpm we have our gear ratios we multiply that all throughout and that gives us a wheel speed of 94 miles per hour so that's the speed that we're actually traveling 94 miles per hour while we're in the top of third gear and so i go to shift to fourth gear of course and if i were to shift to fourth gear that would lower the gear ratio from 1.625 to 1.272 which means our final rpm would then drop because we're multiplying the engine speed by a lower number there so we lower our rpm it goes below that red line and you accelerate back up to it in fourth gear right ideally that's what happens but unfortunately i shifted into second gear so second gear has a ratio of 2.325 to 1 meaning our engine speed now goes up so instead of dropping that rpm from 6800 rpm the engine wants to go to 9729 so that is based on a wheel speed of 94 miles per hour and being in second gear our engine speed would want to be 9729 rpm not good because redline is 6800 rpm so what's happening at the wheel well at the wheel if you were to be at 68 100 rpm which is the highest speed the engine wants to be and you're to be in second gear your wheel speed would be 65 so your vehicle speed would be 65 miles per hour so your tire really wants to slow down your engine really wants to speed up because you put it in that wrong gear and then you have your clutch in the center and this is the intermediary where you have these two sides fighting against each other and this clutch is helping to sort that out now it's worth mentioning there are different consequences depending on which gear you're shifting from and which gear you're shifting to so as we mentioned in this third gear if we were to execute a money shift into second gear we're going to 9729 rpm if we were to be in second gear going for third but accidentally hit first that'd be even worse we'd be taking our engine rpm all the way to 11 000 so you know there's different consequences fifth gear and you're going to six but you accidentally hit fourth you're going up to 86.50 so you know not as high as the shift i did you know third to second gear so that is all based on gear ratios and the larger the percentage gap in gear ratios the higher the consequences for a money shift okay so what kind of damage can you expect and there's really three areas we want to focus on first of all your tires want to be at a slower speed and so you know you could have wheel lock up you could have that rotational speed slow down and you could have that rear end want to kick out and you could have some tire wear so that's not so bad tire wear not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things it's a fairly cheap fix relative to the other options here also what can happen is you can have of course clutch slips so your clutch is that intermediary again between these two opposing sides that want very different things and so it's going to have some slip occur you could have some additional clutch wear as a result of that but finally and the reason why it gets the name money shift is because it can cause significant engine damage and thus cost you a lot of money so one of the big problems that can occur with your engine is valve float so your valves have springs that are used to control when that valve opens and closes but those springs are designed for a very specific rpm range in this case from zero to 6800 rpm the nissan z's redline but we're hitting 9 700 rpm or potentially that high meaning 43 higher than the range it's designed for so you can start to fall outside of the useful window of that spring and you can no longer control that valve's motion and so this is a problem because you can start to then have contact so why not just use a stiffer spring well stiffer spring means it takes more energy to compress that spring meaning your engine is less efficient so you wouldn't want to use a really stiff spring if the operating window for your engine does not require it so what's the problem with valve float well aside from the fact that your engine is no longer going to run properly if you're not actually timing your valve opening and closing correctly you can also have damage occur through contact so if the engine is an interference engine meaning when the piston is at the very top of its stroke and the intake valve or the exhaust valve is all the way open they would overlap now under normal operating conditions this is all timed so that this never happens but if it is an interference engine and then you no longer have control of your valves you can have contact between the valve and the piston and then you can damage your valves your valve train your pistons your connecting rods all kinds of problems can occur so there are some engines which are not interference engines meaning that that valve can open up all the way and your piston can be all the way up and they won't come into contact however you still have really high speeds that are occurring that your engine is not designed for which can still cause damage a non-interference engine is a much safer design though because it means if your timing belt or timing chain is to fail you're not going to have contact between your piston and your valves now one of the things i was curious about was the speed of the pistons in this scenario so there tends to be a limit on the speed at which production cars will have their pistons moving and so you can calculate the average piston speed for various vehicles using a simple formula and so using the nissan z at its 6800 rpm redline the average piston speed at redline is 19.5 meters per second now the fastest moving pistons in any production car that i know of is the audi r8 v10 which has an average piston speed of 26.9 meters per second so in our money shifting scenario that i did going from third to second if it were to actually hit 97.29 rpm then our average piston speed would be 27.9 meters per second faster than any production car as far as the speed of the pistons that i know of and if we were to go from second to first which would be a much worse money shift that would put our average piston speed at 31.8 meters per second well above what i have seen as kind of the limit for production cars so ultimately when you start looking at these different factors valve floats interference engines really fast rotational speeds forces that the engine is not designed to withstand then you have damage occur within the engine and it gets that fun name money shift okay so what happens in my scenario well i was driving onto the main straight i'm in third gear accelerating out and as i start to get closer to redline at about 90 miles per hour i go to shift to fourth but end up hitting second immediately the rear end of the car wants to kick out to my left so i counter steer very briefly to correct and quickly get the clutch pedal pressed down again which stops anything bad from continuing to happen once everything had settled i stick it in the correct gear fourth and i'm back on my way thankfully i avoided both the wall to my left as well as engine damage unfortunately i wasn't data logging so i don't know where the engine got to but with the tire slipping some clutch slip and reacting quick enough the engine didn't miss a beat and happily kept tracking without any codes or faults or noticeable flaws and yeah i might have grinned with a slight smirk knowing that i'd gotten away lucky now can any of this be prevented well technically yes so there are plenty of manual transmissions out there with reverse gear lockouts meaning say you're cruising down the highway you can't just shift it into reverse and blow everything up gm also has something called skip shift now this is a solution for fuel economy and it's kind of annoying technology but what it does is if you're at low throttle it forces you to go from first down into fourth gear rather than into second gear and it does that by blocking second gear up so you can't shift it into second instead you have to force it into fourth so technically you could create blocks that prevent you from going into specific gears depending on what your vehicle speed is but i've spoken to several manufacturers out there and none of them really seem interested in doing it and considering that the manual transmission is kind of on its way out i don't think we'll see that technology implemented however there are future technologies like clutch by wire or shift by wire which may end up being you know implemented in the future and if you were to have something like clutch pie wire and you were to let out the clutch in the wrong gear well then you could have a control mechanism that says hey you're in the wrong gear we're not going to actually let that clutch out examples like that so perhaps in the future when things are driven by wire you can put control solutions in to prevent this but i don't think we're gonna see mechanical solutions to preventing a money shift now there's a really cool video humble mechanic did tearing down an engine which was not so lucky after a money shift and he walks through the entire thing to show all the damage done the valve train basically exploded sending rocker arms everywhere and damaging the cylinder head it's worth checking out so i'll include a
