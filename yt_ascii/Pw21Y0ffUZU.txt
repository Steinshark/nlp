so today we're talking about smart rings and we're talking about them because some of the big tech companies have started to say they're going to do smart rings i've been wearing a smart ring for you know quite a long time i think i've been wearing it about 5 years and they've been out longer than that this is from a company called ura who's had the first kind of commercial rings available and you may have seen people like prince harry was wearing one at some point that was so they've kind of been around a while but suddenly the big companies are thinking smart rings might be a good wearable tech option for their portfolios this is relatively big and you might be able to see it's kind of on my hands hard to close my fingers around or not have it bang against other rings so you have to choose carefully what what finger you use but they've got a range of sensors built in and every time they release a new version this is version two of theirs i think it's got slightly more sensors on the inside around the finger what source of things can you do then so like a watch it tends to shine different color of light through your through your skin to look for like heart rate body temperature the thing that a lot of them use the most is heart rate variability which it can it can detect one of the things they're trying to do a lot is show whether or not you're stressed or whether you have a stressed response in your body heart rate variability i guess is kind of quite standard that they see the more that the variability increases like the range of difference between each rate to change or if there's like a millisecond difference here between there and it changes a lot every heartbeat every heart pulse then it's that's when it's starting to say you've got higher levels of stress is kind of what they're inferring from it but it could it could mean lots of things you could be just excited about something it could be a roller coaster that you've seen and you're really excited about going on though that's a very good point yeah if you if you go for a run then for the rest of the day your heart rate variability is higher so for the rest of the day you might have seen something's like the garmin watch have got like a stress display and so you go for a run and then for the rest of the day you're stress display is kind of higher but that's just because your physiological response to that activity is it yeah it's like why why have they not calibrated for that i mean you you expect that to be a simple thing to sort would you yeah it's because well what people say is they want to reduce stress but that's very much a reflective or feeling experience of how you are and what the watches and rings can tell us is the stress response okay and the stress response can be good you know if you could do something exciting like you said a roller co po you enjoyed it your body's got a stress response on it but you don't necessarily feel stressed the problem with stress is it's kind of i was going to say it's a loaded term but it's not a easily measurable thing is it or is it is it measurable the stress response is measurable well but that's what that's my point so stress itself is not no not so easily u people obviously try and there's lots of apps to help you track it like but that's more of a kind of subjective i feel stressed we could do another video at some point on the companies is where they put a little button next to the employees to say i feel stressed right now to see what employees did and that kind of how many of those are placebo just like a little plastic but doesn't do anything anything i'd have to look into it again but my memory was that it created a lot of backlash and people felt like it wasn't good for their for their work life well actually seeing the button just sitting next to you all the time as per like and employees are like so we've been looking into what these could do and there's been loads of research in human computer interaction as a research field to study what people might do with jewelry smart jewelry so there been necklaces bracelets watches rings one thing they would say about rings is that you can wear multiple multiple rings more easily so you could have several rings on one finger or rings on each hand on each finger and you might be able to tell more about it so there's lots of research into gestures interaction in vr where they could track your fingers more carefully if you could see each bend of your finger and which angle it was they're also looking at how rings and watches might talk to each other so one thing is interesting if you try and do a ecg on a watch you kind of have to touch the watch with your right finger and if it's if you're wearing it on your left hand then it can do like a heart electricity pulse through your body but in theory you could do that without them being directly connected if you could analyze it and then you've got kind of connection between smart devices what's also in fingers is not being done at the moment is you could give like haptic feedback to a finger mhm so at the moment you get lots of vibrations in your watch telling you when you have a notification and if you're trying to give people feedback on what they're doing you could give feedback directly on different fingers if you're wearing them on multiple fingers or she could use it to help i don't know learn an instrument or something by yeah that's a kind of exciting example cuz i guess things like classical guitar it's a lot all in the fingers without much in there wrist so i mean i wear my watch on my left hand but if you had your watch on your right hand you could tell strumming better but if you had sensors on every finger or on multiple fingers you could detect finger position better guitar piano could all become slightly more analyzed i think the point is we use our fingers for quite a lot more things than we use our arm position you can do quite big gestures with your arm you could kind of figure out someone's pointing towards something in vr but in things like the vision pro they're interested in like pinch interaction so suddenly you can do more interesting specifics not that cameras seem to be struggling too bad with it and they figured out when you're doing a pinch but maybe with detecting each finger with wearables you could then start to figure out different finger pinches and whether that matters or multiple finger pinches those things one thing we thought about when we were discussing rings is that rings often mean something and they're often used a bit more stylishly and maybe that's something that that companies might do more in the future has come up with different types of rings diamond rings wedding rings you know these often have like a they signify something to people they're quite meaningful so you might find that they become something that people attach more personal value to which might be interesting to know what would you do with your personal data if you gave someone a ring you know i can give you a ring and perhaps now i can track you slightly better as a as a person in a relationship tenuous is it yeah i don't know it's interesting to know what they would do with it as they shrink maybe that it could be used a bit more surreptitiously i suppose but you might find companies that focus more on style and like aesthetics and products might make smart rings that are more designery or collaborate with companies to produce smart wedding rings you know one thing that they talk about with intimacy in smart wearables is what you could do to communicate vi it kind of subtly for people who are fire away so there's been lots of things like maybe you've seen on smart watches where you can tap your finger on the watch and then it like if you got both fingers on it then sends your heartbeat to somebody else it's kind of like a romantic thing if a rings are more of a romantic thing what's the kind of battery implications of a ring like that good question so this one used to last about a week and you would get a good load of data and just have something by your bed only charge it every now and then now it's a few years old the battery life isn't lasting as long i kind of have to charge it more often and it's hard one thing you don't get if you don't have a screen cuz this has a screen it tells me you're running out of battery as this doesn't tell me it's running out of battery i kind of have to check it every now and then with my phone so this is the spire stone that came out it was quite a while ago actually it was maybe 10 years ago and it was a it's a little thing you wear on your waistband or on your bra strap but it's designed to track your breathing so this was also trying to do stress in particular stress was what they were interested in and they the assumption there was that breathing rate is also a thing to do with stress so if you are stressed you start to breathe more shallow of course there's lots of reasons you breathe shallow but that was the main assumption if you wanted to trck stress yeah you could you could put this on and it would kind of sit down here as you were breathing it would just sort of subtly check your breathing rate and then beep at you when you were stressed i think beeping at me to tell me i was stressed would make me more stressed it was very interesting yeah it would be like if i was prepar like measuring the quantum thing effects it's like a bit like that yeah yeah it would say like every couple of minutes you're stressed do you want to take a break right now and i was like well i'm preparing for a lecture i'm going to be giving a lecture soon for example if i was leaning against the sink while washing up it would think i was stressed cuz i was it was affecting my breathing depth cuz i was leaning against the sink so that would be like you're stress right now i was like i'm really not i'm just i'm just washing up this is like my to take a break from the washing up but it still needs to be done yeah that's s of more of a meditation thing if you wanted to be you know washing up could be actually quite relaxing but yeah this is the problem with all these in that they anything you have it's assuming something might indicate something like stress they're trying to infer things from from yeah other yeah things happening with your body right but there could be all sorts of reasons in the end that affect it so it was interesting though fun to try for a bit interesting to learn about yourself from and that's the sort of same thing with the sleep tracking and the and the activity tracking with different variables is you try it for a bit and does it help you learn something you were saying before about possibly you know ring working in conjunction with a watch you think kind of the more sensors the more devices if you know you get a more holistic view of what's going on then perhaps they'll be inferring things in a better way my guess is that's why why some of the big tech companies do want to to add more variables is that they got more points of reference and more points of cross reference and then perhaps from that they can tell it's not stress but it is something else or it is stress and not something else and then maybe at that point it's more useful for people but again probably needs a lot more machine learning a lot more data processing to figure that out and i would argue that for most people the smartphone is wearable anyway because the you know food i've not got any data on this but i think most people have it in the pocket i think well i don't know if it's unfair to say most men do what's interesting about my wife is that her her watch is the only thing that tracks her steps accurately because her phone is usually not on her person yeah fair point but it is for me i've now got this that track steps this that track steps my phone that track steps so it should be pretty damn accurate by now one of the problems and one of the confusions is that people call these things large language models which makes you think that they kind of talk like a person then if you do minus t as a flag and then put in the hash then it will tell you what the type of that object is the fastest way to get
