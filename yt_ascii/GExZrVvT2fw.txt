let's jump back to it artificial intelligence what's your thought of the state of where we are at currently with artificial intelligence and what do you think it takes to build human level or superhuman level intelligence i don't know what intelligence means that's my biggest question at the moment and it's i think it's cuz my instinct is always to go well what are the foundations here of our discussion what does it mean to be intelligent how do we measure the intelligence of an artificial machine or a program or something can we say that humans are intelligent because there's also a fascinating field of how do you measure human intelligence of course but if we just take that for granted saying that to whatever this fuzzy intelligence thing we're talking about humans kind of have it what would be a good test for you so during develop a test that's natural language conversation would that impress you a chatbot that you'd want to hang out and have a beer with of you know for a bunch of hours or have dinner plans with with is that a good test natural energy conversation is there something else that would impress you or is that also to differ yeah i'm pretty much impressed by everything well i think if roomba if there was a chatbot that was like incredibly and i don't know really had a personality and i if i didn't be the the turing test right like if i'm unable to tell that it's not another person but then i was shown a bunch of wires and mechanical components and it was like that's actually what's you're talking to i don't know if i would feel that guilty destroying it i would feel guilty because clearly it's well made and it's a really cool thing it's like destroying a really cool car or something but i would not feel like i was a murderer so yeah at what point when i start to feel that way and and this is such a subjective psychological question if you give it movement or if you have it mmm act as though or perhaps really feel pain as i destroy it and scream and resist then i'd feel that yeah that's beautifully put and less say act like it's a pain so if you just have a robot that not screams just like moans in pain if you kick it yeah that immediately just puts it in a class that we humans it becomes it we anthropomorphize it it almost be immediately it becomes human yeah that's technology question as opposed to sort of a physics question right i think that's a really good instinct to have you know if the robot screams screams and and and moans even if you don't believe that it has the mental experience the qualia of pain and suffering i think it's still a good instinct to say you know what i'd rather not hurt it the problem is that instant can get us in trouble because then robots can manipulate that and you know there's different kinds of robots as robots like the facebook and the youtube algorithm that recommends the video and they can manipulate in the same kind of way you
