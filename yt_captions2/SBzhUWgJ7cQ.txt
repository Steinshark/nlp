[music] all right guys welcome back to tech in turn today i want to try something different people always ask how to get into these companies and i want to try to convince you to not do an internship at one of these companies now i'm not telling you to not work at the companies i mean i work at microsoft right i can't really speak to that but what i want to convince you is that there might be some better opportunities for your internships there might be places where your time is better spent than worrying about fang and big four so the first question you kind of have to ask yourself is why do you want to work at the big four like step back even maybe pause this video and ask yourself like why do i want to work at the big four and that it might seem obvious i wrote down some of the reasons here that i suspect you'll come up with um because they're the ones i had when i was in university and the first one is if i could work at one of the big four companies or fang then i made it right like i've proven to myself that i've made it and the more i think about that the more i think made it where like is that my career goal is is to to work at microsoft or is to work at google is like is that your whole career goal and if it is that can be reached before you even start your career like as an intern you can reach your career goals the reason i bring it up like this is because i think you have to take a step back and think about what your career goals are which is not something people tell you to do often like you're so concerned about getting the next internship or you know getting a full-time job that you don't step back and think like in 10 years where do i want to be or what do i want to be working on and if that is generally like i want to be working on this very specific product at google then great all the more power to you second thing i hear quite a lot and i actually kind of agree with this one is uh just to interact with many customers like just to have the breadth of the company because at a company like google or microsoft so many people in the world use your code and that's kind of a really cool thing in some essence isn't it now if you think about a company like microsoft we really have products that touch most people in the world like let's just say seven billion people in the world i think you have to consider though that even if the company has that breadth your product won't necessarily have it so you're not going to work on microsoft word and write the entire thing you're not going to write all of microsoft word you might write like one specific component of microsoft word and although there are a lot of customers in microsoft word only five percent might use the thing that you actually implement and they might only use it once like would you rather write code that five thousand people use every day or would you write rather write code that a hundred thousand people use once if you're working at a really cool startup um that you know your code might actually run more times than if you just have it run for a lot more people so it's something that that you need to consider and the last thing i hear quite a lot is uh to grow as a developer and i also agree that this is definitely the case at big companies you're going to get mentorship you're going to have a really great mentor and he or she is going to be able to provide good feedback on your prs they're going to help you with design decisions and all that great stuff however you are going to be working in parallel to the team so the team is working on the real product and the team is working on new features and bugs and then you're over here working in the same room as them but on a completely self-contained project now when i was at a startup for example like toast i was just a member of the team i worked with the team and i learned so much i probably learned more in that internship than i did i didn't close the window rookie i probably learned more in that internship than i did in most of my other internships so you have to consider the fact that you're going to be not working as part of the regular team and if you'd rather get a taste for what full-time is going to be like i really highly recommend it that you go to a startup now that i work at microsoft now that i'm here i have more clarity into it now i look back and think all right what did i want to come to a top four company for and a lot of these were the reasons and i think it's just better for you guys to sit back and actually just think about why you have motivations to go to a big company if it's just about learning and growing as a developer you might actually have a better time going to a startup the last thing though that people say a lot is and that definitely was the thing for me is money definitely big for big five fang companies whatever pay a lot of money so i understand that however there are other internships at maybe not top four companies but other really big companies that pay even more so for example the the highest salary i have ever heard for interns was actually i believe at salesforce or was it dropbox so one of those companies was giving interns the option of 11k a month you had to forego the stipend to get that but that's still a really ridiculous amount of money so if it really is a money thing you know don't think the top four are the top payers that don't think that the top four are the top four paying because they're not necessarily all right guys that's all i had for today i really hope you enjoyed this episode and i can't wait to see you in the next episode
