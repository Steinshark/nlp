hey prime i'm going through a rough time and my boss told me i can step down from the lead or the tech lead position and work as a swee again do you think this would be a seen as a bad thing in my resume what do you guys think chat i want to hear i want to hear from you so we okay sweet ie yeah yeah some peeps are are cut out for management some aren't uh you know is there economic will you have any economic ramifications is there a reason for him suggesting because of a personal issue uh he has a personal issue are you worried about getting your position back can we get some more deets depends on how you frame it yeah depends on how well you can explain it okay depends on the rich it's a health issue oh it's a health issue all right so i'm gonna be real here i think that if you're having a health issue or really just any like intense like family based issue like you know i know there's some engineers in our community who have uh they're you know their little kiddos going through cancer treatment and stuff you know they've reached out they whispered me and honestly like any form of health issue is is so emotionally tough you know whether it's you beautiful wife kiddos even your mom your dad you know like that stuff's real you know and and life you know i've said this before but like i encourage you guys to work hard you know i get [ __ ] on on twitter because i i say hard work is a good thing and people are always like oh you gotta qualify that no i think hard work's a good thing i think you should work hard stop with excuses just work hard um but if you don't have something you're working for if you don't have someone to enjoy it with if you're sacrificing it with your health you're working so hard that you're just selling out your your 70s body it's not work it's not worth it right it's just not worth it work is meant to be enjoyed i always think about you know you know the old ancient hebrew story of adam and eve like even in their story they had adam working in the garden when everything was perfect and like that's real that means like there's something fundamental about human and work life like it's it is very very important but if you don't have you know if like if you're sacrificing yourself for it it's not worth it i don't think it was ever meant to be that way uh i don't think it was ever meant to be to be at the expense of uh i think it's it's meant to be i think it's really it it gives you purpose a sense of meaning it can give you something to you know to work at to feel proud of uh you know those are all great things but if you feel obligated and you feel worried about your future you're you're already at a company you're hired during a tough time with a bunch of layoffs you're in a tech lead position you'll get to a tech lead again it's not like you're going to lose your ability you're just stepping back because you have a real life problem and to me that just seems perfectly reasonable any here let me let me invert this do you want to work at a company in which uh wouldn't hire you and would feel suspicious of you if you took work off due to health or you reduced your position from a high communication high hour position to a lower hour position would you want to work at a company like that and the answer is no you wouldn't you know you'd no one would want to do that we'd want to work at a company that can understand and support you during these things like netflix is really generous about those things netflix would would very very much so when my wife had surgery four months ago you know i told my boss i'm like hey i'm gonna have to be off for a while and then i and i even told him i think january is going to be pretty hard and he ended up saying well here's the deal in january how about you work around life you don't make life around work you know because when we're working we work our life around our job but he gave me the invert and just said hey you need to be off for a little bit you need to go do that go do that make your work around your life get things back into position and then let's hit it hard in february and i was like yeah i'm in i'm in to do that that's good and so i i do feel like you want to work at a place that understands that there's very good value in nurturing and caring for your your staff and you know not every place is going to be like that some places are going to be old school uh you know they're going to be more intense but there's also plenty of great companies right there's plenty of great companies and you you will be able to find a great company too so i'm not one of those people that uh you know i don't think of every company as bad or good i think just some are great some suck and if you have a if you run into a situation where health issues mean that you're not being a good employee they're just not a good company that's all there is to it work hard when you can work hard card enjoy your job take satisfaction take pride in what you do work to the best of your abilities be happy about it i don't believe in quiet quitting i don't think it's a good thing i work as if it is my own project and i try to make it the best i can possibly make it because for me my work is important to be good for the sake of my work being good but when i need to take a break i need to take a break for real reasons and i think i think that's just a good way to live your life i think that it's just harder not to live that way that's all
