let's code today what should we build let's build something with python because we love building and tinkering with python and it's super in demand let's build i've been seeing a lot of videos around computer vision this one here this one here i've shared them with you before let's try and build something with computer vision i think that would be really fun a really interesting project if you are someone who is already a programmer or maybe just wants to build something really cool because you're learning how to code or maybe you don't even want to be a programmer but just something fun to build a really interesting project let's build a face detection app so when we run this program it will detect faces through a webcam so excited this is gonna be so fun i i know i need to calm down but i just i see those kind of programs i'm like i could never be smart enough to build something like that it's pretty simple to do so we're gonna do it before we do it though hit that subscribe button for more tech coding and career related videos and okay now let's get into it foreign start diving into this project there are a few things that i really want to break down for you because oftentimes terms like machine learning ai generative ai they're thrown around kind of interchangeably when in reality they are pretty different i found this image online and i wanted to share with you because i think it does a really good job of breaking down what the difference is i'll put it up on screen here and you can see ai a broad term that is for computer or technology that can mimic human thought intelligence or behaviors so once again ai when people reference ai it's a very broad term kind of think of it as an umbrella or even in this image kind of all encompassing that it doesn't mean a specific thing if that makes sense then though we go into machine learning which is systems that use algorithms to mimic the way human brains learn which we're starting to get a bit more niche a bit more actual tangible things that these systems are doing go down one more into generative ai systems that learn patterns in existing data sets and out put new results such as text video audio when asked to do so we've interacted with generative ai a lot when it comes to chat bots especially with chat gpt when it comes to claude ai different chat bots that are able to output new results when they are asked to do so and then also too on this list the included chat gpt i think because of all the hype around it which is a popular generative ai product that can chat with users users ask questions a prompted end result are returned so i wanted to share that with you before we dive into this project because a lot of times i've been seeing online and i'm guilty of this too using these terms not necessarily interchangeably i hope i don't do that anyways but more so using these terms is really without understanding really what they are and it's so important at least to have a base as to what are these terms and what are the different aspects with ai one more i want to cover with you is natural language processing natural language processing is a branch of artificial intelligence that essentially deals with the interaction between humans and computers using natural language hence the natural language processing and the key goal of natural language processing or nlp is to ensure or enable computers to understand interpret and manipulate human language so oftentimes when we're interacting with chat gbt in the form of text we are interacting with nlp here are some key capabilities of nlp text processing and understanding so nlp techniques like tokenization or part of speech tagging allow computers to retext and extract the meaning of that text speech recognition this converts a spoken audio into text that can then be processed by other nlp technologies so when you were speaking to a computer and it can process this and have a response back then there is natural language generation which can be used to automatically generate well-formed natural sounding text and once again i keep on using this reference but chat gpt so here is the question i referenced earlier on in this video about generative ai and how it is used with chat gpt what is the difference this is something that got me a little stuck for a while is what is the difference between generative ai and natural language processing so generative ai you can think of as it focuses on generating new content such as text images audio key examples are large language models like gpt3 chat gpt that it uses that can generate human-like text whereas nlp focuses on understanding and processing the human language so it can include tasks like translation sentiment analysis and speech recognition if you really wanted to sum it up or if you need a cue card when you're talking to a friend at a party or whatever the case is generative ai creates new content that seems human made the goal is to be creative so when we think of ai generating art nlp natural language processing aims to understand the human language the goal is to process interpret and analyze the human language so there can be some overlap between the two but in general that is the main difference all right now let's get coding okay i'm very excited to build this computer vision application for face detection mainly because i've been seeing so many use cases of computer vision online recently i'm like we got to get into this so we are going to be using python for this as mentioned and then also to opencv which is an open source computer vision library also to machine learning software so here are some key or main points about opencv it is one of the most popular libraries for computer vision and image processing it also too provides a wide variety of functions from face detection object tracking image segmentation and more and it can process images and videos to identify objects faces shapes and colors it's pretty crazy what it could do i'm really excited as you can tell to tinker around with this alright so let's get into it let me share my screen here okay you can see my screen i've imported cv2 and numpy or np i don't know why it's still saying could not be resolved i have imported both of them and i did just try running this before you know recording it and doing again with you and it works so i'm i'm not sure but any experts out there please let me know down below why i'm having this important problem still i've tried restarting my project i've tried everything as starting the terminal again nothing is working so first things first to get your virtual environment running this is the command you will run in a new vs code project once you have that run you are going to run this command which will install opencv alright so then you import cv2 and then also to numpy okay so i added some more code in here and let's go through what exactly this code is doing the first one is define the part this part of the code is defining a function that we called detect faces which essentially you can think of as performing face detection on an input image so as you can see def detect faces we're passing in the image and then there we are doing when it says gray equals this is converting the input color image to a grayscale and this is using opencv's function and this is because i just learned actually as well that face detection works better on grayscale images then number three the faces line is performing an actual face detection using the pre-trained classifier i am not an expert by any means in uh computer vision so just bear with me but i just think this is such a fun project to build and learn together there so there we go okay so now number five in the for loop x y w and h we are drawing rectangles around the face shape okay let's keep on going okay you can see i have more code on the screen here this is actually the final bits of code so uh as i mentioned the for loop is looping through the face array and um apparently i'm still learning so i have notes on this it's coordinating the width and height of each detective face then if we scroll down a little bit here return image is just like any other code we are returning the image with rectangles um and then so essentially if we wanted to summarize up this code it is drawing a blue rectangle around each detected face in the webcam frame then what it will do is display it continuously in real time so that's something i found really fascinating as i was exploring this is the things that go into you don't think about being able to display it continuously in real time constantly there on your face this is really cool it's time to run it let's see how this goes oh wait we can't run it yet there's one very important part here i'll put it up on screen this is the github xml file that you have to download first and input it into your projects root directory and this is really important because it is essentially a ton of different code as far as the meat of the project you can say that is why this project can be so small is because this is going to be really reading face detection so you can see here too in this github i am using the frontal face default but there's things like lower body there's left eye full body there is a ton to use which is pretty wild and i mean it's really it's a huge file but what that will do is help be able to do frontal face detection all right pretty cool here and this is just from the opencv github repo so it's open source really fun to use all right let's get into it okay to run this all you need to do is run python in my case i'm using python 3. so python 3 and then the name of your file it is detecting my face how cool is that okay i'm gonna do a screen recording so you can see it better one sec here all right i hope you enjoyed going through this really fun project with me at the end of the day no matter how senior you are if you are a programmer or not even a programmer but just want to get your hands in some code or build something really cool this is a really fun project to tinker with and build i hope you enjoyed it as much as i did i'll link the xml file that you need to download down below so it's easy and accessible for you and let me know what we should build next i'm really enjoying building and learning different kind of technologies you know i've been a software developer for six plus years now but i'm always looking for other areas to expand and build onto and as we've been talking a lot about artificial intelligence machine learning computer vision all these new and advanced technologies well not even new but more popular now you should say technologies i wanted to dive into them hit
