at my new place there's a lot of stuff for me to charge everything from batteries to controllers to my freaking car so anchor sponsored this video where i'm going to be showing you guys all the really cool solutions we've come up with to charge all of my devices efficiently and safely and we are off to a really really good start here as you can plainly see [music] obviously not everyone needs a solution to charge their high-powered electronic water guns but as a parent i can tell you whether it's a water gun or some other electronic gizmo it's a pretty crappy feeling to have your kids come to you and say dad can you play with me can we play with those and you go oh they're not charged can you wait four hours well right it's not real it's not reasonable so the solution we've come up with here is nick callanan printed out these 3d printable holders for the spiral water gun i mean shout out thingiverse by the way because you can find freaking anything on there okay there's a slight flaw in the system there we go then this is where it gets genius so the cable management for all of them is run right along the length of a gun so you barely see them and one of the things i noticed about these is that they always retain a little bit of water and it gets freaking nasty so we installed this little water trough obviously it's not going to run the water off outside the house or anything like that but it gives it somewhere to just sit and evaporate where it's not going to stain the wall or cause a puddle on the floor that could be a slipping hazard pro tip by the way if you're using ltt cable ties or any other hook and loop style fastener on a braided cable like this one you want to put the soft side in that's actually why we have logos on both sides because otherwise the hard side will just kind of pull it out and cause little little fuzzies and then the whole thing won't like look nice like this does the cherry on top for the water guns is less about charging and more about battery management this little smart outlet will allow me to put a little battery powered switch right here that you can press to activate this entire circuit so that way they're not just sitting at a hundred percent charge constantly being charged all the time which could cause the batteries to swell and die coming around to the back of my media center i think i did an okay job of the cable management okay look you can't see it from the front all right um but it's pretty clear that we can do better step one is going to be replacing my existing power bar with one from anker that has more plugs and step two is actually going to be salvaging back some of my plugs by replacing multiple power bricks with individual ones this right here is from anker's gan prime lineup it's a 65 watt charger that's super small thanks to its gallium nitride design and it's got two usb-c's and a usb-a allowing me to charge my switch as well as for my harmony universal remote receiver now obviously when it's sitting behind my media console i'm not going to be moving it around but one of the key benefits of these gan chargers is that they're super portable compared to something like a 65 watt apple brick it's literally half the size anker also offers their 737 gan prime charger which will deliver up to 120 watts and that is why i hate attaching power bars to things because you either try and line up the screws on the little keyhole things and it like never quite goes in right or you hot glue it this is actually with like extra strong hot glue and it eventually comes off anyway fortunately i have a new solution this particular one isn't from anchor this is from ltt store but i'm sure they won't mind me talking about it this is what i'm going to call the grand piece of our upcoming cable management lineup basically it's a little universal do data majig that fits into any one of these keyholes you tighten it on like this and boom magnetic mount i mean assuming there's metal here we'll put a metal thing there yeah the goal was to have it be so strong that you can plug and unplug things without it taking it off but when you need to move you can pull it off magnus baby how do they work the ltt store power brick holder ah okay wait for it if you have like a ton of like power bricks and cable power bars and power bricks and stuff like this just changed the game and probably the coolest thing about this is jacob from engineering spent literally months probably longer than i would have allocated to it optimizing the magnetic field orientation whatever so that these things would have just wild strong pulled strength look at this that's what it takes to pull it off so once it's on there it's on there a few moments later and we're done there's obviously still a lot of cables back here but we were able to consolidate everything that was plugged into the wall behind me all six of these outlets into this one power bar and everything is strapped up to the back of our media console including an extra lan cable that's you know super convenient to just grab down and run to wherever we need it in the future and oh so much cleaner there we go now controller charging same thing as the guns kids want to play games they don't want to worry about charging controllers adults too rather than settle on just a place to charge double a's and triple a's i've created the ultimate charging station these little wire shoe racks are available for next to nothing at places like ikea home depot or even on amazon and what's great about them is that they allow for adequate airflow for your chargers and your batteries while also reducing the risk of fire one thing that i would like to improve about this setup is getting rid of this little bit of carpet here and actually screwing a metal plate to the wall right here because while double a batteries are unlikely to catch fire some of the types of batteries that i'm charging here could say for example the lithium-ion batteries for my tools or these'650 based tesla batteries for the kids radio flyer tesla ride-ons those are not nearly though as dangerous as these any diy batteries live inside separate metal enclosures because even under ideal conditions these lipo batteries can cause some wicked wicked fires anker's contribution to this one pretty straightforward another one of their very well spaced out power bars and then ltt store contribution and little cable management clips anytime we need them just you know yeah let's take another crack at this uh okay good i didn't want my car charger just you know lying across the floor because you never know kids could run over it with their bike or you know you could accidentally roll a piece of equipment over it or whatever so with a simple spring balancer and some aircraft cable we were able to suspend the car charger up above me i think there's still a bit of fine tuning to be done with respect to the lengths of the aircraft cable or whatever else but boy is that ever better than having it dangling along the floor right sometimes as is admittedly the case with these ninebot go-karts there's not a whole lot you can do to achieve perfect cable management nirvana i mean i guess we could build some kind of like two-layer stacker with all the bricks you know power managed into it or something like that at the very least we have this a 3d printed enclosure that allows me to take two power bricks and turn them into just one while also offering some protection from the bangs and scuffs and scrapes that are likely to well probably not do much to them okay this wasn't really necessary but whatever the go-karts are here and they plug into the wall a little something like this [music] for my nightstand my before setup is actually pretty solid i've got a total of eight usb ports with these two right here i've got this non-slip mat here that prevents anything from being accidentally tugged off the table and then i've got this single wireless charger that'll do a phone airpods an apple watch if i had one of those thank you apple for not making it the q standard as well as having a usb-c here that i put my little urine charger on i can pop on there but that's not to say that we couldn't do better these don't do fast charging and i've got a fair bit of mess under the desk that i think could be improved as for my wife yvonne set up she just has the one of these quad-port usb-a things she honestly doesn't really charge much just her phone and then her air pods which are not plugged in oh my goodness yeah i didn't even notice this this needs to be replaced yeah i think anchors probably got us covered there though now technically the adhesive i used on these is temporary it's actually the same as this stuff but when it's clean it's literally micro suction cups boy does it ever grab ah there we go and the adhesive that's on the other side of it is wild this is this is the intended side you can kind of stick it place this if you want oh that's better we're all anchored up we've got their power port cube coming off the wall over here this will do usb as well as ac power that goes straight into one of their gan chargers here this puppy will do a total of 150 watts through a combination of three usbcs and one type a so two of these usbcs are going up to the top we've got one of them here this is probably going to be for phones and random devices and then one of them is dedicated to this side and that's for my io neo or steam deck or whatever flavor of the month handheld gaming console that i'm going to be using so that'll sit right about there obviously we've got more usb ports up here so two type c's one micro b and one lightning connector and those are all easily accessible but here we go we tuck it in a little something like that without taking up space on top of the desk and without being an eyesore oh so much better not much we can do about how messy yvonne's nightstand is other than just put it all in a pile and hey hope this is how you wanted it put away hon but hers is great because there you go you can easily see and access it if you need to plug in more cables say if she wants you know this micro b or whatever else and the one that she actually uses in bed is a type c that'll reach right over to around here one of the coolest things about anker chargers is their power iq4 which will automatically detect the devices that you have plugged in and then distribute their total power budget accordingly so if i were to add another type c over here say one for the io neo and one for my laptop which i often charge my backpack right here just a little something like this it'll automatically distribute the power as needed my problems here in my office are twofold one is that i didn't have enough rgb before as you can see we got that sorted out but number two is that my cabling situation is a messy and b in some cases downright dangerous this is the ac power cord that was running to my subwoofer step one is going to be to pull off my existing far too long xlr cable although it was conveniently managed with this ltt magnetic cable holder and replace it with this custom perfect length one from the one and only dan who built it for me thanks dan that's why we call him dan the guy and i don't this one i can't get perfect no matter what this fiber optic cable just can't be coiled up tightly or jammed in anywhere you got to be super super careful with it so i'm just going to take one of these and then accounting for that needs to be height adjustable i'm going to leave a little bit of extra coilage there and then i just need one of my little cable management arches boop also i hit away my displayport cable here i'm using an hdmi tv right now but i'm probably going to switch to displayport monitor at some point so i'll just leave my cable here and then it'll be ready to go for me when the time comes if i was willing to settle for wireless headphones this wouldn't be a problem but i'm going to have to accept at least one hanging cable under the desk and that's the one for my headphones let's just go ahead and put this magnetic arch here these anchor usb hubs are super handy they have a combination of data ports and fast charging ports and while i wouldn't normally recommend strapping them in the way that i'm doing right now because you'll probably give up at least one of your ports yeah you can see that spacing i give up one of my data ports um the benefit is that it hides under my desk and i never have to see it well it might not be the cleanest setup in the world but considering how much is going on with this setup cameras microphones lights other more different cameras other more different microphones there's just a lot to it i am very happy with the result oh did we ever power it on ah okay it's on now so that's good i went to show you guys one of the coolest features which is that everything's magnetic which means that even though i never use a standing desk if some butt head were to come and standingify it it would just rip the magnets off rather than actually breaking anything because this fiber is extremely fragile i'm not gonna go out of my way to test this theory our magnets are also like crazy strong um but theoretically it's a fail-safe that does exist in the boys room we get to check out one of our coolest products yet this is the 727 charging station this is part of their gan prime lineup and it's got a number of things on it two type a's two type c's these are pd type c so you could try something like that oh shoot where'd i put all the laptops ah yes say for example uh a chromebook for school or other more different laptop for doing anything other than school and this is really neat it's also got these super cool duplex receptacles look at this it pops out when you plug it in so that's how it can stay so slim if you want a tighter form factor they also have the 615 usb power strip in their gan prime lineup with 65 watts distributed between two fast charging usb c ports two ac outlets and a usb a port this last one's really cool this is their 733 power bank it's part of their gan prime lineup so it has the same active shield temperature monitoring that checks like three million times a day or something like that to make sure nothing is overheating and this is going to replace two things in my backpack lttstore.com um my 10 000 milliamp hour power bank which you can see it's actually not a dissimilar size to that's that's gallium nitride for you and my i believe this is a 65 watt oh this is a 100 watt charger damn i thought it was you know what i'm switching back to the framework anyway so it'll be the 65 watts that i need for my framework laptop it actually replaces both of these pieces plugged straight into the wall and just uses a standard type-c cable love that dual purpose and that way i never have to think about charging up my power bank separately it just charges whenever i plug in my laptop oh and you know what else i don't have to think about a segway to our sponsor because the video was brought to you by anchor hope you guys enjoyed it bye
