ladies and gentlemen welcome back to tata steel chess 2024 it's the first major chess event of the year this is round number nine out of 13 and oh my goodness the good games keep on rolling in we don't have the top three players in the world participating by rating and yet we are still getting hay makers players are swinging for the fences world champions are winning they're losing a bunch of players are basically drawing zero of their games and in today's video i'm going to take you through some more epic battles some absolutely heartbreaking gut-wrenching moments some amazing victories and painful defeats here we go we will kick things off with the indian sensation prand rames babu who is now officially undefeated in over 40 classical games of chess he has not lost the game in 40 games we have an early stages of a gig streak forming of course the records are held by guys like magnus and dingly ren who have uh gone on streaks of over a 100 games without losing prague plays e4 he's up against juen jun who has had a great event uh the women's world champion playing up to a very high level and prague gets us going real early as my man plays the fried liver attack technically this is not called the fried liver the fried liver is uh d5 ed knight d5 knight f7 but for all intents and purposes my man prague goes for knight g5 now here a massive disappointment as j and june plays d5 instead of playing the traxler can you imagine if she pulled up the tata steel and played a traxler good lord i mean seriously that would have been absolutely incredible instead she plays d5 e takes d5 and now not knight takes but instead knight to a5 which is the main line prague gives a check which is the main line black loses a pawn all of this has been played tens of thousands of times before and now bishop to d3 another move is bishop to e2 another move is queen f3 prague chooses this and j and june plays knight to d5 setting up an attack on the knight with her queen as well as looking at knight f4 possibilities p plays h4 defending the knight j and jun plays queen c7 all right so there's a lot of lines here uh h4 obviously defends the knight and if black were to play h6 uh i would imagine white would play queen h5 threatening checkmate uh but maybe not maybe not um maybe maybe he had something else planned like maybe bringing this knight back or something because actually after queen h5 queen f6 uh there there there is i don't know there there there's some very critical crazy lines here but okay queen c7 now computer actually gives bishop h7 as a free pawn uh but prog spends a little time in plays b3 so clearly still in his preparation low depth stockfish says go take that pawn um that looks absolutely derange to me but apparently it's the best move bishop e7 there is queen f3 threatening this so i don't know pr goes here anyway main line of fried liver is absolutely insane knight e4 and finally the knight goes back to c3 and we are in a situation where prague is out of his preparation i think here maybe bishop b7 is the only thing in prague's notes plays f5 jun plays f5 and now queen h5 check would run into this move king d8 instead of a queen trade because white is up a pawn so white would enjoy trading some pieces but instead we have knight c3 and basically a completely insane position where um prague is up a pawn but his position looks completely absurd he's got all these pieces blocking his pawns black has a very very strong pawn advantage in the center and as you can tell from the evaluation the position is dynamically balanced so prag plays knight a3 looking for knight c4 e4 played benji i have a dog sitting in the room i promise i'm not talking to to to nobody and dog owners you will know your dogs will randomly chew themselves really loudly so i promise i'm not going insane so e4 attacks the bishop queen e2 pins the pawn to the king as well as setting up pawn to f3 and long castle castles bishop a6 she goes to e6 and now prague is able to get a couple of pieces into the game let's not forget prague is a pawn up if prague is able to simplify these pieces correctly then he is going to be in good shape knight goes back to b7 and now a sophisticated move from prague who takes on b7 getting rid of one of black's pieces and now pawn to a uh f3 first pawn to a3 was good pawn to f3 uh is good as well he plays a3 a little bit later but once he starts challenging the integrity of black's position it's just going to be felt like the pawn advantage is going to be felt knight to e5 rook to e1 adding more pressure and now he turns his eye to the g file and as you can see here there is a long-term brewing attack she gives away a pawn he takes it but it's just not good enough there is not enough play to be had on that side of the board he starts pushing out her pieces and the attack is roaring forward j and jun does grab a pawn back but now a well-timed queen e5 and let me tell you prague is attacking very very aggressively look at his pieces and suddenly the white position comes alive i mean you look at you look at the position that he had where everything was stuck black had good center control but he slowly unwinds by trading off some of black's major pieces and then he turns his attention to attacking his opponent rook e1 j and jun plays queen d7 prague knight d6 jan j rook e7 queen h2 and now just simply queen h6 the queen is uh unable to to be captured queen d6 bishop f6 that threatens rook g7 mate in a few moves that threatens the rook jan june resigns prag nando wins an absolutely beautiful game he is now in first place he just beat the women's world champ couple of rounds ago he beat the current world champion that is dingly ren he's also beaten magnus carlson this man is the champion of champions right now he is looking to be in impeccable form he has not lost a classical chess game in 42 games now hans neiman all right in the challenger section looking for a bounceback victory plays a c5 nysso indian he's looking to play a bonon that is literally what he is trying to do he's trying to get his opponent to go here at which point he would have played a bon defense and we would have gotten a very imbalanced position but instead of that hara plays knight f3 so she invites a capture in the center and now we are in a sideline of the nso indian it's a very interesting uh it's not really a nso indian it's kind of like a sideline of an indian defense just period no pun intended cuz har is indian but it's it's what it's called if you look at the database and hans plays knight c6 she brings the knight back plays a3 and now han starts instigating on the queen side with this move b5 and here there's a moment of hesitation uh from hara who plays b3 bishop b2 and now hans is able to push this pawn and annoy the position a little bit hara plays a4 but that move locks the queen side and basically makes makes it very difficult for white to do something in the future admittedly taking is also not a very pleasant looking move it allows black to get an active knight but not having all of this lock down here would give white chances in the future she decides to lock the position instead of playing that hans goes here and now they get into a maneuvering game so hans puts his knight on a5 where yeah i mean it's going to pressure the position for a very long time and then he trades the bishop because that's white's better bishop right this is a bad bishop the better bishop gets traded hara continues to maneuver hans comes back and he's just going to try to seize control of the dark squares e5 sabotaging his control of that square hara could now potentially maneuver but it's very difficult she goes here the idea is to go knight c2 hans plays knight d8 because he's also got ideas of his own he's he's going to put the knight on c5 and pressure all of this and hans wins the race the thing is hans is going to win the race of annoying his opponent he's got all the rights situation here look at white's bishop this is a really difficult position the only thing that's making this position still maintainable for white is the fact that there's no easy way to break through so han starts taking more space i mean he's trying to take as much away from white as possible right knight d5 now he takes with the knight he takes with the knight because white's options are to go here opening the c file and the diagonal which loses or this which gives hans the dominance to play with his f and e pawns right hara could have just sort of stayed put probably what she should have done is gone h4 tried to lock it down and just basically say my position's not great but you can't beat me then i'll put my bishop on h3 and i'm going to be all right but instead she makes a very committal decision and hans trades plays bishop c8 and just all his pieces come alive from a distance he completely dominates the board and he just does a great job here of hunting down the white position on all three sides e4 is a major threat the pawn arrives on ag three being sacrificed to open up the file ara doesn't even take it and now hans just oh my god everything all of it just a little bit of hesitancy from hara and just a just a great game from hans trades the queens opens up the position the rook gets in dominance dominance from start to finish just a great game by him all the pieces controlling and he marches in and and and white is completely defenseless the knight can't move if you move the knight let's say to d1 i will take on g4 with check and you will be promptly mated so it's a very very very very very nice game from hans neeman uh i wouldn't even be surprised if it was a perfect one like that was just a positional squeeze from the chess gods is what that was an absolutely stellar game by him a bounceback game for him and he he he wins a very nice one oh this is heartbreak i'm about to show you a game that's going to make you cry d4 d5 and my man max vadam who played this a couple of rounds ago uh against um not a couple of rounds ago literally last round against gukesh do you remember that game it was that that game where it was a mirror image capture queen a4 was played and then gukesh was a was a pawn up and then ma max vardon played like 30 moves of prep well parham knew that that was going to happen so he just plays his own line and he plays it like this knight he can't take the knight because of the pin so they play a position and now both guys are out of prep max has to think on his own he plays a g excuse me he plays a gambit with black where he's a pawn down after like four moves he plays it back toback round so the guys know he's going to play it right and yet look at the position that he gets from the opening bishop c4 making it very difficult for white to move both guys as you can see from the time management are playing on their own baran plays knight4 long castles and my friends uh max vadam is cooking he is literally winning this game in about 12 moves he's going to go knight d3 a3 knight d3 take take white will literally never castle you'll play rook g8 put a queen on the c you know on the light squares and you're just going to win the game so param makulu now has to sacrifice material he goes queen e4 and literally loses a rook he has nothing better he has to lose a rook but the good news for him is that the knight is trapped it cannot go to c2 because you will play rook c1 so param makulu despite right all of this still ends up in a position when it all said and done where he's worse black has a rook for a knight and a pawn black is winning max vadam just played his gambit for his goofy gambit second game in a row and he is just winning the game bishop f8 and now he's going to try to win this game by getting a pawn majority moving if he can push those pawns he's going to win the game he's completely winning knight e4 and now rook a2 knight f6 and here here he doesn't have to do this probably it's better to show a little selfcontrol but max didn't want to lose this pawn and then you know the other pawns are going to start rolling so instead of doing all of that he just says i'm going to give this back and then i'm going to go here and i'm up a pawn and i have connected passers now stockfish evaluates this as about equal but you start moving forward how is white going to stop black's pawns white has pawns of his own but how is he going to stop the pawns i got news for you he's not he's just straight up not going to stop them max is an absolute genius pushes the pieces all the way back and rook h2 and a3 and and max is winning again just an absolutely breathtaking game from him playing this ridiculous gambit that is not supposed to work at top level but it is working rook c7 rook h3 check bishop f2 rook f7 and now if he just plays b4 i think he's just completely winning but he plays bishop c5 rook c7 pawn to a2 and that's it the pawn is just going to make it pawn's just going to make it rook c8 rook a8 check is coming king a4 baram just goes e6 it's the best that he can do and in this position you can't make a queen because i will do this but what you can do is play king b3 the point is if rook a8 you play king b2 and the pawn just queens you sack you sack the bishop for the pawn and you win right take take queen or rook a3 even which cuts off the the king so king b3 is probably winning the best line there is rook c5 queen you try to queen and then i can probably stop you by playing queen a8 instead of that in this position max vadon plays rook a3 which actually messes up his advantage because after take a1 queen e7 the pawn is queening there's no way to stop it by some sort of miracle if you play queen e1 check i go here you have no more checks rook e 3 take take rook e five white wins because there's no way to stop the pawn so this is completely nuts a1 e7 and max fadam is no longer winning the game oh my goodness he plays a move here he he has a lot of moves a lot of these moves are given an equal evaluation but this is a very stressful position he plays queen h8 and he loses he loses to the absolutely incredible rook c8 rook c8 oh my goodness you can't take because it's a fork so queen h7 the king go the pawn goes up the board there are no more checks and white is queening and the worst part is if rook a1 to go rook e one i i just check you and i win your rook and then i queen i can also just block with the knight i mean it is absolutely heartbreaking param makulu fights to the bitter end and he wins a game temporarily down a queen and in this position max vadam just resigns because not only is he now down a night he's also going to get mated soon you can't go check cuz the king goes here the king is safe unreal i mean this is so crazy he plays this gambit twice he's 0 out of two he should have been one and a half out of two at the very least he should have been one out of two with two draws i mean this is so heartbreaking what an absolutely insane game max vadam goes down param makulu gets a much needed victory now another game alexander donchenko from germany ali resa fua this one is just a queen's gambit decline there are no goofy gambits al resa does play bishop b4 which is a bit of an aggressive line generally you play c6 and the bishop goes to these two squares but in this game alira plays a very aggressive queen gambit decline my boy came to win knight e4 he grabs the bishop and he has the bishop pair brings his bishops back to their home base and this is the position that we have in the opening ali resa look at this g4 shoving the queen backwards but potentially creating long-term weaknesses and now alexander donchenko plays some inspired chess he could castle but he's not really ready for that yet i think he doesn't like that black can play h5 and lock down the position so my man just shoves his own goofy rook on the h5 square and says ali resa you can't connect your pawns and like a good wrestler ali is trying to connect his hands trying to connect his pawns to throw the opponent not physically this actually would be a good fight i think donchenko outweighs fua but might be taller anyway they can take chess boxing after this uh rook h5 you don't you don't let him connect upon pawn so he can't uh he can't you know put pressure on your position and now knight d7 ah donchenko is a principled man all right he knows that with the king in the center he doesn't necessarily have to castle he can open up the position and now he is taking the fight to fua and that is the way you have to play knight f6 e takes d5 sacrificing the rook that he put there completely he put the rook there and he went there to die the purpose you want to take the bishop and open up your opponent's position and it's too dangerous now he backs up and it's actually very difficult for fua to move but he moves the king manually to g7 knight b5 looking to get the bishop fuia says okay you can have the bishop i don't want to lose any time i'm going to take the file now you can't castle stupid knight d6 queen d6 king f1 all right we are obviously not afraid of castling queen b6 we defend ourselves bishop d7 i'm manually walking my king to safety rook c8 queen f4 and now rook h4 so in this maneuvering game danchenko says wait a minute what about the pawn right oliv resa could have played rook c8 but instead he goes for more and suddenly danchenko is just going to win his pawn he tries to defend it from the other side but rook h4 how do you defend the pawn rook c1 i've got ideas to go rook c5 rook c7 and my king is going to go behind my rook and my king is somehow safe how do that happen and it goes from b to words because bishop d3 rook c5 well timed bishop takes g4 d jeno's a pawn up and it's a very very valuable pawn it's a pawn that ali resa did not have to do he didn't have to do all of this he played a little bit too aggressively too much of a blood lust to win the game he can't play like this in the candidates tournament all right i understand he's trying to win every game he's trying to please the fans he's trying to gain elo but uh he's just under a huge attack now now in this position bishop g 6 and the game goes on white will probably play g4 maybe rook c7 but instead of that ali rza goes rook h6 and now it's bad to worse because all the pawns are under fire rook h7 the pawn falls you can't take it you take it with the knight it's queen f7 queen h7 you take it with a rook i take it's game over the queen out of the game the bishop just ceramic the rook is nice but it's not doing anything and alexander donchenko hands ala fuja another loss this man alza is on a roller coaster in this event up and down up and down up and down i mean he wins a game it's like breett taking he loses a game it's crazy donchenko gets a win as well and the best part is i have more games for you there were decisive games in no less than three more battles and even more than that waye versus yan porishi this one a bishop's opening uh you'll notice that wei does not play uh knight c3 too fast so here comes d5 yan trades the dark squared bishops they both move their a- pawns for reasons i can't really explain you cuz you're like 2,000 points high lower rated than them and rookie one rookie 8 it's just a very stable position white will spend the game trying to attack these pawns as he reroutes and does exactly as i say also he will put the knight there and try to take advantage of the fact that black has moved his pawns in a certain way so the knight cannot be easily removed and there is another targeting of the pawn he's trying to get a position where black will have this very ugly pawn so yan goes here and as you can see from the time management way still very much in his prep could reroute could reroute could play c4 as well to try to break up the position bishop c6 there it is trying to open up the position bishop b5 ab b5 pressure here open up the rook yan plays queen f4 creating counter play wei tries to kick the queen out the queen still hangs around he's opening up the center it's a very very critical moment here yam plays rook d8 and now wei opens up the position again and yan center blockade is kind of falling apart ef queen f three are we going to go to an end game listen if we go to an end game you count the pawns white is white is winning that pawn survived computer here says that it's equal for black it says this is not scary black will trade probably trade again and then win this pawn with something like knight e8 but instead of that yan tries to keep the queens on the board but now wei plays knight c4 and this is really bad news because if yan doesn't trade the queens wei is the attacker and he's got the full stomach so yan plays h5 this is vintage yan he's just trying to create chaos if we can mitigate this chaos he's going to win this game he plays d6 opening up his light sor bishop and now a beautiful move a move that is very easy to miss in a position like this king f8 was played to get out of the way of the bishop to also prevent any rook from arriving on e7 except that's exactly what wei does it's called a collinear move in the words of robert h a move on the same line of sight as a piece that can take you and the idea is quite simple you would like to take with the pawn force the king out force the king back and reared and now yan is stuck nothing can move knight f7 is a massive threat but this is vintage yan poni here comes queen d2 the counter play is not finished apparently there was a better way to do this it was to play queen e2 king f8 and then knight d6 so keep the queen here prevent any counterplay because the way it happens in the game now wei has to trade the queens and he has to try to win this end game yanomi sacrifices his aon bishop a2 he didn't want to take it if you take the pawn on a4 there is various tricks maybe with the knight and knight d5 and coming in here but now we have a3 way starts bringing his king and uh there is no way for yanomi to create counterplay this is an umbrella pawn you are hiding behind the pawn the bishop is pressuring f7 yan tries his best to create counterplay but he is completely paralyzed not a single one of his knights or his rook can get anywhere wei shuts down yanomi absolutely brutalizes his position and nepo resigns this is neo's first defeat in the event i think which is crazy wei wins a much needed game as well yet another decisive result now yordan van fores n abdor of nc was just absolutely dismantled by yan pishi so all the players are taking points off of one another e4 e5 knight f3 knight c6 this time we do not get knight g5 we have this and jordan plays in a very forcing way with d5 we actually saw you remember the game mar andrea maritti versus hans nean no yes yes mar andre maritti versus h uh hans hon nimon uh bishop b3 and now knight h4 looking for queen to h5 check by a miracle jordan doesn't blunder it and now nerre is just trying to open up the center of the board as much as possible he's basically punishing jordan he's like jordan this is not how you play chess what are you doing like why are all your pieces in the center of the board you going to play this prov oh oh no i pinched something in my back oh my god ah chess is a brutal game queen e7 bishop 2 e3 he's like you're going to keep your king in the center i'm going to open it up let's go knight f3 now nck wrote jordan v forest an instagram dm and said i'm going to oil up your position knight to e4 i have knight d6 coming i have bishop b6 coming jordan finally gets castled but knight to d2 an excellent blockade and the attack there is roaring forward and uh the position is very balanced here ah balanced is uh you know it's it's rather it's it's imbalanced uh but it's still kind of you know it's within reasonable terms of each player uh and then jordan goes here which uh i guess he was trying to play knight f6 but that move takes the eye off d5 so nock responds now knight c5 we need to trying to put the queen on b5 potentially and also defending key squares in the position position and jordan goes here and ner brings his rook and jordan goes here and no takes the bishop and does this and threatens that and that and also b4 and and jordan resigns what yeah according to the database jordan just resigned here that wow i mean without this i mean i is this accurate cuz uh i guess he just hated his position so much i don't what could have possibly happened queen d2 why not knight b3 i mean i i i guess he was trying to i don't know maybe he just really thought his position was just completely lost i have i have no idea uh in fact i'm gonna go look it up yeah i mean i guess the position was just totally hopeless and i have one more game for you mar andrea maritti this man is absol absolutely brutalizing the challenger section it is a ready he's playing against diva desmo who's having a very good event and he plays in a very symmetrical way it's a completely symmetrical position completely symmetrical so white tries to take advantage says if you take me i'm going to open up pressure on this i'm going to get a good position divia plays e6 take take and mar andrea says let's play this position you will also notice uh he's spending a lot of time like i mean he's you know he's trying to play rook c1 knight a4 kind of calm down the initiative that diva will try to create bishop a6 there's knight a4 knight d7 and now it's going to be a slow methodical movement of these pieces queen goes up to fight for the dark squares bishop b5 trying to take the knight and ruins white ruin white structure so knight c3 divia says take my bishop go ahead because if you do i'm going to und double my pawn or not she didn't want to und double her pawns okay i guess she's holding out to play c5 that makes a lot of sense a5 okay she plays a5 and a4 it all makes a lot of sense queen goes back to b7 all right we have a big big dancer now she's not going to get to play c5 now but her position's still pretty pretty okay queen d7 i'm worried about that c pawn though cuz she never actually got rid of it uhoh uhoh oh no it's a massive weakness oh no okay rook a3 is taken and i mean the c pawn is just is still just standing there and now she has to give up the knight because the pawn is too strong marand marra could have played this he didn't because of c5 so he went bishop be1 and i mean yeah the pawn falls and that c pawn just is a weakness the whole game he brings this king all the way to the queen side that c pawn is still a massive liability and he plays king c5 and at the end she defends it he plays king d6 to go here and or there by the way and diva resigns because yeah black is completely toast you can play bishop b6 ab king b6 i will give you check very important put the king back on the a file and then i will go feast on your pawns i mean this pawn is like literally ruining black's position c5 i can go here remove the defense so the fact that diva just did not get rid of the c pawn and mar andrea played the whole game against this backwards pawn a backwards pawn is a pawn that is standing behind another pawn has no pawns to support it right and can't move forward because white the other side controls the square in front of it so it it's supporting a pawn but it can't move forward itself it can't actually progress in its own life and in this game it was the thorn in the black position the entire game literally the entire game and mar andre wins i got news for you mar andre is is destroying the chall he is up a full point but you know who's not destroying any section these guys ner back anish prague ges five and a half then you got vidit alo wei you got seven people half a point apart from each other and there's four rounds to go and prague is also cooking kukes is cooking everybody's cooking ali res is cooking and blowing up the kitchen every other game i don't know what to say but uh i'll see you all for round number 10 now get out of here
