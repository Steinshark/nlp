i gotta be honest with you guys i didn't even look at this listing past the title price and the first picture all i know is it's a big penis server it's got a fair amount of capacity and it's a sand which is something that we've never really had an opportunity to touch on before i didn't think they were actually going to accept the offer tell me this jake is it even possible we bought something useful i've got the listing here i didn't really look at it that much either i just saw that it was five thousand dollars and you said offer a thousand dollars and then he said yes here we are i mean how much of that are we even getting that's just a picture of a rat are we he wanted us to take the whole wreck shut up and i was like he agreed to let us not take the rack we're just taking what's inside that's good i don't think that rack would even fit in the truck but does that mean that they expect us to take all of that equipment is that all even j-box yeah what's that thing in the bottom it's four j-bods in the controller server the best part is it's 96 hard drives but they're 600 gig hard drives so the total capacity is like 60 terabytes we can replace this entire thing with like three hard drives now we can replace this entire thing with two of those keoksi ssds and it would be faster and it would be faster so i talked to the guy on the phone a little bit this company there are about 100 people so similar size is us yeah but they're moving from in office to work from home they took all of their server equipment and put it in a data center for a thousand bucks it's kind of a this is a steal i mean even ignoring the drives because those are basically worthless like how many hours do those have on them probably a lot 600 gigabyte drives you said yeah anyways the disc shelfs themselves i've seen go for 500 to a thousand dollars each on ebay because they're really useful for home lab it's like the cheap way to get a bunch of storage you buy one of these you put an hba in your server and there you go one cable out to 24 drives 24 drives yeah they didn't just sell it to us because they knew the channel or whatever did they no no he did say that he recognized us but it was after oh there's the other thing these are gonna be sas drives oh that's actually kind of an inconvenience because it means that if we just wanted to give them away at the christmas party people couldn't even plug them into anything i think they're dual controller as well yeah yeah they're sas so this it's like a redundant link to the drive oh that's awesome so if one of the controllers goes down you're good 96 more drive bays and that takes up what 16 years then yep it's one of those super micro 90 bays basically yeah it's not the most space efficient but hey we just got a free rack msi meet the mag z790 tomahawk wi-fi it's got support for the latest intel cpus and ddr5 memory premium thermal control with an extended heatsink a server grade six layer pcb and even more features to elevate your gaming experience check out msi z790 tomahawk wi-fi at the link below we're shooting on iphone oh and we're not even going to be able to hide it we have a real camera it's going to take too long to set up and it took a long time to get here so we're in a hurry hey how's it going hi oh wait did you bring money you take e-transfer right yeah okay wow ouch damn i am loving the vibe here already look at this cable management everyone knows it's better to have your wi-fi access point up high what better way to get it up high than two cardboard boxes it's almost like no one's actually been working here since the covid lockdown and they just had to wait out they expired their lease oh we got some pdus and this is it wow it came with the whole rack this is the big boy okay i mean no it was specific but all right yeah this has got to be at least 10 years old is that about right did you guys buy it new yes what was this what was this worth at least 100. well hey that's uh this is the definition of pennies on the dollar then yeah yeah yes my hired guns get it hired guns two tickets yes well what i'm not gonna do it look at this more like pea shooters how the devil are we gonna get this out of here oh yes that's a quality cart hand crafted or at least hand upgraded we've got a couple of options at this point i don't think there's any getting around pulling the servers out but we're not actually obligated to take away the rack it's only if we need another rack do we need another rack no could we use another rack didn't we just buy a rack i see should we take the rack if it's a quality rack i mean it's a netapp rack it's probably good so the the bed of the truck is technically available i mean it's basically what we what we saw in the ad right as expected the drives are 600 gigabytes but you were wrong they are 15 000 rpm this is what passed for high performance storage before solid state got affordable enough that you could actually deploy it as a smaller medium business i'm trying to see if there's oh yeah june 11th 2012. that's 10 years ago 11 years ago yeah wait is that the manufacturer date on the cold spares oh yep these are cold spares the ones sitting here oh this one's different smart responsible people this is a 2.5 inch one but also from 2012. oh september 2012. has this been on since then pretty much since you got it consistently so these drives probably have like eight or nine years of like consistent running i'm trying to find the date code on this one this looks a lot newer oh yeah i mean that's branded seagate exos it's not even it's not even a hitachi one like this uh september 2019 on this one apparently this has been losing drives at a rate about once a month last year and then it's been better behaved this year oh oh there we go there's the face of the control it's kind of cute hey i missed one servers had swag like this everything's really chaotic today so you're gonna see me refer to notes on my phone don't worry about it some of you are probably asking yourselves what the heck is a sen well anytime you've got a lot of machines be they servers workstations or even individual client stations you're going to need storage and one of the ways to do that is to put all the storage in those individual machines but from a hardware maintenance standpoint that can be really inconvenient because anytime you've got any sort of failure well you have to go in you have to swap that storage out not to mention that the provisioning of that storage can be really inconvenient maybe one person needs a lot maybe one person needs a little maybe now those needs have completely reversed now one way to work around that is to deploy a nas and that's what we do back at rstudio so essentially we've got a machine that looks pretty much the same as this we've got a head unit that acts as a controller and then we've got these shelves that are full of what are called j-bots which are just just a bunch of this actually that's what jblad stands for so each of these four u's is just power and drives that's it there's no logic all of that is handled by this guy the difference then is how the storage gets accessed our nas is at the office like most that operate in a windows client environment use smb as their network file transfer protocol and smb and nasas in general are great you could think of a nas as kind of like a hard drive that 10 or 20 or 50 different people can all plug into at once and read from and write to according to their user permissions at the same time even reading the same files at once but it comes with some downsides so for one thing file locking if two people have the same file open and they both try to save it at the same time you're going to end up with a conflict so it has protections in place that well lower performance smb also uses the tcp protocol for communication which compared to just plugging a drive directly in your system is much higher latency which makes it totally unsuitable for booting your system off of i mean you could run windows over smb in the same way that you could run windows off of an sd card but we've shown you guys that it's really not a very good idea now let's talk about sin this is more like taking your drive or your 96 drives and slicing them up into 10 pieces or 20 or 50 pieces you take those pieces and you allocate them to vms or bare metal servers or workstations or whatever you want and unlike smb they are getting block level access to that storage obviously there's still a performance penalty from using shared storage because if some other client is hitting the exact same drive as you well that head's got to seek right but by building gigantic arrays by filling them full of high performance drives these run at 15 000 rpm that is more than double even a performance consumer drive theoretically you can mitigate a lot of those performance concerns also because you're not using tcpip you guys i'm assuming we're just plugged in using like iscsi over ethernet yeah you're using a completely different protocol the same one that you would be using with a direct attached drive sort of sort of sort of we don't actually discussion desktops anymore but you get the point making for a connection that is so low latency that those computers have no idea they don't just have a drive in them and under ideal conditions your performance could actually be better i mean your bandwidth is going to be limited by your ethernet connection but say for example you were hitting a huge data set with a ton of random reads and writes this would absolutely slay a hard drive that's just plugged into your computer i mean look at it yeah look at it we got to get this thing out of here yeah yes it is and we actually brought some for you guys as well so hope you enjoy them they're great for everything from building pcs to you know adjusting the cabinets in your kitchen to well really anything a screwdriver does and three for you he made fun of me for being short what the hell is wrong with you another advantage of a sin is reliability individual drives can fail i already mentioned that but if it's in a device like this there's all kinds of redundancy in place to keep your entire operation from grinding to a halt for starters this is cool our controller isn't actually one computer it's two computers ah here we go that are working together in such a way that if one of them goes down the whole system stays up and pretty much every aspect of this system is architected just like that for example the drives themselves are dual interface drives meaning that two separate controllers freaking wild can plug into this drive at the same time meaning that if your controller dies so that is the actual card inside the j-bod that's plugged into this drive there separate controller that's also plugged into this drive then there's the fact that there's all these drives right so they're obviously running some kind of i mean this is what netapp so some kind of proprietary raid oh you guys are raid tended that's wild you guys could lose literally half of these drives before you'd lose any data assuming they failed optimally or you could lose an entire j-bod but that would be pretty hard because let's go look at the j bonds everything is so cool each of them has not one not two not three but four flipping power supplies and i'm willing to bet you could lose two of these before you would actually lose power to this thing oh it would have to be the optimal too though it would have to be this one and this one or this one and this one not this one and this one by the look of things we haven't actually opened these up yet we'll have to do that back at the office we got to get out of these fine folks hair very soon here wait a second now hold on a second why is there an rc car battery in here what the tr oh that makes sense because this is running old school hardware raid so you've got a big fat raid controller on this card right here and then you've got a battery backup so that if there's any data in flight and the server loses power it can store it temporarily uh on the ram cache so that yeah this ram is actually installed on the rate card so if there's any data in flight there that's a right cache it'll flush it to the disk once power is restored hilarious the presence of the controller in the head unit means i might be wrong about the dual controller thing i said earlier about these j-bods do not leave this bay empty uh oh it's empty oh i get it this is a placeholder sbb2 blank do not leave it empty it's probably a cooling uh airflow routing issue [laughter] oh i did oh my god what this is only a 580 watt power supply are you kidding me we literally have power supplies and servers that are this big they're like a thousand thirteen hundred what that oh okay yeah so not very dense compensating for something foreign something to note is all the hard drives we transport on this thing are probably toast there's that that anecdotal thing where some big silicon valley company moved a bunch of drives like across the park was it ibm yeah moved a bunch of drives across the parking lot and then like 30 of them failed within the next couple months or something i forget the numbers on solid casters so they switched to using like rubber chunky tires and that's fine yeah this uh that was also a really long time ago so it's probably that hard drive tech has gotten better these drives are a really long time ago there's other benefits of sand that i haven't even touched on yet for administrators having all your storage in one place is great for both maintaining security within your organization and maintaining your backups so instead of having backups flying around on the network all the time packups are just done from drive to drive so fast hey jamie hey awesome that is very heavy yeah it's not too bad though okay all of which raises a really big question with all these benefits of sand why is it that i've been so dismissive of the technology every time someone has suggested that linus media group should use it it certainly would have saved us a lot of hours replacing drives or imaging windows just stupid it busy work but that actually leads us into why we've never used one until you reach a certain size of organization to the point where you've got people dedicated on site who understand the architecture and can maintain it a sand can actually add more complexity and more work than it will save you compared to a nas and for us because all of our editors work on the same project sometimes at different stages in the editing pipeline having individual storage pools that then they would transfer projects from one to the next actually more efficient so for us nas is still the way but that doesn't mean that sand doesn't still have a place a modern sand might have multiple tiers so for example you could have a high speed flash sand that is the boot drives for all of your system or that you could allocate storage from for a high performance applications like running a database or running simulations on giant data sets then it would have logic built in that takes data that's not being frequently accessed and demotes it to lower speed magnetic storage or after that eventually essentially archives it to a tape library just because these are kind of outdated units doesn't mean that the concept of having all of your storage centralized is outdated at all and in fact we saw a deployment like this when we checked out sfu's supercomputer a couple of years ago i mean the sand thing really is just describing how the clients connect to it i know that's why people getting so upset at us for not running a sand i mean i haven't even gotten into the maintenance contracts because we could have a sand that's just our server running iscsi yeah just running true nas scale with in connecting with iscsi hey it's a sand in fact we will probably set that up for the land machines at my house when we eventually put in those one new language not every computer in your house you already have 10 gig to everything why not every computer in the office iscsi is easy enough to set up but you could probably do it yourself with a couple tutorials on youtube and you could use your nas to just use part of your storage in a sand type of configuration it's really just about the connection so these are nothing special then yeah i mean the controller i don't even know if we can like just install linux on it it might be very yeah do you guys know i could you just like install like ubuntu on that controller no yeah it's probably pretty locked down yeah and that's not the only thing about this that is kind of locked down these are sas drives you wouldn't find 15 000 rpm sata drives and sas has some advantages for enterprise use but it has some disadvantages for one thing i can't just take these drives and plug them into a random sata controller on a motherboard say to controllers can't talk to them however that doesn't necessarily mean that these j-bods are totally useless to us we use almost all sata drives some sas controllers will talk to sata drives so these are e-waste these might not be i mean we could also just get sas drives oh they're so expensive how many clients did you guys have running off of this thing uh we had 10 uh dell servers running vmware oh okay so these didn't serve any workstations or anything like that it was just all for those servers all for those servers of course some file sharing but it was mainly all through the vms that makes sense oh that's something i didn't even mention earlier just because you have a san doesn't mean you don't also have nasas so in this case the san acted as storage for a file server that could then act as a nas for all the other clients on the network neat right they're offering us more stuff hold on a second hold on vending machines boardroom tables is that pool table available no one of the guys got it on our internal draw ah ooh that seems unlikely my goodness i'm afraid that my epeen is simply not large enough to contain this table so i'll tell you what jake what between you and me yvonne and i are thinking of moving again okay we're gonna move into a real mansion this time i'm thinking this dining room table okay bubble embed a bunch of technology i want i want literally get to put stackers in the garage i want little pop-up screens at every place thing or like little like ipad holders we're not putting a stacker in my garage and we're not moving he says it but just wait we were trying to find drives for this thing because it has a different block size so are they forwarded by them and people have reformatted them so they'll work on a pc but you can't go back yet another reason to all of those who have asked why i never just bought a proper sand appliance oh okay i'm coming here comes the wreck here comes the rock boys how exactly were you guys planning to put the wreck in here it looks a little tall it's gonna stick out a bunch and then you have the straps holding it oh okay okay can you hold that yeah you hold the cart i got these oh god well no no i we should each take an end okay no no i mean really can you okay i don't workplace injury it's just me okay yeah you all right okay yeah on the one hand we got five thousand dollars worth of equipment for a thousand dollars on the other hand they admitted when we were leaving that they had no idea it was listed for five thousand dollars it was apparently supposed to be listed for five hundred dollars ah did he say that yeah what yeah oh i i didn't hear him say 500 yeah oh but but they also gave us a bunch of stuff that otherwise would have ended up being e-wasted we got a couple of pretty decent pdus we got the rack which is worth way more than 500 bucks for the right buyer i mean and the the disc shelves are worth at least a thousand bucks too oh yeah probably a thousand bucks at u.s not bad yeah i'm pretty happy happy to tell you about our sponsor pulse way are you tired of having to be at a desk all day
