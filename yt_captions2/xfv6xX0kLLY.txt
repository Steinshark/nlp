hey uh what happened to all my footage in the arc video uh what footage well the the graphics card installed footage all the gaming footage all that stuff there's just one little snippet at the end what what happened uh [music] the card turned on fans are full blast i think this might actually be an arc problem yeah this is okay weird but interesting game streaming on arc is basically broken now

connectors well that happened to me too i had two solid eight pin connectors for an eight and six pin graphics card i did not want to bother with re-pinning my custom cables so i did the next best thing i had this spare 1200 watt antec power supply from back in the ncx days and i had no idea if it was even going to power on after sitting in my garage for all these years but we needed it to start playing and my plan for it is i have jumped it so this is going from uh pin 4 pin five just jumped it with a little the paper clip and i'm going to plug in this guy just into the graphics card because i am too sick and too lazy to undo all of my power runs right now i don't want to completely swap the power supply it were if it's janky i love it it's mine and you can't take it from me not even if the psu was clearly stolen from work time to game almost linus wasn't quite ready yet so i installed my drivers and started poking at intel art control their first party graphics card companion app thing what a nightmare uh if i click away from it it just closes it didn't it didn't go anywhere it's not it's not accessible it just closes ui elements behind the translucent parts of the window would still like highlight and interact with your mouse even though you couldn't actually select them and you can't drag the window around what why oh of course it's an overlay at all points in time for no reason neither nvidia nor amd are using just an overlay geforce experience and radeon adrenaline both have full applications that can run in the background and just be moved around the screen if you want why would you start with just an overlay i actually hate it so much and that's that's not just it the driver page is just a hyperlinked picture taking you to intel's download page what you can't update it through the app that's like the whole reason people install geforce experience performance monitoring is wacky because it doesn't run in the background highlights only work in supported games and not that many of them to be clear and the in-game overlay just stays up all the time regardless of what's open and there's no history if you close the main overlay the in-game overlay doesn't record things it just shows it in real time whatever it's fine nobody gets it right the first time let's just focus on the game experience luke come on okay the first one we tried was halo infinite and honestly for the most part it ran pretty well fps dropped for a few seconds oh interesting uh i'm still at zero drop frames [music] 377 0 weird anomalies massive blooming in both the menus and the loading screens but once we got into a match it cleared up maybe this was halo maybe arc hard to tell both feel kind of chanky sometimes either way weird nothing game breaking performance was okay it seemed like a steady 60 plus fps in the match we played and i personally didn't really have any issues so we hopped over to anno'00 to see if we could figure it out it looks like game streaming on arc is basically broken now i'm not using the av-1 encoder right so maybe the av1 encoder would do a better job but because it's not supported on major streaming platforms like say for example twitch yet there's no real purpose for it yet this whole time i was encoding through x264 on my cpu and everything was perfectly fine no drop frames great quality stream performance was all right but linus was streaming with h.264 on his gpu and it was causing all sorts of problems my gpu encoding just outright crashed so i'm back with cpu encoding who would have thought that the best pairing for an intel gpu is an amd cpu with lots of cores yeah this is not running too great and it kept just actually completely cutting out pretty much the whole time but the game was still playable for me at least i panned around some open water and arctic towns then checked out a much fuller and complete city with a ton of stuff going on and it was totally fine it feels fine now guys like 100 it feels fine so we moved on to untitled goose game which we played through steam remote play just like you should consider moving on from youtube to float plane where we've got plenty of exclusives and behind the scenes content things went perfectly fine with our squawking geese for the first little bit until my game started turning into an awful watercolor painting my screen is like messed up really super super messed up i don't know why i'm only like mentally registering this now okay it fixed there we had no idea what could be causing this until we realized linus was hosting a remote play together session the best part about all of this was when we checked advanced settings and it said encoding was enabled on nvidia amd and intel igpu because it hadn't been updated for arc yet we tried to fix it by disabling hardware decoding on my side but it wasn't until linus disabled hardware accelerated encoding on his pc that it actually resolved the issue i then hosted a game of ultimate chicken horse through remote play so we could make sure it wasn't just linus and this is remote play together but uh we're not using steam we're using a powerpoint if you just want a game on ark with no streaming of any kind then yeah so far it works we had one issue in disc jam where the game wouldn't go past 720p leaving us stuck in a resolution much older than the game itself but the performance was pretty okay in the games we tried as long as it wasn't over remote play since then i've tried out call of duty modern warfare 2 anno'00 assassin's creed odyssey inscription slay the spire and quite a few other games and had no major issues that other people didn't also have it sort of felt like i was having more total issues than i feel like i would have had if i was on my previous titan rtx but there was no way to really prove that and in general everything ran pretty okay i had one hard crash that felt like it was similar to what would happen if you had a driver crash on nvidia but the system didn't recover from it at all like you would expect it to with a nvidia driver crash where the pop-up comes in the corner the the application force closes all that type of stuff it just black screened hard i had to hard power down my computer bring it back up and then event viewer just had nothing there was no information so i have no no idea what happened i maybe it was arc maybe it was something else i don't know the question then becomes how badly do you need gpu encoding in 2023 i guess this is a 350 graphics card and right now you can get an rtx 3060 for about the same price and the rx 6650 xt is cheaper at a little over 300 bucks and both of these cards have significantly better hardware encoding at least right now arcbos major av-1 performance which looks as of right now to be the future of encoding so that's great right and obs can encode it now right wrong obs has an nvic av1 encoder nvidia only intel's hardware av1 encoding is useless if you have no way to use it don't buy anything based on the claims of future benefits but all of that being said the challenge isn't over yet maybe there's some light at the end of this poorly encoded tunnel apparently intel has reached out to linus with a new driver that might fix vr so stay tuned for our final thoughts in part three and if you want to pick up an
