to the losers bracket where he then took on wesley so so in today's video i'm going to very quickly show you that match against see carl wesley couple of appetizer games because it already happened

went wesley attacked hikaru early with the italian and got a very pleasant position this has kind of been like this the the story in a lot of wesley and hikaru matches uh wesley puts a lot of pressure pressure on with white and he gets quite decent positions and you know he's pushing and he's pushing and he's pushing but hikaru fought back in a very very decent way but wesley continued the pressure and this first game was ridiculous wesley got a nearly perfect end game he's got a queen and a rook and five pawns versus hikaru who's really only got four because his b pawns are stuck together like this he just can't separate them which sometimes is nice you get two strawberries stuck together you get a giant strawberry he had two goldfish stuck together giant goldfish two pawns stuck together not tasty not very good and wesley slowly slowly got us down to as close to a winning queen end game as he could but hikaru had a defensive fortress and wesley was trying to break through trying and then he couldn't and then he couldn't and he decided all right it's time to repeat moves hikaru basically played this move offering a three move repetition but queen f3 wins and both guys were like what hikaru almost jumped out of his seat when he saw it the point is that a queen trade wins the game here why because white is playing a five on four black is down upon so you're just gonna go here f4 trade the pawns and you're slowly gonna win both guys just went for this end game and the first game ended in a draw and they play a best of two in the losers bracket they play less games and the the very next game the game began and it was over in 60 seconds hikaru played a berlin rather he played a spanish wesley played a berlin and hikaru played this variation where you force a draw with a queen repetition hikaru forced the draw in one minute because he wanted to play armageddon and then it was madness hikaru bid eight minutes and five seconds in the arm again he got eight minutes against 15. 15 minutes he's got eight minutes to he is down nearly half the clock that is ridiculous and wesley plays a new opening he doesn't play italian he doesn't play the spanish and very early we had a bit of a sideline from hikaru and wesley just got a pawn up position now kikaru spent this game blocking wesley from castling he was doing his best but he was worse he was worse throughout this game but look at the clock he was worse but he's no longer down seven minutes he's only down one and at 20 seconds right so he's getting the game back and closer than ever before but wesley once again gets an excellent position and is just cleanly up a pawn but wesley rushes he tries to get it into an end game and now hikaru is just down upon nothing to play for a minute down as well and it's armageddon so wesley's looking to play for a flag this man hikaru fights back for for like 30 moves wesley walks his king forward it looks like hikaru's busted but no no he's not down to two minutes versus three caru down to his last two minutes slides his queen to the eighth rank with queen e8 coming up wesley blunders and hikaru storms back with just one minute and 35 seconds on the clock to even the match on the board and on time and what ended up happening in this game is wesley resigned because he is in a losing bishop end game hikaru won a game down seven minutes on the clock he won he didn't draw that's how he got back to play against magnus insanity and so the match with magnus begins here we go hikaru lost to him once so he's gotta beat him in this match and that'll force a grand finale reset so magnus opens with an english and we get this which is essentially a queen's gambit declined now it is a queen's gambit declined hikaru plays dc e4 and now this line b5 a very exotic line where black is going to give away b5 and c4 but take the pawn on e4 and get a solid blockade or we're gonna get this and then i'm gonna take take that and black is just going to say look this pawn might die in the long run but i'm going to get nice light squared blockade and the computer has shown over time this is absolutely playable so queen c2 knight a5 and we see hikaru completely locking down the light squares but then magnus plays this absolutely absurd h4 this clearly is prep as you can see from time management you don't just play the move h4 you certainly don't play the move h5 allowing bishop a4 and you certainly don't just a couple moves later play king f1 clearly magnus did his homework yes he's thinking on his own but the idea here is that because black's exotic center approach doesn't actually pose any problems to this stronghold magnus can just get his king to safety like this and he's going to go for a very very computer-like idea h6 the point is you know if hikaru is castled this way this makes sense hg checkmate but he's not so what is the idea the idea is that we're gonna go here and in the long run in the end game these pawns are liabilities magnus is seeing a future where every piece is gone he's got one piece left maybe it's a beautiful horse with a long mane and beautiful tail and it's gonna gallop into g5 and feast because the black king is unable to stick around okay and that's the idea so now it's time to start trading pieces and activating our rook from the corner we take on c4 we take here check here come a couple of exchanges and now we're down to queens rooks night and it's a dominant advantage as the black king is completely stuck rook b4 queen a2 the opening experiment has not paid off magnus absolutely dominant a four minutes on the clock hikaru is done for there is absolutely nothing he can do right oh there's always something hikaru can do the second that you think that it's all over against hikaru like look at this position i mean right white is just gonna play rook f7 rook g7 knight h7 i could see it's game over nope because he's just gonna jump around he's gonna give a couple of checks and then he's gonna come back to c7 and it's like wait a minute now they're both below a minute what what but the problem is the position was too good it was too good to mess up rook b4 and the problem is that black's king is just on the back rank and you can lose that ball and you don't have to lose that bond by the way but he loses the pawn on e5 but the only remaining pawn that matters is this i mean it's such a problem for black to deal with and he could have played rook f8 but it just makes no difference white goes here preventing this that pawn survives the apocalypse and it's just gonna be the other pawn notice how it's the flank pawns it's the a h pawns in the middle and end game that matter the most like this because they restrict enemy piece play they create long-term problems and they are also just passers they are really difficult to stop marching up the board so knight g4 played knight f7 and magnus carlson takes game one of the grand final in a very nice fashion i told you in the long run the pieces would feast and feast they did a beautiful game very nicely done start to finish good control very unique idea with the h pawn and this just goes to show you that if you don't constantly play like wesley so constantly going for main lines hikaru played a very exotic line very exotic and he got punished and this is the thing about top level chess especially against guys like magnus carlson like you you uf around you find out i mean that's just how it works really that's just how it works all right you fudge around you find out i like to be more family friendly on youtube you know kids are going to learn to curse one day just not on this channel maybe on some other channels so magnus takes game one it's time for game number two hikaru's got the white pieces he goes for knight f3 and we have her ready and we have a reverse king's indian now we have knight c6 and c4 okay c4 is one of the approaches here magnus decides well you know i'm winning in the match so let me trade queens and create this this laser beam all right this is a mammoth pawn structure uh and hikaru is gonna try to advance on the queen side right so he's gonna play knight a3 and rook b1 and now he's gonna try to attack the structure magnus is like all right attack my structure do your worst all right because it's defended b3 knight c2 coming bishop b2 also something is going to travel to the center magnus plays king f7 he doesn't need to castle because it's the end game the king is completely safe and the rook is going to come to the d file to fight for central real estate bishop b2 here comes the rook one of the rooks he takes and now that hikaru is trying to go knight h6 it's time for uh knight g5 rather magnus plays h6 preventing that and we have knight d4 knight into e5 and this position looks really promising here you know because white is actually applying a lot of pressure if if magnus plays a little bit too slowly then the g6 pawn falls as well so he's got to uh he's got a strike right now he does because he's magnus knight g4 this pawn hangs that pawn hangs danger levels i hit the bishop i hit the knight you take my knight i take your bishop so the center falls apart knight c6 counter-attacking the rook and defending the bishop and the bishop now attacks the other bishop so we have takes takes the knight is kicked out and we get this end game two rooks in the night two rooks and a bishop but black is better black is better because of the pawn structure he has three three white has three one two all right c5 attacks tonight kicks it out and now we improve the structure but magnus is not really playing for like a like a win i mean he's just he's taking what you know what what comes to him but now this very nice idea f4 pawn takes f4 and magnus could take on h3 but instead he does this in a much more fancy way he sacrifices his rook i'm not yelling it because it's barely a sacrifice the point is that if king takes you have bishop f5 he wins it back immediately and magnus just taking care of business i mean honestly gets into a2 and hikaru's got to be a little careful here but magnus kind of threatens a rook trade hikaru comes down to c6 all the pawns are gonna fall off the board and there's there's not much here the players repeat move so hikaru can't break through with white so now he magnus is up one and a half to half and he just needs one more point out of two games so either he wins the next game with white or he makes two more draws i mean it seems like you know forgotten conclusion all right foregone conclusion that magnus is going to win this match and then something completely insane happens magna starts game three hikaru plays a sicilian this man is like i'm i'm going out on my sword right here sicilian let's go i'm looking for a night orf i'm not looking for an alapin you play knight f3 now we're gonna play a night or i want d4 let's go magnus magnus plays bishop b5 a little bit more positional now the critical line here to play for a win is knight d7 but the critical line here to play for a win with black and take massive risk is this that is not the most accurate move because white can damage your pawn structure and very quickly play d4 alright magnus decides though that he's going to play this in a very locked way all right uh i'm actually getting my thumbnail made for this video right now it's amazing i'm recording the video you're watching the video right now but when i'm recording it the thumbnail is still getting made isn't that amazing how that works a6 and magnus comes back to f1 this is the way you play if you don't need to win he's just like all right do your worst i'm gonna go c3 d4 take the center put my knight there after we trade get my bishop out hikaru plays the move g5 sacrificing the pawn completely in order to play rook g8 and launch a cannonball at magnus whoa g5 magnus responds the most principled way the best way to meet an attack on the edge of the board is to panic and lose all of your pieces that's how you would do it magnus though strikes back in the center an attack on the flank is met with an attack in the center you go g4 i'm not scared d5 you take my knight i take your night you can take on g2 but when i take it's when i take this it's check so you don't actually get my bishop so now we get this and this hikaru plays this and brings his rook forward and then locks the center with e5 magnus plays b4 and when i was looking at this game i was like it's ridiculous i mean magnus is still playing all the best moves and he's playing in a very typical magnesian way i mean he's just got a full lockdown positionally there is not there's just not much hikaru can do he's trying to trade bishops he's walking his king out of the center but it's like plus 1.3 white just has a dominant positional advantage now magnus here the whole time is trying to cool hikaru down like imagine you know you guys got like uh aggressive drunk friends all right that's kind of what's going on here you know one guy's like yeah let's go you're like yo calm down calm down you're gonna get us and try hey don't worry about him he's just you know he's just doing his thing magnus is like hey come on let's just trade knights let's get the knights and the bishops let's get everybody off your course like no b5 let's go i'm trying to fight throw some hands now the computer is sitting there like i'm not so convinced and now you don't have to take here all right you don't you don't have to take the computer trust to find all obscure ways magnus is like well if i take we're just gonna trade pieces so let's trade and trade and trade and now it's just queen rook for queen rook four two rooks ain't nothing hikaru can do here it was dangerous for a minute but not much he can do all right now magnus goes to the b file brooks are in rook comes back queen trade all right nice and easy king f6 rook b6 trading pawns three pawns down and yeah it was exciting for a little while but unfortunately uh it's just going to end in a it's just gonna end in a whoa wait a minute is it gonna end in a draw is hikaru better magnus only has eight seconds nah but i mean it's just rook in three versus rook in three i mean it can't really happen whoa actually hikaru is creating very big problems because he's got f5v4 this is hardly an asset for magnus if this was here they would make a draw but it can't move and it can't move and that can't move so what is going on here magnus decides wait a minute i'm just gonna have to chuck my pawn now he's down a pawn now magnus goes rook g4 rook d4 hole oh and you can't do this because king f4 king g3 and i win both pawns oh my god oh my god hikaru's gonna win a rook end game against magnus carlson with black hikaru is going to win the way magnus beats people we're in rook end games oh dear lord no but it's still a draw right wait a minute maybe it's not a draw maybe he's gonna walk his king around uh-oh uh oh he's gonna find a way or maybe he's not rook c3 rook c5 maybe it's still a draw and hikaru's time is ticking uh oh rook f2 and f4 oh no oh this might be it this might be the way forward king f7 rook a2 king f6 and suddenly here comes the king here comes the rook and here comes the king and that's it hikaru is going to win this game probably but how how is he gonna get in he probably needed to delay this a little bit but he still goes for f3 he can maybe try to walk his king in he plays f3 we have takes takes and now hikaru brings his rook back and now he needed to play rook f3 give a check and if magnus hangs out he slides the king in like this so the other alternative is to just give up the pawn and try to defend like this but hikaru goes the other way he goes the other way and now it's a draw what the point is the king needed to go down this way not to the other side why because if you do it this way the white king gets close and you lose your h pawn you can lose the pawn on h3 but the point is that now i am giving you endless checks you see in the other situation that i showed in this position the black king there are no endless checks if you try to run to the other side and give endless checks i freeze your king on the second rank and then your endless checks run out all right i will get in i'm gonna run my king down to the first rank and block with my rook but the way it happens in the game is that never happens the rook is not on the second rank so there is no shield there is no shield for the king the king is running desperately trying to avoid checks and magnus creates a fortress neither one of hikaru's pawns can cross this is disgusting this is horrifying two pawns up in a rook end game your king has no shelter he's running like a madman all over the board and he's getting checked and he's getting hunted and there's nothing that black can do the rook is stuck defending both pawns neither pawn can go forward this takes 132 moves and the players make a draw good lord hikaru almost had it in the damn bag so it's gonna come down to his last game with white he has to win this game to tie the match go to an armageddon potentially win the match and then send this to a grand final reset here we go he starts with the same opening as he did in game two only this time he doesn't play c4 he plays e4 but i'm certain he expected magnus to do the same thing in game two magnus did this and traded queens so it's kind of natural that in game four magnus does this and trades queens and he basically says you can't beat me it's a queenless middle game we have symmetrical pawns and i'm gonna play knight f6 and bishop g4 and i'm gonna just give you my bishop and then i'm gonna go here and like and like this and he's just like come on try and beat me let's go you i mean you got it right you play played into this opening you have to beat me to win this whole thing king g2 knight d7 and magnus trades the dark squared bishops takes takes so now we are in an end game i mean this is right around that very late middle game stage end game stage hikaru is going to try to put in the work he's gonna kick out the night magnus just takes the bishop completely symmetrical position a watch magnus go to work h4 white as stuck you either take and leave yourself an isolated h pawn in a permanent problem you either avoid that but then i take and then i attack this and if you go here dark squared equity for black so now black goes knight c5 the idea of knight c5 is to dance into the dark squares of the white position then i play f6 rock solid then i bring my rook to defend my position and bring my other rook back it did its job and i'm going down the center line takes takes now kikaru's like i don't know what to do i gotta play for a win so he sacrifices a pawn to split the pawns and create weaknesses here's the problem knight f7 holds everything and now black is going to start firing back and he's gonna start firing back with this outside pawn sacrifice a5 if you don't take i take and i'm walking in i can also just lock the position but if you take because you know you need to play for a win i come here and it's just i mean you have one pawn island two pawn island three pawn island and you're down upon and magnus walks in to a2 and now an amazing move g4 check oh my god it doesn't look possible but the point is you're deflecting my king away or this now knight g5 my pawn goes rook c2 and in this position after rook d3 he car offered to draw he offered a draw because it makes no difference a draw is a loss he could he could resign but he also didn't have to take any of that risk right the point is that in chess we have this kind of gentleman's agreement if you will uh ladies you're more than welcome to the agreeance antiquated terms i do apologize it's a it's this agreement that you know a draw is a loss so i'm gonna take a lot of risk and the game is not rated anyway so you know magnus could play this for a win but offering a draw just ends the match so magnus just accepts and he wins the air things masters he wins the champ the first event of the champions chest tour he wins thirty thousand dollars not too bad if i may say so myself um and he was just flawless i mean he was ridiculous today just just effortless with black took what came to him um but uh he almost let it slip he almost let it slip in that third game and you got to give credit to hikaru also playing through the family stuff that he's dealing with uh you know he had to travel right before the event and i mean that just takes ridiculous uh mental fortitude emotional fortitude and to fight back from the losers bracket i mean to be down seven minutes in an armageddon like hikaru and magnus are far and away the two best uh speed players in the world uh wesley so though i mean he is right there as the number three he is just inches away from being number three it is close um i i just said that hikaran magnus are far and away and then i just said wesley is yeah i'm i'm trying to hype everybody up but somehow i over i did a little bit of overlap there wesley's close but it's hikaru and magnus for sure uh and that's it folks that ends the coverage of the earth things masters i really hope you did enjoy it i've got some fun video content coming for you some opening content you know some some low elo content some other content and an announcement which will probably be in the next couple of days so yeah see you in the next video get out of here
