all right hey we're doing this we're doing this okay so what does your text editor say about you i think a lot of things but let's find out what they say i think what it says about me is i'm a pretentious douche but let's find out you read the title you know the drill to start this attempt at memes that proxy of cyber bullying we're going to go with the honda civic mcdonald's air force 1's death note rick and morty visual studio code vss code there's so many words in there that i'm not even sure i'm not even sure where where that even went i'm not even sure if that was bad or good i mean got that air force ones in there i want cube brain by the way how am i how am i supposed to get cube brain users exist on a spectrum and on this spectrum the most common type of vss code user you'll find is the junior dev fea code font with dracula mode six udemy courses purchased none completed hello world printed medium blog written sticker for macbook acquired when you grad i mean that was the one of the that was single-handedly one of the most accurate set of words i've ever heard said all at once like just that the shak it was shakespearean level that was a sh when you get dunked on so thoroughly and it was so beautiful because it all lines up with every with so much reality i've seen this it was fantastic this is great bro did not cook too hard bro cooked just right that thing came out medium rare and delicious graduate from this level of vs code user get your first job in the industry and eventually quit to become a tech youtuber 2 months later you've entered the realm of typescript tommy you sold a few courses and can finally afford to sit at a cafe open up that macbook and talk about how you became a digital nomad and posting it on twitter and your tweets mostly consist of and omg guys does anyone else coffee into code minimal setup doy keyboard late night programmer am i right does anyone this is this is actually like i didn't realize how shockingly accurate this is and i'm afraid about neovim coming up next i have never felt inside of me these things but but there is something dude i don't know what it is about the digital nomad but what is this trend i have seen it so often people just be like oh yeah i'm a digital i'm a digital nomad yeah yeah i write i write html but from a new from a new country every few weeks i don't know just seems interesting digital nomad does sound better than being homeless it is true it is true bros just summarized 80% of tech twitter dude he the thing is is that i don't think he realized how wide of a net he just cast but that that was about 80% of all programmers he just he just landed on right just there and now what are we going to do just now now we're going to just get made fun of with vim and emac i wonder if i wonder if eclipse users are going to make it in here what else now on the other side of vs code users are the people that i don't know actually like get done build software i mean someone's got to do it man the staff principal jedi engineers they've been through a vim linux i3 optimization phase and realized what's the point we're all going to die anyway they probably have three it's true it's true we are all going to die anyways you know i was actually just thinking literally this morning hear me out on this one i was just thinking this morning there's going to come a day when the doctor won't be streaming anymore you know what i mean i know doesn't it doesn't it kind of just like ruin your day you shut your mouth i know vibes well sorry it's not my fault this guy just went all philosophical on us it's friday man come on hey guess what guess what it's friday i hope you guys enjoy that vibes ruin yeah let me hey let me just just ruin all of your vibes extensions use terminal not iterm and have their file explorer on the right side of their screen navigate can i just take a moment here for a second if you have a file explorer open at all times i just have so many questions for you and really the only important one is why what are you doing with that file file tree what are you doing what what what are you looking at why do you got it open what are you doing what why do you need to see your files are you lost do you need a map you confused confused you know bro bro what happened if you need to like you know just like look around that code yeah yeah that does happen it does happen sometimes but man when i'm writing code like i don't look at my my files like when was the last time i don't even remember the last time i looked at my files just like to go peruse them he what are you doing today just looking at my files like the thing is is that it makes even less sense once your project gets big enough because at some point you have like 10 20,000 files in your project and you just you can't just go perusing just use harpoon telescope improve your life this is the moment of the day when linux audio quits working dude i okay i it's not linux it's actually not linux it's not linux's fault it is straight up this okay i i'm buying a new capture card right after right after this stream i'm buying a new capture card because this is just annoying this is the most annoying thing in the universe i have to do this way too often i don't know what is happening with this capture card it's not linux because i can hear it in my headset it the the audio goes through the capture card out the other bit into the monitor and the monitor can play sounds so it has nothing to do with that it has something to do with between the capture card and the usbc into the windows yes i use windows okay i use windows and i'm proud of it i'm literally the great i'm so good at this i'm so good at this we back we back we're so back use terminal not iterm file explorer on the right side of their screen navigating away from the vegan only safe space trigger warning cafe to your mom's basement let's discuss dude that was a based mom's basement right there okay what is this mom's basement whose mom's basement is this okay this ain't this ain't my mom's basement yo mama mention my mom my mom don't my mom don't got this look at that tv cath r she might have the catho ray tube she might have a catho ray tube though mom's basement let's disc the neo viers you know the thing is is that everything is so fun until you're the one getting made fun of okay okay so when this happens remember when i used to have this colored hair remember when i used to have when i remember when i used to have normal colored hair those are the those were days those are great days those are great days uh remember when i lost and i i and now then i lost remember when i was handsome yeah the good old days now look at me i i'm i'm a social justice warrior now neovim users immerse themselves in their computing experience they probably have a super villain looking ass split ortholinear keyboard they're probably okay it's not super villain esque okay but it it's it's it's a really nice keyboard that helps prevent rsi okay okay okay i don't what do you what do you mean super villain esque oh my goodness this guy i feeling so called out right now this is just please if he mentions system 76 i'm going i'm actually going to tear up i'm going to tear up running arch linux off of 2012 thinkpad and rarely using the gooey you click a file they cd you press download they can we just back up for a second and just appreciate just apprciate using the gooey you click a file just just the just the little things okay look at this we got rtfm i meant folder dude like this is funny you know when when you say the word folder oh my goodness it's just so good you will there's no greater way to trigger linux nerds than just saying the word folder you say folder windows user detected make folder make fold these nuts they cd you press download they pseudo pac-man ds you watch the anime they're reading the manga they're the same kind of people that get straight dude you is getting it get getting know up unhinged on pull requests and these neo viers they don't just experience computing they experience life anime joe rogan ross they experience everything but the outside world and basic personal hygiene maybe they're stuck in their mom's basement because if they go outside they'll meet i mean i'm not saying it's inaccurate but i do feel like you know you might have crossed a couple emac lines there okay a couple a couple emac lines joe rogan mentioned my personal life experience oh my goodness the priests of emac but quiet down you don't want to wake up the old folk it's way past their bedtime emac users had it easy great economy decent house prices college was cheap jobs were plentiful racism and misogyny was normal get can e a dick i'm on ftp baby ibm model i just i heard so many words all at the exact same times that i i'm not even sure i'm not even sure how to process all those words at the same time the get can eat a dick one i swear it said can i need a dick but you know i don't know a get can eat a dick i'm on ftp i know this is this this actually is the best engineering video of the year and what is with why do people love these ibm keyboards can someone explain to me why people love these ibm keyboards what is this like what was the draw here is this like ducky before ducky and this and and and people just loved loud and easy to clean tactile thonk better than mechanical better than mechanical ibm keyboard was sturdy and nice clicky sounds i i never i i i think i may have had one growing up i can't even remember childhood memories impossible to break okay okay nostalgia it's the good old times yeah keyboard crt monitor richard i can't believe he's included multiple pictures of me this is getting kind of annoying getting made fun of this many times in a single video okay crt monitor richard stalman is right about everything yes those things too to use emx all you really need installment is right about everything yes dutch pedophiles have formed a political party to campaign for legislation i'm skeptical of the claim that voluntary pedophile harms children wait i i feel like before i completely think this guy is a crazy guy i would first need to actually read the entirety of that statement and and and know for a fact he actually said that but based on what i'm looking at i would only need to know i'd only really have to say one thing which is bro what the are you talking about what what are you talking about he did damn stalman ruined for me damn oh no average libertarian i don't know about that those things too to use emex all you really need to do is sacrifice your pinky and it's well worth it too emac has everything email music player calendar pong it's a whole ass operating system it's only a shame it didn't ship with a decent text edex editor oh brother this guy stinks now for the following segment i know these products aren't technically editors i am very happy that he he did he did do that that that was very good that was very good this is an old joke i did like i like the emac se i'm actually extremely disappointed by that that one phrase by the way i don't know if you guys know this but are what my pressing our very own emac priest pick i don't know if you saw this our very own emx priest over here he might have just switched to neovim yeah neil dude neil vi supremacy is happening he finally getting a job can't dick around with lisp and hasal for too long finally time to just get a real [laughter] job pearl clutch your pearls we got something going oh my gosh look we put a man on the moon ides are just the moon landing of text editors you really think we made progress as a society with that one and honestly did it even happen and anyway we're going to be talking about the average software engineer the jet brains boy mostly right is that the average i kind of feel like the jet brains boy is not the average i mean i don't like the fact that go's getting tossed in on the okay i don't like that okay i think go go is a is is a wonderfully simple language i feel like vs code is the average and the average is a bunch of soy devs in coffee shops sitting get currently getting chicken neck getting shrimp posture fting java or go doesn't really know doesn't really care probably has a great social life parents were supportive had hobbies wore ralph lauren growing up they wanted to be an investment banker or product manager but settled for writing garbage code without unit tests the archetypal tech bro let's go to the other ide users the visual studio gang this has two sides of a coin flip it once you get the indie game dev crowd they've been working on the next minecraft for the past decade fully funded kickstarter or entirely broke doesn't matter they haven't released a game either way no original thought that is that oh o oh can can we just take a moment and pour one out pour pour pour one out for the indie game def that hasn't released a game yet that's me that was savaged wrecked absolutely destroyed it hurts it hurts the anti thor it is the anti thor you know i mean if we're going to be real here is it much different than me do i ever actually finish or release anything i don't even know if that's true thoughts or artistic decisions mostly rdit opinions and replying to him on reddit is our other visual studio bro exclusively uses microsoft flavor java yo bisco yo bisco bisco where you at and will defend that technology to his grave even though it's the only one he's worked with tucked in dress shirt khakis and these boots for some reason dad bods are in bro first off those khakis were not pleaded okay best editor best editor i of course you're of course you're going to say that okay those were not pleaded khakis i feel like the the official one is pleed khakis oh you don't even know worked at the corporate since college and it's cool startup life isn't for him the 401k is match the decently sized middle class home somewhere in idaho braziller india is a qui brazil menion oh my goodness love it i love i love i love brazil i love brazil what's wrong about all this actually all those things were fantastic i mean that's like those are all great by the way i don't know if you know this unironically i am going to brazil turo is absolutely flying me out to brazil we're going boys we're going to brazil i'm going to brazil okay damn chicken tiki masala look good in that previous picture yeah i'm very excited about the send pictures yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah very excited about that it's pronounced brasil okay i'm sorry i didn't use the endon name endon uh when may may 7th or something like that chick dick masala let's go now it's time for the honorable mentions nano because you're too afraid to use vim on your aws instance eclipse and net beans you went to college in the 2000s and dressed something like this this actually might be the single most accurate part of this entire video this is this is shockingly accurate because um not only did i probably dress like that i used net beans in 2005 and 2006 when i went to college i totally dressed that that could have been me i may have just got done listening to the transplants 2000s and dressed something like this sublime text in adom vss code before vs code you're can we just take a second here and just appreciate that that sublime is the only text editor that just keeps on going and still asking everybody for the $15 or whatever it is and still everybody closes that window over and over and over and over again sublime 4 is out you know that right sublime 4 is somehow the win raar model the win rar model they went with the they went with the they saw the massive success that was winrar and decided that they wanted to follow suit and now look we got sublime version 4 before vs code you're still in high school and muted aiden's stream to watch this apologies if i haven't offended you and your editor wasn't here i'll be sure to do better thank you for your time i am big boox by the way if you're not subscribed to big box you're a loser so go press that subscribe button go press that like button this guy is great i like big box this is my second video i've watched from him and both of them were such w's you know but at okay so i'm i'm going to just we're g we're gonna i gota at least say a little something about editors here's my only thing i'm going to say in a real tone i know we just got done watching a very non-real tone video when i was in the 2005's going to college right here this guy when i was this guy i uh i didn't know anything about my environment i didn't take the time to learn anything i used my ide as a method to avoid things and so just thrown this out there that no matter what you're using try to take a little bit of time and learn how things work i'll tell you i'll tell you this much man the amount of the amount of just things have made my life easier learning a few core hles so good so dang good and they're for free they're just there they're just there they're just hanging out and all you got to do is just use them jq jq is so useful the amount of time i've saved on jq had to be i i' i'm in the tens of hours in the last two weeks saved just because i had jq parallel oh i've done so many paralleling parallel is so good it's just hard g new par parallel is crazy powerful yeah it's just so good anyways anyone used the atmail studio in 2000s i did use uh the air workbench that was uh that was one one of the weird ones that was a weird one i don't think a lot of people know about uh that was just for embedded systems um anyways yeah of course i'm going to i i don't know if i'll continue today but i am going to continue things uh hey i appreciate that good video everyone follow him i is so expensive yeah it it is so expensive i did use it though the name i've used a lot of editors
