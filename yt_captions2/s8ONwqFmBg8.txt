ladies and gentlemen whether you are a new fan of chess or one that has been around for many years you should be well aware of the fact that basically every single day in the chess world there is a new story every day every week every month every year in the world of chess there are memes and there are dreams and it's currently may 2024 and the memes are very very strong we got some more of them delivered by first class mail yesterday in the form of magnus carlson best player in the world playing 11 out of 11 games of the chess.com title tuesday tournament by playing the a4 rook a3 opening better known as the band gambit better known as the v so opening and if you don't know what i'm talking about in a very very brief synopsis over the past week a grandmaster account was banned on ch.com after extremely good results in an extremely dubious opening that idual then took to reddit and twitter to talk about the fact that uh first of all revealing who they are which is grandmaster brandon jacobson and saying he didn't cheat and that is currently the story did he cheat did he not cheat i'm not so sure but what i am sure about is everybody is playing this absolutely idiotic opening now and uh yeah we're going to see how magnus carlson did it i actually played a little bit of this myself of course the opening that i am talking about is playing a4 rook a3 and promptly losing your rook that is is that is the opening all right now mr vu aka brandon jacobson reached 3140 3150 defeating nit defeating other players uh in in in overall very very good results what would happen if magnus carlson best player in the world tried this opening himself now i'm going to take you through his tournament because he did this against 2500 2600 2500 2800 grandmaster 2800 grandmaster then we get up to the 2900s my boy was playing this against some real really really really good people let's see how he did now game number one he plays an international master who does not take the bait all right he doesn't take the bait he kind of just develops his pieces and says you know what i don't want to get embarrassed by magnus because i will anyway so at least i want to put up a good fight now meanwhile magnus just left the rook there and i mean this kind of shows the meta strategy of what to do if they don't take the rook magnus puts his bishops on the corners by the way this is just completely a free pawn i have no idea what his idea was here maybe it was to play queen c1 or queen c2 and the thing is if you don't take the advantage that magnus is going to give you well he's going to i love how the rook is just standing there like he's going to outplay you over time so you might as well try to play magnus with an advantage now to black's credit black got a great position and i think because magnus was in full-on meme mode he wasn't really trying his hardest i mean as you can tell uh his opponent here finally decides to go for a tactic which is giving up his rook to take another pawn and now he's going to attack both of these rooks at the same time but he forgot that he was playing the literal goat so after queen a2 takes takes takes takes magnus has a bishop and a knight for a rook which is very good black has two extra pawns but it's probably not going to work knight takes f7 is a beautiful dynamite strike black blunders you take the knight i take the bishop now it's two bishops for a rook and this is a completely winning position and magnus cleans it up immediately goes to his favorite phase of the game which is the end game all he needs is a couple of bishops and a couple of ps pawns he wins the pawn he he wins all of that and and now the pawns are just going it's a red carpet look at this look at that security escort to the end of the board beautiful stuff he goes g6 g7 this disconnects the pieces and uh he won this game by two minutes and a completely dominant performance but his opponent did not take his rook so we can't really evaluate what happened here well what what about this game well in the first few games his opponents were just not interested in the memes which is really disrespectful i mean we have never lived in an era where the best chess player in the world logs on for nonsense blitz games and plays a5 rook a6 i mean gary kasparov would never all right fisher didn't know what the internet was all right i mean like these people the internet didn't exist in 1972 right i don't i don't think it did i'm just kidding i i i'm kidding all right i obviously it did g6 right and white just plays a normal catalan and yes some of magnus's opponents were just not letting him have any fun i mean he had to leave the rook there and then he was like you know what i just got to beat you normally fork and you know he's just uper rook for a night he's magnus freak and carlson he doesn't get checkmated he trades the pieces he goes to his favorite phase of the of the game which is the end game and you know in this game it took him down to some pieces but he won the bishop and he won the game but some of his opponents certainly wanted to participate in the memes they wanted to participate how is magnus going to handle this opening i mean brandon freaking jakc son beats daniel nitzki 40 to 29 he beat darus schweer 16 to4 i mean what did he just reinvent chess is this like the greatest opening i got to tell you i played this opening myself i won some nice games now it's the thing is losing a corner rook for a bishop is not such a crazy disadvantage in a thre minute game with zc bonus time but this opening sucks on a high depth of stockfish it's like an evaluation of 2 and a half to three but the thing is most people are human most some of you are cyborgs and npcs but most of us are human and you know this is not the easiest position to handle especially when you don't play it the proper way you see black white is just sort of taking a weird setup and by the way for the record for the record magnus plays this his own way magnus doesn't take instruction for anybody you learn openings when magnus plays them he doesn't play them based on what anybody else says you know in technically you're supposed to play this opening by doing this that's what you're supposed to do and then this and then this and magnus says i'm i'm going to play this opening however i want i want to take the center all right i want to take the center e5 knight d7 rook b1 and suddenly from the opening there is almost no advantage whatsoever and then here magnus has queen h4 check he doesn't see it doesn't play queen h4 um queen h4 is not winning a piece but it it is winning a very important pawn so magnus would be winning another pawn and now he has only a onepoint material disadvantage he's actually better cuz he's going to put his knight on c4 uh but you know the goat misses a fork because you know he's in meme mode but already from the opening he takes on g1 you enter a tactical sequence and bishop to a6 is on the way and he is just going to he's just going to win this game so what went wrong in this game is his opponent played in a very silly way i mean his opponent kind of didn't put the knight on the most natural square and then tangled up the center and then like i mean rook b1 i i can't even explain this move i i i don't even you know and then magnus just kind of wrecked the center castled and his opponent tried to get into a fight with him it didn't work now he's pinned queen h4 queen h5 white's position is completely falling apart look at that queen b5 and uh you know he's just he's just going to clean things up rook c8 he he could have played a little bit better but as always he goes to his favorite phase of the game it's an end game whites king is out in the open and and uh he's going to lose all his pieces and there we go b2 b1 you can't stop it run from it try to hide you can't b1 is mate and he won okay but he's beating people who he is 700 think about that magnus is 3230 his opponent is 253 700 points bro you get to a point on shell.com you beat somebody you lose rating you ever seen like those things like if magnus beats his opponent here he gains one point i'm not even did he gain point for this game i don't think he did like if i refresh did magnus gain one rating point he didn't gain a rating point did he gain a rating point for winning this game the versus the 2600 he did he gained one you saw that he gained one rating point did he even gain one in this game yo that's nuts he didn't he he doesn't even gain a rate bro imagine being so high rated compared to somebody else they don't even give you a rating point oh my god that's crazy okay now this game he's playing a polish grandmaster right polish grandmaster says i am not taking your rook notice how the other people didn't even have this option like this person played a catalan like he didn't have the option to take this person also didn't play that yo they're too scar they're not even taking like that's how afraid they are right so now c4 he he put a pawn to block his bishop this opening you know you're going to you're going you're going to get people who are just so unwilling to participate in their own potential embarrassment which you know for the record is like that's hard to do you just saw the roast of tom brady like it's not easy to volunteer for stuff like that h4 h6 and in this game his opponent just play very principal just said okay push push magnus just unrelenting dude unrelenting and at this point white's like i have to take because i have nothing so he takes and then he goes to an end game so he thinks i got to b for a rook it makes sense to win the end game but he's playing the best endgame player of all time i mean it doesn't matter you know what i'm saying like seven pawns for black only six for white black is uh black is down all right black is down a point of material it is a rook for a bishop and a pawn but it's really difficult here you know it's really difficult to make progress rook d2 he trades knights to try to make progress into the white position and he just blocks and then he plays a4 controlling the light squares and then he wins another pawn his opponent blunders the pawn on g2 bishop comes back to e4 g 5 nice little counterplay not necessary he could have just played knight c6 but he's trying to play quickly put the pressure the best move here is rook e one which his opponent finds now magnus goes here looking for complications and all of a sudden he might be in serious trouble so suddenly we have the early stages of what happens when this opening backfires this opening is not like the second uh is not like the second version of chess this opening sucks it's really difficult to play in a material disadvantage for that long pawn takes pawn takes rook d7 now you got to do magnus magic the king walks i mean what like bro bro just walks his king out bro thinks he's a he's walking his king for real pawn takes bishop takes he's just losing knight c6 but you know it's it's nerve-wracking to to to get into a winning position against magnus so white is now down to less than 20 seconds king goes back to f5 how are you going to attack the king it it doesn't work rook f2 rook f7 i mean it looks like maybe you're going to win something nope he defends himself and now white is met with some very serious resistance magnus has two pass it's just a draw it's a draw all the material imbalance it's just a draw but white is going to get under 10 seconds oh but now it's definitely a draw i mean it's kind of crazy he didn't take this here right this is just a draw so now i mean if you're playing with white here you could just you trade the rook you just you trade everything you just sacrifice and uh you just make a draw but he's trying to win he's not trying to make a draw he's got the two rooks trying to trying to win the game but ironically so is magnus somehow and he wins so magnus wins this game and a ridiculous time scramble and this is game over because you just make a queen okay but in that game in mag you know he had to work some serious magic no pun intended and at some point his luck would start running out in this game magnus played this opening against a very talented young player who ultimately did make the very difficult decision of capturing his rook and now magnus plays the vu london so magnus plays a london system but is down a rook for a bishop i mean you talk about the uga london this is the uga london bro is just straight he's playing a london but there's no rook and there's no dark squ bishop for black crazy play bishop b3 just plays like normal now he brings the knight back to b1 bishop g5 and now he plays this move to try to damage the pawns uh his opponent is i believe one of the youngest grand masters in the world right now ehor uh uh snov from uh ukraine bishop f4 g5 bishop g3 knight c knight to e4 and from the opening i mean magnus just got a dream position bishop for rook right or at this point it's knight for rook but ultimately in the beginning it's bishop for rook and he completely controls the position and it's very difficult for black to break through probably at this point it's just a draw like there's really not much that can be done you know maybe black is going to make some sort of breakthrough uh because the person that controls the pawn breaks ultimately controls the game but it's actually magnus trying to make a breakthrough because he's magnus he plays every single game on the mode that he's probably going to win queen e2 here he could have played rook b3 but then he would have lost his a pawn he keeps poking he keeps prodding and uh they get into a tactical skirmish knight d6 and it's it's very complicated but ultimately even though magnus is able to pick up some pawns he's down a rook i may i remind you he lost a rook on the fifth move of the game and some 30 moves later he's really going to feel it he's going to feel that he's down a rook in this game that rook comes back to bite him in the you know what rook a2 bishop b7 and that's mate so you either have to trade the queens now and suffer magnus goes here but somehow there is no checkmate and unfortunately he has to make a draw or fortunately but he saves the game he does not get mated uh mr snov second youngest grandmaster maybe third youngest grandmaster in the world right now threatening a checkmate with the rook by the way that he was presented he was given the rook uh yeah now uh and magnus does have to force a draw but he i mean he's drawing right the other thing to remember is this is titled tuesday brandon was playing this in three minute chess this is three plus one so from this position white wins 100% of the games if there is no bonus time unless you're playing them but in magnus's case magnus would win 100 out of 100 games from this position with white if there was no bonus time but because it's title tuesday there's bonus time so beating your opponent who's very young as well very fast probably not possible and so this game ultimately ends in a draw but there was more i mean this man was doing this relentlessly here's a game against the very strong polish grand master casper pan uh this was uh again magnus playing it in some very unique way uh and uh you i mean bro straight up just gave up a rook and played knight a3 knight c4 knight d2 he did a knight carousel like marryg go round and then he played g3 bishop g2 and i mean i mean his position is awful i mean on a high dep this is probably some minus five like this is is a terrible position the amount of odds that magnus is giving his opponents here is is is disgusting it is disrespectful beyond belief pon i saw somebody on twitter they they wrote something like imagine i mean it's your it's your one chance to play the best player in the world and he's doing this to you and it's like sucks the sucks sounds like a skill issue to me knight e4 bishop e4 castles i mean white is down in exchange black has the center black has the activity black has literally everything sometimes you say in chess i'm down material but i have compensation like i'm comp compensating for it right in this position black has the compensation and the material okay queen d5 queen d2 r i mean black is doing everything perfectly now what you do here with black you play knight to e5 you trade a bunch of pieces you win the game yeah because if knight d4 you lose the bishop if knight e5 you take the bishop knight d3 you play bishop e4 you take i mean like you just you just chop everything down maybe the knight goes to f4 you play some queen f5 queen i don't know but but you slowly win the game casper just has to you know he plays h fine h3 queen c5 okay he's looking for his spot rook c1 he's completely winning he needs to play knight e5 at some point hesitating a little bit h4 a5 okay he's restricting magnus but he's not he's not doing anything he's not doing anything right bishop f1 okay and now magnus starts coming backwards so it becomes a little bit harder to trade now magnus tries to tr by the way knight a2 is a w it's a rep i mean the position is losing takes takes f6 okay now the knight is coming alive and you know maybe magnus oh oh sacrificing a knight now you do the math white is just down a full rook he's down a full rook absolutely nothing to show here rook to h7 kicks out the queen now let me attack i mean magnus is you count the pieces magnus down a rook he's down three points of material he has two extra ps but he's down a freaking rook in case it's not clear he's down a rook queen c3 knight f5 bishop a3 queen d5 but but he's making it difficult now here knight g3 just wins the game easier said than done he plays knight d4 and he blunders that after queen d4 take after the big trade after take take take take take take there is bishop f5 which is a fork otherwise he would just be winning he would just have two rooks i mean he would just clean oh no oh no so he doesn't blunder the fork but he blunders this position and now magnus is just down a bishop for a rook and he's oh god he's in the end game okay but at least at least this one's just going to end in a draw there's nothing that yeah i mean very simply you're going to trade just just like going to trade the pieces and oh no no magnus is working his magic no no no no no oh oh he blunders everything king d5 and all of a sudden he's not winning anymore rook f oh you had to play rook h5 you had to do it in the other order but you do it this way and and now you lose because oh man okay magnus was dead lost this entire game i mean how good is this opening now granted magnus is not playing it in the meta way right he's not playing he's not playing it like uh like the right way which is this way he's playing it his own way and you cannot lose more time you know black just get got a completely dominating position oh but magnus still got it done now here's the game against a 2940 this person doesn't have as high of a title as the previous player but this is clearly a player that will get the grandmaster title in the future and this player plays uh the principled way he plays like e5 and again magnus doesn't understand the theory of this opening is not playing the opening the way it is supposed to be played which is fening the bishops you know dedicated to the cause of doing it his own way f6 bishop d7 and he is still down a rook for a bishop it is just unbelievable a4 all right b3 solid stuff rook c1 queen e6 oh wow look at that no queen for magnus okay because in the last game he was trying to get some counterplay white says no queens knight d5 let's trade some pieces i come into your position you play defense white is just much better the imbalance remains rook vers versus bishop no difference of pawns rook e one which apparently is a very bad move but king f7 and now magnus begins pushing his pawns forward instead of leaving the position uh i don't know why he didn't double after knight takes c2 you trade the rooks right and then if king if king f7 you play rook c8 and um maybe he was worried about losing these pawns but magnus is going to lose all his pawns too going to lose all his pawns so instead i mean i'm one i'm not saying i would have found it i'm just saying that was the best move now magnus meanwhile dancing does by the way doesn't take a draw look he had a chance to repeat moves he could have repeated doesn't make the draw and now starts trying to take over the game despite being down material he's still down material he's much worse it's still plus two g4 but suddenly the bishops are coming alive uhoh oh uhoh white's got a lot of weaknesses and he's got 30 seconds to figure them all out oh no he's taking over the game again oh white is parall he can't move he can't move look at this he just can't move anything and bishop is coming to a6 oh my or f5 oh my oh no oh and now it is over look at ian he just he can't move a single piece he just can't move and he resigns so magnus is beating these people in that middle to end game phase where for the best player in the world this level of imbalance is meaningless in blitz games in blitz games in a 90-minute game it might be a different story that would be absolutely fascinating to see the amount of odds he would need now magnus did lose a game i will show you that game he got very close to losing several games he got very close to losing the game that i just showed you against porun got very close to losing this game this game was nuts i cannot believe he did not lose this game this is against idis gell turkish grandmaster who's uh one of the youngest in the world right now i think he's like 15 um and as you see in this game white took the rook because this opening is garbage uh even though i you know myself have had some success with it it is completely ridiculous the way i'm beating my opponents it's by like tricking them yeah and i mean as you see here edis just plays straight down the pipe i mean really just straight down the board marches into the the black position magnus is forced to go to an end game and uh white actually lost some advantage but then regained it back rook a1 bishop a1 now he picks up this pawn and it's over i mean he has a pass c pawn and a rook for a knight like this is like the game is finished absolutely finished king e7 c5 you might have wanted to start with knight a4 just be patient but okay c5 knight goes to c4 rook a3 and he's just going to win the game and here idis says bro take the pawn take it i'm going to feast on these pawns you're going to lose magnus plays king c5 knight to e3 and in this position he finds one of the craziest defensive sequences i've ever seen this is so absurd so the knight is guarding the pawn rook can't take it right and but the knight is hanging so what do you do well you move this knight to c6 okay but the rook is just going to move along the seventh rank like the rook is going to go there and the kn is still hanging yeah but then this knight jumps back again and then you cover your king with the other knight you you play you play knight to c6 defending this knight which guards the pawn and somehow the rook is trapped no but i mean this is like witchcraft i mean this is i don't know how he does this to people this is and now he won't lose a single pawn he creates a complete barrier and he won't lose anything now and and and this rook is in jail the rook is trapped in the jail i no but this is i mean this is so sick this is so sick and and now he might even play for a win he's just not even okay he lets the rook out but now he goes in with the knights he can win a pawn here with knight to e2 but it's too dangerous if you if you take on f4 rook a7 knight g5 and uh it's probably bad news so so magnus actually just ends up forcing a draw here i don't think he wanted to like i think if it was up to him he would have played this for a win he was under a lot of pressure here white m handles the end game he doesn't lose again but magnus did lose one game he did lose one game and it was against the uh lithuanian grandmas uh p nisus and uh let's see how it happened e a4 all right we have all the stuff right and lo and behold this man plays the right setup he plays the right setup the same setup that mr v su himself was using but then instead of playing e3 knight e2 he plays knight f3 which we have seen is the technically incorrect approach the meta seems to be that you need to put your pieces like this uh from uh the uh very famous 69 game match between one daniel nitzki and brandon jacobson knight f3 the reason this is bad is white loses time knight to e5 and now you're going to go c5 now here magnus plays b4 to not allow black to play c5 so black plays a5 and then c5 anyway and he's basically just winning time and this just can't work uh this can't work uh because you're just opening up a lot of lines and black plays bishop d7 white does implement the correct game plan right he does implement this game plan but what the difference between this game and some of the other games is that ptinus did not sit around waiting for magnus to lose he did not shuffle the pieces he just went after magnus he was like look i got you know i got to go out with a bang i'm going to go out with a bang h3 rook b8 taking the open file bishop c3 attacking the weakened pawn he says go ahead and take it go ahead and take it take the pawn you can't really because then i'm want to play h4 if you take i got different attacking ideas over here i mean i'm not going to sack right away it looks extremely dangerous actually what if i do sack right away my original thought was that the rook could just move away but after queen h2 and here you might even have e3 i mean this looks awful awful very very very bad so yeah that's what happens i mean he he hesitates now magnus has to start playing a little bit of defense but in this game unlike the other games here his opponent was unafraid i mean he just sort of walked him down the board played knight to h5 knight b1 he took you can't really take cuz the knight is going to take and i mean we we seeing magnus he's the one down 40 seconds now e3 shuts the door this is a worst nightmare of this opening i mean magnus has been able to trick and kind of duck and weave and get out of the way but oh my ptin nisus shut the whole thing down i mean he got the rook he got the rook he got the clamp and uh all of the kind of issues of this opening get exposed in this game as black shuts down the entire center and hits him from every angle i mean it is it is a bludgeoning now again if magnus did this on equal terms it would have been extremely impressive but he did play probably the worst opening known to humans uh and uh his opponent punished him for it because and still magnus was you know threatening a checkmate it didn't quite work uh and now a gangster promotion to a knight that's actually i think the best move by the way this is the fastest checkmate because because it forces a reaction and then when you take i actually will not take back i will play queen c2 queen d1 and then it's mate momentarily so c1 knight very nice conversion and uh and magnus loses to uh mr ptin evisus overall magnus ended this title tuesday with uh a score of nine with eight and a half i think he drew three games and he lost one w so he had eight and uh no no no no no no no let me calculate let me calculate the last game that he played was against i think it was climos which is the game that i showed you i will calculate it i think it was nine points but i might be wrong so he he won one he drew he drew three and he lost he lost one so not bad drew three lost one which means he won seven so eight and a half eight and a half points playing this opening which you know which which led him to lose uh a lot of points it led him to lose like 30 rating points so his performance was probably something like 2,900 3,000 with this opening uh granted the time control was 3-1 if he was playing these games in in a in a different uh in a different uh format maybe he would have he would have won some of these games but that is the report now i might give you my report as well uh i have played this opening a little bit just for the memes and the dreams uh but that is how magnus did with this opening and we will continue to follow the storyline uh brandon jacobson has since posted again he's also saying that he was going to post uh on another social media platform we'll see if chess.com puts out a brandon jacobson report i have absolutely no idea what to expect i am eagerly awaiting the next updates i love the chess world because my god we cannot get out of our own way it is incredible stuff uh that's all i have for you today get out of here
