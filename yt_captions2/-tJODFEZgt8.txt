ladies and gentlemen this is going to be one of the strangest youtube videos i ever have to record this is not a youtuber apology video but it almost feels like one uh i'm going to just break the bad news to you now and then for about 10 or 15 minutes i'm going to talk about what this means for the big picture of chess in the future let's pull the band-aid right off for the last year plus if not year and a half a massive match was being planned between magnus carlson and hikaru nakamura the goal of this match was not just to pair two of the best speed players in the case of magnus arguably the goat in all formats against each other the goal was to take the next big step for chess internationally it was an event that has been scheduled moved and finally had an agreed upon date an agreed upon format which we will get into and it was supposed to happen november 26 roughly to december 3rd of 2023 as of october 6th which is today the event has been cancelled and this is painful for a variety of reasons this is a pretty raw reaction i have found out the news just i don't even know an hour plus two maybe two hours ag i don't know um and we're going to talk about what this means what this means for the future but i don't think all hope is lost none of you even knew that this event was being planned in fact after i guess the news broke internally uh hikaro made a video about it and this event according to his stream was going to happen at the ufc apex so they were going to put the event on magnus versus hikaru with chess boxing in the middle at the ufc apex in las vegas can you imagine incredible stuff uh this event was going to be a type of format called fast classical chess i have hikaro muted because it's just a very loud hype trailer it's a very nice trailer put together by his team uh this was supposed to be the format it was going to be 45 minute chess with a 15-second increment they were going to play 12 games standard and fisher random so they were going to play chess 9lx or chess 960 which is when all the pieces are scattered and they were going to play regular chess and the the format was going to be 45 minutes so not rapping in blitz like karo frequently does give magnus really intense fights in it and not 90-minute chess where magnus has had a good record against hearo it was going to be something in the middle uh and listen i got to tell you the uh the prizes for this thing were uh were substantial i think they come up here on the screen in a moment as hikaru tells you the rules of fisher random chess and the prize was uh quite something 400 that's that's a bad still image let me go back okay the prize was $400,000 for the winner $200,000 for the loser and the prize was going to be split uh by win percentage after that so if you won the match 6 and a half out of 12 you would win $400,000 if you lost you would get 200,000 and the remaining $400,000 it was a $1 million prize fund was going to be split up uh based on your win percentage this was a massive match and originally the plan as hearu stated uh when he went live to announce this was also to include chessboxing chess boxing happened last year it was a massive sensation that lewick put on with mogul moves it had average live viewership of 300 plus thousand throughout i was ready to commentate it i had a contract basically ready signed and ready to go to be the main commentator uh for this event for the match and also for chess boxing i had custom suits coming in i mean i was i wasn't a participant but i really do feel like along with the chess.com and even the players uh a part of me you know a part of me died a little bit when i when i found out the news today um let's talk about what this match would have meant yes it would have been a spectacle for you right you would have gotten to see hikaru the probably the only man on the planet that has challenge magnus in any way shape or form in recent years versus magnus who is the man right we we look at him to win basically every event they are far and away the two most popular chess players internationally you know like vishwanathan anand is spectacularly popular in india in particular like you can't take anything away from vishy but just i think on an international current competitive level it's hikaru and magnus and i think it's difficult to combat that furthermore this event in my opinion was going to potentially be the next chess boom it was going to be in las vegas at the ufc apex media would have been there such as espn various sports media and there was potential to create so much behind the scenes footage i know for a fact like danny wrench has traveled to florida to record with with hikaru they were filming magnus and hikaru interviews for this event last year in norway chess i mean it's it's been years they have been preparing so much content and maybe it will still be put on the event seemingly has been cancelled as of october 6th which is today because of issues with the venue i guess yes insurance something something did not go through you might remember about a week ago our favorite youtuber lwig said this mistake cost me $100,000 chess boxing is dead that was eight days ago uh i can tell you with knowledge you know i i i know obviously some behind the scenes stuff i can tell you certain thing like it was still going to go on organizing an event where people who who have zero boxing experience come to a state get in a ring half naked and punch each other while also playing chess that takes a whole lot more insurance and sanctioning to organize getting two dudes who know how to move little wooden figurines really well does not take a whole lot of insurance but getting the whole event organized with production with security with ticketing something something went wrong i don't know what went wrong i don't know what went wrong um i'm not in those discussions i am not i'm not an employee of chess.com i am a content creator and i play on their website exclusively um this was going to be a monumental moment for chess in many ways however i don't think this is the end and i think this is worth having a bigger picture conversation about chess some of you might not be interested in this some of you want me to scream the rook seven times in a video make a couple of jokes and show you some cool mag magnus game or 200 elo chess but we need to talk about chess big picture because it's important for the development of you as a consumer of this content and maybe of paid courses or whatever in this world and for the best players in the world who you want to make a living and the first question is why has chess never become commercially viable let's take a step back 99% of you who are watching this video right now were not into chess before 2020 99% about one maybe maybe 2% of you watch chess a lot before 2020 but most of you did not you might have known about the game but you weren't actively participating because we've had multiple explosions the queen's gambit the cheating scandal short form content which exploded in early 2023 i can tell you my youtube channel had 200 plus million views my total content had 300 million views in the month of january of this year short form content exploded off the map it was the biggest thing any of us could have ever imagined but why is chess not as commercially viable as literally any of your other favorite sports where are all the major sponsors where are the watch companies where are the car companies where are the telecom companies why doesn't the speed chess championship have a bunch of things plastered this was the opportunity for the match this is the opportunity for all top level players to get into this beautiful chess boom let me give you a secret top level chess the 20 30 best players in the world have not gotten i think even a fraction of the growth that social media various chess content creators have gotten over the last several years i am a good enough chess player to kind of bridge the gap between top level chess and layman 200 elo that's why my channel has grown so much my channel has grown so much because of you that that number that you see subscribers and view that's you you like to tune in to this channel to listen to me talk about top level chess to listen to me talk about low-l chess ai chess chess drama whatever it might be some of you watch my videos and complain that's fine i you know you might be struggling in life this might be your outlet and i wish you nothing but the best some of you actually do have meaningful constructive criticism which i ignore um that's a joke i have taken much criticism over my life and i have definitely made adjustments i don't listen to everything because you can't possibly listen to everything but that's that top level chess players have not experienced anything even remotely close why why have they not why is the world championship not of did you know that the chess world championship has the same prize fund in 1990 as it did in 2023 can you imagine can you imagine one day literally after this video go look up the historical prize fund of the world chess championships they literally don't make any sense why st louis chess club is like blossoming i mean i'm they've been hit with a wave of a whole lot of bad things which i'm not going to get into in this video but those of you who are in the know in the chess world you you know what i'm talking about uh they have the world chess hall of fame like there's a whole little chess village in st louis so much top talent goes to play there the us championships are hosted there that is through the efforts of rex singfield one man and probably his team but he is a billionaire and he is a philanthropist and he is doing sensational things for chess i have nothing but respect for what he is doing there for the st louis chess scene and chess scene in america period but he's a billionaire and in general chess historically has relied on the efforts of billionaire philanthropists robert downey j iron man's of the world that have so much money they would love to park it in the game of chess and take it to new heights but that's it if you ever look at the world rapping and blitz championships for example that were held last year in aana in kazakhstan you look at the sponsor list you you don't know those company you none of there's no brand presence there for 90% of the people watching maybe in certain regions of the world chess is not commercially viable especially for top players if you're out if you're ranked outside of the top 30 of the world you can barely make a decent living playing the game playing the game you can make courses you probably have students nowadays you're welcome by the way because they start with me and then they want to take their chess seriously i'm not trying to be factious i'm simply saying the chess ecosystem for content consumption is so massive but the best representatives of the game like our best athletes barely get to experience this unless they also have big social media followings hikaru is the best example he's competing at the highest level and he has a massive channel in following he's merged the two he's the only one doing it magnus carlson's got an inactive youtube channel with over a million subscribers can you imagine if magnus carlson started making his own content magnus please don't let me have the highest subscribed youtube you could have the highest elo of all time one day you know one day he's going to get bor and he's going to come back but none of them like 99% of top players aren't even verified on social media that's the struggle and that's why the match was going to change that because if we get to a spot where top level chess players have a great social media following we can record them behind the scenes just like they do with top athletes that's going to open so many doors but historically chess has been limited by sponsors nobody's ever heard of or billionaire philanthropists and this was a step in the direction to change that and as of october 6th it has been put on pause the reason why i'm not saying it's dead is because big events get canceled all the time i really like the ufc i like watching mixed martial arts i like to think of jones cormier ufc 200 the biggest event that they had been that put on up to that point jon jones couldn't fight like three days before the fight something about a drug test that's crazy the whole thing fell apart now this feels like for me it fell apart because i know the behind the scenes and so much potential is gone for now will we put something on like this in the future i hope so if you're watching this right now you have access to corporate sponsorships hit us up maybe we can get another venue but it's too late to pivot it's too late to pivot in the fourth quarter company budgets event budgets are hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars chess boxing last year they probably lost a couple hundred thousand i am not their accountant this is simply an estimation putting on these absolutely massive events and including pricee funds takes a whole lot of money it does and chess.com is major objective from my standpoint i don't have any internal information but from an outsider and spectator standpoint is to create this kind of professional ecosystem for these top players to make a lot of money and that's where chess has struggled historically for example why is chess only on youtube and on twitch why like why is that the only place you can why is it not on any sports bars i was watching tv out in my living room the other day battle bots robots fighting each other is on the discovery ch channel because that stuff is epic that stuff is fast-paced and while that stuff is dorky and i have no idea how to program a robot i was captivated i was watching them slice open each other yes as human beings we are naturally drawn to violence and conflict just look at the media but things like that that is the stuff i am working toward everything i do in chess including writing a book that has no notation in it and qr codes this is not a promo you can get the book if you want you get you don't have to my point is everything i doing in the chess space while building my own brand and my own uh you know all my courses and my my my media and my and my and my paid content and all that stuff at the end of the day is to make it as easy and accessible to understand and learn the game for the consumer i don't make garbage i take a lot of pride in the stuff that i make and that is the goal with all of this is to make this game as global as far-reaching as possible why does that matter for you by the way right you you might if you're still here and you had the attention span for all this why you you might be sitting there going you only are upset the match is over because you make you're going to lose money on it you know first of all if anybody's going to be upset it's magnus and hikaro because they were guaranteed $200,000 if you could lose every game of that match and make $200,000 all right i don't know what they're me i was going to make i don't know i was going to make a fraction of that making recaps all right and maybe having some sort of sponsor plugs but uh that's not why i'm upset if anything they should be upset way more it's about the fact that where do we go from here what is the goal of this what is the goal of any of this of this chess boom how do we capitalize on it why are we not on a netflix why are we not on a hulu all right they only get interested in us because of the chess cheating scandal but there's so much more we have to offer the behind the scenes the preparation for tournaments there is so much more to be made of these chess players and at the end of the day if you have any favorite chess players you should be rooting for them to succeed now why does this matter for you do you like anything do you like anything anything at all sport whatever anything that you watch on a screen if you like anything or anyone whether it's uh athlete whether it's musician whether it's you you never stop and think wow i really want them to participate in something of a lower value wow i want them not to be that successful wow i want them to that doesn't happen it it feels like anywhere except chess it chess is a slightly weird ecosystem where if i start complaining that like chess should be sped up and get into tvs people are like you just want to make more money you know i got plenty of money i got plenty money it's the fact that the people who are the best players and the best athletes and the best representatives don't get anywhere near the access of the social media folks that are participating in this world because our entire ecosystem in my opinion from top to bottom is broken the commercial viability of it the fact that why are people going to sit and watch a 7-hour game why that's like that's tough that's a tough thing to do a a tournament that lasts four weeks right like every sport is speeding up you like a footballer you like a baseball player you like american football right whatever you like you want them to excel and participate in something at the highest echelon at the highest production quality all of the stuff that you watch behind the scenes of people drive to survive for example formula 1 drive to those of you that watch formula 1 drive to survive chang so much about formula 1 where is chess's drive to survive okay maybe these chess players are not as interesting and handsome and muscular but like we can do something with them i don't know i'm sure there's something that we can do with them to to package some type of uh content like this that is the major reason this is said um chess has to change and modernize a little bit in my opinion for you higher production quality higher content is great but a lot of you could even get jobs through chess which you don't even realize if you're a personable individual and your rating is 12200 that's like you have a fast track if you live in any major city to teach chess after school in new york city if you're a 1,200 and you're a normal person who can pass a background check you can make $100 an hour the demand for chess is massive you can run chess tournaments you can run camps all those kids are going to play chess you could probably get them to sign up for something through a referral you can create a business through this people do it all the time there has literally never been a better time to be in the world of chess as a consumer of it you can start a local chess club at a bar you could meet people you could meet friends why do people participate in hobbies it's to feel intelligent and good and feel progress and also a sense of community that's it there has literally never been a better time to participate in the world of chess and right now the people who are experiencing the biggest and most uh felt kind of harvesting of the fruits of the booms of chess are people like me not the top players in the world karu magnus great but it's people like me because i'm able to take something like a social and it's all the creators i can take the youtube i can take the twitch i can turn that into courses i can sell merchandise i can publish a damn book i can start a chess tournament tour i want to build a gotham chess club a high-end posh really nice chess club in new york city if you're watching this and you're involved with the venture capital company hit me up you know all of these different routes and avenues then i want to build chess programs in schools i donated $100,000 couple of years ago i want to start a foundation maybe get get people into better colleges through the angle of chess or through stem or something there is so much that you can do and uncover in something that has gotten as popular as chess even though it's a hobby anyway if you're still watching that was the purpose of this video the chess ecosystem doesn't quite make sense right now it's got to change some something has to give for example in 2024 the candidates tournament which is the tournament where the winner plays the world champion is being held in toronto that is the first time ever a candidates is held in north america i think there's like a technicality maybe in like 1959 there was some knockout match in you know saskatchewan where people had to take a reindeer to get there or something how crazy is that that's we gotta we've all got to modernize and adapt the boom has to be felt every everywhere we've got to be thinking media we've got to be thinking social media we've got to be thinking things like netflix specials these big scale matches getting the sponsors involved for all the top players in the world that stuff that stuff goes throughout the entire wave it's not just about me making recaps i'mma be here making my ai content and my my low elo content that's plentiful millions of chess games are played every day i'm not going anywhere anytime soon i'm going to write a sequel to the book i've got so much more to give to the chess world don't worry but we got to make events like this happen and uh it's a shame that it's not going to happen due to various logistical happenings that i am not aware of and frankly i do not want to be aware of but it's a shame that this fell through this is why it's important and i hope that all made sense if there's anything actionable that i said out of any of this please do write it in the comments take some action in your own life go start a club at the local bar go do something go go go try to do some private lessons and uh thank you for being in the world of chess 3 four years ago nobody cared we were a very very small blip on the map some people were playing chess because they really enjoyed it now it's weird if you don't play chess or if you haven't heard of chess so the match is canceled uh i don't think that's going to change in 2023 and maybe we will see you in 2024 i think that's all i have to say get out of here
