ladies and gentlemen the game of chess has been around for thousands of years but we don't go through many patches we don't make any particular updates to the game so it's actually kind of fascinating that millions of people still uh enjoy playing instead what chess does is we overhaul games completely and that's what we've done once again it's currently may 2024 i like to time stamp these things because you never know you might be watching this video 30 years from now and the world is in an apocalyptic state and you come across a chess channel and you're like wow look how the world used to be 30 years ago anyway it's currently may 20124 and there is a new type of chess format that magnus carlson hikara kamura vishwanathan anand and basim amin who's the highest rated player in africa uh and he's actually representing egypt they all faced off in this format it's called casablanca chess and it's called that cuz they played it in casablanca in morocco and basically it is a type of format where you start a chess game in a predetermined position so there's no openings you're dropped in like they do in fortnite and then you just play it's a very fascinating format hikaru said it was his favorite format in years so what am i talking about well it was kind of a recreational event but we did get magnus and hikaro playing against each other and this is what happened this like they started the game right here they they had no control over their openings the only thing that that needed to happen is that the position had to be equal obviously you can't just give one of them you know the morphe game right the opera game so what i'm going to do in this video is i'm going to take you through different games that they played from different positions and starting points and explain to you how they looked and what games they followed so the very first game that i'm going to show you is hikaru versus magnus from this position and the game that they were supposed to follow was this one anat carp of gary kasparov 1985 the world chess championship match and the way we're going to do this is i'm going to show you the opening right so the opening was an e6 sicilian it was a timon of sicilian kind of a shenan setup with d6 e6 maybe knight f6 and a6 and now karpov played g4 and h4 very aggressive stuff against kasparov kasparov played this sixth rank pawn setup bishop e3 a trade kicking out the queen and now the bishop coming to e6 now it's very interesting to see how the players of the past played compared to the players of the of the current day so karpov back in 1985 39 years ago put his knight on d5 then he put the pawn on c3 then he traded off the dark squared bishop gary took with the queen and then karpov went for an attack ultimately there was a trade and kasparov rerouted the queen on the h file and then struck in the center the game went on and ultimately ended in a draw all right but the key idea was knight to d5 c3 and knight e7 and in the game between hikaru and magnus that is also what happened so they actually followed the same the same position they actually followed the same position for a while but in the carp of game after knight e7 kasparov took back with the queen very natural move where as magnus carlson either from memory or from inspiration took with the king that is a statement move that is a gangster move we love that he takes with the king he puts his king in the center and this is a pretty common idea in the sicilian defense actually like you leave your king in the center and if the knight can't come get it from either side it's difficult to get that this is actually a completely reasonable move it looks ridiculous don't try this at home only try this if uh magnus is uh is playing it uh but uh now hikaro plays g5 so clearly you have to justify having the pawn there now we have knight to g4 all right so magnus could have taken on g5 but instead he opts to go knight to g4 and now karu moves the bishop out of the way because he doesn't want the knight to take it and the knight is almost trapped right you have to play f3 black here has the option between queen b6 threatening mate and just the immediate pawn takes on g5 he opts for pawn takes on g5 now by the way bishop g5 is not winning a queen in fact this just shows you the resilience of black's position black's king is completely safe you have no way to get to the king at all not even close agg now right here hikaru can choose f3 right away and that is the best move according to the engine knight f6 bishop g5 and here hikaru thought like black just plays something like king f8 and has an advantage king f8 knight h5 like he he probably thought something like queen b6 knight h5 this type of thing and he thought black is better um the engine doesn't really disagree uh but it still thinks that you have to do that it thinks that you there is nothing else instead of f3 hikaru plays bishop to f3 trying to target the knight with the bishop and now magnus finds a very very nasty idea a very nasty idea he he first he defends his knight and when karu goes to attack it again the knight sneaks into the white position and this is when you know you've messed up when the knight is just darting around your territory and five of your six major pieces are on the back rank something is inherently wrong with the white position bishop g5 check f6 it's ridiculous how strong that king is and it shows you that it's it's different than how kasparov handled the position so magnus improves on kasparov's chest very interesting stuff so the king is safe hikaru comes back and now look at this i mean i i love the fact that this king is just completely blocked off on all sides and magnus doesn't rush he trades he's slightly better plays queen b5 and white just has too many weaknesses he can't even castle you can't castle cuz you're going to lose the pawn on a2 and you don't have any attack now karo plays bishop c1 twice in the same game he just played bishop c1 here that's how you know something went wrong when you got to keep making the same move you still can't get out now how does magnus ultimately make the breakthrough plays bishop f7 stays patient targets the pawn forces white's rook to be passive now queen a4 just restricting maybe sneaking into c2 in the future targeting the e4 pawn and now d5 and now black's position is going to come alive down the defile it's going to come alive in the center white just can't get even he can't even get off the the starting rank right rook h2 now the queen just slides back to c6 he's just not letting you know he's not letting it be easy bishop f3 for example like yep that's exactly what happens now magnus is a pawn up so magnus has all the benefits of the position and he's a pawn up hearo tries to open things up but what a move by the way rook e8 and the threat is just to move the king the threat is to move the king and then a bazooka is going to be pointed down the e file and hikaro plays queen g1 and yeah if this is the position of the pieces somewhere through in the middle of the game something went horribly wrong horribly wrong king f7 and you know what i love about this position this is so interesting the bishops are of opposite color right which means both sides have an objective to play on the color where they're stronger black is stronger on the light squares white is stronger on the dark squares but look how every piece is on the dark squares look how every piece is on the light squares and only one side right now is going to be delivering a fatal blow to their opponent uh and magnus takes on e5 hikaro just you know he finally gets to move as king but the king is forced back rook e3 is lights out hikaru's rook never got out you can't even even you can't even say the dark squared bishop got out so ultimately in these sicilian middle games it's seemed the position was much harder to play for white it just was and i i think honestly gary showed the same thing gary was the one calling the shots in this game putting the queen on the h file on h4 and ultimately putting the pressure on karpov throughout karpov though a very resilient defender kind of turned the tables and then just simplified down and and nobody could win here but very interesting to see how magnus improves and you know magnus might have not played king e7 in a high stakes game but you put him in a 15minute game in this kind of new format and he's going to get really creative trying with king e7 very interesting stuff like fascinating the to see the difference in the way they they play now this one was also fascinating i'm actually going to show you both of these games this was actually in the first round this was carlon anand and also hikaro basam this position follows a game from 150 years ago some of you weren't even alive back then that's crazy and they followed chorin versus steinet if you know anything about these dudes were the og chess in influencers all right if they could be walking around back there live streaming games in person they would all right which just is a hilarious thing to think about this was played in'89 135 years ago i mean just incredible this was played in havana in cuba and it was choran versus steinet and and and that havana back then with capablanca it was like um capablanca came a little bit later but havana was kind of uh there was a there was a big chess hub there there still might be uh obviously there's a lot of strong cuban players so this one was a was an italian evans gambit like it blows my mind 135 years ago people were playing this cutting edge gambit stuff this was the style of chess in the in the in the in the early 19th century like the early'00s but it it it persevered it persevered you gambit the pawn c3 and then you take this big center with d4 now important moment steid played a lot of queen to f6 it was very like normal back then bring the queen out counterattack your opponents nobody really plays queen f6 anymore but it's not even that bad of a move like according to the engine it's 08 you know what i mean like and this is this thing is this thing is so good it's ridiculous nowadays people just play knight f6 like the importance of developing traditionally etc is is very valuable queen f6 d4 knight e7 this is the incorrect way of setting up uh according to the engine bishop g5 queen d6 i mean you can't really blame them back in the day they used to live until they were like 35 like the the concept of foresight was not really you know a thing back then like they would put the queen in the center and the engine hates it but we don't care about the engine queen b3 castles um rook d1 keeping the tension and now this move bishop to b6 okay so the top move according to the engine and the move that choran played in the game is to take the pawn is to actually take the pawn it's a top engine move queen g6 and then he played queen a3 and he went on to lose he got hit with he actually didn't get hit with a tactic although knight e5 was the best move but he went on to lose the game so d5 queen g6 the engine just likes knight b2 and karu said even this position probably is slightly easier to play uh for black because black can play things like knight a5 d6 etc and even though uh i mean it feels like white is a pawn up white's not all the pawns are just back here so it's funny because karu played a move that the engine didn't approve and so did magnus so both guys make a move and now they have worse evaluations according to white according oh my god according to the engine for white which is which is hilarious that the game in'89 followed the top line of the engine even though white went on to lose these guys played a move the engine doesn't like but might be a little bit easier to understand so bishop to f1 i mean look straightforward concept you're trying to put a knight on c4 is what you're trying to do and you're kind of leaving it up to black to decide what to do so the hikaru game went like this bosam took and now it's a little too dangerous to take the knight uh to take with the knight because the queen can't protect both knights at the same time so after take take bishop b7 you simply lose material so instead of that boston played knight g6 hikaru kept saying putting the queen on g6 is likely the better idea and it's it's true black should put the queen on g6 and when d5 is played you got knight d4 ideas hitting this hitting this trying to remove the guard of that now bosam went here hikaro took the center gave up another pawn but then bosam just blundered knight d4 uh rook d4 um he just he couldn't you know the pressure was a little bit too much and now a very counterintuitive move karo plays rook takes forks the queen and the bishop and uh bosam got both rooks but in this position it's actually only white who is happy because black cannot get off the back crank just like the previous game that we saw hikara now plays h4 d5 tries to trap the bishop in the corner and uh he uh he he basically succeeds makes black do this now h5 and and and yeah you're you're just getting in is what you're doing uh e i mean i i i mean i mean yeah this is not a pretty picture you know what i mean rook e8 bishop f6 is a beautiful move if pawn takes this and that's just mate like there is just no way to stop that so we get h6 queen f4 it's still coming bishop b4 bishop d3 i mean a be like a beautiful attack and hearo wins the game in style sacrifices the bishop queen f6 bosam resigns because he's hikaro is either going to win this back or take this pawn and made him what a game right so hikaru got this position and it it wasn't much better i mean according you know again computer is like a very tricky defender it pushes the pieces back and it it's just not scared it's very scary though to play this position as a human so hikaru played bishop to f1 which is inaccurate black should go queen g6 and take on d4 and you know what did what did magnus do magnus played knight a3 right away which is also an inaccuracy because black can play pawn takes d4 but he can also play knight a5 now we have queen a4 and here vishy should have probably taken on d4 and played knight c6 he played knight c6 right away magnus went here and again you got to put the queen on g6 so in both games both players with black did not understand that queen g6 was the optimal position for the queen to go here to target everything by the way this kind of looks like the steinet game right this kind of looks like the steinet game where he took on e5 so in this game between uh magnus and vishy vishy went here and uh vishy got hit with this move and suddenly things got very unpleasant he thought he was threatening on f2 he was but suddenly the queen is stuck in the white position and can't get out he goes queen b2 rook b1 the queen is trapped so again he went queen c5 thinking magnus had to defend himself or at the very least play bishop 2 e3 not necessary rook d5 magnus invites him in and is's like oh sorry you lose the queen now these positions are so tough to play because you just dropped into them queen a3 queen a3 knight c4 vishy gives up some material but magnus ends the game in style he sacrifices one rook to damage the position and and then he sacrifices the rook again so the reason that vishy didn't take on b6 here is because he would have just taken here so we have rook b6 and vishy just didn't want to play this position magnus took a knight a bishop and is going to take the other knight and it's just game over you're not going to win queen and knight versus two rooks vishy resigns and it's funny because both guys did not play what the engine liked but neither player with black understood that the concept was queen g6 would have been very interesting to see would magnus and hikaru have understood that putting the queen on g6 would have been correct uh like i said in the classic game uh in the game from uh from the past white ultimately did not handle the position correctly and it was steinet who defended got all his pieces out and with black and then yeah just bishop f3 like it's crazy back in the day they were hanging pieces like h3 weakens this and then there's just take take and a pin i mean these are you know it happens this this is chess back in the'80s and yet were playing moves at the top engine line right i got a couple more for you we have another magnus hikaru game uh and again they they they played they played a lot uh of different positions and different interesting formats um this one uh followed uh the game uh uh zun versus um alisa galova from the 1999 world chest championship match and here i just have an empty analysis board for some reason uh this is the 1999 women's world championship match it happened between two cities uh kazan and shenyang which is pretty normal like uh i mean again chess is weird like we don't have a consistent format anywhere so it's actually very normal for world championships on the women's side to take place in two two cities for some reason i you know i like they would they don't do that uh in the open or the men's or whatever but um i don't know that's just how it's always been so uh let's take a look at this position magnus and hikaro playing this position uh white has castle queen side black's king is in the center if you don't recognize this position i don't blame you very tough to understand it kind of looks like it could have been a french defense like in a a weird advanced french also looks like there's no ewn there's no c pawn i guess there is an ewn but it it was from a d pawn it got traded so tough to understand uh that i mean it it's not even what i just said is not even fully accurate but uh looks like the e- pawn was preserved the d pawn was traded for the c pawn that's what i was trying to say but sometimes you just ramble and you say stupid stuff and that your audience is sitting there like what did he say and then i'm like what did i say and i make fun of myself and i call myself stupid and we all move on um so the position is after this move f5 and i'm going to show you the the the the historical game um and uh it was from a a a classical sicilian in 1999 played 25 years ago bishop to g5 and this is called the r rza variation e6 queen d2 white castle's long and amazingly i mean even 30 years ago some of these positions have absolutely survived the test of time as we just saw in'89 they survived the test of time but it's you know in an opening like the sicilian very cutting edge some of this stuff is very dangerous like black playing you know so aggressively white playing so aggressively and um frequently white takes this knight because you can't take like this because you're gonna lose this pawn so gf6 and then you know frequently i've seen white play f5 and the point is that if e5 white gets this really dominating clamp on the d5 square um but in the game white went e5 which is a move it's very aggressive forcing black to probably create some sort of structural stronghold like this now white plays king b1 always a useful move when you've castled queen side you protect all your pawns you get off this diagonal you get off of the c file if the rook is there and now bishop to d7 is played uh white plays queen e3 and now f5 closing closing the door not allowing the center to open up all right now in this game white went g4 which is the best move it's actually the best move white sacrificing a pawn fg h3 playing it like in gambit style making it a very unpleasant choice for black if you don't take white takes you so you got to take you got to just bite the bullet now bishop h3 queen c7 and now white went f5 so z jun was just aggressive in this game long castle rook f1 and ultimately white was still upon down so the best white is going to potentially get is to win the pawn back bishop c5 insane position white has to sacrifice a rook to fuel the fire of the attack h5 then white found this very nice idea b4 put the knight in the center bishop g2 and it was bad news it was a completely winning dominating attack where all of white's pieces got involved every single one and ultimately white took what a beautiful finish discovered attack on the king queen is hanging bishop is hanging and if you go here you get mated down two rooks queen b7 and you take so gamova was put under massive pressure in this game with white's attack and the critical idea is this move pawn to g4 now we have hiar we have carlson versus uh we have carlson versus hiar in this position and we have bosam versus vishy vishy went knight e2 and magnus went g4 so magnus finds the critical test of the black position now again magnus is known to have a ridiculous memory so this entire format could literally be cheating for magnus because he just remembers the moves like there is a chance magnus remembered the analysis of this game karp of kaspar of 1985 because he's a he's a demon like he's just you know like it's just you know what are you going to do if a guy has a ridiculous memory or he found it on his own right he did spend about 2 minutes and he found this concept of g4 it's a very natural concept it is the only pawn break in the position that makes sense if white plays a4 he should be stoned to death frankly uh but uh yeah we're not going to get magnus playing h5 so uh rather h5 uh a4 so g4 right now hikaru takes because frankly if you don't take you're going to get destroyed and now we have this move h3 so let's see will karu take on h3 yes he's up for a fight he understands the demands of the position all right magnus takes with a rook so that is not what was played in the historical game in the historical game white went bishop takes h3 both moves are liked by the engine but actually rook h3 slightly preferred uh so yeah unfortunately magnus is improving over the previous game queen c7 see hikaru knows magnus is coming in here and f5 is a very key idea so queen g1 all right there is magnus infiltrating hikaro knows he's going to have to do something right here right now he counterattacks with this move b4 i mean to be honest with you he doesn't have a whole lot else now we have queen g7 magnus abandons the knight on c3 for a good reason he's going to win the rook rook f8 now the knight comes back to e2 now karo has a massive decision he could either castle along which is actually the top line of the computer i know black got made it in the stem game from 25 years ago that's a very different position plays rook c8 though and now apparently because his king black's king is going to be stuck in the center he's worse and so what magnus does is he puts the knight on d4 and then he simply takes his pawn back and that i guess was inaccurate he should have just gone here first and then if the bishop went to c5 he should have put the knight on c1 that was kind of getting into the essence of the position he put the knight on d4 and this trade of bishop for knight is not great for white to to sustain his advantage because black activates on the queen side rook back to d1 and here comes hikaro with a counterplay giving up the pawn on a6 completely which magnus takes now rook a8 white is winning the magnus is beating hikaro and casablanca chess two times in a row the bishop is hanging the winning move here for white is queen g7 and i think karo must have missed this concept you can't take you can't take the bishop because rook h8 and after take you got to take otherwise you lose there is uh queen f6 here and rook h1 and you're getting mated the only way you don't get mated is by putting the bishop over here and then i go b3 i'm going to win the bishop and i'm going to checkmate you so you're going to lose all your you're going to lose your bishop here hi caro plays bishop c6 rook h magnus rushes it was better for him to bring the bishop back for some reason i to just wait the winning move here is bishop f1 and the constant threat of rook to h8 makes the position un uh undefendable for black apparently so this is a very important lesson in the threat is more powerful than the execution because magnus executes the threat but it's too fast and actually where the king is now is fine magnus comes back to f6 this was all part of the plan takes on f7 takes on e6 and he might be winning he might be winning with queen e7 king a8 and literally just taking this pawn but he doesn't go for that he goes completely low risk he plays queen f8 check and he repeats the position and this is actually how he clinched the tournament victory so this was uh the last round of the event and uh he won the tournament with um i mean obviously he did uh what else did we expect with uh four and a half uh out of six i believe and uh he could have however he could have played for a win in this position he could have taken a b4 and he would have had four pawns for the bishop i'm not sure what he didn't like about this position maybe he didn't see a very clear win but after something like queen f8 king b7 yeah i mean you know there is a chance white can lose somehow but maybe there's queen f3 queen e2 these types of things but okay that he opts to repeat the position and uh and ultim the game ends in a draw he was winning though he was winning and this attack did prove to be successful because he found this concept of g4 the same concept uh that uh zun found in um uh in her game uh i think it's technically pronounced uh jun i think technically that's that's uh that's how we would pronounce it now one final game and then you are free to go uh anand did not play where where are the time stamps why did where's the clock i whatever 92 is what he went for and he prepared the move g4 which bsam did not stop bsam should have played h5 but now g4 and and and and actually in this position he executed most of the right plans but unfortunately vishy still got to get going he got in with his rook he got in with his queen and b should have been a little bit more aggressive here playing a little bit more ambitiously with bishop c5 instead he went back and sort of said you know what viy you can take my pawn but now i go queen f2 and life is good it's not good it's it's not good you you needed to respect these pieces just like how in the stem game the pieces came alive when the position opened up um by going here basam got his queen locked out of the position and vishy just does what vishy does best bulldo in the position knight takes e6 that is a fork you can't take because the queen covers mate so bishop a6 is checkmate in two so in the game we have queen e5 and now bishop a6 check king b8 and he just takes on f8 if you take i win the bishop and i mate you on the next move if you don't take i'll mate you i'm also threatening this bosam resigns it was close it was a tense game but he just made the wrong decision he put his queen in the territory and now now he's completely lost because the queen is locked out now obviously bosam was in a tough spot you know he was the he was the representative obviously of egypt uh and of the african continent in chess but this was a tough field magnus and hikaru and also vishan you know legend of the game but he put up a he put up a fight he made some draws he lost some games it's life uh and it was a very interesting format let me know what you think about it honestly in the comments uh obviously i feel like this is not a perfect format um in the sense that you know if people know games very historical games and they analyze them previously and you know they know what's going to happen it it could be problematic uh but i find it fascinating and and it's so cool to see how games were played 20 years ago 50 years ago 140 years ago it's very interesting format magnus wins hikaro gets second beating out vishy by half a point uh bosam fourth but that's life he was the underdog i don't know if we count this as an official tournament win for magnus but um yeah a new format of chess now get out of here
