this is my gaming laptop it doesn't come with a keyboard or trackpad or even a battery i had to bring my own guys i'm not gonna lie i don't really get this this is how we did laptop when i was a kid strapping a jackery to this thing doesn't make it a laptop well that's not the way we do it now they want us to do it this way well i don't know that way why would they change laptop desktop is desktop laptop is laptop math is math and this message is from our sponsor jackery they just announced their new solar generator 1000 pro which features two 100 watt ports for fast charging all while being two kilos lighter than the competition pre-order yours today at the link down below [music] on the surface the new igame g1 plus from colorful is an all-in-one desktop but beating in its chest is the heart of a laptop it's got a mobile core i7 12700h an rtx 3060 six gig laptop gpu and two 8 gig sodium memory modules all crammed into this stealthy stand behind the display more on that later but first i want to show you something unfortunate this is rage mode which unlocks the fans running them at their full 3700 rpm uh colorful wouldn't the point of using mobile hardware to be power efficient and quiet there we go compared to the default quiet fan profile which allows the cpu to thermal throttle almost immediately rage mode yielded a whopping 35 improvement in our cinebench score i mean i think it's pretty safe to say that most people wouldn't want to use the machine in this state but hey at least it's an option to allow the fans to compensate rather than just letting the system overheat take that apple and besides the igame's true purpose is not to be a multi-threaded workstation powerhouse it's got gaming right in the name maybe our quiet fan profile will fare better here and it does in quiet mode not only is the machine merely silent but we see our cpu and gpu reach around 70 and 80 degrees respectively after a one hour loop of f1 2021 not too shabby but are we giving up any performance as it turns out the answer is no while rage mode did have a significant impact in performance when we are maxing out our 12th gen core cpu in gaming we saw just a 5 to 8 degree drop in temperature which did improve our fps a little bit but the difference was so minimal that i would say it's definitely not worth making your machine sound like a jet engine speaking of fps our hardware performs as we'd hope in our esports and mainstream gaming representatives cs go and f1 2021 but in tiny tina's wonderlands which is representing the demands of more current aaa titles we barely managed 60 fps with our settings at high and running at our native 1440p resolution that's with or without rage mode which gives us some concerns about the longevity of a machine like this though maybe it can be upgraded while we're opening it up let's talk some other speeds and feeds the display's 1440p 165 hertz with a measured pixel response time of about five milliseconds like a laptop it's got wi-fi speakers and it's powered by a single power brick god these things just make my hands tired from having to like put so much force on them so this is exactly why i didn't want to tear this down ahead of time oh that's for the wireless charging so here's the problem there's no obvious screw holes except for the very bottom of the display once we took that off there's a cable for the charger and i can't there's like no other screws can i try using a hammer oh god so can you even upgrade it we had this whole spiel about like oh yeah you can it's got two m.2 slots and all this other stuff but i don't even know how you get it out i don't know if we'll end up using that so i think that you got to flex out the bottom and then it clips along the side but it's a pain because you've got this cable attached and then you've also got the monitor to deal with anytime you want to move it so i'm going to spin it and rest it on the display and then the cable is going yep okay there you go so after that's off ah this whole thing just comes right off all right it's not terrible but also you're really okay and that's just on a ribbon cable let's take this off i'd rather take the cable off instead of breaking it there we go okay that's a lot better unlike a laptop though you can't just tuck it under your arm and take it on the road there's no battery and it doesn't come with a keyboard and mouse raises some questions like who needs this thing and why are you still waiting to check out the stealth hoodie pro on lttstore.com considering this cable here and then how the display is kind of just out i don't really think they expect many people to actually open this thing as you can see we've got two sodium slots for our memory no not force we can't upgrade that we can maybe get bigger capacity but it's already running at the max rated speed of 3200 megahertz and then we have an extra m.2 at least it's a full 2280 slot for another ssd if we want to put that in there but it looks like if you want to upgrade the other already installed ssd you've got to take this whole thing out so there's screws here here here here another minor issue if you want to take the board out you got to take the cooling stuff off too i should probably call that something better than the cooling stuff heat pipes yeah maybe there's thermal paste that's glued to ah you got that well because it's a laptop it's a laptop cpu um this is actually neat though this is kind of cool all right did you get all that yeah i i gotta say as much as i hate taking this thing apart this is neat i like that this just kind of like levers up and out of the way so you actually don't have to remove uh the entire heat sink or the cooling apparatus like i was worried about um i think our motherboard is attached to something i'm not sure if i just missed a screw or if it's just oh there's one screw here yeah and here's our ssd it's all the way on the back so if you want to change the original one yeah just don't probably yeah so just to recap if if we want to change our ssd we've got to get all the way to the back we can add a new one and we can change the memory modules but without any sort of major tinkering that's about it none of which would be a deal breaker of a problem if it weren't for the price we specced out a small form-factor pc with equivalent hardware and a better 1440p display and even with the sff tax we managed it for a few hundred dollars less not to mention that it not only matches but beats the i game in just about every performance category i mean as far as our temps go they probably would be more in line with colorful's aio if we packed all the hardware into a case rather than testing it on an open bench but at least we've got something upgradable which is a major problem for the igame and it's not some kind of fear-mongering about is your system future-proof enough the igame can barely handle 1440p in aaa games now let alone over the next few years as game developers pump out more and more demanding titles that are built for the hardware of the xbox series and ps5 era of consoles and even ignoring performance like a laptop the screen isn't detachable or usable with a separate input making the entire system essentially e-waste once it falls behind the times so who is buying these things if they're overpriced and underperforming and lack flexibility one option is cyber cafes or land centers it's a breeze to deploy has a dedicated ethernet port and is going to be good enough for esports games like cs go or league for many years to come but a 32-inch screen is huge for a facility like that where you would normally find 24 or at most 27 inch panels so for most of the cafes that i've seen these would be reserved for premium users with the majority of their seats targeting 1080p on much smaller monitors with much more budget hardware which kind of makes it out of place in another way because at those 32-inch premium seats i'd expect to be running an rtx 3080. another market i can really see this in is the non-tech savvy mom and dad you know they're out there at the best buy they want to find a compromise between the imac that they think looks pretty and their kids desire to game well fair enough for that i guess it's not entirely fair of us to compare the ease of use of something like this with a diy desktop that we cobbled together on pc part picker but it raises the question if they really want something that's all in one why stop here you'd probably be better off just buying a laptop which has even more all in its one you get similar or even identical hardware more portability a much more appropriate display an attached keyboard and trackpad well you'll want to buy a mouse as soon as possible in either case this unfortunately doesn't include one either and surprisingly you can get all of that for the same price or even much cheaper like this asus tuff unit with a 300hz full hd display for only 1500 us dollars that is a whopping 500 budget remaining for a monitor a mouse and dammit where's our desk this desk pad from lttstore.com and if you don't need the portability intel's nooks have become more and more modular over the years featuring full fat desktop sockets and space for desktop gpus expensive yes but so is this and at least it's more versatile even if you like how it looks with its gray blue stand off-center power button and big eye game logo on the chin there's no denying that other all-in-ones tend to look a little sleeker than this one from colorful take the hp envy all-in-one 34c 1070 xt not only does it look nicer but it's got an i7 12700 desktop cpu an rtx 3060 gpu though probably also a laptop one 16 gigs of ram at 4 000 mega transfer per second with two more sodium slots if you want to upgrade wi-fi six a three in one memory card reader and more i o than colorful unit for just a few hundred dollars more it's 34-inch display only runs at 60 hertz but it's 5k so while the lower refresh rate is definitely an advantage for the i-game the i-game has its own problems as well running 1440p at 32 inches diagonal is really pushing the bounds of acceptable pixel density and hdr400 is just another way of saying don't bother enabling hdr you're probably better off without it and it can also be frustrating to use instead of a typical on-screen display menu for the monitor you have to use colorful's eye game center which doesn't actually give you any control over the brightness or color settings for brightness you need to use the side buttons that also act as volume control and while there are osd settings they're not so you can actually adjust the color they're just so that you can display specs on screen not alter them to be clear the app itself overall is fine and using it to change fan profiles or lighting does work but for this much money it's just missing a lot of the features found on just about any modern monitor it's kind of like what colorful set out to do was compete with apple's imac in terms of simplicity and price and then they failed on both counts speaking of fails get subscribed on floatplane for blooper reels and behind the scenes content from your friends at linus media group it has a 15 watt wireless phone charger built into the stand though and a built-in webcam did we break the budget
