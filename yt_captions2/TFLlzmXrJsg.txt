yeah so after all these years on youtube i finally got recognized by jet brains and i've never been sponsored on this channel and i've never sponsored anything on this channel besides of course my own website indent. check it out if you want to learn more about python but otherwise i have never sponsored or been sponsored by any anything on this channel i get lots of emails every day regarding products that i should sponsor on the channel but for me i find it incredibly difficult to sponsor literally anything that i don't believe in i get lots of offers to sponsor things such as cryptocurrency or products that i just don't see a purpose for when it comes to ind dentle i love making videos i love making courses the only thing i usually sponsor of course are my own courses cu i know exactly the work that goes into them i know exact exctly what they are i can actually vouch for them there's it's not just that i'm not just sponsoring it solely for the money i actually believe in the product i'm sharing with you guys so what am i trying to say with all of this well jet brains recently reached out to me and they just asked if they could help in any way with ind dentle whether i wanted to show up to some conferences whether i wanted to be parts of some jetbrain projects and i was super excited because all i do on this channel is use pyam to make python scripts and to teach you guys python i think it's the easiest code editor or ide to use on the internet and i've been using it ever since i started programming and it's actually another product i can actually vouch for because i use it every single day and what's special about this product is that i'm not sponsored by jet brains they're just helping out i'm not actually sponsored by jet brains i'm not getting paid to talk about jet brains i just personally enjoy the product and that's why i'm talking about it and i will continue to be like that on the this channel i will talk about products i actually believe in such as indent. check out the link in the description if you want to learn more about python but otherwise i will only talk about all mentioned products that i actually believe in anyway as always i just wanted to thank you guys because the channel is what it is today thanks to all of you it has grown so much i never expected it to actually get past maybe 5,000 subscribers it really started as a hobby channel where i just wanted to share my experiences with programming but now it actually grew into something professional that i do as a profession and that's probably one of the biggest dreams in the world to actually work on your own schedule as a youtuber making courses at your own pace so thanks again for supporting the channel because without you guys this would be nothing and every time the channel grows so does the quality of the content i put so much more effort into each video to make sure you guys get the max out of what you're learning especially compared to when i started this channel as a hobby now i actually have resources to make sure the videos are of quality and also al just getting support from jet brains is just mental for me again i just never thought it would grow this big so for me it's quite a moment and yeah so all i really wanted to say was thank you guys for everything and i'm really excited to continue working on ind dentle on improving the quality of the tutorials of the content and investing more and more into it so you guys can also get more and more out of it i think one of my long-term dreams would be just to completely remove ads from this channel of course i need to get a stable income for that to actually be feasible but it's it's on the list it's on the list of many things i want to do building a website for learning programming building an app for learning programming continuing to make the process of learning programming much easier for anyone who wants to learn it regardless of their background as long as they have a computer or some screen to follow along with i want to make it accessible that's practically the only goal of ind dentle so once again guys thanks so much for watching and i'll see you in the next video
