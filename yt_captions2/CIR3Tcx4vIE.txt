ladies and gentlemen it's currently january 2024 and over the last couple of months in the chess world we've been hit with the cheating scandal 2.0 and the protagonists in this one are none other than grandmaster and former world champion vladimir karnick and hikaro nakamura karnick has been on a bit of an anti-cheating crusade now whether it's been fruitful or not is up to interpretation but definitely most recently he pointed all the fingers and all the spotlight at the streaks of one hiar nakamura on chess.com recently chess.com muted his blog due to various statements that he then went on to make against uh young prodigies and some of the younger folks that he thinks might not be playing fair so it's been a whole thing now while this has been going on um i've been very curious to see will magnus uh ever play karnick will hikaro ever play karnick now karnick has quit playing on chess.com multiple times the earliest was in september when he posted i've decided to stop playing on chess.com from tomorrow 1 this was four months ago too many obvious cheaters nothing is done to clean the platform from small crooks harsh words but true uh hope i will come back one day when it's been cleaned up etc etc the strength is in truth peace out but then he like came back and he played a few times and yesterday he tweeted this such a lineup timour even okay will play for a change as well hikaru leon beast less q that's uh that's nomi parvan dennis lasic wesley so jose eduardo martinez alcantar fao carana eduardo uraga yan kristov duda lot of really good players and he decided to play now then he played magnus but this is how it ended vladimir kiik made a twitter recently uh to to continue to post things uh at some point he responded to somebody i saw this yesterday he said that uh he wanted to join me for a video but i'm not allowed that's what he he said i'm not allowed i don't know who's allowing me maybe god i don't i've already stated here publicly that while it would be an interesting conversation with uh vladimir i don't think we're going to get anywhere i think we're just going to talk in circles i don't think we're going to get to the bottom of any issue i think he has his opinions and yesterday he said i already forgot how dis dis disgusting it is to play cheating tuesdays we'll play remaining games and no more thank you all right amazing now magnus yesterday played in title tuesday and it was a hoot it was a hoot and he actually got a game against vladimir karnick which was sensational but before i show you that game which i will show you anytime you go to a nice restaurant you do start off with a nice appetizer and i just look my friends i had to show you one more game you get two games of magnus you click for one game you get two games games it it's actually completely ridiculous or the way we would say in the words of mr crnic it's very very interesting the way magnus can get a rating of 3,370 and play stuff like this i mean he plays games where he plays h3 and then g4 like it it's unbelievable he just literally plays garbage openings gives his opponents much better positions sometimes completely winning positions and then he wins and then he wins the games i mean it's i've never seen anything like it before so this game against sagalo very stronger master he opened with h4 and then he played a scandinavian defense you may ask what am i talking about well the scandinavian defense is when black brings the queen out and then rotates the queen to the a file well magnus basically does the exact same thing except he's basically got a pawn here which i imagine is not doing his position any favors although he can put his bishop on g5 and he could expand if his opponent doesn't fat castle that way um and it seems like i can't make moves on this board because black's clock reset okay tremendous queen takes d4 all right knight c6 queen a4 love when ch.com does that just puts the clock on zero knight f6 magnus plays knight f3 and just plays normally just basically plays like he hasn't actually put a pa on h4 he's playing a reverse scandinavian defense uh e3 knight c3 and clearly he wants to castle if black were to take on f4 magnus would play queen takes and then he would castle play bishop here and launch an attack at his opponent's king so now shako tries to pin his knight magnus counterattacks with the same bishop move and takes the damage to his pawn structure over here while also having light squared weaknesses and a random pawn on the h4 square okay a6 takes t uh excuse me not takes takes um if takes there would would have been bishop takes and then he would have had to move the queen so he comes here he's not worried about discovered attacks and that's the thing when you play against magnus he does these ridiculous things against you but there's no there's no knight jump that helps knight here is a discovered attack on the queen but the queen's just going to move knight can't actually do any damage so zako is doing a nice thing here with his pieces if queen takes there is a nice combination knight takes followed by taking here if queen takes the knight takes queen here knight takes here there's bishop b5 defended x-raying and skewering the uh the queen to the rook that's not very nice now shalo does get a pretty good game here but he's down two minutes this is the other thing about playing magnus he plays really quickly all right and he and he he knows when his opponents are nervous right now magnus's queen has to dance out of the way he ends up taking because his opponent only has 30 seconds on the clock and then he does this he's targeting a pawn he has some good pressure here but at the end of he's just going to lose the pawn on h4 that stupid pawn that he put there on the first move of the game well that it sneaks out of the way and now he actually could have a potential thing knocking on the door here now in some completely absurd turn of events that pawn ends up helping magnus very very nicely which is kind of nuts cuz you know it looks like he's just getting destroyed on the queen side right looks like black can simply play b takes for some reason he doesn't plays h6 now magnus does this and zips in with his queen now if black trades the queens here he probably can't lose but he's magnus so for some reason magnus makes him panic and instead he goes for this now if the queens are kept on the board it's probably going to be m and look how quickly magnus can turn on the pressure and by the way the queen can't go to g6 playing defense because of this idiot pawn that he put there magnus plays rook c1 and now it goes from black better to equal to queen g4 to black bishop f6 on the verge of defeat plays rook c7 rook c3 what do you do you can't take this is mate you can't play rook f6 because of rook c7 the only move here is bishop c4 shako 5 seconds on the clock panics takes the bishop loses the rook it's much worse than that because he's actually getting mated he goes here but white's king is safe and magnus wins i i mean the the ease at which he does this is just hilarious i i don't even i don't even know now this was his game against vladimir kramnick and uh he trolled him he trolled mr karnick just realized the uh the dimensions of the board are slightly slightly off the crop is a little bit weird in today's video hold on a second that's that's a little bit strange why is it like that that's okay needs to come up a little bit i think there we go that was weird sorry just realized this profile photo was cut off or maybe that's just the profile photo maybe that's just what it look looks like okay anyway his profile photo tri me out all right whatever that was cnick trolling me so vladimir is playing in title tuesday plays e4 but he spents a minute and 20 seconds on this move because he probably didn't know it was his move that probably also didn't make him very happy magnus goes here age6 this is called the card defense you also notice magnus chad behavior former world champion go to 139 on move one magnus also spending a minute and 20 seconds to even out the clock that is what we call good sportsmanship you know what we call bad sportsmanship playing e6 and a oh my goodness this is one of the most accomplished chess players who has ever lived mr karnick and and magnus is doing this it's unbelievable he's like the kid in the back of the classroom that uh secretly a genius he's just bored in class that's why he's misbehaving now shockingly this is like equal so i might just have to play the magnus opening now black is going to try to use the the pawns as a springboard and it's better to use the queen side as a springboard because the king might still want to castle short which is why he plays b5 all right that pawn could be used for b4 at some point in the future white generally does not want to commit a pawn move here cuz first of all doesn't even stop b4 the bishop will come in second of all it's a little bit of a waste of time because the knight can always wrap around so very common move here is bishop d3 to meet b4 with knight here which would no longer block the bishop and the bishop would be defending the center pawn we can actually watch this from magnus's perspective okay because then he plays c5 he's still not developing any pieces if you're watching this at home and you're young don't play chess like this all right don't you got to put pawns in the center knights bishops and you say well levy gotham does it why not gotham magnus does it why can't i do it if magnus does it cuz he's kind of better than you you know not by a lot but by enough so you shouldn't really do what he does now takes bishop takes so now magnus has gotten rid of one of cranic central pawns and he's actually got two of his own left so if you count the central imbalance black is actually very happy and now he develops his bishop so he's got nice pressure the best move here unquestionably in my opinion uh is e5 e5 for white controls black's natural development and it takes away dark square control i really like this move e5 i'm not going to put it on the board because i think it's going to break the board and it's going to make the clock go back to being zeros which is really annoying white plays a4 here right so karnick is trying to say i think your pawn is stupid a4 could he have considered e5 and maybe bishop f4 developing yes but he plays a4 claiming he's not afraid of b4 so magnus plays b4 and says all right if you're not afraid of b4 let's go and now magnus develops his knight to f6 virtually begging for e5 to be played begging for this move saying you got to play this move lad and then i'm going to jump in i'm going to when the pawn gets here i'm going to trade it or i'm going to target it right but but magnus has this tendency to freeze opponents a little bit and they don't play e5 and instead they play knight g3 which is fine vladimir rotates his knight to g3 very powerful knights control four squares of action white uh black can castle black can play d5 black can also play more passively with d6 he does play d6 he doesn't castle yet he doesn't castle which is very interesting very very i don't know why he's not castling like you ask me the most natural move is castles but clearly maybe he doesn't like e5 maybe he doesn't like white's attacking possibilities maybe he doesn't like e5 and then something will get to the e4 square it'll pressure that diagonal pressure i don't know but he plays d6 k k plays queen e2 now the best move has to be castles right has to be according to the computer it is no magnus plays knight d7 he's not even thinking every move is coming in one second second now it's a little late to play e5 now if you play e5 black actually has enough on that square that he can play bishop takes knight not that one but that one and that hits the queen and actually removes the defender of the e5 pawn completely so black would be very happy now e5 is off the table if e5 is off the table you can activate the knight and the bishop white should now play a5 which karnick does nice positional move rook defends the pawn disconnects black from ever joining the pawns together and prevents anything from going to b6 it's a nice idea but it could be a long-term liability magnus again doesn't castle every move that he's made look at magnus's time from the very beginning of the game 140 every move is around 137 135 137 13839 he's not even thinking every move magnus is making is coming in 1 second finally he spends six seconds and he makes a big decision everything is solid white's got a major pawn break which could work or could or could not work black can of course castle play a long-term game no magnus here attacks karnick with his h pawn wow attacks karnick with his h pawn that is very interesting now the major question is will white play h4 to major decision to make karnick spends 20 seconds and opts not to do this by showing karnick he wants to attack him and getting karnick to play and commit a pawn two magnus will win the g4 square from the g4 square he will not be easily booted and he will apply steady pressure to the white position also after h4 every time a pawn moves something gets stronger something gets weaker the pawn stops guarding the knight that pawn is actually not guarding the knight because it's pinned so a move like d5 would open up a queen takes knight situation very interesting stuff right because you can't take the right can't take kik decides to play bishop g5 computer doesn't like that move doesn't like it a whole lot but it's okay with it now magnus openly says go ahead and take my knight take my knight because then i'm going to get this brick wall in front of my king and i'm going to put my king right there that is so crazy that's such a deep idea hiding the king in the center behind the wall of pawns knowing his opponent can't can in as well and creating a tetris piece of pawns over here the two and one like that all right now knight takes pawn takes magnus has not spent any time he started this game with 140 he i mean he's barely spent any time he's averaging about 1 to two seconds every single move now it's actually okay to play h4 it's okay to play this move but it's still a very big decision because obviously black will get this in the future now vladimir says wait a minute i can take the knight and i can take the pawn and he does magnus straight up loses a pawn not only does he lose a pawn he's lo he might lose another one with check he plays king e 7 and magnus uses this completely ridiculous opening that he played to reverse course in the game did karnick have to take on f6 probably not uh but magnus has a very solid center he's still constantly eyeing for this knight h7 could happen as well queen c6 defends everything and pressures the center and this brick wall just basically prevents white from getting any attack ever white has no access to the black position at all but king e what a position look at this he has a tetris piece of pawns protecting his king queen f3 queen f6 is scary but black can just go here the rooks are coming now the only thing preventing black from getting a totally devastating attack is the fact that the center is blocked and it will be blocked for a while black cannot play the move f5 because white will take ruining the king so karnick just goes back to g3 and now rook h4 which is the best move it is the top engine move now if i'm playing black here i'm going here cuz i want to put my rook there right away no magnus puts the rook on the best possible square simultaneously controlling f4 woo something got in my throat oh my goodness breathe in feel like i breathe in like fuzz or maybe i'm just allergic to magnus's openings rook h4 controls anything going to the fourth rank pressures the pawn prevents queen g4 and sets up a doubling but the best part once you get white to make one pawn move one pawn move you've created a sufficient weakness and that's the knight and now you switch your plan rook g8 hitting the knight all of this is being hit and now after king h2 magnus follows up with the best move i told you a little while ago you can't you can't open up the position that easily here not possible can't play f5 cuz white controls it really really well so instead of f5 magnus plays f5 what yeah leaving that pawn and if pawn takes he's got devastating intentions with e4 that is another reason why the rook needed to come play defense you say what e4 e4 is defended 1 two and three times no cuz when this pawn goes up the queen's door is opened and the queen actually pins the knight to the king which means the knight has no role in the game it's paralyzed so bishop takes a6 karnick bold very bold move grabbing a second pawn and basically saying uh magnus i don't believe you i don't believe you have an attack well now magnus plays bishop takes e4 a very critical decision and white's position is falling apart because black is going to come back and snipe from a distance now we see the power of the bishop pair the bishops are snipers the rooks are snipers f4 is knocking on the door the knight the knight has got a pay up the knight takes now we bring in the rook we see the entire justification of this it's actually beautiful the symphony that magnus conducts with his pieces the queen comes out to h5 s simultaneously putting pressure on the black position but also covering key squares magnus plays rook d4 all right trying to slide his e pawn forward the top computer move here was actually rook f4 with the idea if pawn to g3 e4 sacrificing the rook for a checkmating attack magnus didn't spot that plays rook d4 and instead now kr gets his king out of the way but unfortunately this is game over that's just an attack on the bishop and a checkmate and there is absolutely nothing to be done white's pieces are totally stuck there is no way they can create counterplay the queen goes back he takes the bishop c3 and now we'll see how he converts the game bishop b4 he allows a check and now his king goes to hideout with the pawns again what a safety net for the king a beautiful safety net queen b6 magnus says all right you know what you want to queen trade no problem rook b8 rook a6 rook d6 and uh karnick lost on time here only had one second but of course rook b6 is coming and then you win the end game by planting the bishop firmly winning the b pawn winning the f pawn and marching creating a pass pawn making a queen uh magnus opens with the car defense h6 e6 a6 b5 i might i might give this a little bit of a shot as well i always like to see how he he beats some of the best players in the world also opens up with h four uh magnus tied for first in title tuesday with 9 and 1 half points out of 11 despite not playing a game because there were server problems so he lost a full round he did not get paired he got a zero and he scored nine and a half out of 10 in the games that he did play and he tied for first with nine and a half points um very curious to see what's going to happen next i mean i can't imagine vladimir takes too kindly to trolling nonsense openings but i you know i'm not really sure um the bigger storyline of course is uh is kramnick saying uh these are cheating tuesdays and he's not going to play in them anymore um this might be the third or fourth time he has promised not to come back to play on ch theam he always does he plays against prague he's played against uh fabiano carana recently he plays against strong players who i believe you know he respects and believes are legitimate um oh and one more thing i think magnus to get to 3370 has won 60 he has like 65 out of 70 points like magnus has played 70 games on chess.com and he's got a streak over 60 i think he hasn't lost the game in 45 or 50 games i checked this yesterday it's like completely absurd he has like 45 wins and five draws so in the words of a chess legend some of you may find this very interesting of course that is said tongue and cheek and um yeah let's hope magnus gets the 3,400 blitz it's the month of magnus carlson at the moment on ch.com they have all these bots i will be playing the magn bots pretty soon i'm going to try to get them to play against stockfish as well um that's all that's all get out of here
