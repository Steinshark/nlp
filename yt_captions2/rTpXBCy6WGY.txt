playstation xbox switch wii u pc vr headset i'm all set except this kind of sucks the layout is far from ideal and if i want any airflow at all i have to leave the cabinet doors open while i play which can be a bit of a hazard now my wife and i like the way this thing looks but nothing about it seems to have been designed to be functional and looking at some of the newer options online i can't help but wonder what the heck people are supposed to be putting in these look at the dimensions of these cutouts does no one in the furniture industry play video games and what i'm supposed to put books in my blu-ray player so with that in mind our only course of action was to break out the tools and with the help of our sponsor solidworks take a nice looking cabinet to the next level to satisfy our tech needs we've got cooling dust filtration rgb and a few extra special touches to inspire your ultimate media console or maybe inspire the furniture industry to get its act together so we don't have to do this stuff ourselves thank you solidworks for sponsoring this project they were a huge help in making this build check out their 3d experience solidworks for makers offer in the video description and stick around to learn more [music] right out of the gate while it would have been fun to go the full costume route thanks to yeah let's oh this is the back thanks to designer charlie zagaroli really okay sounds like a fake name we didn't have to go from scratch his enzo media console actually has a ton of the elements that we would include in a from scratch design including a durable marble top classic color scheme and perhaps most importantly a killer sale price on black friday when i bought it the first thing we did after taking delivery of the enzo was to have tim from the lab recreate it in cad using solidworks features like externally controlled parametric equation files are a lifesaver for projects like this we are adding all of the little funky details and dimensions can end up taking a staggering amount of time with the model finalized we were able to start planning the perfect gaming cabinet starting with cable management bar for improvement though is very low here i mean many cabinets actually including my own have the cable management holes up high on the shelves for some reason why would you want to consolidate your cables up high where you can see them even better before you run them around to the back where they're no longer visible it makes no sense unfortunately charlie in his infinite wisdom didn't actually do much better the holes a don't match the picture b are kind of centered in terms of height and c aren't even symmetrical between the two sides the solution though a replacement full metal back that will allow us to drill any additional holes that we need and then pin everything down using the upcoming magnetic ltt store cable management arches as i mentioned before though modern cabinets need more than just good looks they need to be functional and the biggest thing i've struggled with is cooling i mean it blows my mind on uh that more cabinets don't include mounting points for ventilation fans i mean a mid-range gaming pc or current gen console will easily kick off 150 to 200 watts while it's running so i've always had to add fan holes myself and even my efforts haven't always been enough which has resulted in these needing to stay open and actually being accidentally knocked off on more than one occasion let me show you what i mean i'm going to go ahead and fire up a gpu stress test and while this is heating up let's take a closer look at the upgraded cooling solution in cabinet v3 over there check this out we found another excuse to use one of these massive 200 mil by 30 millimeter noctua fans these things are all about moving the most air with the lowest noise possible and at 86 cfm we're going to be replacing the entire volume of the interior of this cabinet about every four seconds at just' decibels we're going to lose some performance to the dust filter though so we might actually have to add a second one for good measure but this is a pretty good starting point you can see i actually had things not bad we're getting just about maximum turbo out of this founders edition rtx 3080 but it gets pretty loud and you can actually smell hot electronics when you open the door it's not a very good time in here let's see do we actually get a little bit more frequency when we open up the door too really but temps are dropping and it's getting quieter fan speed 69 nice nice next order of business this all has to come out this thing's really cool i have a little hdmi 2.1 switch up here that's meant to be an extension for a marantz brand receivers but you can just use it completely stand alone and get three inputs to one input on your tv or your receiver or whatever the case may be my universal remote didn't have support for this model because logitech no longer supports their harmony remotes but i was able to just pick the last gen one and all the signals worked exactly the same yeah as long as i really didn't think about is these these ir blasters have to be within cable reach of the main universal remote hub and within signal reach of every device inside or on top of the media console and positioning them so that they actually hit everything every time can beat such a why did i only decide to switch this thing out do we have drawers wait you said drawers but you pointed up okay thank you do i seem smart to you most of the time that's about destructive and answer as i could have asked for with a question like that ah yes if i was wondering what it contained now i know feels like it's made of paper charles paper really great cable management handhold thing at the back we've got a little lip on here so your stuff doesn't come flying out the front in case gravity changes orientation they're saying the darts cord flows change in direction oh these are actually these are pretty good shelf hangers though i know i approve of these especially after the trouble we had with the msi yeah not bad i don't believe that off on this i think they're going behind his back which harley would have put a cable management hole in a slightly less stupid place slightly hey linus oh well that explains why there's serial numbers or something printed into the top of these shelves you're probably not supposed to see those you know what i like my theory that they're supposed to go up to prevent things from falling out oh it doesn't really prevent anything 10 gig link back to the server room and then gigabit for everything here except the gaming pc which can actually get 10 gig unfortunately this is an older 10 gig switch so it won't do multi-gig it won't do two and a half or five which honestly okay okay what you don't like my cable management hole what's your problem that's a glory hole this thing is this it absolutely dwarfs the other one damn it harrison did you check the dimensions yeah did you check them with me you had this sideways uh-huh it worked yeah it worked wouldn't you rather have it more accessible well i don't know and the point is every console right you have to get an xbox and a playstation and all that in there how else will i play psvr and i'm not playing psvr okay fine uh we might as well just load things in it now yeah let's get this out of here uh there's a hole here vr that's vr you know this is a drawer though is there a slit in the side of the drawer i had some input on this but i wasn't familiar with all the details going into things today we had this argument once before let's do it again'0 degrees cables towards the back seriously i think you're high no i i think it's the absolute best decision what the absolute best decision is an extremely strong choice of words there are three choices there are three orientations that we can put this in cables towards the back is by far the most functional what do you lose out on by having the power button at the front you're not wrong i mean it's awful but it might be right look at it i can't you can't now i see it okay that's convenient but now i see it fine it's better to chosen it wins so vr goes in here and then the idea is that it just hangs out the front yeah like this yeah whenever you want a vr you don't have a door open to get knocked off okay i think that this is less stupid actually not bad not bad less stupid that's good i mean that's the bar just treated myself to some adequate craftsman clippers this side is sticking up about a millimeter more than this side that that will i wouldn't describe it as smooth but that's more what we're looking for functional we went from straight to straight functional cool vr headset installed uh so i'm kind of thinking switch this side or i don't know i guess it doesn't really matter the wii u matters more than you think okay this wii u is central to the experience how else will we play motion control games shut up vr motion control no no no not vr motion control i'm talking classic motion control i cannot duck hunt no no the shield boom shield i do have to say i'm having some second thoughts about the multiple shelves in here way to go harrison um you know what we could do is we could go shield on top of wii u h and then switch like this and that's a little bit easier to get at hmm it's almost like i had a cad model to work off of you know you went from i wouldn't call anything that you did stupid to wow you're an idiot really fast that's uh i think a record time would you like the left hand shells now that we're taking them out would you like you left your face got them okay i'm up oh wait where do all the consoles go right hand side oh and these i can probably all hit all of with one ir blaster that i'll just put up here in the top that means the marantz thing is going to have to go over here as well iron blasters cannot hit nintendo devices so the only thing on this shelf that this needs to actually hit is the nvidia shield the only other things that need ir are the tv which will get hit by the bubble that sits on the top and the computer which is using this bad boy so we may only actually need one ir blaster but i feel like i should put one in up here for future proofness or something oh no this marantz hdmi switch also needs to be hit by the ir blaster oh god where's the hub the hub which is here oh my god this pile of wires is a problem that's it that's it for cable management stuff you don't think that's enough good savory dressing okay i need a glue gun who needs to screw things in when you can simply wait we left the wood backing in oh it's on the back we didn't replace it though no i thought it would look better if you only had wood inside i wanted magnetic mounting everywhere this is what happens when i roughly lay out the scope for a project then m to z slash go on vacation and then come back and we shoot we just need stronger magnets watch this i can't even put this one down because the one in my hand is so strong but it's grabbing onto it these are thick boys just wait it'll stick my life hands you would get a bigger magnet watch this to give you some idea how strong the ones i'm holding are to actually see the field yeah from this far away yeah that's with a few of them stacked mind you but they're they're still they're still quite op but how do they work here's the plan i'm going to take this magnet and i'm going to glue it to the bottom of the shelf then i'm going to take this magnet and i am going to glue it to the bottom of this thing then they're gonna go smashy smashy stick okay no problem no problem right right okay at least we have metal on the back so when we go to mount a power bar now we can basically just go chunk these magnetic power strip holders are going to be an absolute game changer once they hit the store i know i've been teasing them for literally months at this point i assure you we are working on them they are coming diametrically opposed wiring detangling strategy see you later man untangles wires for multiple hours all of worlds stunned are you writing haikus man it really would be better to have the right shelves because then it would have the little heidi thing on the you know i'm gonna go get them no no i'm over it i'm already gluing things to what it is the top of these shelves so forget it ow that's very hot it's magnet it has a hole in the middle i just put my finger in hot glue that's really smart having a kind of date just go away first day back from vacation easy day oh it's tidy right tell me it's tidy no don't look that close don't look that close ow darn it i stuck my finger in it again all right no problem and you're not glue in your beard boom got him wait do we even have enough hdmi for all those consoles and stuff i mean long time viewers are gonna know that anymore we're just showing that you could i want this ir receiver for the computer ah ouch ouch ouch darn it ow both too hot for my hands and too cold to actually stick nailed it really got things under control here right now foreign okay does that look okay i can even see that okay [laughter] you have a seat okay it's so big it's all right don't look at the cabinet look at the tv it's so huge everything's fine so this um avon hasn't seen it yet maybe we could put a plant or something like a space filler so you don't feel like you're coming around this corner and gonna like no take yourself out oh freak it's so big oh no okay but hey it'll hold a lot of stuff right damn boy i am loving this all magnetic back just boom power bricks just stuck on there easy that makes me feel very good because i was bound to say something encouraging eventually are we gonna get all this in here heck yeah i mean today slightly less heck yeah yeah slightly well we've solved a few problems for example we have these dots to hopefully deal with this bottom thing uh no no no you know what let's try double stack two dots and then we'll put a white one in the middle and we'll have an oreo okay this is not going well quadruple stack drupals what i mean i guess it's better than that the good news is that some other things went really well so we got the hole for the second 200 millimeter fan in here looks absolutely awesome and things get even better you're probably wondering about those metal frames that we put on the fans earlier that's for these that's right magnetic fan filters boom um boom again okay they don't stick amazingly they're not like the super strong kind of magnet but hey once the fan is spinning it's going to stay on there no problem it'll just suck it on there and they are temperature controlled okay not with the most sophisticated mechanism but these little control boards are actually pretty cool you set your target temperature with dip switches and then you use a potentiometer to control the speed of the fan it sure as heck not from corsair i'll tell you that much which is good though because it means we don't have to have software running for it to work and it also means that it can cool the cabinet when we're running a game console rather than a pc that's what the space over here is for what controls the rgb lighting i just noticed those rgb strips in here now whatever button you press oh assistant's guppy goby goby oh okay so you could just put like effects and stuff in there if you really wanted to hello cool we've made some big improvements to the charging situation this is not that different from before fundamentally in that there's one of these brand who must not be named uh usb charging hubs and then a whole bunch of usb cables in a pile but now the pile moves using the magic of where's that stapler using the magic of a handheld stapler we were able to just take this power cord and carefully not puncture it being sure to only work on it while it was not plugged into the wall staple it to the cabinet staple it here so it just kind of sits here with just the right amount of slack and then when we need our stuff boom easy access these are called watchmen they're the receivers for the trackers that i wear for vr streaming and the problem with these is that the reception sucks so it's possible that we could go with shorter usbc cables and just run them off the back here and just kind of sit them on the back of the computer it's also entirely possible that with this metal grille in front of them they won't work inside here at all got it so we might end up getting a little bit creative and i was kind of thinking maybe we run them out the back and actually can i put them here so that there's wood in between us and them yeah these are not amazing yeah these don't really uh stay in here hey we're gonna have this linked in the video description but that's not going to be a recommendation to buy it i mean realistically i'm not charging any of these on here anyway so these cables can just go micro b how old are these yeah i'm sure we could 3d print something better than these good enough for the video and then he never updated it yeah these have to be c to c right because you need separate controllers for them okay that was a troubleshooting step um i thought i needed separate controllers for these but it turns out it was actually just wireless interference so maybe i do maybe i don't but what i know for sure is that most of my usb ports on this thing are see now because of that card so yes okay long story short if you're wondering what we're talking about this is a super cool usb card right here it's got eight usbc 10 gigabit per second ports but that's not what's neat about it what's neat is that it has four separate controllers for them so it actually gets the full bandwidth to each pair of them that means full bandwidth for devices like cameras or high-speed external storage and it also means that if there's any interference between different devices say audio devices can be pretty picky about what else is plugged into the same port that all goes away by just plugging into a dedicated controller i love how we started with magnetic everything and then it tests how long to break out the hot glue you broke out the hot glue on day one i undid your hot glue and replace it with magnets are you happy with all the crossers now there's nothing else to go from this shelf to that one yeah okay yeah i think i think we're good i mean i'll probably find stuff but it's simple enough to just this drawer out and then run a thing and this is cool the hole here is not quite big enough for this to seriously why is this thing such a piece of crap look at this harrison three thousand dollars look at how much play there is why am i the only one outraged about the quality of we're gonna have to do an ltt store media cabinet at this point no honestly though like apparently this is acceptable look at that i'm gonna have to break out the same long stupid drill bit and the same countersink thing to do the same after the fact repairs on this thing that i had to do on my old one and that one was like 600 bucks not too big and didn't have drawers that don't work look i'm not blaming you i'm just saying that you're the one who spent my money on this i didn't wanna yvonne's notorious for not checking the dimensions of things before she orders them she ordered this dollhouse for the girls she was like oh yeah this will fit in our house this thing's like five feet tall i'm like you know it has dimensions right on the site i didn't expect it to be that big right but the dimensions are right on the site you know i'm kind of feeling games on display on the shelf and maybe this is just random accessories every family has a drunk drawer yeah yeah junk drawer trunk drawer okay yeah theoretically this is just gonna work you ready what are the unable to reach hub okay good start yeah we changed the access points and this thing is one of those stupid things that won't just be like oh the ssid is the same and the password's the same no problem the red light went off yeah the red light went off indeed i don't think this is going to work i have no idea what's happening right now okay let's try lg tv power toggle okay well that worked hey hey sick and it's even spinning man nocturnal makes good stuff hey yeah they're spinning i wonder if the ir thing just is confused because it's plugged into a different port than usual or something like that i'm willing to bet that's the one well let's just start ripping stuff out is the unknown usb device out yet come on why would you do that oh right this that was the dongle for me jeez way to go harrison i think it has to plug into usb 2. gpu stress test now what i want to see oh my goodness these fans are on already you've got it real sensitive over here hey i've left them at the default settings really this is just default yeah about how's our frequency yeah yeah it's a little bit better we are actually getting slightly better performance our gpu fan is still kicking into high gear here i guess there's just not really a lot we can do about that though because we're pumping fresh air right into it at the bottom of the case kind of is what it is then substantially louder actually having this open in the front hmm do not anticipate that okay ltt store media cabinet definitely learning some things like maybe acoustic treatment inside maybe not as big maybe brought to you by our sponsor solidworks 3d experience
