the most popular tech wiki ever was this one from 2014 where we explained intel's core i3 i5 and i7 cpus but they say a lot can change in eight years and in this case they were right so today we're going to give you a roundup of intel's current 13th gen desktop processor lineup updated for 2023 while the upcoming laptop versions of these cpus will likely have specs a little different than what's presented in this episode their overall use cases will be similar we're going to start at the very top of intel's current product stack and talk about the core i9 which displays the core i7 as the highest end consumer processor lineup back in 2017. simply put current core i9 models give you the most cores and the most cash period intel's current 13th gen of cpus codenamed raptorlake gives you 36 megabytes of cash and a total of 24 cores on an i9 eight multi-threaded high performance cores that kick in when you're doing something cpu intensive and 16 more power efficient cores for less taxing workloads i9s also come with turbo boost max 3.0 which sounds like a power ranger spin-off but is actually a feature that identifies your specific cpu's fastest cores for an extra bump in speed core 99s also feature the highest boost frequencies so they're best for gaming although for the money it's probably best to only pull that trigger if you really need the power for heavy duty creative work like 3d rendering or video editing moving down the ladder you have the core i7 which is kind of like a mini core i9 you get the same 8 high performance cores but only eight efficiency cores for a still generous total of 16. although the cache size is slightly reduced to 30 megabytes you still get turbo boost max 3.0 the core i7 can be a good buy if you're a streamer and can use the extra cores or if you're a content creator that doesn't need quite as much power as the core i9 offers next up is the core i5 which is actually going to be the sweet spot for most of you we'll tell you why right after we thank freshbooks for sponsoring this video when building a business it's easy to feel like there aren't enough hours in the day and if you're doing all the invoicing and accounting on your own you're probably spending too much time on paperwork freshbooks is an all-in-one accounting software that can save you several hours a week that's more time to spend nailing a client pitch serving your customers or just enjoying the company of those you love and right now there's a special offer just for our listeners head over to freshbooks.com techwiki to get 90 off your freshbook subscription for four months the core i5 has only six high performance cores and either four or eight efficiency cores depending on the model you get but that's still more than enough to qualify for the good bang for your buck award if you're going to use your pc primarily for gaming you get less cash either 24 or 20 megabytes and there's no turbo boost max 3.0 but that trade-off comes with a very significant reduction in price and just because it's a mid-range doesn't mean it's a slouch and creative apps either sitting below the i5 is the core i3 which has a more straightforward composition you get four high performance cores 12 megabytes of cash and that's it these specs are sufficient for light to moderate gaming but might struggle a bit in the aaa titles that are now asking for six or more cores but you do get a dramatic reduction in price so it's something you could look at if you don't need tons of power but want to do some reasonable multitasking without your computer breaking a sweat and at the very bottom of the product stack well it's a little unclear as to how intel will brand this segment going forward the desktop side is still as of now using the pentium branding for the higher end budget cpus and celeron for the lowest end entry models but on the laptop side intel has gotten rid of pentium and celeron and replaced him with a single brand called intel processor which is so generic it's confusing it isn't clear right now whether future desktop chips will follow suit but given that intel's website already seems to be de-emphasizing the pentium and celeron brands it wouldn't at all surprise us once you get down to this level don't expect to do anything aside from light work and casual gaming if you want a bit more power for multitasking go with a pentium otherwise you can save a few bucks by opting for a celeron which will work just fine as long as you don't push it beyond a few basic tasks at the same time hopefully this has helped you make sense of intel's letter number gumbo now if you'll excuse me i'm off to go have a bowl of alphabet soup um alphabets so thanks for watching if you like this video like it if you dislike it dislike it and check out our other videos and maybe maybe leave a video suggestion in the comments and subscribe and follow follow is there following on youtube oh you could ring the bell that's what you could do that's like following
