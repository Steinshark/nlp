a lesson in hard work this is a copy of my medium post which the prime gin couldn't open which is the copy of my linkedin post which the prime gen couldn't open so i've reactivated my university blogging account just for you i hope you like it i do thank you for this meme this is a great meme i remember making this meme uh i originally made this meme to say uh uh what's it called for rich harris and i rich harris and i did a little side by side and i wanted them to look like the usual suspects and so i made this originally then uh if this is p color you need to go to the doctor okay this ain't p color if your p looks like this go to the doctor please well i hope the music doesn't ruin that intro uh it is a trend nowadays to say work smart and not work hard and to say them let's see and just damn it thank you appreciate that the forgotten yeah uh let's see okay let's see that is equivalent to saying using half your potential oh okay okay okay that i mean that this is a strong this is strong uh that is like lifting weights with one hand the world record for two-handed uh weightlifting is more than double the world record for one-handed weightlifting so one plus one is greater than two in this case working smart when combined with working hard has the potential for exponential growth okay okay i like i like where this is going i do like where this is going many people think that jeff bezos and bill gates are incredibly smart individuals and they got rich because of that but they don't see the years of hard work and dedication that was behind their success uh besides for bill gates potentially stealing a bunch of things from what was his name tim something steven something i can't remember uh but jeff bezos like you look at some of those old pictures of amazon he has like he has like uh doll gary kildall killed all right kill killdal is that the person's name anyways like jeff bezos has this picture of it's like an amazon play like a banner he has some hair and he's like in an office like i'm making amazon right so yeah i mean it didn't start off amazing he had 250 000 i forgot how he got 250 000 and he used that to support himself while he worked for a long time right well he had hair at that point uh it is in portland the work uh let's see it's important to state both smart and hard work together because often only one of them is advertised as the key factor of success but that is misleading society must learn to delve deep into the topic before deciding a verdict and understand concept and issues from a holistic perspective okay now i mean come on what do you do society decides based on a tweet okay real talk i go like this i go to twitter and i jump on here and i go like this work hard tweet it send it now and guess what people are gonna be pissed i'm gonna get those kind of things you can do all sorts of different statements like this just makes people all sorts of rascally and angry and now i've also lost where i was there we go we're back epic tweet oh people can get so angry on this one we'll watch at the end of this and people will be like well most of you are going to jump in that tweet and be like oh deez nuts got over god right i don't wanna i don't want to read that all right that is the only way to make real progress my commitment to uh to hard work and smart work is by doing every let's see is by working every day and night okay well sometimes you want to take you know you got you got to know when to ease off the brakes man i haven't taken a single day off from the office in three years since i completed my bachelor and joined the company okay you know i'm not sure uh i'm not sure if this is good you know like i know there's seasons where you work really hard and i've been there i remember my first couple years i was working wild and one thing i think that probably makes a difference also is do you have community at your job i found that when i had community at my job i worked a lot more hours right um and two do you have kids i think kids make a make a uh make a lot of difference i don't know if this is satire or not but i'm just taking this currently as not satire right i don't know if this is satire so i'm just taking it as not satire um but you know when i had kids it greatly changed my hours and how i worked you know what i mean because all of a sudden there's like a whole new world that i really have to consider and it really it genuinely changed who i am have i missed a single day of work at the office no do i have a lot of leaves accumulated yes are a lot of them expiring and have expired yes have i worked overtime almost every day yes am i getting paid for overtime no do i care no am i normal no why am i doing this i'll tell you below keep reading okay that's straight i mean this is a whole strange sentence right here let's find out i have met some incredibly smart people and have worked under some amazingly brilliant minds mine's so smart and so foreseeing that i often left awestruck and sometimes confused about the decisions made they can see more into the future than i can right now and that i find and that i find unacceptable they are giants of knowledge and i am a i am but a hobbit okay they work incredibly hard and smartly i love the lee at the end that the only resource i am left with if i'm if i'm to catch up to them is time so i must use time as an ally if i work hard i work harder for longer if they make smart decisions i think and learn for longer and while they relax or sleep i'll close the distance between us and us slowly but surely this is a this is a hard this is a hard mentality here i you know i'm not so sure about this um the generation of future i'm gonna i'm gonna try to give my opinion at the end of this but let's hear let's let the person cook okay let's let them cook the generation of future is being built now enough of looking at success stories uh through life hacks or billionaires trying to row their boat through a bridge or ceo trying to fight each other in a cage match okay that i mean that's funny focus on improving yourself every day uh this will pay a bountiful dividends in the future so i do agree i do agree with this statement you know every night or weekend after completing my office work i try to build the tools and technologies that i might that i think might be useful every night or weekend i try to think about what i can contribute to help the business this enables me to understand business and technology and more importantly learn to uh to gain a holistic perspective on the world this is my free life hack to build and deploy production level software for the benefit of myself and the company i can get my ideas tested in the real world and see their benefits this enables me to think as a manager product developer security knock engineer software developer artist ui ux etc many people in the world do not have the opportunity to work so when you are presented with one you must must make the most of it you must learn not to just do the work but also to understand the mechanisms and complex processes that govern the work uh the work going on this will enable you to contribute more and improve yourself slowly and steadily becoming the giants you admire it is important to think as it is to work only doing both will lead to true success let's let them finish cooking okay hold on let's let him finish cooking farmers for example work incredibly hard they must possess knowledge of the plants they grow the seasons and affect our crops harvesting methods best crop storage practices money lending or borrowing techniques financing and so much more even after all this incredible knowledge they still must go out and work from dawn to dusk and tend uh the crop each day i'm incredibly let's say i'm an incredible of their craft and dedication hard work yet people under people have absolutely no effing idea how much people like one of my good buddies is a potato farmer literally works from like 6 a.m to 10 p.m for months on end to just get things going right and that's part of a farmer's life it is a i mean can you compare the two i don't know but it is very very hard like i i don't know if you can say they're the same or you should say they're the same but it's just a very interesting perspective that there are professions that require work that is incredibly different than what we do i don't buy the whole you know thought workers if you will can only work for 30 hours a week before becoming burnt out i definitely don't think that that's real uh but i don't think that you can just continuously work the top management of famous companies often comment about how they work 16' 20 hours or even sleepless sleeplessly every day while they uh while this may be expressive hyperbole of the hard work and pressure they face in their jobs as heads of large organization it serves as a reminder to others that no matter how high you reach there is still room to grow higher and if the top management is not sleeping then we must also strive just as hard and develop ourselves you know the problem about not sleeping is that it's kind of a pay me pay me now pay me later problem you know what i mean because if you don't sleep well you get dementia you get horrible horrifying disease problems in your brain and your brain rapidly gets awful and i don't think i want that i want to end well you know what i mean uh cortisol levels yeah absolutely huge cortisol levels you get all sorts of problems i like a good amount of hydration a good amount of exercising a decently good diet and a lot of exercise and good sleep right i think all those are really really healthy and then some good like side physical hobbies and so i do do a little bit of you know a little bit of gardening i do a little bit attending uh the field that i have i have to like do a lot of weeding and all that and a little bit of cocaine of course absolutely just a touch you know just a touch to make it fun but you know like physical hard work is just different than mental work and i'm not sure you can relate the two and they both have their version of burnout really hard physical work means that you spend your body fast and then towards the end of your life you hurt and so they're likely is an equivalence i'm not sure if physical is easier i don't believe that statement i'm not sure which one is it is you know what i mean you have no joints left so one would argue that if you did the same thing with your brain could you also experience something at towards the end of your life you know like if you really think about it we've never lived in a world where this much thought is just like freely being worked on right this mental work life is a very new world concept right a thousand years ago people weren't like oh you know what i do i work from home yeah i sit at home and i study i'm just a studier like you know like a hundred people got to do that you know like it wasn't like a huge crowd of people got to do this so i don't know i'm not sure that whole autopilot thing i also don't know about that when i was in college i did literally study math for 16 hours a day to catch back up did i think it was bad no was i able to catch back up absolutely did i become number one in my class absolutely so is it bad is it good i don't know are there seasons where you really want to fight hard i think so are there seasons where you need to back off absolutely i do i can't i just i just don't think to me this article is not necessarily an article that i think people should strive for i think that you're i am less worried about burnout i don't think you'll be burnt out if you enjoy if you can find joy in what you're doing or satisfaction in what you're doing but i do think it is most certain that you will end up having health problems and that will lead to a life of despair health problems are incredibly incredibly difficult and they can be incredibly incredibly like hurt deep down and that's not worth it either you know i've met some people there's this guy that will be in chat every now and then rxjx and you know he was he was this person he would work constantly dude he ended up getting some some problems some health problems that affect him for the rest of his life well you know and he had to completely change his diet how he exercises his sleep patterns and all these different things and it was really hard on him and i still think about that a lot because i also was the person i was like yeah hell yeah but then i learned from him and i was like gotta back off you know you got to do something different you know anyways it is clear that society has evolved so much over the years that we were able to enjoy so many comforts in life absolutely be happy about what you get in life uh but that has the unfortunate consequence of making a lot of people lazy uh yeah i think it's easier to like we don't have the same needs for sure uh i think people people optimize to their situation it's hard it's hard to say it's lazy but it's also easy to say it's lazy i'm not sure i can't say either way uh the comforts we enjoy uh are not to be used for showing off to others but rather to increase our productivity and improve society i consider it incredibly wasteful when people destroy things waste food litter etc on that team while some people dude i really am on that team you know how many hours a year i spend picking out of my my property because people throw it off on the street near us i do it all the time it is so frustrating while some people may enjoy the luxury of having so much food material goods etc they don't consider the impact it has on society many videos go viral of such acts but the wastage is unbearable for me the incredible amount of work that went into growing those crops slash building those things is completely wasted society does not improve by such acts we must learn to always respect the money food and work of others and use them in such a way to help society i mean great ending to this i i'm i'm loving the ending to this i i think we should be much much more careful about what we do with things even if like i even run off well water and i still try to be very careful with the water i use because it feels free but that doesn't mean it is free right uh all of these does not let's see all of this does not mean we must we mustn't take breaks taking breaks is incredibly important to energize oneself but you haven't taken a break but i think i can see but i think we can train ourselves to take breaks in a new way instead of sitting and browsing the internet so we can think about the future and how to achieve that studying working on improving ourselves as a leisurely activity a kind let's see a kind of hardcore lifestyle as you can say i do agree that browsing the internet is not a great way to take a break because you're still activating your mind but you're activating your mind on just like the worst form of dopamine hitting i like i i'm on that team that that's not good but i think you should be doing like you should be connecting with people or exerting yourself physically or or enjoying more sleep you know what i mean doom scrolling is awful doom scrolling is awful you know what i mean unless you're watching the private yeah yeah keep watching me though keep watching hey tune tune in okay buddy okay follow me on twitch give me your twitch prime right now give me them get ready um i am suggesting that we make working more enjoyable than seeing random videos on facebook or looking at memes on reddit uh i'm actually on this team i think working is way more enjoyable i am suggesting that something like reading watching useful stuff is such as engineering concepts or business ideas on linkedin or udemy etc i say linkedin because i find more intellectual content here more often i'm browsing a different linkedin then oh watching the private account since he's technically it technically is enlightening in us all let's go got him other sites have a higher proportion of distractive content certain subreddits can be quite informative as well uh every day i try to change my mindset and i try to find enjoyment in thinking and learning hard concepts i mean that's good this is a good my this is good to have i have preached this a thousand times which is a hard thing is a good thing an easy life is not a good thing like i don't think that i i'm completely on that team but there's there's once you have you you have to measure what is a you know what is enough of a hard thing there's you know there's complexities here like having a wife and kids the hard thing is saying no to wanting to learn the reason why i can't make the progress in o camel which is eating me alive is because i'd rather spend time with my kids or with my wife and that's hard that's a different kind of hard do you know what i mean that's a it's hard in the worst way because there's the lower will this desire to just like really crush in and do something i almost probably get dopamine effects from learning and all that but the hire will says no don't think about it don't let your mind be distracted be engaged with your kids and man there's these times where i can feel it creeping feeling this desire feeling to want to go do this and it's like you have to reel it back and you i mean the hardest part is not just being present physically but being there like emotionally or mentally or whatever you want to call that right like that is hard and i find that to be one of the hardest activities ever but i absolutely love the challenge of being better at that present uh to all my engineering folks less experienced than me i suggest you build complete microservices on something which can be useful for you and your team for example i i'm this good i mean it's good yeah if you're learning how to learn and you want to get a good job this is a great piece of experience i think this is great for example in my personal case i built a microservice to collect data from all of our microservices we had multiple portals to access information from our databases logging platforms and so many apis that are many microservices etc that it wasted a lot of time to find log in and access them so on my weekends out of my own interest i built the microservice that connected to everything else and provided a common platform to access everything in one go that's great experience by the way i'm a back-end developer who knows back-end popular languages like java kotlin deez nuts golang c plus plus python etc by doing this i learned front-end technologies like javascript react framework etc i also learned about docker to build microservices and nginx to route to different requests for multiple applications running on the same container i think of this as my mini product and my teammates as my customers that's good this is tools developer mindset right here every weekend i spend some time thinking about how i can improve my me and my uh teammates lives and help boost productivity by adding cool new features so i mean this is a good habit to be in in some sense um like when i built the tool that i'm currently working on netflix this was my mentality of how can i improve this thing from me and the people working on this product how can i do that what are the key points how can i make something useful and in my own time and time of work i went and and crushed out something that was awesome and now i'm happy i did it throughout my senior engineers who are more experienced with me thank you for taking uh care of younger folks you're a guide who let's see you are the guide who will lead them to greatness i hope you're able to teach or learn to teach the younger folks some valuable lessons which may help them in the future be kind to those under you they will surely repay your kindness and learn from each other for the younger generation is building so many cool new things that soon you might have a hard time keeping up with us it's an interesting take i do think that the one of the most important things i've ever done is teaching i don't like teaching i truly don't but i think it's one of the greatest activities to partake in being able to explain something to somebody who thinks differently than you makes you understand the topic in a very deep way he's definitely oh he's most certainly a kid i mean the fact that he thinks that the younger generation is building cool things okay i've seen react server components i'm not buying it uh i have taken a lot let's see i have taken a lot over the years i have relentlessly consumed a lot of knowledge from varying sources i've watched lectures from mit and red developer notes in chinese i've seen so many tutorials on youtube and read so many articles on blog sites that i feel it unfair to keep my knowledge shared with me a secret those who helped me did so with the purpose of improving society and advancing mankind i believe and must do my part by returning the favor and helping those who may find this article useful so the danger of an article like this is that ultimately what you're doing is you're making work or knowledge or self-improvement your god and it's a man's are ever and unsatiated and i find that to be a very dangerous thing so you really do have to be careful about making work self-improvement any of those things god because that's not a good god that's a bad god that's a god that will never be satisfied that's a god that will constantly drive you and you will end up getting sick you'll end up losing a lot of life you'll end up missing out on opportunities that are significantly better i love the drive for knowledge though i love the willingness to do hard things i love that you favor hard work i think that's good i think that's a really really good good mentality but not all heart the problem is is that hard work can become a drug just like any other drug and it can enslave you just as hard as any other drug and you will affect those around you and yourself so you got to learn to say no and do the hard thing for you which is to not do it being in control of yourself your actions and your responses are very very very hard that's what i say if you in here can't sit down for 10 hours and crush out a problem undisturbed and do it well then i think you have a problem and if you can't help but to constantly work i think you have a problem if you are not in control of yourself i think you have a problem right you've just let the lower will win whatever that lower will looks like right be be the dog not the tail do you know what i mean there you go that's my that's my opinion on this article uh just like everything i think there's i think there's meat and i think there's bones uh eat the eat the fish spit the bones eat the fish spit the bones
