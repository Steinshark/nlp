samsung's marketing is geared toward the kinds of people whose eyes glaze over the second they hear terms like qd oled panel freesync premium pro or usb power delivery all of which are included on this monitor and yet all of which are absent from its product page i mean for many gamers this process is enough but this is linus tech tips you all want hey need to know every little detail when you're shopping for a gaming monitor and samsung yes sponsored this video packed this display to the gills with features that i get to tell you about including their incredible qdo-led panel that we have already seen in action a couple of times and absolutely fallen in love with i mean it's not cheap but it did say odyssey g8 in the title so you already knew it was going to be among the best gaming displays on the planet let's crack our open inside the box we find some things we expect like a monitor stand and a visa adapter it's a curved monitor so you'll need one of these if you want to use it with a base amount it's nice that that's included and some things we don't expect like a remote that's right the oled g8 packs in a bunch of the same features that you would find in samsung's smart tvs like built-in streaming apps and even some free tv channels through samsung tv plus which is great if you want a display that can pull double duty as a more tv-like experience say if you're living in a dorm room or something and it's got a couple of 5 watt speakers which sound surprisingly usable actually maybe even good stand assembly is a straightforward affair we've got a nice hefty base for the bottom that screws on with two number two phillips head screws lttstore.com but as much as i love stands this this is the centerpiece it it worked on this oled a grand total of zero times on their product page for the oled g8 seriously go look go check i'll wait but they should because this panel is based on the exact same technology as samsung's s95b tv and is as close as you can get to zero compromises every pixel on it turns off completely for incredibly deep blacks and because you don't need to wait for the crystals to slowly change positions like on an lcd this is the fastest display in samsung's lineup with pixels boasting response times of just 0.1 milliseconds gray to gray in practice this results in virtually no blur to all 3440 by 1440 pixels especially if you're running at the maximum 175 hertz refresh rate none of that is what makes this so special though any outlet is going to be fast with deep blacks qd oled uses a quantum dot layer to overcome traditional oled's biggest shortcomings though like subpar brightness and the potential for burning it also significantly pumps up the color gamut for the best looking gaming that we've ever seen we should probably have a game open let's get it let's get a game going here what do you think should we mix it up and go with do maternal i don't have it installed on here you bastard how dare how dare you no it is installed oh yes oh got him we have a much more detailed explanation in this video here but the short version is that quantum dots are particles that get excited by one wavelength of light then with incredible efficiency turn that into a different wavelength of light so instead of rgbw sub pixels that shine out in their respective colors w is white to boost brightness at the expense of saturation you get a single color of oled panel that excites an rgb quantum dot layer in front of it this allows that single color oled panel behind it to wear out much more gracefully over time ploof from our writing team for example has been gaming on his qdo-led for six months already with no sign of burn-in whatsoever and it does all of this while boosting brightness and improving color saturation thanks to the absence of that white subpixel of course there's a lot more to a monitor than just the stand samsung included their neo quantum processor to help with a number of things starting of course with hey cool look at that that's their upgraded correlating module with core sync and it helps with image optimization and powers the tizen-based smart entertainment media and gaming hub that helps improve gaming scaling through the use of machine learning media and gaming center on a monitor that's right built right into the monitor is access to all your favorite streaming apps including game streaming apps like geforce now and xbox game pass ultimate so you can play a ton of amazing games without worrying about your power hungry pc heating up your room it also enables the oled g8 to support amd freesync premium pro which gives you the benefits of variable refresh rate with hdr so you get a great picture with strong resistance to tearing or to stuttering even if your system is struggling to hold a steady 60fps frame rate i know this is the older horizon but does this ever look so good it's worth noting by the way that do maternal can only run high refresh rate or hdr because the game doesn't support freesync premium pro horizon zero dawn on the other hand butter smooth with hdr men is that ever gorgeous not the most ergonomic setup that i've created for myself here this stand by the way supports height adjust as well as tilt this also gives us a better look at the i o which is a little unusual on this monitor it's got a mini display port 1.4 a micro hdmi 2.1 one usbc port and a usbc port with power delivery this last one is great because it can do up to 65 watts meaning that you can use the monitor as an additional display with your laptop and charge your laptop while you're doing that for a one cable solution this is great for students or i mean really anyone who wants to minimize cable clutter also perfect for watching movies in the dorm the oled g8 is going to be joining samsung's monitor lineup alongside the neo g8 which uses a mini led backlight with a traditional lcd panel which probably raises the question why would you go with one over the other well let me tell you if you find that you're particularly sensitive to color fringing like you would find on a cutie oled today or if you're in a room where you have no light control and it's super bright the brighter picture of the neo g8 could make it a better choice but if you're pretty much anyone else i would recommend sticking with the oled g8 but in the future the neo might actually lose one of its only two advantages let's talk about color fringing because of the unique triangle subpixel layout of qd oled sharp lines can render with distracting green and pink outlines this is something that affects all qdo-led panels no matter which company is making the display now for me and actually almost everyone else we pulled in the office it's the kind of thing that i would forget within a week or two besides my home pc is almost exclusively used for gaming where you won't notice it at all but for adam who worked on this video it's a deal breaker so what's the solution well to understand the solution we need to also understand the problem and the current situation is partly thanks to microsoft to improve text rendering in windows microsoft uses clear type which is kind of this color trickery that takes the subpixels around black text and slightly colors them to soften edges giving fonts a smoother less aliased appearance but this is a super new panel with an unusual triangular subpixel layout remember it's currently unsupported by clear type that means that the wrong values are getting sent to those subpixels causing green tops and pink bottoms now this effect can be mitigated by changing the scaling in windows or sitting a little bit farther away from your display but those just make the fringing less noticeable rather than eliminating it completely another option is to use better clear type tuner which is a program that lets you adjust the same settings that windows clear type does but in a useful manner and it helps but it doesn't quite resolve the issue so realizing that we were committed to this rabbit hole we kept going and sought out the more granular mac type which allows for low level access to windows text rendering with mac type you can actually configure the exact coordinates of each subpixel to force windows clear type to properly smooth the tech next and when it works it looks amazing which is great news because it means it's not a hardware problem like you haven't seen text until you've seen the kind of contrast that you get with deep blacks like this but thanks to windows 10's wonky approach to text rendering mac type requires such deep access to our system that our corporate antivirus actually alerted our sysadmin while he was on vacation and it wiped out the program on its own like we're talking registry edits and more it also ended up breaking a bunch of software now it's possible that with more time we could have made it run a bit smoother but there's a catch it doesn't even fix all the text on your system lots of apps like chrome and hilariously even microsoft office don't use windows to render text rather they'll use an alternative like free type which also doesn't support this new subpixel layout meaning that even if the text in windows looks crisp it'll still be wonky pretty much everywhere else so please microsoft free type project everyone i'm begging you support this new pixel layout you'll find a link to the odyssey oled g8 in the video description it's already amazing and if i get my way it's only going to get better if you guys like this video why don't you check out the one where we sent james to a quantum dot factory to learn just what the heck they are and how they're made
