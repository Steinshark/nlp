okay okay i'm not sure really why i'm caught 
here i'm not really sure why i uh put a   blazer on for this video but we're getting 
really serious i guess no we're not actually   what kind i don't know anyways i like the blazer 
blazers were calling me today so here we are   having a very candid conversation with a blazer on 
i don't know why i feel like that's so weird but   okay let's get to it we need to stop 
romanticizing tech and as i'm saying that   i fully take accountability that i too 
often and am responsible for doing just that   as a tech youtuber i often say just how amazing 
it is in tech the perks the benefits the   just all these amazing features that tech brings 
to our lives and it's true there are so many   positives to working in tech to using technology 
what technology has brought to our lives but it's   also i think so important to really highlight that 
there are some downfalls in technology whether it   be working in tech using tech all of the above and 
i've been scrolling on tiktok recently yes i'm a   millennial who goes on tick tock probably far too 
often but i don't know is anyone else addicted to   tick-tock here or is it just me but when i'm on 
tik-tok and i get on what is called tech talk   as the young kids say i see a lot of these tick 
tockers doing tech talks or talking about tech and   kind of exaggerating what tech has to offer 
working in it for example i'm not going to pull it   up on screen here because i don't want to call any 
tick tocker out or do anything weird like that but   some tick tockers saying that you can make 800 
000 to 900 000 for compensation working in tech   and your first year in tech and and hey if 
that is true sign me up where are these jobs   because that sounds amazing to me but i think 
we've kind of almost gone a little too far   to the other side of promoting and romanticizing 
tech and today i really want to sit down with   you and have a a candid conversation about that 
before we get into it though make sure to hit   that subscribe button for more tech and coding 
videos leave in the comments other video topics   you want me to cover other questions you have 
leave your opinions on my videos do you agree   with me disagree i just want to hear your thoughts 
i want to hear from you i i love our community and   i just want to hear your thoughts and everything 
before we get any further though i want to share   with you about a tool that you can use in 
your next project which is the foala editor   okay when i came across this tool i thought 
it was really cool and i was really excited   to share with you essentially the floral editor is 
a lightweight w-y-s-i-w-y-g html editor yes that's   kind of a tongue twister super easy to integrate 
and it is an editor that is written in javascript   and allows for great text editing capabilities for 
all your applications and okay let's talk a little   bit about some of the features it includes it is 
cross browser compatible you can put your mind   at ease that this will work the same on safari 
internet explorer and many other browsers it   is also cross-platform compatible you can use 
it not only on your desktop computer but also   on your tablets or smartphones not to mention it 
is super easy to integrate the editor easily can   be integrated to any of your projects it only 
requires basic knowledge of html and javascript   and it really will help your project stand out 
as an interesting feature now a lot of times i'm   wondering okay if i'm integrating this editor is 
it going what is it going to look like how will it   work with my project and that's one thing i 
really love when i was playing around with   the foia editor is just how modern its design 
is it really flows with any project that it is   integrated with which is also a huge bonus you 
don't have to worry about that side of things   i linked it down below so make sure to click on 
the link to learn more about it and play around   with it integrate it into your next projects 
especially if you are building different projects   or coding different projects and want to add a 
really interesting feature in this is for you as i was saying in the intro to this video there 
is a lot of hype right now around tech there is   so many roles in tech that are open and in demand 
and the tech industry can't keep up with it and   in turn there is higher compensation higher 
uh benefit package higher everything because   of the need for more people to work in tech and i 
definitely have seen this glamorized side of tech   how amazing it is but i it kind of concerns me in 
a sense that we also need to be truthful as well   like anything if we just start talking about the 
positives and kind of inflating the positives just   like any industry there are issues or concerns 
that need to be spoken about as well and looked   into as well and if we're only focusing on the 
positives how are we going to improve and grow   and of course it's easier to talk about the 
positives and the negatives or the not so   goods i guess you could say but i'm sitting down 
with you today to just share my thoughts on it   some of the things i don't even know how to really 
this video isn't scripted this is just me sitting   down with you and having a raw conversation about 
it because i don't really know how to describe i i   didn't want this to be a scripted video or a i 
don't know a structured video i just wanted to   be my thoughts on the situation and i think one 
thing i'm just going to highlight some areas i   guess that i think in tech that should be spoken 
of more or we could work on more one being work   balance and i know this is a term we often hear 
thrown around especially in tech i've seen a   lot on once again to take the tick-tock of how 
amazing this work-life balance is working in tech   but let me tell you as someone who works in tech 
some days i work really long hours some days it   feels like overwhelming and tough and stressful 
and it just can be too much almost and when i   go then on social media or any platform and see 
how amazing this industry is i'm like yeah it's   great but let's also address that this is a job at 
the end of the day you're not doing this because   you want to work for free it's because you would 
like to make money to live your life and you know   let's not kind of get the two confused i see a 
lot of people really take on the identity of the   company they work for which i think is a very 
dangerous place to be in if you are someone who   solely relates who you are to where you work 
because i think part of the uniqueness you can   bring to a company is by having other experiences 
and interests outside of work and through those   learnings and experiences even though they 
might not directly be applied to your everyday   job they will trickle in in different ways whether 
it be ways you look at problems or how to solve   problems or ways you look at different marketing 
or creativity all your experiences will come   together in your job but if your sole focus and 
identity is your job how are you going to find new   experiences or new things to bring to the table so 
i thought that was a really interesting thing to   just keep in mind when you are working somewhere 
or putting content out online or speaking to your   friends and family is at the end of the day it's 
important to love your job and appreciate your job   but don't make your job your life and i say 
that as someone who takes great pride in my   work and in my job and in my career and think 
it's so important to put your all into it but   don't let it consume you because it's easy done 
in the tech industry is to let it consume you   but in turn you will have little to offer 
because you won't have any unique experiences   so that's one thing i think that really needs to 
be highlighted more in tech because it's often   that people just get consumed in their jobs and 
and let it take over and it's so important to have   interests outside of work another area i think 
we really need to talk about more is typically   maybe maybe it's just me and i'm clearly working 
in the wrong i don't know job or anything like   that but when you are graduating when you graduate 
from school and you get your first job in tech or   otherwise don't expect to be a millionaire in 
your first year i'm not trying to set ceilings   for you or say what you can or can't do but let's 
be realistic people i just i'm shocked with all   of these tick tocks saying that they make 500 000 
plus a year right after university like where are   you working and how do i how do i do what you do 
because this i've never heard of this in real life   um so i think it's important to make sure 
that your expectations are not based on   social media and what you are seeing online 
but more so through your own research let me   rephrase that your expectations can be based on 
what you see online and people you see online   but make sure to not just allow whatever you are 
consuming into your mind without questioning it   where are they getting their resources from who 
are they what is their experience and once you   take all that into consideration you can choose 
to believe it or not but i think too often we just   sit down consume content and then have these 
unrealistic expectations based on this content   that is telling us things that aren't isn't even 
true and i'm not sure why the pendulum has swung   so far into this romanticizing tech i think a lot 
of it is because of views online everyone wants to   be famous or an influencer or anything like that 
and and when you add shock value to your content   like oh i made a million dollars this year or oh 
my company paid me x y and z people are intrigued   and they want to watch more and it just keeps 
on getting the views but in order to keep on   getting those views with that content you need to 
produce more content and it's pretty concerning   i think as someone who is wasn't always in tech 
if i was just getting into the tech industry and   i saw those videos i would think wow i clearly am 
doing something wrong like where are these jobs at   how do i get it and i would set my expectations up 
unrealistically and in turn i'd be so dissatisfied okay i'm sorry i had to take a little 
break here i gotta go get water   um okay i feel like this video was me just you 
know talking about my thoughts on romanticizing   the tech industry but i really just wanted to have 
a candid conversation i feel like that's our best   i just feel like you all really resonate with 
these kind of videos where it's just me sitting   down and being really honest with you and just 
sharing my thoughts and being totally unscripted   so that's what i wanted to do today but i'm 
curious to hear your thoughts on the topic of   romanticizing tech it's a great industry i'm 
happy to be in it and really building such a   big part of the future is through tech and i love 
that i can be part of that in any way possible and   i'm not trying to say tech is anything but a 
great industry but i also think it's important to   have these conversations and 
be real about our expectations   and what we are going into the industry with 
and where we are consuming our content from   anyways i hope you found this video very helpful 
and insightful but i'm super curious to hear your   thoughts on this topic so leave in the comments 
below and i will see you all soon thanks everyone you
