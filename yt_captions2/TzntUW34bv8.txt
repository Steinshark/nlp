our testing lab is in complete disarray i don't even know what any of this is the wiring is half done basically everywhere the floor refinishing stalled what is this creepy place and gary this is what qualifies to you as an organized workspace based on here at least everyone's got their priorities straight there's somewhere to kick back and eat snacks it's pretty clear i'm gonna have to roll up my sleeves get this train back on the tracks jake dan oh fear not for the cavalry has arrived great let's get started all right we have a rack we can install cable management heck yeah that's right by the end of this video we're gonna have all of our networking equipment on the rack we are going to have our network up and running including our wireless access points which hopefully will enable the people who are already over here to work yeah that's the plan anyways just like our plan to tell you about our sponsor smart deploy powered by pdq.com smart to play maintains drivers for you so you don't have to think about it and with over 1500 driver packs to choose from you can deploy any business class device with a single windows image get your free licenses worth over 500 at smartdeplay.com ltt foreign [music] you're already working yeah of course i'm working jerry rig everything knife lttstore.com i love it it's almost wow it's very red you know the car yeah you're right you're right for the ltt orange is actually more red than it kind of looks in most contexts because of what's around it well they're getting that together i'll give you a bit more of a realistic update on how things are going over here the racking is in and anchored for the logistics department the vast majority of the cables are actually run throughout the building including to the test stations which as you can see are already being deployed over on the already painted part of the floor the logistics department got a quote for the floor that was like outlandish and figured that they could paint the whole place themselves in about a week which turned out to be right they've only spent a couple of days and they've made actually really excellent progress on it and while the job site admittedly could be a bit tidier when you're doing this much work there's bound to be a little bit of mess for example this is the six ev chargers that we're going to be putting up outside the building with free employee ev charging i was just giving these guys a hard time considering everything that they've got going on the place is actually so surprisingly organized we specifically went out of our way to not show how like really arranged all of the thermal compound and hammers are wait what the hell do you guys need hammers for if it doesn't fit we hit it what what are you can you get some foam we're gonna tip it off because that's the only way to get it off you want foam yeah to like put underneath here to put underneath it why do you need foam it has like scratch ah there we go it's okay just stand there and ask questions we'll do the work all right it's all he's been doing the last six months i mean if you insist you grab that in oh my god it's really heavy oh my god here switch spots with me dan you got that no no i got it i got it i got it where do you want it just off i keep it vertical though or horizontal we're going to tip it back vertical yes okay uh in that case you should lift it up a bit more yeah you guys ready to go rack racing oh you're wearing sandals watch out dan whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa oh my god oh no close me in did i tell you there's a reason i'm on medication close me and close me in well it was nice for five minutes oh my god linus if you scratch the thing you owe me a hundred bucks oh it's really hard to steer you're going the wrong way oh no oh god i hate you you love it come back yes please please for the love of god just stand okay now the place where you were tip it over right linus what what oh god jeez dan i stopped you it would be really funny if you were the one to it up i am a fraction of the weight that this thing can support it should be fine until we're going through the doorway wait no it's gonna sit through the door it fits in the doorway at your house okay slow down oh god it might not touch you oh god no it'll fit god it fits okay rotate okay watch it if it fits i sits you're gonna make us like do this the whole time i'm not gonna make it we have a bit of a lip here yeah so to your right there you go straight forward how much clearance yeah push it hard ready okay ready three two one jesus three one more two one oh god i'm getting hold on i'm gonna go low okay put your feet on damn it when they go high we go low stop it ready i can't oh no it's gonna hit me in the ankles wait all right i'm just gonna lift it yeah let's just tilt it like the tiniest bit can i help you what you're doing is terrible yeah it's great no it's not yeah we're gonna have to disconnect the internet oh should i let them know nah these things are super cool they're called rack studs and they basically mean you never have to fumble around with a metal rack nut ever again which is great cage nuts suck even good cage nuts suck what i think the best bet is gonna be is to put an extra switch in there and then go quick plug things in to switch them over okay we can move this stuff okay they want my plan and i helped you might say i'm pretty handy we started putting them in on this side which is the correct side and then we went no no no we want the casters these casters in the front too bad we didn't realize these pdu mounts are right here so we have to use this as the front technically nothing would prevent us from moving the pdu mounts this way it's actually symmetrical yeah but that's a long work that's what would prevent it yeah the amount of work we're pretty work shy uh these are very plastic they are and this amazingly excellent really isn't it it doesn't move at all wow isn't it incredible dude these can the sheer strength is like 300 pounds per or something it's amazing they're nylon bro nylon's indestructible or so the marketing says they're made of the same thing as your screwdriver not bad not bad for those of you who aren't familiar with what we're comparing these two this is a cage nut or as i call it the fingernail destroyer because the only way to get these in is to like you got to kind of stick it in there and you gotta kind of like to be fair the ubiquity ones are garbage yes that's kind of ubiquitous thing though what suck for a while and then iterate and then like suddenly all of a sudden you're like holy crap this stuff got really good like these switches are an amazing value and they have super cool features like you can pull out your phone and ar point your camera at the front of the switch and it'll show you like what devices are connected to that port your camera is plugged into this one your your ap is plugged into that one i've never used it i have well i'm glad it's super cool and like really handy there's two different kinds of switches that we've got over here we've got the ones that we just put in which are 24 port 10 gig switches which means this entire place is going to be capable of 10 gig to absolutely every workstation and then our second type of switch is this guy right here uh this is the enterprise 48 poe and it's exactly what it sounds like all 48 of these ports have power over ethernet meaning that we can again freaking up to 48 security cameras actually you can do more if you use some really cool little additional switches that are poe powered poe switches i actually used one of those to run two three security cameras off of a single poe port at my old house is this two and a half gig shut up no this has got to be a gigabit it's 48 2.5 gig ports how much is it so 1600 us dollars that's 720 watts of power do you know what i would have given for a sixteen hundred dollar forty eight port two and a half gig switch like when we started this and it's kind of the bee's knees don't hit me in the head with that well i might you don't want to see head injury linus this is me when i'm functioning well oh could have fooled me here catch go for me oh that was awesome first take see if you can do it again uh nope nope one is good oh i dropped one okay it's like this is like the bottle flip let's see if i can get it to land on the switch oh my god jake jake's what what are you doing sorry you know me and linus is a weird is a good combo the three of us too much energy it should be illegal i mean really jake i mean that's what we've been doing all day look you just got here they're not even metal they're not even convenient to pick up whether your ltt store.com screwdriver no with like a metal screw picker up or do that i mean you guys have one right oh you guys have one it might be another logistics yeah anymore he's in the no man department that i'm technically nobody has told me what my job is but i'm not part of colton's my manager wait do we have a new ups over here not yet uh don't don't talk about that i'll cry yeah okay eaton is working on getting us one of their lithium ups's no no not lithium oh is it like the other same one it's a 9pxm 12 12 kilowatt oh in that case eaton is working on getting us one of their banging ups's with the like giant battery backup base full of lead acid batteries and all that stuff careful what honest for you guys just just take that oh my god oh you unplugged it i was gonna keep the power plugged in okay sure what uh okay and what the idea about some black things is that we interrupt their internet as little as possible while dan didn't really listen to the plants so um i had never listened to you yeah i mean can we plug that can we at least plug the cables in through the cable management yeah it's going to take a second yeah yeah he's just holding the thing this is so overkill we have like a hundred gig fiber coming from a closet 20 feet away with that's connected to a one gig cable box it's lit i mean it's enough internet for here like i only did 10 gig to that closet no look 100 gig oh yeah can i pull out the ento one uh you know at this point let's just do it okay i told them no internet whoa linus i broke one oh jesus well it's because all of this is so much weight yeah why are you doing well i was trying to support it sorry jake did you say these are cat6a yeah what ultra thin baby oh that's super cool feel the connectors too they're so nice they just come right out oh wow and they snap in so nice where's the 48 port patch for this one going i don't look at my map no i know but then we're breaking the trend it's going to be patched like the patch for each switch is above it right yeah patches above and below above and below unless you want to loop over the cables they're not quite long enough realistically a few years down the line there could easily be 40 50 people working here though so we could put another rack between all the equipment and everything yeah that and we have a decent sized server room unlike the other place yeah we could totally put a second round i could absolutely put a second rack in here jake what are we actually doing for hvac in here i don't know we are going to knock out that window and put a unit outside oh brilliant yep i wanted to get rid of the window anyway so that's great oh okay all right let's just pull the goddamn badge panel up yeah i mean what's cable management anyway right dan's problem for later hahaha got him future dan i actually like doing it your the joke i'm sure it's a joke whoa wait these are 48 port patch panels yeah so we have to remove them all and put them in singles because he doesn't like 48 quart ones or just put it in the rack and i'll do will with it later yeah he's gonna deal with it later but how long are you gonna get that no you just bring the bundle up here and it'll be fine i don't believe you you're just dropping them on the floor james pick them up now because the later it's later dan's problem oh my god you guys know that i pay for it either way right you know you know they cut fiber cables and data centers right this is that hurts me data center and i don't like that data center now what happened here yeah what is this how could you guys possibly think we're gonna get these patch panels into the new rack like this this was not me dan what in the i actually don't know you've enabled him here i am trying to talk sense actually we run the things through the thing hold on one weekend oh god all right all right okay actually let's make it we're making progress here sort of fine you know what if that's how it's gonna be watch this i don't even care yeah that's the spirit high five terrible hey remember jake jake hey hey remember when you were gonna 3d print me a face plate when you were like yeah don't worry we can help you yeah you know i love working two jobs it's great okay yeah all right over there yeah i got it okay so this one should be good to go yes i see it i i got it i got it i got it sorry sorry sorry sorry you won't need that where is cisco 35 35 is there okay well hold on wait you're not sticking them through the rack i mean aren't i no no like through the top no i can't because they're attached to these oh you can't like crush it enough then oh dan will do that later but at least this way it's i crush it out like somewhere that sounds awful no no he's got this okay where did our internet one go where do you want that i don't know i threw it on the floor i i know but where do you want it now so i wish you wouldn't throw things on the floor jay cut jake moved my patch bay that i used for that once okay i moved it okay okay i keep asking a question and everyone keeps giving me everything but the answer to it where do you want it yeah we'll just i'll put it in the wreck may i has a 24 port patch panel i think there's some on the floor that's where we keep everything oh my god you guys are infuriating really but we get it done no no don't do that undo that don't stop doing that you're using the rack as a holding thing yeah oh you're smart okay i would have just used the floor okay don't give them that i don't know that's smart dan what is that uh i don't know i think they're important they're in this uh one itself i can't read my writing you can't read your writing what i don't know i was probably drunk things your boss wants to hear okay 100. well working in a warehouse alone you're not even alone there's like six other people working here every day not when you get that truck this room network we're not supposed to get drunk what i'm way ahead of you i was being facetious at the beginning of this video but spending the day with them doing this maybe they do actually need me what was our goal today again um to get all this stuff in the rack and plug things in oh okay we could have that done in 15 minutes right all we need to do is change this rack it's like one of the more difficult things and i couldn't do this alone this one's not labeled i don't ah darn it i don't know what it's actually for aside from when you do the ar thing you have to point it at these so it's probably like some sort of qr code but when you click it you see how they're all synced you click i they're all synced except these ones don't look at these ones they're not plugged in hey you want to pass me that black one sure i'm glad they're on the floor they're so easy to find oh my god no it's nature's bucket i'll have you know that i have also qualified all of the runs in this building so i know their exact links and all their locations are also mapped with uh unique kind of human readable text names instead of w4 nice that's actually super awesome because in the event that we are trying to diagnose something that for whatever reason has the label fall off or we catastrophically lose our map or whatever else knowing the lengths of the runs will actually give us a solid clue as to where the heck it's going we joke a lot but we've actually come a long way in terms of networking and server configurations and all that kind of stuff you're welcome things have been running pretty smoothly for pretty smoothly i mean pretty smoothly there was you know catastrophic data loss from the vault yeah well that wasn't my fault it looks messy now but once i have a cleanup of all of this it'll be pretty beautiful i hope man the number of times in my life i have tidied up a server room of some sort be it worker at home and had a bundle of cables this big at the end that were not plugged into anything on either side that i then just hug and to have been to organize every time so this is the part where everything devolves into chaos right and we start blaming each other because while it's all fun and games for the labs team to not have internet right now for like you know a little bit of time at the end of the day they must have internet tomorrow i have this patch cable mostly disentangled from everything else oh awesome i think this is a traditional nerd mating dance did you fly you throw your cables around and you hope it attracts a lady it never does what the is going on look we're nearly done maybe if you had helped oh yeah i didn't say it's perfect but look look at the room at least it's in the corner yeah we don't know where that one goes what oh yeah that was one free from 24 pack no my 24 is full oh i don't know put it on the floor thank you nice wait why are there no studs in this i told you to get the purpley boys this is what we call in the biz a classic vlog doesn't really have a purpose this is stuff we were gonna do anyway i was gonna but now it's on camera i was gonna do and now you came along for the ride it is going to look awesome at least i think people can get an idea now of what it's going to be this is half network yeah oh my god i thought you had done that no we did the other one these are cool cables basically we take our 100 gig in from our closet over there and then we can connect to all of our switches here with their 25 gig uplinks by splitting our 100 gig here into 425 gigs guess what 100 gig is just 425s put together this is chaos i don't know how this is going to edit together like it's something somehow they always seem to make it work yeah that's why we have um a lot of editors it takes a while to make this into not a turd that's why we release like six ltts a week and we have over a dozen editors on stuff this is what we give them can i just you know give her give her the old full sends only i mean once the rack is closed it's good right i didn't close it yet i still got those fiber cables in the door frame neat um it's closed okay and cable managed wow you guys are so good at that not bad right uh there not bad right we may end up with some storage here but it's also possible we just won't have any as long as we've got a fast enough link back to the other office which we're doing with air fiber dishes on the roofs then really all this has to handle is the infrastructure within this building as for why it needs to be 10 gig basically everywhere with link speeds up to a hundred gig well we're gonna have a lot of really high-end testing equipment including testing server equipment so unless we have this infrastructure we're just not going to be able to do that the only storage that we've got for now is this nvr which is a network video recorder which is going to handle all the security cameras we'll handle some of the security cameras we only need another one of these i think it'll have there is another one there's another one okay yeah pretty much this whole thing is just going to be cameras and i should also mention that there's still 90 more runs to come in here the warehouse is full of like 200 foot long 10 gig ethernet plus cameras plus aps it's everywhere and you're going to use contractors right that one probably just like i use contractors for this segue to our sponsor secret lab thanks to secret lab for sponsoring today's video secret lab cherish our engineer to keep you incredibly comfortable

check out secret lab today if you guys enjoyed this video you know what let's have a throwback why don't you go watch the one where i noise isolated the server room at the old place we are not doing that here i thought we were i thought we were if this networking equipment then probably not okay that's how loud it is but if we put servers in here i have to fill the ceiling we'll we'll do it less bad don't worry okay we'll do that but like better asbestos no
