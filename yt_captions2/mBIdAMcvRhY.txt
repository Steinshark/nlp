okay oh what just happened what are the odds that my house will be put back together at the end of this day you know sometimes i really do feel like my life is stranger than fiction there's this company that makes water cooled beds not waterbeds water cooled beds they sent over their fancy mattress topper for our sponsor deal and i really like it but that's not the strange part the strange part is i was looking at this thing going man i bet we could make like a bigger better cooler one and they were like sure we'll sponsor that because for whatever reason they think our solution which i'm gonna make with this guy yeah is gonna make theirs look good to which i say does theirs have rgb i think not let's prove them wrong lads before we go any further the first question we need to answer is why on earth would you want a water cool a bed but if your relationship is anything like mine you probably have a pretty good idea of the answer already in the winter she's practically dying of hypothermia unless we put like six blankets on her and in the summer i can be lying there buck naked with a good like' inches from my wife and still sweating bullets well eight sleep has a pretty cool solution to that instead of heating or cooling the entire room which is super inefficient you heat or cool your bodies directly and because they have two separate loops you can actually heat or cool either side wait does ours do heating no oh balls well that's going to be a disadvantage the whole thing's app controlled and with their subscription service and the app it helps keep you at the optimal temperature throughout the night for a restful sleep to do all of that you need more than just a radiator and a fan that's where the pod comes in it contains a reservoir a pump a heat sink and a thermoelectric cooling module that handles both heating and cooling but if a little cooling is good then more must be better right oh yeah i have no idea what the plan is today but it involves this so yeah let's run some tubes this is all really cool but where is the mattress topper oh it's up there oh easiest way to hide something from me put it above about seven feet this has some very very cool features of the eight sleep doesn't it uh came with dirt on it really did you buy it used no brand new out of the box already dirty like you can see all of this right here yeah that corner up there yeah it's disgusting okay ah excellent now i do have a question how do these manifolds work so it's in both sides out all of these so these are 20 ports right here and those are going to be the 20 tubes that'll run along your side we have the ability to break two more this is how many spares we have excellent that's great holy crap you've gone very ambitious here your intention is to do two separate zones for the two sides oh yeah okay we're gonna retain that feature oh my god you really are trying to beat it okay with the kind of stuff i've seen him do i mean i hope the sponsor will still pay us for the video because we might just beat it i mean that's about as advertised i like the bits where i need to wash my hands after i okay all right all right you just have a sheet on it kind of allergic to it are you yeah oh you're allergic to latex i guess huh oh i see you've brought along other options for cooling as well we have this peltier cooler yeah we have two peltier coolers that one right there is from your chair oh so my chair is no longer cooled no and did you realize that the six pin had melted on it that was by your butt the thing about peltier coolers is that they consume so much power for the amount of cooling and heating that they can do that there are only a handful of applications where they really make sense compared to phase change cooling it just so happens that this application is one of them because any efficiency gains you might get from using an air conditioning system are lost when you factor in that you are chilling the air around you that you are mostly not occupying rather than taking that cooling and applying it directly to your skin where not only is it not wasted to the room but it's able to be passed using conduction rather than convection which is way more efficient air is a terrible terrible conductor of heat now obviously the tubes are not going to be able to be right against your body because that would be that's some princess and the p level stuff right there i think i'd be able to feel that but i think the plan is for us to embed it in the foam kind of like what we did with the water cooled chair though hopefully not taking as long as we did with the water cooled chair because that took a long time i'm not 100 sure that we have enough to do all 40 runs like we do in feet wise but we might not just buy like the way that you cut it up we bought all of home depot's quarter inch tubing how much did we spend on tubing this morning it wasn't that much i don't remember but this stuff's pretty cheap that's 300 feet of tube we need 260 by my calculations oh my god how on earth are we gonna do this okay sure fine which way is up i was just thinking the exact same thing i have no idea this is the kind of thing where your buddy asks if you can come over and help with a project and you're like yeah sure i could spare some you arrive and it's like really like this so this right here is with this right here should be 80. it's not it should not be a square really it should be four inches longer in one of the directions but it also means we can't screw this up because they already did yep yep what are you doing there well i'm showing a loop going from you know the end to the back to the end oh so what i was thinking is we have like one here one here oh my god you just want to go across yeah so then we go across they combine over here and we have this absolutely fantastic control valve right here so you can adjust how much cooling each side gets with these wonderful ball valves it's a very analog approach uh you don't have to worry about like your wi-fi going down your bed not cooling right and where does this get affixed too the end of your bed so you want this at the head and the foot yes i don't know i need a nap now when we did the water cooled chair we used our laser to make tubing channels yeah obviously that's not the plan today even if we had a laser this big i mean the fumes alone would be enough to kill behalf of our team so we have two options the first is a hot wire which fumes maybe still a problem second option is a knife and we just send it i've never tried a hot wire that sounds fun yeah okay hot wire foam cutter yes this looks very affordable the best way to do it is with this one right here so you just go straight through something yeah that we can't do because we're not going straight through it so instead that pops off this looks very i bought this on aliexpress and i'm reselling it on amazon i think this right here might be our best bet you see the little hooky chum we might be able to just i see and then have little tubing channels if that doesn't work then i don't know we take this i mean i wonder how hot it gets there's only one way to find out for sure we have a much better way to find out for sure the answer is quite hot see i know before you're even got your other better way yet compared to your 10 000 iq move of touching the hot thing i think that getting out the flear is a much better idea greater than 130 degrees celsius we know that much it's a little burn me then if that's all that you wanted to know yeah yeah it'll burn you that was pretty much it uh okay why don't we start on yvonne's side i guess i just you know what maybe like about halfway deep well we don't even know if it'll work yet it's working it's quite slow well that definitely goes in there i wouldn't say it stays in very well though i think it's time for us to try another method [music] i'm kidding i'm kidding this is here for something unrelated let's try the really sharp knife what the hell is on here this is covered in glue uh uh look it's got people's fingerprints on it it was in a bin with my ca glue which tipped over and spilled only on that knife perfect oh it's faster it's just a matter of if it'll actually like go in there which seems like it does if the hole is not very big this could work my only question is once it's in there how on earth do we keep it in there why do you think i have the ca glue oh to glue it back together yeah does that work have you tried it on this phone have tried nothing linus today is an experiment i also brought a whole bin of silicone adhesive if we want to use that and make a huge mess no hopefully the ca works i also brought the instant set is this a spray bottle oh no that's the activator so you put the ca down then you spray it with that when you have the stuff in the position that you want i see okay we definitely need more than that but it does work on this foam which was a concern so let's try and do this like we would do it so i'm going to put a bit more and then you spray it or no you put it together yeah so you go like that and then oh sorry thanks for that well how's that supposed to hit it i don't know it's probably enough oh okay this corner here is not going to be the most comfortable part of this mattress topper this mattress topper is not going to be the most comfortable part of this mattress that's fair this is not the best tubing for this we should have used a more silicone based tubing yeah and talking to eight sleep one of the things that took them the longest to develop were special like pliable tubes that weren't uncomfortable so this is the top now right no no no the white one's the top you want the the the less memory foam on the top yeah but i was thinking that like these right here this is a super good insulator of heat so if we have this much foam between the tube and you our cooling will be severely compromised you wanted this in the top of the topper that's going to be so uncomfortable well your comfort is not the priority the pure watts that we can extract from your body is no no no no no you know what no no we can test this we can put this in here we can just go like this run some cold water through it and aim the thermal camera at it see if we can get enough cooling to go through it just plug the tiller into it plugging the chiller in is not the most trivial of things wait the chiller is 240 volt right oh oh alex how the hell are we going to plug in oh how the hell are we going to plug in the chiller this right here is called the quick 220. as long as you're able to find two outlets that are out of phase boom you have 240 now that's how we're gonna run the chiller these look exactly how i feel right now but soon you'll look like this oh wait oh my god no that's why would you why would you convert this technically there are plenty of devices that you could plug into this that can handle 240 volt like say for example the dc power adapter for your laptop but converting outlets to be not the correct standard for what's supposed to be inside them is a big no-no oh my god the two out of phase outlets go into the quick 220 which goes into this adapter from a proper 240 volt outlet to a 120 volt outlet which goes to the back of the chiller right oh a receptacle tester you didn't even talk about this oh that's a gfci tester yeah because if you have it on gfci this will not work because it'll see the two like circuits put together how do we tell them if they're on different phases if they're on different phases than the 240 volt light lights up i see i do like to get lucky we got lucky haha there we go 238 let's go yeah how are we adapting to that tubing great question oh no this is a really sketchy way to do this but i've done it before if you get lucky the outer diameter of your one tube is about the same as your inner diameter of the other or will this just work oh that works too before we fire this up should we move the foam away because we've got the foam soaked it's going to be a real bad time no it should be fine this is i got perfect control of this look sure okay go wrong and full if i am waking up hello okay that worked yeah it's great okay so what we need to know is if it manages to cool this through this and so far the answer is no i need time like there's nothing there like i touched it you can see the heat it needs to be way closer to the top we need to have these like right against your skin that's not going to be very good have you felt it with the ca glue no it makes like a hard thing like it's very noticeable and our chiller is broken do we just have it so that we know that it'll be comfortable-ish and maybe not cool great or do we have it so that we know it'll be uncomfortable but also will cool very well i think our most earnest honest attempt at this would be to make it comfortable and then see if we can actually cool it in a way that's comfortable i can't wait to cut this for the next two hours there's got to be a faster way all right and about an hour later this is complete now i just have to put all the tubes in so i'll see you in another hour quick question for you yeah did you by any chance bring quick disconnect no sick yeah that means we have no choice but to fill this upstairs then yep i don't think we can carry it full of water no that seems like a bad idea also uh getting that chiller up there is going to be absolute hell should we make a call to logistics now i don't think we can do it i think we can my plan is to take this guy we'll have to put like a piece of wood down here ratchet strap the chiller to it and then all plant lifted up you go on the bottom or we can do this all falls then it's on me well but also i'll be the one taking most of the weight yes i have ratchet straps all right but unfortunately our corporate overlords have forbidden us from using them as long as these are available ltt cable ties available now from lttstore.com oh crap i've already got it all over my finger perfect it's burning oh hey are you excited to sleep on this this evening that's going to live in her room how loud is it where is it gonna go if you killed me they'd never identify the body because i have no fingerprints why i got ca glue all over my fingers oh my gosh i don't think that's good yeah trust me i know okay so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna like go quick and give her to all of them and then uh you're gonna kind of kick that in for me and i'll kind of like try to hold it together without getting ca all over my fingers here we go let's go go plan because yeah it's everywhere it's everywhere it's everywhere it's everywhere my side's going fast oh crap how did i manage to glue this one with the tube out here whoa you're putting on a lot more ca than me yeah it's kind of stinky this is acceptable right it's so great i give it to my boss your boss sounds like a dick okay is this good enough i think so yeah you know what hold on i need to know how bad those spots are to lay on ah you know what i can definitely detect tubes oh that's not uh i was like you know maybe this way is better ah i actually think the other way would be way better this way's better because you're not getting them like jammed into as much they're like going lengthwise ah still not great yeah i mean it helps that the most padded part of my body is the part that digs into it the most but i can definitely feel that 100 uh how the devil are we doing this uh i was thinking that we'd worry about that after we get the chiller upstairs because that's going to be worse for sure oh my god i don't know if this is gonna happen wait could we just run a really long tube up the stairs oh my god that's a terrible idea we don't have tubes that long do you have tubes that long no guys for real though make sure you go check out eight sleeps big sale promotional event that they're promoting with this because like they're clearly cool folks oh yeah we can't even go too horizontal did i just go too horizontal uh it wasn't for very long but horizontal is bad for phase change cooling systems like these because all the oils go in the wrong place and the compressor can get pretty bunged up your genius plan then here is what drag it up the stairs basically uh yes oh my god can it oh can this fit through the door i don't think it's going alex yeah doors what 33 the door is not this whatever this is you know what the front door yeah well yeah right oh there we go one stair oh my god this is so dumb yeah this is a really heavy three two one one two three who needs to go to the gym tonight these tires on the hand truck should really be a lot more insulated they're like okay are we fine you wouldn't be the first lmg employee to put a big gash in the wood floors that was not easy for three stairs i'm sweating i can tell you are too so one advantage of eight sleep solution is that it's not this yeah like maybe 500 pounds so bring your mattress in there what are the odds that my house will be put back together at the end of this day it is 4 40. it's wow foreign i'm up oh very good way to help cool down normally i have it on a schedule but you can also just set your temp dialogue [music] coolington minus 10. that doesn't mean negative 10 degrees celsius it's just a dial that goes from minus 10 to 0 to 10 for cooling and warmth we're gonna bring up the thermal camera so we can show you guys how the real one works oh that is so nice right now that's 10 degrees celsius that's uh not the kind of thing i would actually want for sleep but for right now it's amazing hey this is my job i'm benchmarking notice how much quieter the eight sleep is compared to the chiller that's as loud as it gets it's just got the one knot to a fan in there so much better okay this actually bodes really well for our solution on the thermal camera it's just showing up as like 25 degrees everywhere on the bed really yeah because i am very chilled right now oh whoa okay this is pretty funky here you look at the spot where i was oh my god that is really cool so it is insulating like everywhere there's no tubes but the second that you like press down on it yeah so what does my back look like then oh yeah you can see the squares and also where you're really sweaty by the way their tubes are significantly more comfortable than yours i'm just saying well i hope so i mean it definitely so now i get to take it off new plan we cannot safely get the chiller up here you guys have seen me do some sketchy stuff over the years even i don't think that yeah so we're gonna drag the guest bedroom mattress downstairs hi uh we decided we're filming in here i know how you are sometimes you just you know can't wait so now there's a bed right here so i'm ready oh everything's ready so i'm kind of thinking i couldn't help noticing you're a couple of tubes short on some of these yeah wait we didn't have quite enough how did you manage to glue foam down to the floor of the garage alex what the heck that's when my bottle tipped over and spilled a little bit on the ground alex you know what my next big investment is going to be a house that i pretend to live in that we film all the my house content at so i don't have to have you guys in my actual house gouging floor spilling bottles of ca taking all my my bed apart yeah but then you won't have all the cool things that we make videos about in your house you know what i could just hire professional movers to take them from the fake house to the real one i'm sure that the final edit of this video is going to be leaving out a lot of stuff so make sure you're subscribed at floatplane.com ltt for all the extras oh and that is why we have these little stoppers here good job blindness it's still dented it so which side we want to be the top uh the white side hey von this is now the guest bedroom unless you want to use it once you see the cooling performance you will if only that was how to impress women i'd be a stud my computer runs so cool we wouldn't even believe it this bed has so many btus comfort wise how we doing here i can feel them with my feet so that's something ah you know what this way around it's better it's also on a mattress oh it's definitely better oh yeah that's fine i don't even notice the test now is whether it actually cools the user oh aesthetic you know one time we could go a week without saying this is the worst thing we've ever done what is alex planning to do here with these extra four fittings on each one you know what i bet it is he's probably just going to loop them and then we don't have to use them okay you know how your mom said that i didn't have that cool factor do i have enough cool for her now i remember i've never said that what she did say was that i'm not tall enough oh do you know what we really need to do cap off these extra ones yes we need to just i was thinking a little loop more oh that is what you were gonna say yeah oh man with my bed this close to my gaming setup i will never have to move again oh you have the scissors now oh i can give them back to you i'll go get other scissors better oh my god it's not even working oh interesting alex this one has more than two on the one side here as in four three oh he is correct it's not great so basically we're just one running short on this side that's okay that can be yvonne's side what do we do about the water are we out of tubing yes i see uh one thing that we can do put a little scrap of tube and a big clamp on the two that's exactly what i was going to do see this is our problem neither of us is able to stop the other we reinforce the behavior that's what makes our relationship so destructive faster each other oh this is terrible this is terrible this is your threshold alex we left terrible behind in the rearview mirror a long time ago any idea how much water this thing is gonna nope we're just gonna keep pouring water into it until it doesn't need water anymore don't worry about it man i tell you this has got to be a whole sponsored series linus and alex one day build the sponsors product and compare it to the real thing in color is just for decoration but the barb works for that one what about we use this guy sure because that one i think will want to leave the other ones won't absolutely atrocious i mean the water's in there now yep point an overturn baby one more call out again to eight sleep for sponsoring this video guys check out their promotion down in the link below and uh let's do this thing yeah what's making that gurgling noise i wouldn't be too concerned yet okay there we go there we go she's working now low p1 low p1 is good no oh i think p1 is that it's too cold follow steps one to four to release trapped air in the pressure transducer salinas how are you feeling great we uh didn't get to your bedroom we didn't get the rgb that we wanted i forgot about the rgb yeah yeah we promised rgb that was that was a dumb promise basically the whole flipping thing has to come apart all the panels come off there we go so this is our pressure turns do sir it says to push on the valve until water flows what a side quest how the devil am i supposed to get this off when we offer this thing for free in the group chat at work any bets on who's going to be the one to take it oh the mattress topper no one lynch says that someone wants it okay hold on just a gosh start in second here the res is empty this is so gunked up oh the water can't get out of it that would probably do it so that's our problem and you can actually see right down into the residence bone dry but i think what's happening is it's circulating the water back into this thing and it's so slow to come out of it that it's running dry totally makes sense now okay okay go for it go go go go okay she's flowing boys temperatures dropping go figure you have to fill your chiller with water i'm gonna try hopefully you know what here we go open there that is how it is supposed to work [laughter] shout out thermo scientific though this is a very user-friendly filter system we just didn't know how to use it okay how many leaks is it working it's working yeah are you sure we don't need this at 10 degrees hey no we should have a five set it to five yeah what it's gonna be freaking freezing late sleep goes down to 10 degrees we've got to go lower than that the point is not to just go cold well some of the oh what just happened oh no turn it off that's a lot of water uh wow what even failed is that a quick connect no this is a whole fitting thing what it's a male to male adapter i was about to say i'm really shocked that none of this leaked it's not through the rug yet oh holy crap it's not through the rug oh my god it's all up the wall ah relatively minor okay and so what was this this is a rotating male to male oh wait oh it's an adjustable length thing that's what was alex it's an sli fitting oh it's working it's working yeah the bed's cold okay good good good good aren't you glad that we didn't do this in your bedroom yeah i mean at least we're in the room that already has a water damaged floor oh my god this looks like a crime scene on the fleer oh you can already see it hold on hold on wow that's working really well you know even without the rgb i'd say we succeeded think about it while we can't do heating for the water we do heat the air with our handy dual purpose white noise generator here here check it out is it cold under where i was like should be uh you can't really tell you can't tell no not really oh okay i i promise you where my thigh is right now hold on you can sort of see it but like not as much as i was expecting really yeah i can feel it though hey yvonne come try it see if you can feel the chill you can hold a camera like you can feel it right not really why not i was expecting it to be way more well there's so much more foam though i was hoping for like an extreme cooling effect oh yeah this is not nearly as cold as i hoped the point is if you were to try to diy something like this i think you kind of could but by the time you put in that much time and money i don't know man think you're crazy i can totally feel it then again maybe i'm crazy because if the flear can't see it then i must be imagining it like my back right now is freaking chilled you know what i think it is i think it's that we were really inconsistent about the depth of our cuts that's why there's kind of cold spots oh and one of the sides i did with the knife that's way longer and the other side andrew did with the knife that's shorter oh yeah the side's way colder it's not as much as i was hoping for though and considering how cold we have the coolant it's not very effective yeah what's the cooling at right now five 7.9 hmm good effort in summary then we learned a lot and i think you could conceivably diy something like this however i doubt that eight sleep considers this solution to be a significant threat to their business well played eight sleep well played if you guys enjoyed this video maybe check out the one where we introduced the chiller and i think we used it to cool a computer yeah probably
