so this this tweet is nuts man um it's actually pretty br did you see my response on it i did see your response i actually haven't read it right when i saw this and i saw yours i was like oh this is like a great one to read through because i did read yours because you okay so hold on do you want do you want to read it or would you like me to read yours yours is i yours is just mindblowing yeah i'll read mine um i've told this story before too but basically just so you guys have context there is a a person who said that they had a very rough time at blizzard and explained all that with you know their entire story and it's it's a massive story if we look at this it's like just bajillion post long like outrageous amount of stuff right um so what i did is i responded with my own one of my own stories and i'll read this off here so i said working at blizzard was easily some of the best and worst experiences i've ever had anywhere during my career so far and i i worked there for seven years for context from 2009 to 2016 and uh i grew up there as well my dad actually worked there for 23 years as a cinematic director so i have been with blizzard since the beginning since it was silicon and synapse and then chaos studios and then blizzard entertainment so i've been there since the beginning right can i interrupt for one quick second so as it became blizzard and you know this is like war warcraft 1 to warcraft 2 phase like right in there there was such motivation for me to learn programming because of how much i looked up to blizzard so like during those days like it i it's like just even you saying these things it gives me goosebumps because like you lived the life i wanted to live and then when i read this it's it's shocking so keep going sorry i just wanted to like put that in the minds of everybody who grew up in the 90s blizzard was like the place if you were going to go as a programmer it was the place not all that glitters is gold man and i i think that's the part that really sucks here you know so i said a number of the issues you've described here are not unique which is the real nightmare in response to his his negative story and i said when i was on night crew in qa which was my first job at blizzard in in 2009 as that's where i started night crew qa and we worked all night and then i slept during the day i was paid $1050 an hour when starting which the starting rate for a grocery begger at um trader joe's at the time was $12 an hour in southern california you can't live off of that right you can barely even rent a room for those that don't know what southern california is just so like a little context what what was 2009 rent for a studio $1,500 yeah something like that i couldn't afford that i lived i lived out of a room um and then eventually i lived out of a room from a a lady that basically made halfway houses for younger people that couldn't afford to live anywhere else and she i don't know is people who are usually getting off drinking and trying to reassimilate into working life and she did that specifically for younger people that just could not make enough to live in california was the problem and she she was able to do that kind of thing for me which was great and i had another buddy who i met through there and then like there i think there was like six of us living in that house cuz it was a converted old folks home that she had bought and then did that which was awesome wow so that's how i survived right so the grocery bagger trader joe started at $12 an hour i said this is impossible to live on in southern california it makes no sense for one of the largest gaming companies in the world one day during our shift we were told a critical task had come in and we all needed to be on it immediately the task sheet was a piece of paper and they handed it out to all of us and it had like 30 or so steps on it we were told to read the entire thing and then perform the task so i read through it and like about halfway through in the middle of the task it said turn off your computer get up from your desk leave this behind leave the room and i read the rest of the task to make sure that there wasn't anything more because it said read the entire task and i left the room the last two people who left the room got fired the rest of us went to day crew they were dissolving the team that's how they lost their jobs because they took the longest to get to that point in the test that was it oh my god so i i didn't even read that oh i didn't i like misread that i didn't realize it was just it was a race to whoever just left the room f or last and and the way that they the way that they pos that was those are the people that don't know how to read tasks so you're going to day crew everybody else is getting fired and that was it imagine getting fired for being meticulous like that as a qa like it's it's even worse too because after i went to day crew they didn't even talk to me about like the pay increases or anything like that they're like hey you're going to day crew now and i noticed my next paycheck was smaller and i was like what the hell's going on and they said oh yeah you lost 50 cents an hour that was a night crew differential that was it i just lost $1,000 a year because i went to day crew and that was it you know and during that time 50 cents like i mean if you're going from 1050 to 10 like that's a meaningful difference yeah that's the difference between getting an egg in your ramen or just ramen like that's that's like real difference yeah no it was it was horrible it was probably the worst experience i had in my life but i was too young to realize that that was like really not okay right i didn't learn that until much later because this was my first big job i had been working freelance before this so i was used to kind of shitty environments i was like okay i guess this is just how this works and i didn't realize that this is wrong until i think halfway through starcraft 2 we had our manager like our our our lead of qa our director came down and uh morale was really low because we had been on starcraft 2 for over a year at that point of overtime and we ended up doing two years of overtime because the team had this weird the lead of the team had this weird idea that qa could get ahead of development so we just worked crazy hours on [ __ ] that was not ready for test made no sense hold can you just can you just like give me like a like what's a three sentence argument for how qa can get ahead of development can you just can you just like throw that out for me there's none there's none at all they never had an argument they're like yeah we're getting ahead of development i was like that doesn't make any sense to like we're doing it and i was like but what are we testing if we're ahead of them so we would end up testing stuff that just wasn't ready and then punting it back to dev and then dev would be like why did you test this and then punting it back to us when it was ready to test and we just kept doing it we're just spinning our wheels doing nothing it made no sense so that sounds so emotionally painful testing things that are already like pre-known to be broken yep it was awful and so while this was going on morale just shot through the floor people were losing their minds actually i watched a couple people get divorced on that team because they weren't home all the time with their spouses and like it just it started to collapse right people's morale went nuts cuz it was over a year so after this happened our director had to come down to like rally the troops right and he comes down and we're all sitting in in front of him in chairs and he's he's trying to give a speech to everything and halfway through the speech he stops and he says but i want to let you know that you're not the rock stars that the devs are rock stars and any of you could be replaced at any time in the middle of this morale boost speech this was the first time i had met their director for our department and i'll never forget that [ __ ] because my my lead cuz i was on the editor team in qa my lead got up and walked away and he me he motioned for us to leave too and then everyone started to leave they bailed on him in the middle of his speech and he was like what's what's going on what did i do wrong and hr got so many complaints that he had to come back and apologize and during his apology he said it again that's was the second time i got to meet him and it was just it really set the stage for me to be like wow qa is really treated like [ __ ] right like i'm i'm not treated like a person here and i did everything i could at that point to leave the department and over the next four years i eventually got my chance and i actually gave a document to olivani to build he was the director of battle at the time to build a application security team for all the blizzard's websites globally and i got that job they made the team and i became the lead of application security and there's my there's my battlement coin man so can we roll that back just a quick second on that last one uh because you do say because you we've had this like we've had a brief discussion in the past a couple of these like online banters about qa being considered engineering or not is this really like the turning point where you feel like qa has to be treated like engineering because or else i mean that whatever however inhumane that was that was like the turning point i'll give you an example of why they should be right i i am a special exception i have a lot of skills for things that general qa normally wouldn't do but as an example i saved 30,000 hours of tester time on diablo i console because they built custom hardware to allow us to do automation on the console itself it was a bridge from the pc to the console that mimicked uh inputs the controller inputs and they wouldn't allow me to use anything so i to use autoit to do it but i actually wrote custom firmware to get that done in the first place and built the devices myself out of parts that i bought from china so i still have those they're called by frost cuz it's a bridge so think about that on i think at that time it was about $1 an hour right and they didn't even reimburse me for the parts so i still got the damn things so you look at something like that and you see okay yeah let's just treat them like monkeys with keyboards let's pay them in unlivable wage that doesn't make any goddamn sense now i'm the exception there not everybody was able to do those types of things but you have people that are they are so knowledgeable about the games they know absolutely everything ins and outs for it to be able to test these types of things and report these critical issues and discern what is actually going on so the development the other development side can actually fix this so yeah qa is dev and the best thing that i ever saw was when they started doing embedded qa which i saw for for uh overwatch one overwatch one was phenomenal for that because they had a development team and they had an embedded qa team and they were efficient as [ __ ] because of it it was awesome it was great to see and i had hoped that that would spread out to the rest of the business but it didn't and a lot of it came down to fears that qa would god what was the what was the term it was like a frateran i with the enemy kind of thing like they're going to abandon ship and join development and all this it was this weird military brochacho [ __ ] that made no sense it was really really strange andiz whatever that's the strangest word to describe making a product good it was really really weird and it pissed me off like you wouldn't believe and like outside of that there were also things like qa generally looks down on right like down people look down on them and at the time when i first started blizzard we had different colored badges for different teams so night crew we had brown badges qa had yellow badges and everyone's like oh i got to get a yellow badge cuz it's like a status thing if you don't have a yellow badge and you're just like kind of worthless and i remember talking to a guy who had a blue badge which was development side and he was talking to me he was really interested in my ideas and then he looked i saw him look down look at my yellow badge and disconnect the conversation and that happened a lot dude and it was literally just like this weird kind of like class-based badge environment and to blizzard's credit they eventually did away with the different colored badges because it became very toxic that kind of environment became super toxic you know it's like a bra new almost you're like you're the beta class and this is the alpha class and you're just forever a beta because of it yep and they eventually got rid of that system they switched over to blue badges but i had to i had to live through that right and i know a lot of other people did too and it was that stuff sucks man like that stuff sticks with you and it it stuck with me and it it it's the reason that i run my indie studio in the way that i do is to make sure that this kind of [ __ ] never happens to the people who work for me ever and i have i have kept to that every single step of the way so let me ask you a question taught me what not to do you you know since you saw the i mean obviously you see the everyone should see the value of qa right there's no amount of automation blah blah that you can really replace qa with right it's very very important to have that but you obviously had you you were very technical to begin with you were able to make these things which a lot of people even today even in my chat even in your chat that are all developers that would find it extremely difficult to do building firmware making these auto clicks saving all this time do you make room do you allow p you like encourage qa that you have today to als wear the mantle of a dev but in the uh in the realm of automation they should you like give them the working and space to do that yeah if i had if i had more people on here if i if i had a need of more like of qa to do that i would absolutely do it there'd be no reason not to invest in those people because i i'll give you the best option for this this is going to be kind of a weird call out amazon game studios was the best place i ever worked for for anything related to that because they have they have a really good structure for qa for their for amazon game studios so like at blizzard the way that it works is you could become a qa and then once you got to a certain part of your career you had two options become a manager or become a producer there was no path forward for qa if you were an amazing tester you suddenly had to be a manager you needed people skills what if they don't have people skills what if they're just a really good qa person what if they're just amazing at testing and building test plans and and doing that right there's no route so you lose that asset into a role that they probably aren't going to be as good at and also they have to do it because they want more pay that doesn't make any sense so on game studios they structured it differently for you could basically stay a qa your entire career and those jobs ended out at like a quar million dollars man like they were not like small chump change kind of qa jobs they were big deal qa jobs for that kind of stuff and yeah it was huge so i saw that i was like what i what i realized then was i don't want to work for a aaa game company i want to work for a company that owns a aaa game company and it showed me very quickly like this works because amazon is a business and they own a game company and that's my hope was with the acquisition of blizzard that we'd see the same from microsoft because now they're under the same kind of situation and their first action was to fire 1900 people and i it just devastates me dude like cuz you're not going to get that talent back a lot of the people that got fired man they're all over my facebook they're people that have been there 10 plus years buddies of mine that have been there like 13 15 years got fired in that wave where are you going to get that talent back you're not yeah that kind of that's such a brain grain that you cannot re you can't redo though the worst part is that blizzard back was magic 15 years ago that was like kind in my in my head personally that's where like the magic was coming to an end as far as like my love for their games it's kind of gone down since then but it's just like you're losing that that group with whom had the magic still yeah and it's it's it's so devastating because i can understand oh we look at it as a business right we look at it as a cost yeah games don't work that way games you have a name of a st you bought a name microsoft you bought a name yeah and then you fired the reason that name was special and that's that's not coming back man like you can't get it back and that's that's why you see so many of these other studios like if you look at um you remember when hearthstone launched n like massive sensation right did amazing yeah reason it was doing so was ben bro was the game director for that game he loves card games he's so invested in that he wanted he wanted it to be all as amazing as you possibly can he built the best team for it awesome people that all love card games right when he left blizzard he went off to go make his own company called second dinner second dinner's first game marvel snap that's why marvel snap exploded and did so well because he loves card games and now hearthstone is in a state where a lot of people don't really enjoy it right and it's it shows very quickly that when that that passion leaves you still got the name but you don't got the game and that's you saw that when they had uh the diablo 4 they had the devs on there and they couldn't even really play the game well you could see that they're disconnected from it you can also see that with elden ring elden ring is created by a guy who wanted to create a game that he would love and like that's it like that's that is elden ring is the game he always wish he had you know or i mean technically it's dark souls but you know like go all the way back but that's why those games do so well is it's because it's created by someone who loves the thing itself they don't they don't they're not there to make profit they're there to make the thing they've always loved and and profit usually follows when you make a really good game but still there's there's m can't get back yeah there there's two things that i always or there's three things that i always say pay off being passionate about the thing you're working on treating your community and your customers with respect because they they matter more than anything more than anything else that you support them they're going to support you and treating your employees the same if if you do those things it's very hard to lose it is incredibly difficult to lose you still could but it's much harder you know me there's always a loser in life no matter how well they're set up but yeah you're you're right like if you have people bought in you have customers that are excited i don't i don't see how you can lose honestly it'd be crazy for you to lose at that point it's difficult oh god bezos is here the ad break no oh oh yeah you usually you usually take a little moment to do any sort of ad break i i can we can wait for a quick second and not let anything do you want to read these tweets uh or read through this tweet line and do you do you want to go through that or i don't want to interrupt what you're doing i didn't realize you were i mean i know you stream most these days i just don't know which days you stream these days yeah you're good we'll wait for the bezos and then we'll go through it because i i haven't read through all of this guy's stuff yet i've read through of it i was like this is rough dude cuz like i get it and i saw it and i experienced the same stuff so i am unsurprised i i've seen this gay fake promotion and then hearing you getting the old daytime shift learning that you you know quote unquote got a time promotion but then lost money yeah know it's it's it's rough man and that wasn't the only bad experience i had there it was enough that like i eventually left and i didn't want to leave even though i found out i was paid 36% of it industry standard even though you know like it even though the conditions were terrible i didn't want to leave i had to and that's a very awful kind of a thing you know i do want to highlight one quick thing though that you said which is really really funny in the dev world one of the worst companies you can work at is amazon which is which which that's interesting i think goes to show how bad at least this is my perception i could be wrong but how bad the gaming industry is is that in the webd world the worst place you can go is amazon and your best experience was at amazon yeah i think there's like there there's like definitely a disconnect it could be you know you know local there's like a local vertical sometimes they're much better than like say the company at a hole so that's like a real you know that that could happen but it's also just funny that that exists there's a reason for this though i got eight seconds left on ads and then i'll tell you okay waiting on it all right there we go bezus is receded so yeah the um the reason why i had such a good experience at amazon game studio was actually because most of them were former blizzard a large amount of that team was it was people we we joked it was blizzard refugees man so a lot of people left blizzard because amazon game studio is four minutes away it by car it's like right there next to the that makes sense that's a great that's a great change yeah so we all left and we got like way more money but i remember the reason why i had such a good time is my boss was brilliant absolutely brilliant and in the first month that i was there i went to him and i was like hey i don't think i'm doing a good job like i need to have a talk with you i don't i don't think that i'm you know excelling in in the things i'm doing i i don't think i'm doing very well and he said go home and take a like take tomorrow off as well it was thursday he said take tomorrow off as well you're going to get a 4-day weekend and you're not it's not coming out of your pto and i was like what's going on and he said you were so overworked at blizzard that you don't know what it's like to work a normal job you're not used to a normal human pace so you think you're underperforming you need to reset and he was 100% right and he knew because he was also former blizzard and it changed everything for me man absolutely everything it reset everything for me and i was able to go back into the workforce and actually kick some ass and not worry about that because he was right dead right dang because it was awful environment man that's it's so wild to think about how much influence a good manager has and how hard it is to realize how much influence a bad manager has oh yeah you know it's it's it's funny that that you you would think they're both equally obvious but it's it's clear they're not equally obvious no it it it hit me really hard and like i think that that kind of set me up for success there and i was able to like go forward and be like no i'm doing good stuff and i was able to focus on doing the work instead of doing the job which is like to me a very different think the work and the job are generally very different so yeah it was great it actually was awesome from there i'm talking to primin by the way the primagen by the way you are you going to the stream rewards you doing it d dude who's did you not look at the seating arrangement i did look at the seating arrangement i want to make sure you're showing up you who who's who's rubbing shoulder tosh shoulder at the there you're you're going to be able to see me [ __ ] my pants live like within five five feet away you know not even i i will be able to pat your back as you as you shat your pants i'll be like good job you got this there's two ways that i [ __ ] my pants with the stream rewards either i win and i go up on stage i trip [ __ ] my pants and cry right that's that's one way or i don't win but i'm standing up because i think i'm about to win and the light goes over me to someone else and then i ship my pants and cry while standing there there's two ways that this happens right there's no other way around it frankly the spotlight hits you you stand up and then it goes to doug dog and you're [laughter] like oh i actually i was on stream the other day and i i messaged him on on his chat and i said i hope you win so that i don't have to go on stage and [ __ ] my pants acr well worst of luck to you i i i i wish you the worst then thank you thank you yeah it's too late it's too late to unvote me so it's you know if it happens it happens it happens well i hope you prepare you know what the best part about doing any of these kind of awards things are is you have to go on stage you it has to look low effort and you have to be funny and spot spot you know a lot of spotany going on yeah but you have to pre-plan all of that so good luck good luck on i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it it's gonna be great i'm just gonna wing it it's gonna go if it happens i'm just gonna wing it be like hello i you know that'll happen and that'll be great at least you lot of practice talking you know at least i mean words will come out now whether they're coherent and well thought through probably not but at least words will come out they will it'll i hope i hope it's words all right shall we shall we read this because i haven't read this yet you want to read this yeah i'll read it so said so enough time is passed now for me to talk about why i decided to leave blizzard a mixed year with great teammates but a management that mistreated lied to me gaslit me gave me a fake promotion an hr that refused to help buckle up friendos so this is going to be rough by the way that whole thing of there and hr that refus to help hr is not there for you hr is there to protect the company never forget that that is is that true universally cuz that's been my experience universally has been hr's there to protect the company never there to protect company from you that is how that works yeah 100% okay i want to i want to start by saying that all of the people i got to work with on team 4 overwatch 2 were were incredible i can agree with that over like team 4 is awesome 100% they were warm welcoming fun and friendly and so goddamn talented there were so many great people on my team championing for me and i'm grateful for their support unfortunately however i spent most of the year stressed out of my mind working for four people's jobs at once yeah and having management make promises they had no intention to fulfilling and i ultimately felt like i had no choice but to leave for my own mental health yep in july 2023 i was invited to a meeting by art leadership and production to let me know they were interested in promoting me to lead vfx artists of the cosmetics team skins emotes pgs etc so plays the game i had only been there for six months and told them basically if you're sure lol yeah that's a that's a fair assumption at that point it's like i've only been here 6 months why are you giving me so much you know permission like what's happening here right i'd be wary of that as well said but before accepting i was adamant that we were all on the same page about the full role what it meant what i would be doing and also what the promotion would come with pay increase title changes and confirmed all of those details before going further these conversations included other lead vfx art directors associate art directors production directors and also hr and we were all all happy and i started the job effective immediately with the details to come at the end of the week in writing ooh uhoh uhoh no no you don't do that you so there is a very similar situation that happened with me when i was in it on a uh senior red team position they wanted me to move over to a new job that was dealing with specifically finding all the bers because i was very good at it and they refused to give me any of the information about the pay or the role until i started the position and none of it was in writing it and i left instead and the reason i did is because the moment you start that position with it in writing they can const that as maybe you've accepted the position already and you're just accepting all of the terms and there's all this other kind of weird [ __ ] and then it turns into a legal battle it turns into a problem with that so yeah i said no instead i have all of my paid time off sa saved up which i had the maximum and i cashed that [ __ ] out at my current rate which was a much higher rate mostly because i had friends in payol and i asked them what the job was going to be and it was a lot less even though the my my manager wouldn't tell me really that's that's wild they tried to give you a downgrade like i i don't really often hear about downgrades that's kind of wild i've had a very similar thing because i worked my previous company before my current one uh it was i would say it's akin to uh game stuff because i was working uh somewhere between 60 to 100 hours a week like every week i' work 14 hour days just non-stop uh dude it it was a it was a rough time it was a rough time me and my wife were first year married and i'm working every hour of of the day every day and i remember during that time you know i was oh yeah you're now team lead you're now doing this you're now doing this and you know there was no change and then finally i was just like okay this is getting kind of weird you know i've been doing this non-stop and i'm getting absolutely nothing from this and so when i finally was like by the way i'm leaving i'm going to netflix they're like oh no no how hey you know let's let's let's like get you your pay up let's do all these things i'm like no no no no no no no i know how this works like that's that's that's not that's not working because you didn't do it to begin with it doesn't mean you're going to keep on doing it going forward you're you're you wen honest to begin with y yeah yeah no that's exactly what it was it was like all my because i'm a hacker right i've been hack i've been a hacker for like 20 years and you you start to get you get a lot of [ __ ] detector when you're a social engineer and like part of my my big part of my job is being a social engineer right so like my [ __ ] detector was going off the charts i was like dude no this is this this is one of those like fight orf flight responses where it's like i know they're ripping me off i need to reach out to my contacts i reached out to my contacts i found out they were ripping me off and i was like nope we're going to screw you right back and leavea and just did it and just did you know and i didn't actually have the job in amazon lined up for that so i took that paid time off money which was paid at the full rate because i gotten the other role yet and i i used that as runway to go get the the job at amazon while i was sitting at home awesome so did you did you preow you wanted amazon or did you actually leave the job going i don't know what to do and then amazon just like fell into your lap i i left the job saying the best option because i i never anticipated leaving blizzard i never wanted to i i at that time in my life i didn't have my resume and my cover letter on the market which by the way you always should if you're in tech always have your resume and cover letter on the market always be shopping no matter what and i learned thumb is that if they message you personally yep i almost always take an interview if i get some spam kind of marketing like you can tell and sometimes it even comes with underscores and stuff where they meant to put your name in like then i then at that point i won't do it but if someone sends me a personal letter i will minimally give them a 30 minute chat about the job that's like my general rule of thumb yeah i i don't do that now but i used to do that that like when i was still on the market doing that kind of stuff but now it's like i'm running a thing so like i don't want to stop doing that well yeah i mean is there any job someone could offer you that you would want to stop running your own thing that's successful to go run someone else's thing right i don't i don't know if that's no and the reason why it would be no isn't isn't like for me because maybe i could get better whatever you know at another place but that would be letting down every well it's not even just that it'd be letting down every person who works for me yeah and i i'm not gna ever do that like i don't what you know an incremental increase for me but devastating for every other person that relies on me what's the point of that nothing you know it's that that would be awful and no no not even not even close yeah toally feel that and and that's the thing is that as you build out what you're doing you get to be that manager that you didn't have you get to be the team lead that people didn't have you get to have all of that stuff and you get to be that guy and so you get to you know pull a bunch of people out of something and so it's like how do you ever how do you replace that yeah and i that's actually i've implemented a couple of the things that i've seen that i saw at blizzard that did work like we had this thing called email mic where if the system completely failed you you could actually send an email to mike morheim as any employee in any position anywhere in the company totally discreetly what what who's mike who is mike what is his position mike morheim he's one of the founders of blizzard who ceo man yeah well you gotta say those not everybody knows you know who mik mor is oh my god said not everybody okay my goodness come on thor you think everybody in your chat knew who he was i bet you there's one person who refuses to say that they don't they're just like oh yeah totally m co-founder a loser mike morheim is one of the founders of lizard so he's ceo um and he cares very passionately about the company very very much so and so he had a thing called email mike where you could send an email at any time to him no matter what position you were in the company you could be cs you could be a janitor it doesn't matter right and he would he would accept your email and he would talk to you and he did it all the time and if it was very serious he would handle it and he he i had to send one of those at one point and he did handle it right so like those types of things do happen and so i implemented the same thing in our studio where i have a ticket system that any employee of mine can go and send in a ticket directly to me goes to nobody else it's just me and them and that's totally fine you know and i i want to have things like that that i knew worked even at that kind of crazy scale very massive company you know that that's respectable we have something similar at netflix where we have something called the open q&a which is a google doc and you get to ask your you get to ask a question and then one of the se suite or sometimes a vp like once someone really high up in that's particular to that specific strategy that you're asking about will write a response and then the history goes on forever so we have like open q&a for the last five years all the doc questions ever asked all that all there so every you know and if you just don't understand something or you want to say why aren't we doing this or what you know why does this happen you will get an answer it's pretty it's it's a good it's a good system i have a horrifying story for you in that line let's hear it so blizzard used do the same thing at like christmas parties and stuff like that they do these q&a sessions and sometimes they do these big meetings where they'd get like a like a big hall and everyone would be in there and we'd all be talking and you could go up in front of everyone with a microphone and ask questions right i love where this is going it's just like an open mic thing and so they were we were having all this this internal discussion about heres the storm because her's the storm was built on the same stuff as starcraft 2 and as such it was just as uniquely vulnerable to map haacks it was exactly the same vulnerability in fact you could take a map haack for starcraft 2 right off the market change the memory address locations that it would point to and you had a working map haack for heroes of the storm and if you don't know what a map haack is it shows where all of the opponents are on the map even if you're not allowed to see those opponents which gave you a significant advantage think league of legends but you can see the whole map at the whole time awful right horrible so internally the security team and the risk team i was part of the security team time the risk team we we told them like you need to fix this before this goes live because you want this to be an ort this can't be an ort if you do this it's imposs right and they were like no no no no you don't know what you're talking about all this kind of stuff they didn't fix it and it was it was bad dude like it was really bad so during one of those meetings one of these dudes comes up and he asks the question he goes well what are you guys going to be doing about vack and one of the se street guys real smugly i don't remember which one it is he goes well that's what we have a risk team for and the the guy said well i am the risk team so what are you going to do about it and the room just just ate it dude like it was so because the guy who walked up was a risk team member and the the only solution to that problem is you have to wait for a player to report somebody else that has cheated at the game and then you have to manually review that game to see if he reacted to something in fog of war there's no other way to detect it it's horrific which is why if you look in starcraft at the ends of the seasons right you have all these names are like barcode names and they don't get banned to the end of the season that's why because it's manual it's awful ah yeah that's nothing else you could do with that map yeah they're out of process map packs there's nothing you can do for detection on that dang and why is it even possible because they stored all of the location data for all the units on all of the clients even though they were in fog of war but uh you know not a not a great way to do it that doesn't even sound like that hard of a problem i mean you you already are sending down the data probably with tls you know encrypted and all that so it's not like they can view the the network packets it's just really down it's just really down to like don't store things that aren't in memory yet the problem is is you you have to remember brokering servers it's run on brokering servers which means all of that data is on every one of the clients man that's it it doesn't it doesn't hold anything on the server itself it holds it all inside of the clients the brokering servers just transmit the data and that's it so f f's in the chat yeah what does that mean so a brokering server in this situation doesn't actually store any of the data on itself it just transmits the data between the different clients the clients are always aware of where all those units are and they have to be based on that infrastructure the only way to try and build like fix that is to try and do a client server model the server holds all of that data and the client is just kind of a dummy right which is how league of legends does it which is why you can't use map haacks in league of legends there might be a small buffer zone around the fog of war area where you can't see units where it is still technically in memory so that they can cash it so when a unit walks out of fog war they don't pop into existence yeah so that's pretty normal that's what i would assume so that way like if you did get to cheat you could only cheat like four feet in front of you you couldn't cheat the entire map and it's just like ah yeah well i mean an advantage but any player with skill would dominate the player without skill right we could all go okay yeah yeah we get that and and someone actually brought up that sounds like peerto peer it basically is but it's obfuscating everyone's ip addresses because the brokering server stops your ip address from leaking to the other players effectively the same model but with the brokering server in place yeah that's why whenever you play starcraft 2 and one person disconnects and the whole game gets all cra you know gets all crazy it's because there's that that situation going on all right you want to keep on reading let's let's hear about let's hear more about this let's let's go so these conversations included other lead vfx art directors associate art directors production directors and also hr giving the all happy so we talked about that the new role was all of my existing responsibilities and workload as a senior becoming a line manager of three people immediately managing our entier just so we understand what a line because i actually don't i only understand that in terms of restaurants so i don't so i don't know what a line manager is i've never heard that term inside the gaming industry so my guess is that he was a manager for three people like maybe that's what they're using supervisor for cuz in in in the teams that i was on we had a thing called a supervisor and a supervisor was like a baby manager that was like a manager to like three to five people so maybe that's what that is such you get direct reports as a supervisor we called it a supervisor so i guess his was was just a line manager was his position for okay yeah like kind of like a team lead but not not paying you like a team lead you know what i mean yeah yeah managing our entire outour vfx pipeline in china that's a rough that's a rough one that's a that's a team job that's night yeah that's a nighttime job too yep because you're you're g to be at the wrong wrong side of the world for that yep so plus additional lead things planning much much more meetings friday of the past week comes nothing but the production director does announce my promotion to lead to the whole team on the thursday it's official it's happening the whole team knows i even tweet about it because i'm so excited we're all gucci so he actually tweets it out here and he says oh they sent an email about working announcing my promotion he's so excited about it right said my first week is lead my new manager tells me that we are going to have to fire one of my new reports cuz he won't rto rto means real time officer rto i don't remember these damn terms i've been out of pocket for so long return to office policy that's what it is spaming it return to office so when you're i i guess during the pandemic everybody went to go do that and this guy doesn't want to return to the office he want to works from home you know wants to keep working from home he won't rto won't return to office fire him this happened to a lot of people so i hate acronyms by the way so he said me he's waiting for medical accommodation because he is a carer for his parents them yeah laughing we're not going to do that for a junior that is a lot more normal than you think and i hate it i hate it a lot like is it just that so so is there really like a culture of of um like looking down on every experience rung yes that is that there's so many titles like assistant director or a associate director versus a director versus a team lead versus a supervisor versus a manager the way that i felt about it is high school never ends man and it was like that through most of my career there it felt like i was working a lot of the times it felt like not every team mind you yeah but a lot of times it felt like i was working with a bunch of people in high school and there were a lot of clicks there were a lot of [ __ ] there was a lot of looking down on other teams there was a lot of group group culture kind of [ __ ] and then i went to amazon game studio and that was all gone and i was in a room with a bunch of adults and it was night and day man can i ask you a quick question uh this mik fella sounds like he he didn't really i guess subscribe to that kind of model and he was one of the founder ceo then how does that type of culture bloom if you have somebody that is a opposed to it so high up like was he just not firing the people high enough up to like prevent that because culture flows downwards right it it can once you get to too large of a structure it creates these festering pockets right so what ended up happening in this case and i remember remember when when blizzard got sued by the state of california for i don't they've been sued a lot of times i but uh was this the one with all the marches and everything and there's i think it was like something with sexism was that was that what it was all that stuff and it it was bad dude like it was really bad there was a lot of horrible stuff that went on it was awful when that happened i'm actually in a a facebook group group called blizzard alumni which is all the old you know people who used to work at blizzard and mike and and his wife actually wrote like a big uh email to everybody like a big message to everybody apologizing to all of them because he didn't know a lot of the m like you know wrongdoings that were going on he was insulated from because middle management would trap it in there and i saw the exact same thing when i tried to report things up that were awful and i eventually had to do an email mic and when i did an email mic it was handled in 24 hours when i had been waiting weeks before that and they gum it up in middle management to protect people that are you know inside of their group so you get these bad little pockets where not everybody's bad but this pocket is bad and it f it insulates it yeah and then you have this buffer zone where the the person upper can't even hear it or see it because it's fog of war you have fog of war and they don't have they don't have map hacks that's exactly what it is man and it's it's really devastating to think about and there's the what i learned from that and why i run my studio the way i do i run my studio like a d and d team 3 to five people that's the development team if it's in if it's the right size for a dungeons and dragons team you don't have miscommunication you can all sit at the table together the whole team that's working on whatever it is you're working on you can sit together and work on a game together and that's it because once you start expanding beyond that these types of things can happen doesn't mean they will but they can and you need to have a lot of other checks and balances in places to stop these sort of festering hives from growing right let me ask you a quick question were the vps like i think a very healthy thing that you can see in orgs is that vps and like super high up people meet with individual contributors like once a month or once a quarter right so there's this kind of reaching down that reaches across the if you will the blood barrier to go into an area in which they don't get insight into was that happening at blizzard where where people hire up were crossing boundaries so mike did that mike morheim would do that so what he obviously mike did that he was good at that but anyone else he would do things no no no he he did this thing called cs for day or qa for day and he would actually go down in the trenches and do their job for like 24 to 72 hours and just fix everything and like he'd be like why this doesn't make any sense fix this and it would be things that like cs would be complaining about for like nine months 10 months and it got fixed in a day because mike morheim stepped down and did their job for a day and was like this is inefficient and stupid stop it you know and i'm just shocked that he didn't know these things going wrong like it's hard man you got a 5,000 person company you can't see every piece of that you know and it's even even building a corp now for myself there are little pieces that happen in our our discord's got 77,000 people in it right massive community there are moderation actions that go on every day that i know nothing of because i'm on stream all day like i'm running the stream and the mods handle it and we talk about some of them later if they're egregious enough but some of them they're the only ones who see it you know and like that's kind of how that goes eventually that can spiral out of control you know it can turn into a situation where maybe one of those mods is cherry-picking or allowing toxicity to fester or covering for some people right which is why we have a system in place where any moderator can send me a ticket so i can fix it if there is a problem like that i can go and do the investigation and we can handle it right so like as your structure grows you have to put these checks and balances in place but the larger it grows the more blind spots you have and that's i think that's really what if affected blizzard the most in that regard and it's sucks but large org man the only other way to fix is you got to have a lot of oversight ton of over yeah and and discord is i mean your problem is uniquely challenging because everyone there is effectively volunteers right at blizzard everyone there was i mean in the sense that oh you're 77,000 people there those are all people who just want to be they're interested in what you're doing and i'm sure you know you you must have a small set that you're actually working with day-to-day that are paid but you know a large portion are just people there because they're interested and so how like at blizzard though every person there theoretically was paid i assume whether it wasn't that good but they were still paid nonetheless unless you'rea intern or something weird yeah yeah unless there something's truly messed up but you you'd think like that feels easier to manage than discord discord is just a wild west you know half the time it is the wild west i have to rely on people just to make a good calls because you can't like yeah just because there's there's no pre screening for you to enter into the discord so that requires a lot of just like you have to trust people to make good decisions whereas you have you have yeah that's what just makes that's that's where i you're you're probably right like in the sense that i think everyone looks at a problem that's difficult and if you've never really thought about it and lived it for the first time it feels simple and obvious to fix and i'm sure like in the actual practical application it's it's it's damn near impossible and mike probably truly just didn't actually have control or even have the ability to make to affect the change i still i mean still even when i whenever i hear that i still think about this call me crazy but it just feels like if i were in that position i would have to say okay i can't affect change this is clearly continuously going wrong the only way to fix this is that i have to do like a mass metal management layoff like even all the good ones like i'm sorry i'm not trying to be a a dick but something's wrong and there's some broken thing in here we have to we have to try we have to try something different i think there's a better way and i think the better way is to hire hire an outside team to do investigations inside the company discretely that's how you'd have to do it o some sort of like almost like some sort of hacking like offensive hacking but it's offensive hr yep you'd have to you'd have to hire an outside company to do investigations within the company that's the it's an external audit so they have no ties to anyone inside of the company they have no bias in that regard and then you do that that's the only thing that you can possibly do it would it be effective maybe but that's that would be the only effective thing at that point dude that's such a great idea but so hard how would you get because you'd have to get people organically placed in higher positions throughout the company that are underco like this is like this is like double agent stuff you got going on here well i mean think about it this way right like u ju just think about like amazon the way that amazon is structured there was no [ __ ] there there was no drama that i saw right yeah and i was there for a while i was there for over a year and didn't see even a lick of that right but i'll tell you one thing their security systems were fantastic if you went to your desk without badging in if you tailgated someone a member of the security team would be at you in 30 seconds every time and be like you need to get up out of your desk and go bad j right now i have never seen that anywhere else and that shows me a company that is like properly set up so if they have that level of physical security in place at all hours of the day all the time they likely have other set layers of security in place it's not a mom and pop shop it's not a massive company run you know like that it's not it's it's actually a company okay fair all right let's let's we we can we we can move on to this uh this this next one okay it's wild it's wild though i i could keep talking about this forever that's why i'm like okay we should probably yeah going so another lead on the team offers to deliver the news for me because it's my first week as lead and the person we are supposed to fire is one of my closest friends on the team he is given until the end of the month to either relocate or leave we're all distra i'm now doing my senior role my lead role and now all of the work that this great vfx artist was doing they then refused to hire on an intern turn another one of my reports who is incredibly talented and we all love so i add the work they were doing to my own plate i got ads again i'm going to wait okay you got ads okay yeah yeah we can wait jump scare dude yeah for those who don't know i i run ads on my stream too i have ads too do you think they're aligned i don't know maybe are our cycles aligned right now i don't know we are we've crossed the stream so it makes sense yeah wild they just discord unites us even in ads that's true it's true yeah i when i run ads i i do breaks for everything i i put a big jeff bezos head on there it's quite funny hey by the way uh what what day are you arriving for the streamer rewards i'll be there on friday i think around 1 i was gonna come a day early and leave a day late i'm that's exactly what i'm doing i'm doing a day late so friday's the 16th yeah i'll be there we should hang okay yeah do you know sushi dragon dude yeah yeah yeah yeah him and i were gonna do something you want to you want to come crash the sushi dragon irl stream and go eat sushi and hang out that sounds cool as [ __ ] dude his augmented stuff is crazy yeah it's super crazy we could we could do a pretty fun little thing yeah no i'm down i'm super down that'd be a lot of fun man you know he lives in boseman he lives in boseman my old my my alma moer that's where i grew up and stuff yeah i grew up in god i grew up in orange county b i grew up in like tustin that's kind of where i was at what's and i moved weird you know mostly it's like irvine but with crime you know oh fantastic that sounds like a good time it's right across the freeway you know where the crime happens the barrier there yeah dude is that not the weirdest thing that that does actually happen we had that in billings montana we there was a railroad and it was we actually had the wrong side of the tracks and one side was like clean and nice and the other side it was just like welcome to oakland right like it's just like you you cross that bridge and or the the railroad track and it's immediately worse i had a shooting at my job yeah i was a lif guard i got we had two girls watching a kitty pool and uh you know i lived in i lived in i lived in montana so it's a different world and some people jumped the fence and beat up the girls and so they said okay from here on out girls can't watch the kitty pool by themselves so i someone has to go and watch the kitty pool with them and so they selected me and i kid you not this is the exact phrase i'm not making it up i'm not sugarcoating it or exaggerating it my boss at the time who worked for the state pulled me aside handed me a switchblade very illegal and said if any indians jump the fence you got to stab him what where what kind of mad house did you what what that's that's that was my job when i was' years old teaming with testosterone and a switchblade like hell yeah we got switch we're go we're just going down i'm amazed you survived i know kind it was the crazi environment that is that's nuts man jesus anyways sorry okay we we can we could go on totally just derailed now yeah no god damn we we could talk more about doing all this extra work now yeah a month goes by and i've now sent an email or i i've now sent an email or slack message every other day to find out what's happening with the pay increase and title change so his pay has not increased despite doing all this extra work his title has not changed despite it being announced and he lost the teammate so he lost the intern so he's actually doing even bonus work now yep he says i'm told it has to wait until august because that's when all the promotions happen but don't worry it's all happening oh no no dude no dude that is that bothers the [ __ ] out of me no that's not good at all that's really scary stuff i then discovered that i am earning less than 50% of every other lead vfx artist at blizzard so much so that as a lead my salary is lower than every person i am managing i send more emails i'm told it's cuz i'm in the uk and my salary is based on market value not my value oh dude dude i i'm gonna throw something out there okay uh i think that location based pay is is kind of is kind of stupid it's yeah it really bothers me like i get a 5% uh pay uh decrease or 15% pay decrease because i live in in in rapid city south dakota right yeah i'm i like it doesn't hurt me like i'm not like oh gosh you know it's the worst thing ever but still it's like it's it's also super stupid that being said um when i worked at blizzard i was a senior red team specialist and i was paid 36% of industry standard inside of my own area so yeah you you lived in california you lived at the place and you still yeah got crushed the job that i went on to after all of that was hacking power plants for the federal government so it's not like i was lacking the ability yeah yeah i think i think you had the skills to pay the bills but just a little bit yeah they just they just wouldn't pay you know that was that was the whole point with that yeah that was my that was my last job yeah i was hacking power plants for the federal government i worked for the doe i also have three black badges from defcon i am a i a hacker that is what i yeah that's my career yeah you actually hack this isn't this isn't like fake hacking like you although somebody did say on twitter that i was a hobbyist hacker in in my earlier career which was very funny to me i was like ah yes what a hobbyist you know yeah i mean i guess tech technically you have to it has to be a hobby for you to be that good also it's not only just full-time it also has to be a hobby so it i mean arguably technically semantically correct but kind of a dick move you know like little bit dick yeah little dick right there there we go this very funny so another month passes and i get and august turns out to be no no it's actually september now for some reason but don't worry it's coming it's definitely a promotion and there's definitely a pay increase i continue to be overworked and exhausted but hopeful fool fool there it is hey hey to be fair though the only place you don't have hope is hell right that's dante's inferno right right above the the the the pathway to hell is abandoned hope all ye who enter and so hope a good thing though can lead to this type of stuff the problem is is he's in a emotionally distraught state he's beat up from the work he's not able to fight so the only thing he has is well well maybe it'll be okay maybe i'll just keep doing this maybe it's going to work out i'm already in i might as well go all in right and i had the exact same experience when i was a blizzard and i broke out of that because my [ __ ] detector went off too hard yeah and that was it and i feel so bad for this guy this is crazy yeah it's the same so like this is this echoes the [ __ ] out of what i went through so i understand and it's it's a pattern of of an issue with a lot of people there so another few weeks pass and it's getting to 3 months being a lead so i sent an email out to everyone directors vps hr leads you name it telling them that if there is no written information by september 1st i will stop doing the ro immediately suddenly people have something to say this entire time hr have not responded once and they're finally reply inviting me for a quick call it is this call and h ask me what promotion i have no idea what you're talking about at this point i raised a formal complaint i had months of messages emails that i sent to hr explaining that i was talking about and they finally reply with you seem to be confused there is no promotion leadership is a lateral move it's just a change of responsibilities there is no pay increase can we get quick to can we get a quick timeout here leadership is a lateral move no it's not i mean i one okay so let me counter that there is at least one counter that if you go from say principal engineer to director one would argue you have a similar impact radius and that's maybe a lateral move there's still a title change but there's a title change and a responsibility change and a work change you know one could argue it's a lateral move if you have the same impact you just have an impact in an orthogonal way if one could argue but this does not sound like he was exper he was not a principal person going to a role of equivalent thing he was being promoted and gaining new things and now starting to manage people yep this this sounds like the craziest thing i've ever heard the general san was monthly monthly reports with people too which means he had had 3 months of direct reports from people that he was managing and then he was told that he's not getting a pay increase for this in any way yeah after being told see here's the thing that i want to know right he was receiving these communications were those verbal communications or were those email communications yeah yeah because email would be uh email and slack because slack is audible or auditable and so those i mean i assume those would come with legal responsibilities versus ones i mean you got the whole he said she said problem cuz he said i had months of messages emails that i sent to hr to explain what i was talking about and they finally reply with all of this he had months of messages that he sent to hr yeah who was sending him these messages under what communication style here's the biggest thing to you guys always get it in writing yeah if it's not in writing it doesn't exist if they say something's going to happen you say cool i'll do that once it's in writing that's it this is not happening until that's a contract i won't do that work until it's on paper that's it uh thing i i like to practice personally uh a lot of times whenever there's kind of this type of talk that's happening frequently like you know because a lot of times there's just like informal talk about hey what's going on hey would you like to look into this hey would you like you know there that will always happen at some levels and so frequently what i frequently what i'll do is right after that i will follow up with the slack message and being like hey you know i i do feel like this is a good move are you sure we want to move in this dire you know like i get them to agree in a more formal sense ever moving just because you know not everything requires paper because some of it is just literal like i'm changing what i'm doing for these set of reasons and i just want to make sure everyone knows that i'm doing this but i always try to make sure that there's a paper trail of some sort like this is why i've made all my decisions ever yeah no it's it's super important to do that it's always important to make sure that the other party is bought in to the the level that you can turn around and go no you said you do this here's the paper trail now what are you going to do you know and that's that's it make make a legal paper trail for yourself always and i i don't know if he did that here it sounds like he didn't right so she said i was livid naturally and asked that any normal rational human would uh would quote why would anybody want the promotion then which obviously then did the old i can see you're frustrated and i can see how you misinterpreted this oh jesus man if someone tells me i know how you feel i see you're frustrated i there nothing makes me want to like physically slap a person more like that's like that's where like i cross that brer i'm like i'm too hot to even talk right now when that happens i just and then you just back off you're like okay there's there's two options here i cool off or i murder a person right and i don't want to murder a person because that sends you to jail so i'm just going to stop we're going to wait until i cool down for a second and then i'm going to talk to you rationally and directly about how much i want you to shove your head up your ass like that's pretty much how that goes right it's it's this it's the it's the modern empathy movement right they use all these words that sound like they care about you but it's just like somehow so much worse i'd rather have someone be like you didn't notice that idiot i'd rather have you say that than be like oh i feel you oh man i% 100 you know you know i i feel i feel the way that you're feeling right i totally understand what it is maybe we can circle back on this later you know i don't want to boil the ocean it's a dead we talk about this in october october is our month to talk about this we'll come back october is the month to bring these things up yeah and then in october it's like you know the new year is is very close so let's talk about it then you know after after the christmas move you know all of this stuff in the holidays absolutely then we got chinese new year afterwards so we got chinese new year it's just a really tough time right now you know it's a lot of things going on globally and it's it's going to get in the way of that you know business management stuff god i hate it dude i i know i know it all it it it bothers the hell out of me i've lived it so the investigation from the formal complaint comes back after a few weeks and after some careful deliberation decides that hr did nothing wrong and followed all processes correctly so i handed my resignation about an hour later but it doesn't end there because no hr then told me that because of my role as a lead i had gained inexplicable knowledge that would put me on a business risk to work anywhere else so they're activating a non-compete clause that restricts me from working anywhere at all for 3 months and you may be rightfully thinking oh so this is a paid 3 months right you can't stop someone from working at all for 3 months without paying them incorrect that is exactly what they yep that is exactly what they did and unfortunately completely legal because get screwed i guess and that's it because he was in the uk right so he's in the uk how did i didn't realize that the uk i mean man that's crazy that you can enact that and even ac cross country boundaries like that that's what i'm wondering so i'm wondering at that point i'd hire a lawyer if i was in that type of a situation i'd be like you're doing what okay you're going to talk to my legal team now we'll see how this goes cuz i'm i'm i'm not well versed in eu law one of my moderators is he's actually a copyright lawyer in in the uk okay but like that seems wrong and i would talk to a lawyer right my legal advice is never to give legal advice i say talk to a lawyer talk to the best legal advice ever is to go find someone that knows the law go talk to a lawyer yeah generally my my general rule is that if you feel if you feel like something's deeply wrong and you cannot explain anything other than it just seems like a massive human rights violation go talk to a lawyer just just go you say he can't afford a lawyer no you can you'd be surprised because a lot of the times what you can do is you can talk to a lawyer under certain constraint of say like hey i i'd like to talk to you about an issue and we can see if we can go from there and a lot of those introductory things are either not very expensive or are free depending on what's going on and if it's a a legal battle like this there's a lot of laws in the uk that absolutely absolutely cover your ass as a worker like europe does not screw around with that the uk specifically doesn't screw around with that so and then on top of that a lot of lawyers will be glad they like large corporate uh like things like this are huge paychecks and a lot of a lot of lawyers will go in be like i take 20% that's that right i've seen a lot of people say i'll do we'll just go through this because we're going to win this one yep and we'll take a percentage of your gains and that's it and you'll win something and we'll win something and everybody goes home happy so there are situations like that and you you'd be surprised there are even some that will do it pro bono there's even um like systems in place based in the country that you're in that may fight for you on behalf of the country and say you cannot treat our citizens this way there's all kinds of stuff like that man so like there is never a time where you should be like oh i can't see lawyer because i might not be rich enough to see it no talk to a lawyer find out for sure what your options are you have a three-month unpaid vacation at this point so it it does sound like no matter what things are already going be bad enough you should talk to a lawyer yeah so if anyone has continued so far thank you for listening so oh wait here we go i i said i can't survive for three months without pay i have a mortgage and they looked in me in the eye and said well you probably shouldn't have signed the contract then smiley face within a few minutes i was locked out of slack email and that was the end of my time at blizzard and yeah that's exactly how that goes they kick you right out when i was in qa we went through the first mass firing blizzard ever did called the blizzard 600 and the way that it went down was horrific when we were coming into the front doors into the building all the managers were there that morning everyone's like what the hell's going on and they directed you to the right or to the left if you went to the right you were going to hr and you were fired if you went to the left you were going to your desk problem with this not only is it horrible to see this happening right there was a back door to the building that was used by like 50% of the staff so after all of this went on the managers had to go around to people's desks and find the ones who had gone in from the back that were supposed to be fired and go pick them up from their desks in front of everyone the rest of the team about an hour later uh we asked the managers hey can we have the rest of the day off this is horrific and they said no we walked out anyway did did they at least give you like say a task of 30 items to do and see who could leave the fastest no not that time that one was just fire everybody like with a shotgun dude like it was it was just like random people on random teams in fact we were picking up work for people for like 6 months after that finding tasks that like just disappeared and directly impacted the games like directly impacted that cuz there was just [ __ ] that just didn't get picked up cuz like a whole section of the team would be gone all the people and their supervisor just gone so who's going to know who's going to know about that right yeah just just people going wait what happened why i thought we were looking into this so when these types of things happen when they fire someone they fire them just gone you know and and it's devastating it's 100% devastating wow so let's see i also want to sincerely thank everyone who purchased a mentorship one if anyone has continued so far thank you for listening i don't know what the point of this is but i need to get off my chest blizzard had every opportunity to do the right thing and they continually failed at that and yeah no i i agree with this the problem is is once you start down the route of you have pissed off a click you've pissed off a group you have bothered an in crowd inside of that environment it all goes downhill from there yeah because those little festering groups network with each other in a way that you can no longer win and when that happens the only thing that matters is yourself and getting out of there and putting yourself in a a proper position and that's ex this kind of a thing is what was happening to me so i bailed out before they could pull the trigger on me before they could screw up my life and i said nope uno reverso give me all my money i'm out and that's it dang and i yeah i had i i mean i luckily i was on the other side of the click i was on the good side at my the previous company but i was still even by management getting getting blasted by stuff yeah it was not it was not very great but n nonetheless it the people on the other side of the click and you know here's the here's the hard part is when i was really young i i you know i i definitely fell into the [ __ ] range for sure and you know i look back on a lot of mistakes i've made and i you know knowing what i know now i wish i could talk to myself and and explain like wisdom uh man it's hard because i think when you when you're on the other side of things it's not directly hitting you so you don't really say anything yeah what i mean and it's so easy to fall into the it's not necessarily my problem yeah this other person is screwing up it's not you know it hurts it sucks it it feels bad now that i'm older and maybe a bit wiser in my years i i went all abandoned on that because i grew up in early blizzard back when blizzard was first starting right and those core values mean a lot to me the way that i always feel about it is you sign a contract you follow that contract that's how that works right if you're going to do it do the job and those core values were part of that contrave and i watched over the years as people did not follow those core values or twisted them into weapons to hurt people that was just trying to do their jobs correctly and i always fought for it and it put me in a lot of really you know on a lot of bad sides with people but positioning yourself in a way where you can't be defeated you can still fight those types of things it's just very hard like one of the ones that i fought against was when i was in qa there was an issue that happened where i had to go send an email mike and the people that were involved were qa localization q localization were the victims of this and they were individuals that had green cards right so they lose employment they get deported that's the whole thing with that right so they're yeah the position so they can't fight yeah because if if they fight they could be on the bad side and now they have to go back to the country that they came from was that h1 is that is that what we're talking i don't know what the term was for them yeah i don't know what the term was all i by the way they lost employment it's over i'm shocked that that is a i mean i understand the the the base principle of it which is like hey you you live somewhere else you want to be able yeah it's h1b it should be h1b you you live somewhere else and you want to be a part of whatever country every country has a version of this and like it's great that we allow work opportunities for people who are highly qualified to be able to do these tasks that we can't find anyone to do right like that's a that's a good principled idea but man the fact that when you when a company hires them it can turn into complete extortion it's just crazy in this scenario they felt powerless specifically because of that so i ended up i went down the normal route i reported to my supervisor i report to upper management i waited i waited 2 and a half weeks i went talked to people that were affected they had heard nothing from anyone and i said now's time for me to do this and i fired off an email mic 24 hours later the person who had actually done all of this was fired and all of those qa localization people were talked to and they were apologized to and their their jobs were like totally fine everything was good and that was it and it was just like you could see that click collapse because of a system like email mic in place that's why i do that today because those yep the click you need you need a good person that is both engaged with the company and empowered to solve problems to be in that kind of a position and once they are they can rip right through that [ __ ] and just remove it dude it's like draining ayst that's all it is we got one last one to do and i actually i i think this one's very sweet the ending to this sure let's let's let's hear it let's hear it thor wait what are what are we talking what the tweet the very last tweet oh no oh no wait a minute the last one's so sweet if we didn't read the last one so i also want to sincerely thank everyone who purchased a mentorship session this one yeah yeah portfolio review with me at the end of last year it quite literally saved me and i meant that i was able to not go into debt and i am so hugely grateful and hope you all felt like you were they were worth it yeah that's it's really nice i'm going to go like every single one of this dude's post yeah i'm going to join you on the on the like spam he's going to look and be like dude this one guy just really liked all my tweets what's wrong with this guy gross dude look this guy likes spamming me no this is the the reason why this hits me so hard is because it's it's very similar to what i saw and it's the moment you you can tell it's the moment when they don't care about you anymore where they realize oh we've got enough out of this person it doesn't matter now and because we've got enough out of them we can just treat them like dirt and it's exactly where i was when i left it's the exact same thing dude and it it's just devastating to see that and i know that it's happened to so many more because when that lawsuit went through from the state of california that facebook page lit up with hundreds of stories yeah like there's 800 people in there there was like 1,00 stories and some of them were way worse than the things that i saw and some of them were way more minor than the things i saw it was a massive spectrum of just insane [ __ ] and it i feel really badly for mike because he didn't know how bad it was and he was totally insulated from it and imagine building something over your life your life's work this beautiful thing where you just want to make these cool games and you got all your buddies and you build this thing and it gets bigger and bigger and bigger and you think that you're doing objectively good you've got all these good systems in place and it rots out from under you and you don't get to find out until you're retired it's pretty much like termites your house looks nice everything about your place looks great and then one day you have to rip up a floor tile and you realize your entire foundation is rotted it's just so rough dude and it it it was just it's really sad it's really goddamn sad so yeah yeah and what to be real with you the grand majority of people that i know who have moved on are much happier man i'm way happier now i get to make all the things i want to do and i get to write those wrongs for other people that join the industry get to help people get into the industry in like a you know a healthy way and share these types of stories so if they're ever in that kind of situation you get that [ __ ] in writing and you don't trust hr you know yeah that's it i i think one of the sad thing because i see a lot of people being like us labor laws are crazy and you know people defending this and that kind of way i i think the sad thing about this is that you know i'm sure there's laws that could help prevent certain aspects to this but you know all laws have some level of ramifications and things that it will change or you know a lot of times it's like a ball you squeeze and certain things come out certain things go in and it just makes me sad because i mean the true problem is is that when power comes into play sometimes people can do wild things and it's really sad because like obviously the guy who the the people who made this company made it because they loved games and they built amazing games and to see something so good just collapse is always just so sad because it's like an end of an era it's kind of like you know uh what's it called it's like lord of the rings how that's the end of an age right this age cannot exist again there's there may be a new age a better age but the age of blizzard is we're watching it go from one to another yeah and it's funny cu like i i want you guys to know some of you out there work in hr you're not bad people you're doing a job but the role that a lot of people don't understand is that hr is there to protect the company and many people believe that hr is there to protect the employee and that's that's not the case it's to protect the company from the employee it's to protect the company when something goes wrong that is going to harm the company because someone has harmed that employee in a way that could be legally problematic right yeah and that's i think a lot of people forget that it's not a treat hr badly hr is the devil that's not the thing they're human beings as well but their role is to protect the company from mistakes frankly mistakes and legal problems that they could get into with the employees there are some i mean to be to be fully fair there are also situations where two employees are having an issue and yes the hr is there to protect the company from being exposed to the issue of the two employees but their secondary job is to ensure that the two employees can have some sort of resolution that is good for the team good for the you know or there are some things that are like just employee focused yeah there's there's good employee focused things that hr does but you're absolutely right at the end of the day you're not number one the company's number one and i don't blame them that makes perfect sense like that's going to exist in every there is nothing we can do about that not existing it could come up with a new name it could be this it could be that it's just that's what it is and i there's some people on netflix that i genuinely think are great hr people there's one i can think of right now that she has helped me many times throughout my career because you know i'm maybe more of a vocal individual and so you know i've not shied away yeah i've not shied away from the old hr office once or twice and she's been incredibly helpful i i in fact at one point in my life i was getting blackmailed uh not too long ago due to a stupid decision i made uh 15 20 years ago and so like i had to talk to hr about that because well guess who was going to be receiving some messages for some things i did 20 years ago well guess who was really really helpful during that and actually defended me that was really really nice so i'm talking to the primagen guys yeah for everyone asking so i'm not g to tell you what the stupid decisions i made uh 20 years ago was but let's just say it's a veryable off yeah i know it's a very fireable fence today i was stupid i'm a dumb man but yep so yeah i'm talking to the primagen right now so the primagen is is very yeah he's got blue hair yeah you know him as the blue hair guy yeah he's the he's the sonic of programming actually yeah he's converted into sonic as you can see he's blue blue hair if you keep this up i'm gna have to start flossing like you just you got to stop right now he codes really fast right that's why he's sonic yeah it's true it's true blazingly fast blazingly fast dude i genuinely appreciate you doing this this was absolutely fantastic yeah i'm always down to talk about this kind of stuff and it's it's always for me it rein forces why i went indie man like it really does cuz like i i remember when i left blizzard and um you know i've i've known everybody blizzard starting out like forever right so it's um me metson and my dad we had lunch on the day that i quit and i was talking to mets and he's like why'd you quit and i was like and i was going to go to tell him he goes was it the [ __ ] i was like yeah it was the [ __ ] he goes damn blizzard [ __ ] i mean it's not always the [ __ ] like who here has quit because like i mean there is the rare i've quit once because it was uh boring work every other time it's the [ __ ] i've bull right something better can come along that sometimes happen but i've never quit without a job other than just [ __ ] you know it's one of the things that i i talk to my community about is there's a difference between your job and the work the work can be incredibly compelling the work is the thing you actually do the job is things like management and all the structure and all the meetings and all the [ __ ] that goes around that that's not technically you doing the work you may love programming you may love automation you may love doing hr you may love doing whatever it is right doing the thing you love it but the job includes all the extra [ __ ] that isn't the work and a lot of people they're like oh i hate my i hate everything that i do i want to quit my job and i never want to do this you know career ever again it's like no stop you hate the job you may love the work still i would keep that so true in mind if you want to ever quit a job maybe just quit the job don't quit the work move somewhere else and you you may find you know you may find that you actually still love doing that work you just want it in a different environment or with different people it's very important to understand that is that primagen rating me now it is secretly and oh there's chuts and stream now oh god unfortunately i got i got i got work beting and such to do oh it's okay i'm trying to build a service with 59 so i've been experimenting a lot unfortunately all the apis and everything are in javascript and so i just have like try catches and if state like it's it's crazy to make something 59 is is is already hard enough it's it's a hard it's a hard one to do when you have to catch errors that you don't even know exist you know but you now you have to do it on java oh i know i know imagine if it was in rust by the way i mean it's not like i don't have blue hair i mean we could just make you do everything in ruby on rails would that make you happier would you like that yes that that would teach you oh really you're complaining ruby's on rails for a week go yeah there you go get it you into the pit with you go work at that yeah god damn dude well hey i appreciate this very very much thanks for joining me for this uh it was pretty long so thanks for taking the time what it like two hours or something no i think it's really valuable because i i think it shows some insight into bad work environments especially like for the community is to talk about these kinds of things because a lot of the times you won't see this stuff we're entering a time now where many people are more comfortable talking about awful things that happen in workplace and i think it slowly over time changes work culture because it it acts as an inoculation to new employees it shows them no this [ __ ] is wrong go talk to a lawyer right like this is that's just how it goes and it it should be that way frankly it really really should be that way you know i'm on this team you know it's it's hard too it's hard it's hard to make change because you know i one thing that it's rarely talked about is that to make change it requires you to take a risk every like someone has to take risk are you willing to take that risk yep and i i took that i took that risk when i made absc at blizzard like i could have gotten fired for going and talking to the you know director bleet because it was in qa i was just qa kid and uh they had this whole thing badge andy walking around trying to like what's this yellow badge doing in here i had to go and contact him and be like can you let me into the area i have a piece of paper for you please this little 13-page document i was like i printed it i hope that's okay you came in with the pr did one oh that's so good i gave him a print i was like here's this document i think you should make this job no matter what it is and he said thank you and he like smiled at me and i was like cool i'm gonna leave now and i just you know that was it and then two weeks later he was like hey you should you should look at this role and i was like oh i will i'm in the middle of a task right now i got to finish the task first and he goes no you should really look at this role so like i looked at the role and it was it was my role and i played like wait a second i wrote that that's mine you know like yeah it was it was pretty wild and that's that's how i went to battle that man that's how i escaped the hell that was qa you know nice well hey you have a good day thanks for doing this with me appreciate that this is thor by the way for anyone that doesn't know well they're now all on your stream but yes this is thor the one the
