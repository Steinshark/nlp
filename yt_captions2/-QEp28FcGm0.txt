ladies and gentlemen i've got good news and i've got bad news let's start off with the bad news we have found somebody that magnus carlson cannot defeat at chess now the good news is we have found a person that magnus carls magnus carlson can't beat this guy a chess okay this is going to make for some incredible content all right because for the last 15 years magnus carlson has been the best chess player in the world now we don't really know that cuz you guys haven't actually ever lost a game against magnus right most of you are undefeated against magnus so we won't actually exactly know that for a fact but we can safely assume and magnus beats everybody including myself but there is one man on the planet that magnus carlson has not been able to defeat even though the sample size is just two and that person is maldovan chz grand master ivan skitka i played against ivan last year in a tournament in new york he cooked me but we're not here to talk about that we're here to talk about the lack of cookery on behalf of magnus when he plays against ian and the most incredible thing about this is ivan's rated 2500 he is rated a ripe 2509 he is nine points qualified for being grandmaster he only made grandmaster about a year ago now i don't know what he's doing maybe he's in university maybe he's a construction worker but it it don't matter because this was a game played in august of 2022 and this was a game played no nober 15th 2023 15 months later you think magnus was training in the underground ready for his rematch now uh this game i actually covered in a video already uh because i was making recaps of the olympiad but you might not remember this game i'm going to give you a brief rundown of the game in 2022 and this is a game played in november 2023 look at their ratings by the way 15 months later ivan down 6 elo he's been up and down it's tough to be 2860 i mean it is like impossible to gain elo and magnus has lost you know 35 points in in in that many months and it has lot to do with him it's a lot of rating deflation right now a lot of good 25 and 2600s taking points from from those guys so this game is even more impressive cu in this game magnus was white so ivan was playing against magnus uh and magnus played the kings indian attack okay not the defense cuz he's playing with white and in that game he played in a very provocative way way he gamed a pawn in the center of the board right so he just straight up gave away a pawn he didn't blunder that and his idea was that let's say after something like this he would then play like knight e5 and then when this knight went back it would be kind of difficult for black to develop and then magnus might play knight c3 knight b5 and a5 knight a4 knight b6 etc yeah ivan just like didn't let him have any fun and just played very solidly and just you know developed his pieces and in that game magnus pushed ivon all the way way back to h7 took some more space and then ivon played d4 and and and he just opened up the center of the board like showing no fear no respect and he played king h8 and put his knights promptly into magnus's territory on b4 split the pawn split the defense like they do in basketball bishop d2 and then he went back and magnus maneuvered preparing some advancements but after a lot of shuffling and a lot of trading he kicked out his knight and a few moves later he just created this barrier and magnus had an advantage he was up 20 minutes during this game he was putting some good pressure on ivon but when that moment happened he just played f6 he he was not afraid of fighting back against magnus even though magnus was setting up his cannons he had his knights right he had his bishop everything was looking good but uh pawn takes knight takes and then ivon played this nice move bishop takes knight took the center and magnus had to blockade with his pawns and we didn't really get anywhere we got a bunch of trades position got spicy but here came ivon crashing through and uh they repeated moves magnus did not try to play this for a win because if he did if he played something like queen to g2 after the trade uh it oh that well that would have been nice after this trade it would have just been black playing for a win so magnus had a full board of pieces to work with literally knights bishops eight pawns each 20 moves into the game he had all the pieces all the resources to beat ivon in 2022 and he failed to do so so i was like all right well you know that was probably a one- hit wonder 2500 rated gm i mean he's again he's he's a very good player but he literally just became a grandmaster magnus was born a grandmaster like he arrived in a norwegian hospital and he had a title okay like they were holding him up for baby photos with his mom and dad he was already like 1,600 then okay and he couldn't even like open his eyes yet to see light i don't know if he had jaice or anything like that's when the babies are yellow right i think i was a yellow baby when i was born they had to put me under a lamp fun facts with gotham chess when you watch my recaps this was a game they played november they played this game yesterday yesterday november 15th this is the european team championship which is a tourn tournament in europe where they play in teams and it's a championship and that's you know that's how you know i'm a really smart guy now ivan in this game has white so it's it's harder to beat people with black it's hard to beat people with black because white gets the first move so white already like you know if if magnus spent 10 hours preparing the sicilian which is this yeah like right so like you don't know what white is going to play i mean you do know what with ivan he plays d4 and c4 against me he played e4 because the only opening i know is carl khan so i'm predictable um but you know and then he plays c4 and and now magnus has to think and magnus does think he he actually he's already down 5 minutes because he's trying to play in a provocative fashion right like he he's playing the kings indian defense which is hardly seen like if you go to a 27 and 2800 elo chess tournament nobody's going to play g6 because modern-day computers have made it so difficult for black to play the kings indian defense back in the day grick kasparov spammed this opening like like an overwatch character i mean literally he just played ball all right that was like what it was he he he he was hamster he was hammonded and he was just destroying everybody i was a ball main by the way in uh in overwatch knight c3 bishop g7 king's indian defense and ivon plays the system h3 bishop e3 it's called the marov variation um there are many lines here there is the four pawns attack there is the classical there is bishop e2 bishop e3 the double bishop setup h3 bishop3 is a very nice setup and i actually this was one of my main weapons against the kings indian defense i just have to get magnus into a classical tournament and then i have to play uh he have to make sure he plays this opening and basically the idea is to do something like this and then black normally tries to put a knight on c5 while preventing you from playing b4 and you you play like this that's what that's what you try to do with white you go for an attack you play knight e2 knight g3 not knight f3 and then you advance your pawns magnus plays very provocative knight c6 knight c6 very provocative move why because black is basically saying i am not afraid of your knights in the center come attack me right ivon thinks for a bid plays d5 principled move if he was afraid of jumping in like you know fighters are afraid of jumping in against good counter punchers ivon was not afraid all right he played he just played d5 he could have played knight f3 right but then again the entire purpose of the kings indian for black is to play e5 now if you're a baby if you're a baby wimp nerd you take on e5 in the kings indian and then you trade the queens like that's what you do this is how you try to make a draw and often times in chess when you really really really really badly want the draw like you you you fend for a draw you might lose that's just what happens when you try to play play too soft so d5 d5 magnus plays knight to b4 which is crazy by the way because i've never seen that i mean most people i know play here and then uh and then after f4 knight the knight the knight comes here but in general the idea here by black is like you're like waving a flag in front of a bull all right you're just like come on come get me like let's go right so a3 right and now you know again if he just keeps going suddenly that knight is really soft so something like knight g4 could be possible if you take the knight but bishop c3 is very bad for white not losing because this is weak but bishop d3 played by ivon who now spends 11 minutes uh rather 9 minutes to develop a bishop the magnus effect right again we don't know exactly what to do plays bishop d3 magnus plays knight c5 that was always the move that he was going to play now already this is even this is provocative because white could actually get the entire center like when i say the entire center i am not exaggerating look how awful that looks but magnus wants this you understand magnus wants his opponent on edge he wants his opponent in a complex position magnus wants to create these imbalances he wants to strike at the center from various angles cuz he's the best chess player on the planet and maybe in history right so like the odds of him navigating these complexities are higher the chance of him ducking under a punch and landing an uppercut or a body jab or a hook to the head or a kick or a clinch and then a tak down right like this dude is like the demetrius johnson okay of like his skills are ubiquitous with a capital q bishop c2 back instead all right so instead of getting into all of this ivan just says let's go here and now i would love to play b4 magnus says okay play b4 i mean normally you would get a5 but uh he he just okay play b4 like this is look at this look at these horse horse dances like i don't even know i don't even know what's happening here that knight went c6 b4 a6 c5 f6 d7 this dude has spent six of his first 10 moves moving his horses he likes horses way too much knight e2 now he plays a5 castles knight to b6 by magnus and just pawn to b3 now magnus plays e5 e5 is the traditional kings indian move all right he was no longer trying to play c6 he plays e5 and at this point we pause and we say 13 moves have been made who has a better position white by a lot or by a little i know it says 0.4 but what does that really mean has a slight advantage in this position because the kings are equally safe material is equal however white has slightly better piece placement slightly more active pieces and better future prospects so because white has a little bit more space right he is able to kind of mobilize faster also black hasn't moved the bishop black's knights have spent like 87 moves moving and white is going to try to play where he has more space another thing to consider is another pawn break which is the f pawn break which is very thematic in the kings indian defense so these are the intricacies of the position but now let's actually get into the specifics rook to b1 7 minutes spent to slideer rook to b1 this is why chess will never end up on television because even golf which to me is 30,000 times infinitely more boring than chess has millions of dollars main you know main channel sponsorships and television time you know because maybe maybe it's because they hit a ball with a gigantic metal club you know maybe people fantasize about hitting each other in the head with the giant metal club instead like seven minutes on oh dear oh dear there goes ivvan he's played rook to b1 he's getting the bishop off the diagonal of the rook as well as the rook in the corner and he's he's looking at b4 cy couldn't decide if i was going british or australian so i just decided to insult both of them separately now magnus moves the knight again by the way because this was the idea right and now this move is a lot less powerful it's a lot less powerful because you know again if you got this you would be very happy uh but uh first you might want to defend this pawn but by moving out of the way now the move b4 just loses a pawn right so that would just be bad so bishop d3 to defend the pawn he's trying to play b4 magnus goes back and they repeat they repeat moves so if magnus wants a draw he's going to play knight c5 actually in fact it is a draw if magnus plays knight c5 why is it a draw uh because bishop d3 was played uh so that's one right that's so this position just occurred once that's twice and magnus says no right so had he gone back this would have been a three move repetition and a draw instead magnus plays f5 and there it is the expansion on the king side and magnus is playing for a win okay now in the kings indian the game is very simple black tries to checkmate white and white basically tries to say you're stupid you have no idea how to play chess and i'm going to attack you on the queen side which i have to tell you white is really set up to do now magnus understands he he probably has to play for win like first of all he's playing a team championship he's board one by 300 points like he's got to win f3 now again traditionally f4 g5 and basically after a little while you know black gets this and that's that's very scary and then queen g5 and then knight f6 and then you know these knights are usually these knights are usually like over here and you get the rook involved here's the thing though if you do play this and then you play g5 white's attack is way faster way way faster way the knight is trapped like take take take take the knight is trapped i mean you know again you can open my king but the knight is trapped i mean you're going to check me and then and then you're going to get m it so you got to be careful what you do over here which is why f3 and now magnus goes back to c5 and again ivan could play bishop c2 he probably could just go back he he could probably just repeat moves but instead knight c5 arrives and ivan's like you know what i i want to go b4 and the reason he plays b4 now is because white did everything he was supposed to do ian's just playing good principal chess he's playing exactly the way you're supposed to play in the kings indian you're supposed to take more center space when black plays f5 you meet it with f3 and try to slide the bishop back and you try to play on the queen side and you don't worry about losing this bishop why is white not concerned about getting this bishop captured usually a bishop is worth more than a knight but white has 1 2 3 four five six pawns on light squares already so the light squared bishop is replaceable and you won't have light squared weaknesses but furthermore that knight has moved so many times i mean if you literally track that knight it moved once twice three times four times then five times here we repeated so six times and now seven it moves seven times and now it's gone so seven out of the 19 moves now it's just gone he's made like 40% of his moves with it it doesn't even exist anymore and the game is very simple white is just going to go here that's what white is going to do magnus plays knight d7 ion plays c5 and for the second time in a row this young man is just doing great against magnus despite being outr by 300 plus points it's really like incredible stuff um and the last game you know he was kind of getting smushed okay he was getting smooshed you know magnus was trying to advance and and ivan kind of had to hold him off hold him off hold him off play defense trade pieces until he struck back ivon is really really good at like maximizing the effectiveness of every piece and then striking back and there it is and i got to tell you ivan's not playing not to lose this game he was playing not to lose the other game that i showed you uh dudes just straight up playing to beat magnus like if i was playing black against ivan here he would be sitting here going i'm going to cook this i don't know if that's what he thinks when he plays magnus i don't know if he plays c5 and goes i'm going to cook this  you know i would imagine he has slightly more respect than that but if he was playing me again oh you best believe he's going i'm getting c5 i'm get i'm going to get in a gotham recap video that's like white is just playing this position for a win i mean seriously uh and uh you know black here has this practical decision to make of whether to take or not and i i watched taro's analysis of this game he really did not like this move he really did not like that white now can trade the rook and infiltrate along the a file he actually thought magnus should have kept the door shut here should have probably played something like you know let's say i don't know like a knight f6 but in general if the position ever locks this rook is blocked you know white can do all of this but at some point white can't actually get in so if white creates total gridlock right like this you know who's going to win this game it's going to be black does that make sense because black's not created gridlock if now if black does this it's total gridlock but black will play g4 and try to crash through so white needs to do this in a very smart way and hikaru really did not like this decision by magnus to trade rooks i don't have the amount of experience in practical terms of playing the kings indian defense because uh you know i'm going to i'm going to trust the experts on this one magnus now has to deal with this rook trade and an infiltration along the eighth rank so black will not be able to fulfill his destiny and his game plan of creating an attack if there's just an entrance into his territory from the other side if you would like to successfully attack somebody like this you need to make sure the exit there there there it's a seal on the other side you also need to make sure the center's locked so if you'd like to attack some somebody in chess the center has to be locked ideally right so ab4 ab4 knight f6 and ivan just plays rook a1 his position just plays itself he doesn't need to rush now he also could consider c6 at some point it's a very important move and a very difficult position for magnus to deal with and the point of the move c6 is the fact that after let's say b6 let's say i i want to lock the position now this becomes a lot stronger and it's actually very tough for black to move for example if black continues with the attack i'll play rook a8 and you will never move you will never move you try to attack i'll play knight b5 you will never move i have the whole side lock down and guess what then i'm going here and i'm going here and i'm taking and i'm going to sack and my pawn is going to promote you can't do anything this is a fake attack second you go here boom now i'm hitting you from all three sides of the board down the middle on the king side right can't draw arrows but point stands so c6 if you take then i've still got the pawns so you'll play bishop b6 i will play b5 you'll try to strike back and here on deep thought the computer gives a massive advantage to white massive after something like b6 you can sacrifice this but the pawn gets to b7 and black can't defend against that so for example here takes on c3 takes let's say takes and you just take and go bishop a7 and black is completely defenseless completely defenseless look at the evaluation it's only going to get higher so ivon here had to play c6 and just go he just had to go and it's crazy because literally he is winning like he's if he finds this idea to just push the pawns forward and completely just not worry about anything else not worry about the counter play right then he wins that's very hard to do because in this position you give black everything he wants everything he wants and you have to be very careful because if if well that would again if you do this you won't have as big of an advantage ivon does it this way he plays rook a1 now magnus changes gears magnus here realizes the situation is kind of dire and i can't just trade and attack i can't just do this because i'm too slow my attack's too slow he's going to play rook a8 if i go unpinning he's going to go here and if i play h5 and try to play g4 he's going to play here and by the time i play g4 he can take take and play c6 too slow take take it's the pawns it's the pawns it's the pawns knight c3 knight d5 bishop h4 take trade the queens win the end game because you have two magnus's time is running out but like all great players magnus now plays this he completely changes gears the entire game i have been showing you you got to lock the center you got to go checkmate the opponent at this point magnus realizes i'm not the one calling the shots in this position so he takes on e4 and ivon here could instead of taking like this take with the knight he could actually do this and then his plan after this let's say this trade and something like bishop f5 would be to play something a knight to g3 or c3 like like this and just keep it fancing now ivonne after fe4 plays fe4 very natural move very natural recapture preventing the bishop or the knight from moving anywhere maybe g4 in the future g4 g5 knight g3 but now rook takes rook takes and knight h5 and this was not possible with a knight on e4 you might say why was this not possible he would just move the knight out of the way the point is there's no open f file there's no nothing here so white can just play rook a7 white can just keep going on that side of the board all black has this like knight f4 in the game there is the knight h5 idea you trade and then you play knight h5 because now the knight is arriving here it's a totally different story and the rook is open right and the queen is coming to h4 with the knight here and the pawn here the position was more sealed if you play rook a7 now i play queen h4 you play knight b5 uh black still can win all right g takes queen h like this is mate you can stop that but i'll go here and this is mate look how quickly right how quickly it can all happen so that one trade opens up an avenue of counterplay and magnus he he finds it and so now dealing with this incoming assault ivon has to play rook here and you'll notice he spent eight minutes i actually think the threat of all of this was maybe slightly underestimated i think ivon was still trying to win i don't think he was like i'm going to i'm going to trade all the pieces with magnus it was probably a good escape plan it was a good backup plan to have but actually knight take c4 was was was even stronger and prevented a lot of that and then again then you can take with the pawn well first let you know again let's say rook takes rook takes knight takes then you can take with the pawn then you can take with the opp and then again black doesn't have there's no attack no attack here then this is a very different story because the knights got traded and white can still try to advance over here and create some problems but rook f1 takes takes queen f6 magnus plays knight f4 and uh ivon just takes magnus now has the option to take with the pawn or with the queen yvon's still going for some stuff still beating up that bad structure magnus gives a check ivon bravely walks his king forward another check and he bravely walks his king forward to f3 magnus plays g5 wow not probably this is what you know white was expecting and then there would have been some crazy tactics instead g5 so the king can't take h5 g4 looking but now c takes d6 now h5 played by magnus oh my goodness knight c7 dc but then there's g4 you can take the pawn this leads to an unstoppable checkmate queen e5 king h4 queen f6 and then mate magnus still so dangerous right from the most from the most random of positions the most inconspicuous position ever it just looked like we were going to trade some pieces and now ivonne takes on d6 seven minutes of thought seven minutes of thought definitely a big nervous situation and he finds the only move ivon finds the only move bishop d4 hitting both pieces threatening to trade into to an end game and black's only choice is to play pawn to g4 check and allow the king to come forward a moment ago the king would have been swarmed by the queen and the bishop but because of this very important defensive resource bishop d4 found with seven minutes on the clock he walks his king and his king is getting swarmed by threats all these different threats around bishop h6 ivon once again finds the best and only move to take the bishop now this pa is very close to queening but if you take queen f2 and it's never too late to get mated and embarrassed so instead of that ivon plays once again the best move e5 and the idea of e5 is that queen f2 he can go here and this is no longer mate and he's winning what a move e5 magnus plays king a h6 trying to take away the escapes where he could have given a check could have given a check but then there would have been this and then there would have been this and would but instead of that he plays king h6 setting up one last trick and ivon plays queen e3 actually knight d4 by the computer was liked as well but magnus was playing on his opponent's low time he thinks for a while he plays king to h6 queen e3 and now anywhere white's king moves it's going to be check if this you'll slide that way so magnus takes back the pawn finally knight takes d6 and he just says you know what i take the pawn two pawns each knight versus bishop knight e4 king g6 queen b6 check magnus goes here ivon takes and they agree to a draw ivon takes the queen and offers a draw here here and i think i mean there's a lot of ways to draw this the reason that they don't play this on is because the next move would be knight c3 followed by by b5 if black plays bishop to d7 white will play knight e4 black can play h4 i mean this game could have gone a little bit longer but there's no point knight c5 and you just dance around and if this pawn ever makes it let's say to to h3 i go here king f5 there's a fork so they could have played this for another 50 moves but a demonstration of respect by magnus says you know what i'm not even going to uh just let's make the draw ivan skizo what a beast 253 2509 15 months apart i have a theory ivan skitso is the only 2500 rated grandmaster to draw magnus in his first two games against him i would love a chess statistician or historian in the chat to find the answer to that and see if that's accurate cuz magnus has played 25 00s when he was younger but like in his current form has a 2500 rated player not lost to magnus in their first two encounters two draws we found him boys and girls and i don't know when they're going to play again but this man does not lose to magnus and he plays him on equal grounds so incredible stuff uh from ivon and we uh we wish him uh well i wish him nothing but the best and i wish magnus nothing but the best either but it's always fun to see when when when somebody can rival him in ability that's all i have for you today uh if you are watching this on november the 16th i will be in london on the'th and the 21st link in the description tickets are almost sold out so make sure to check those out and that's all i've got for you today get out of here
