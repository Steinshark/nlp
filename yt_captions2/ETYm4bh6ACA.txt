these days it seems like we're living in the age of the online course where everyone with an audience claims to be able to know the secrets of becoming a successful filmmaker for the low low price of 299.99 sarcasm aside i'm a huge fan of self-directed learning and so when i saw that mark bone one of my favorite youtube creators had a course called art of documentary dedicated to documentary filmmaking i was really curious and even though i have more than 10 years experience in this industry and have shot for some of the biggest networks in the world i decided to sign up and see what he'd come up with so what did i think in this video i'm going to break down what i liked about the course and a couple of things i thought could be improved on and at the end of the video i'll tell you what my favorite section was and most importantly whether or not i think it's worth the price [music] hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsythe and on this channel i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer if you're into that kind of thing make sure to hit that subscribe button because there's going to be new videos coming out every week before we get started i'll get a bit of background stuff out of the way if you've never heard of mark bone he's a cinematographer who comes from a commercial background but runs a youtube channel dedicated to documentary filmmaking i think like a lot of indie doc filmmakers his money comes from the commercial side of things which he then uses to fund the passion projects but with the success of his channel in the course that might be changing these days i'm not sure but that doesn't really matter what does count is that his channel is fantastic before i found mark's stuff i hadn't really seen many channels that focused on documentaries specifically and it was actually one of the main motivators for me starting my own channel on top of my regular job as a dp so mark if you see this thank you based off the success of his channel mark and his partners launch their own course the art of documentary which is what i'll be talking about today i first heard about it in the middle of the pandemic when all international travel was on hold which meant i was barely working and so as a fan of mark stuff i decided to sign up and see i have to admit that i didn't know what to expect as i've been working full time as a documentary filmmaker for 10 years and if i'm being honest i didn't really think i'd learn all that much my ego was telling me things like hey man you shoot for netflix and national geographic what are you gonna learn here let me just say straight up that thankfully my ego was wrong on that and i definitely picked up some new ideas even though i've been doing this for a while one other thing is that when i signed up for the course it was the early days and i think i paid 199 or maybe 299 i can't really remember but now it's 5.99 and that's real money so in this video i'm gonna go over the pros and cons and at the end i'll let you know whether or not it's still worth it for both new and experienced documentary filmmakers even at that higher price first let's start with what the course does well and this is a lot i'm happy to say the course is incredibly deeply detailed and i'm not going to try and cover every individual part here instead i'll focus on the three main things i think they nailed with the art of documentary and why let's start with the presentation which by me i mean mark himself and how he gets his point across if you're a fan of his channel like i am it's probably no surprise to hear that this is a big positive in my book mark has been making educational videos for years and it shows he's comfortable on camera and he manages to be both likable and authoritative which isn't easy you can tell he knows what he's talking about also but at the same time his presentation style is loose and organic enough for you to feel like you're right there with him as he goes through the process rather than some sort of formal rules that you're learning from a textbook what's more the editor did a great job cutting everything and it just flows there's even a bit more production value here than most of his normal videos so if you like his channel you're for sure going to be very happy with the style of the whole thing i've done other online courses before and the personality of the instructor makes a big difference so mark and his presentation style is already a big positive in my opinion but all the charisma in the world isn't much good if the course is confusing or badly laid out if it's hard to follow or if their units are too long it can be really tough to ingest all the information luckily they did a great job here too there are a bunch of different units or chapters that cover the different parts of the documentary filmmaking process so there's one on finding a story one on pre-production one on production post production and beyond each of those units is made up of different smaller videos that are about the length of a youtube video which makes them really easy to watch when you have time i mean the whole course is basically a series of very well done youtube videos organized in a thoughtful way and for me that's a really good thing being able to tackle these units one by one depending on what stage of the process you're at with your own film is super helpful and the fact that they're broken into short parts short enough to watch whenever you have a spare 10 minutes mean that you don't get overwhelmed with the information it's all laid out chronologically so when you're trying to refine your story you can watch that section over and over again until you've got it down and then move on to the next one when you're ready for it you've got lifetime access so for me i'd go at the same pace as your film and not feel pressured to watch the whole thing from start to finish i wish all online courses were laid out so well and mark and his team did a great job here okay so mark is good on camera and the course is easy to follow but what about the content this is for sure what counts and without it nothing else matters so does the course itself actually give out good advice and do i think it's worth listening to absolutely this course is full of value especially if you're new to documentary filmmaking but even if you've been at it for a while i mean i've been working on docs at a pretty high level as my main source of income for 10 years and even i was taking notes i'll tell you at the end what my favorite part was for me but for now i'll just say that the core of the program is very very good mark knows what he's talking about and he gets it across in a way that makes sense and in my opinion he spends his time on the right things what do i mean by the right things well for starters the gear section is short i mean we all love gear but when people spend too much time talking about equipment it's a red flag for me that they don't know enough about the things that matter actually the section about developing stories is twice as long as the one talking about equipment for me that's a very good sign if you need to know what cameras and lenses to buy he does lay out the basics but he knows there is more than enough about that already out there in the internet what matters is story technique and planning and that's what the art of documentary is all about and the course doesn't just focus on the easy stuff they go deep into these subjects and break down things from how to find a crew to sound design this isn't generic film advice this is a well thought out course that teaches the step-by-step process of how to make a dock and all the moving parts you need to think about so a big thumbs up in terms of content in my books some units were more useful to me than others and i'll share my favorites later but especially if you're new to this you can feel confident that this course doesn't skimp on content so i've just spent the last few minutes basically sounding like a fanboy but there are a couple things i think could be improved on if mark and his team happen to see this to be honest they're pretty minor when compared to the importance of content and presentation but for starters i'm not a massive fan of the platform they used it's not that it's bad because that wouldn't be fair it does what it needs to do which is play videos in an order but it doesn't do much else and i think there's a missed opportunity for community here there's some limited message functionality kind of like a facebook comment chain at the end of the videos but it's pretty basic it would have been cool to have some forums or message boards for different kinds of questions like a library that you could check if you had specific questions rather than trying to scroll through long chains of random comments i've seen courses hosted on platforms like circle before where there's direct messaging components you can connect with the other students plus messaging boards and threads divided into separate topics so it's really easy to find answers and network with other people to be fair you can tell the aod guys really care about this idea of community because part of the course involves these big group calls they do every so often and that's really cool but there's only so many hours that mark can be on zoom which sort of limits the ability to ask questions so if mark and his team see this i think putting the content onto a deeper platform could take the community experience to the next level the only other thing i might have done differently is this section on career advice i have to give credit to mark and michael for being straight up about the challenges with making money as a documentary filmmaker because students need to hear that but there's only really one section on career and the messaging comes across that you probably need to find some other way to make money and do these projects on the side and while i do agree that it will be very hard to make money with your passion projects i'm living proof that you can actually make documentary production a full-time job and live pretty well i think this makes sense coming from them because they're both from a commercial background and in canada where i'm from too there isn't the same kind of big budget documentary production industry that there is in other places apart from reality tv which we make a ton of what's your name erica i hate doing scavenger hunts i'm at the center of everything she can see phone to my side but the world is in a golden age of documentary production and all the big streaming services are tripping over themselves to make new content there is real money out there and real jobs to be had there's camera assistants production assistants dps fixers producers production managers story supervisors editors assistant editors there are jobs making documentaries where you can make cash and learn from the best and then take those skills and apply them to your own projects look mark and michael are right that if all you want to do is shoot your own stuff you shouldn't expect to make much but if it were me i might add some more to this part of the course and give some more actionable advice on how to think about what jobs are actually available in the documentary industry but again this course isn't about how to get a job it's about how to make your own documentary so i'm really just being picky here so what's my final conclusion and are those two negatives enough to make me not recommend buying the course i mean 600 u.s is not nothing and you could do a lot with that money so is it worth it the short answer is yes i think it is if you have a passion for making your own documentaries and you want to take them seriously this course has all the information you need to make that happen it's thorough and it spends time on the things that matter i only wish this had been around 10 years ago when i was starting out because i would have gotten a ton of value out of this and probably saved myself quite a few headaches from what i've seen this is the best online resource that exists specifically focused on documentaries this is a full-on film school quality program for doc filmmakers and if you're looking to get started i think you'll be happy you spent the money even if you have experience like me i'm sure you'll pick up something here my favorite section was the very first one on story development and it was bang on so often people come to me with topics instead of stories and just by watching this unit alone i think aspiring documentary filmmakers would be in a much better starting place it was a good reminder for me as well and even made me rethink a few elements for an upcoming project i'm about to start and i'm a full-time professional so really well done here the only people i think might not get as much value out of this course are people who are looking for jobs in the mainstream documentary industry but the course never markets itself as that anyways like the name suggests it's about the art of documentary and how filmmakers can go through that process with intention overall i'm a big fan of what mark and his team made here and i have no problem recommending it to both new and early career documentary filmmakers as one of the best resources out there so that's it my review of the art of documentary if you have any thoughts or questions about my experience let me know in the comments hope that video was helpful and if it was maybe think about subscribing and if you wanted to know more about the jobs that are available in the documentary industry maybe check out this other video i made about four entry-level jobs for doc filmmakers see ya [music] [applause] you
