ladies and gentlemen ai has been better than humans at chess for over 25 years i'm recording this video in september of 2023 and in 1997 deep blue beat gary kasparov and that was the falling of the first or final domino depending on how you want to look at it on this channel i cover a lot of ai chess most of it is bots playing against each other at the 3600 elo level nowadays a bot can give a human tremendous odds and still win and stockfish right now is the best computer in the world there are computers close to stockfish and strength like lila which we will cover in this video the new chess.com bot which is called torch and others but stockfish reigns supreme and in this video i'm going to show you something absolutely incredible that stockfish did in a game that it played just a couple of days ago but it's not exactly what you would think stockfish made history but for all the wrong reasons let's go that's that's the intro all right hopefully that was a good one nice and succinct 58 seconds i'm wearing my uh i got i i got the white frames back on my face by the way i uh at the tortoise shell i like this color more stockfish is playing against leela and whenever bots play against each other to sharpen their swords uh they frequently will play certain openings because if it was up to the bots as i always say bots just want to not lose they don't really want to win necessarily they want to kind of keep the position relatively straightforward but c5 the most combative approach this is the sicilian defense white plays knight f3 and black plays knight c6 now up to this point the computers are not playing on free will uh we have not trusted them yet otherwise we'll end up in a will smith movie um and here rather than playing the open sicilian pawn to d4 for reasons that i suspect uh will lead to what's called the sweshnikov sicilian and the svechnikov is a lot it's very possible to force a draw and kind of kill the game off instead of that stockfish plays bishop b5 this is nowadays one of the most popular continuations against knight c6 in the sicilian defense and this is called the rosalimo ross-o-l-i-m-o okay sounds like a type of pasta that was wildly stereotypical of me uh and the idea is to take the knight and to damage black's pawns frequently in this position black plays g6 then black takes one of the two ways they're both fine puts the bishop on g7 puts the knight on h6 plays f5 e5 very complicated approach but leela plays a very provocative move which doesn't get played a lot at grand master level uh and that is knight f6 and the reason that that move is not played a lot is because it's not as good as the other moves black actually prefers to put the knight on h6 because the bishop will have the diagonal open and with the knight on h6 and not blocking the f-pawn in many positions the knight and the pawn will support the f pawn advancing which would then instigate against white center anyway very very sophisticated sicilian stuff here okay it's like you're watching a cooking tutorial and you can't make uh you know you can't make toast you can't make a strawberry banana smoothie it's two ingredients all right really i mean you need milk maybe oat milk almond milk if you're lactose intolerant um knight f6 not the best move but a move played all the same bishop c6 dc6 and pawn to d3 couple of things about this position right we got to talk about ai games but i'm obviously going to teach you a few things the reason why white took here you don't really want to give up the bishop for the night in chess at like seven times out of ten eight times out of ten but here you have a valid argument your argument is you've doubled the pawns fine and now you're going to replace your light squares that's what you're doing you don't have a light squared bishop anymore so you're going to build up a light squared force so that this bishop is kind of useless uh also white is not playing the move e5 because even though that might appeal to your brain uh not every move in chess needs to attack something if every move in chess you make just creates threats you're going to create weaknesses in your position and after knight f4 you're already in severe trouble and after something like castles queen d3 you can't move any pieces it's kind of like throwing heavy punches and boxing without form you're just gonna guess yourself out you're gonna miss and then they're gonna hit you right back so pawn to d3 uh leela brings out its bishop and and trades it off because leela says you know what if if you don't have a light square bishop i don't have a light square bishop and now leela blocks the center with pawn to e5 so white is slightly better here white is slightly better because now black does not even enjoy the advantage of the two bishops which was granted to them on the third and fourth move of the game it's a closed position and black has double pawns so black has no d-pawn the way white will play a closed position the way you can play any closed position is by picking up my middle games master class link in the description i'm just the the advertising the courses thing in the book thing it's kind of like a running inside joke so i just sort of but seriously the way you analyze close positions the way you decide what to do in close positions where do you put your pieces where do you put your pawns where are the pawn breaks right where are the pawn trades in the future that could benefit you how do you maneuver your pieces where how are you get your knight to a certain square where do you want to put your bishop right so stockfish plays knight to d2 with a very obvious intention of playing knight c4 and then it plays a4 a4 is a very interesting idea it's trying to play a5 it's trying to restrict things from coming there and then maybe you'll play knight c4 and restrict space here black plays bishop d6 ready to meet the move knight to c4 with probably bishop c7 or maybe rerouting this knight to put that knight on d4 you see the knight needs to go to d4 so it goes there there there there okay queen g3 stockfish takes advantage of the weekend g7 pawn black plays queen f6 the reason why black doesn't castle i suppose is after knight c4 and bishop h6 and and various attacking possibilities exist with white i mean i don't know queen f6 knight c4 bishop c7 you may be asking yourself if you should click off this video because it's been five minutes and i haven't show you why stockfish did anything important what good tv show is five minutes long you know patience get in there you think two thirty six hundred hilo bots lose the game in 10 moves come on all right now here rather than castling stockfish decides look i got a nice little bit of pressure going i got a nice little space advantage on that side of the board and i i don't need to play moves like bishop g5 to appease the gotham subscriber to just create one move threads that don't accomplish anything i'm going to play pawn to h4 pawn to h4 has a couple of ideas number one you'd like to play h5 and h6 that's just that that really is the idea like you want to go h5 and bishop g5 now becomes possible because h5 is possible and then you'd also play h6 and you would restrict the enemy pieces black offers a queen trade stockfish says no and now stockfish marches the pawn up to h5 this is the way computers play they take space on all three sides of the board you have good space in the center good control of the center you're advancing over here and you're advancing over here while also laser beaming from a distance and throughout this game so far first 14 moves black has just been kind of on the defensive black is sort of letting stockfish advance into the territory and and find a way forward now stockfish offers a queen trade this is interesting so stockfish offers an exchange of queens in both of which ways hurt black if black does this this doubles white's pawns but it's severely restricts black's position so black now cannot move the knight to the desired maneuver and the e-file is open so in the future white will be able to target on the e-file and play h6 to soften that up and continue to restrict black so look at black's pieces they actually cannot move however if black does nothing and goes here the damaging of the structure here is also bad because that pawn becomes a target like that or like that or in the future from that square and white can play g4 and that pawn's not going anywhere so for that reason i'm out shark tank reference queen e7 bishop to e3 black says no trade white casually advancing and black playing knight to e6 okay the black knight i've been terrible with my arrows today i hope you can forgive me the knight is going to d4 right that has been black's idea the entire time now white plays pawn to g3 preparation right just stopping anything from going to f4 black castles and now stockfish plays a gangster move alright this is why computers ruin chess they are 3600 elo and you would think that by being 750 points higher than the next closest human they would follow chess principles like castling because you haven't yet in this position stockfish plays king to e2 because it can because what are you gonna do about it is really the question right like what like you're gonna you can you prove that this move is bad king e2 is just basically saying i'm solid in the center i am safe behind all of this and you're not gonna get to me if you ever play knight d4 i'm just gonna take speaking of which knight d4 and stockfish takes and now black has nothing this is uh this is like yin and yang here in the center the king is rock solid the only thing you gotta worry about is queen b4 but your attack is always there if you'd like it and this bishop is completely dead here's the problem how will stockfish win okay his position is slightly better and knight is better than the bishop black is very passive but how how are you gonna win this is where the magic of computer chess happens right these computers find these ridiculous long-term ways to apply pressure pressure pressure you know as a human here you just play f4 like you just play f4 you hope your opponent does this opening up your g file because they you know hate themselves and then a couple of moves later you go here and then here and then here and like you know slowly you build up a winning advantage as you can see and then black you know blunders and you win but computer won't do that so white plays rook a4 very simple idea stop queen b4 and in the future put a rook in the b file because again stockfish plays the game on all three sides of the board rook f7 the knight comes back the road goes to the a file now you'll notice that's a free pawn but leela doesn't take it uh i think probably because it didn't like that its queen could get trapped here it probably saw something and it got a little bit disturbed i don't exactly know what that something is you know maybe it thought in the long run that the you know losing the i don't know but clearly it did not like something both computers agreed the pawn on c2 is absolutely not capturable which is why rookie 8 has played rook a3 is comes back queen takes c2 is still possible by the way but both engines are somehow silently agreeing that taking this pawn is worse for black because i guess the queen is getting trapped i don't know and maybe the i beats me okay in any case leela goes back and now stockfish plays the very natural rook to b3 putting pressure on the pawn right so stockfish is doing absolutely everything correctly black plays bishop d6 now my friends i'm not going to spoil the video for you but an absolutely massive thing has just happened and i am not going to tell you what it is i'm not going to tell you what it is you are going to have to figure it out you like to watch my videos whether it's passively or actively because maybe i you know you watch me with a meal maybe you're eating some food right now maybe you watch me on a work break whatever it might be you watch me with your kid your kid watches me with you um but you need to actively watch this video i'm not gonna spoil it something absolutely massive has just happened in this position but you're looking at the evil positions equal anyway white continues expanding into the position queen to g4 it's gonna obviously be a little bit of a maneuvering game here because it's a very close position b6 but that's a little bit of a weird move because you open up the a file clearly uh clearly leela is convinced it's got a nice defensive setup here white plays knight h4 of course knight f5 look at that knight h6 is a big threat black has to slide the king off the file white is still firing away i mean white is just a moment away white's gonna find a way to get the rooks over knight h4 that's threatening to win the game if you don't understand why knight g6 is a fork if you take that's made on the next move so knight h4 the queen has to slide out of the way and i mean it's pawn to c3 there it is now we're breaking out of the position now we're bringing the knight back to try to take the pawn and then we're gonna weaken that this is a really nice game by stockfish i mean it really is playing on all the sides of the board it's it's poking that way black is response poking the other way right queen to f7 knight to d2 the queen slides back out and now leela plays pawn to b5 all right because lila's a little bit disturb by the fact that the knight could arrive there and put pressure on the pawn now pawn to c4 rook to b8 take take okay we've opened things up a lot the c file is up for grabs the a file maybe pawn to f4 is going to come in the future pawn to b4 knight c4 okay maybe stockfish is not going to win uh because this is looking really really solid by black now for those of you that may have been watching actively you might have but you might be wondering how this rook is gonna get out it's a little bit stuck and you know white's still doing fun pressure here and on the bishop and the bishop's kind of you know undefended and it's got nowhere really to run and good idea here and here rook but but now leela basically just tries to trade pieces do the math where's the rook gonna go if you trade the rook and the queen where is white's root gonna go king h8 king f1 and stockfish walks its king over queen e8 queen b5 hitting the rook now the rooks gotta go the rooks could battles the bishop goes back to f8 now stockfish is in this very weird situation stockfish is playing a four on four game with no rook the bishop guards the king and the pawn which prevents the rook from escaping this is actually kind of nuts but now the question is how will leela win willie lewin is stockfish still gonna find a way out of this position it seems deathly symmetrical look at the eval it takes stockfish a little while but suddenly it starts realizing it's hopeless the position is hopeless leela plays ponta f5 which is a pawn that can be taken two different ways if you take like this i play e4 if you take like this i take the knight so you can't do that if you take with the queen which looks reasonable nobody can guard the rook the the queen is stuck right now ready to go back at a moment's notice to protect that little rook that's stuck on b3 so in this time black can fire away attacking moves and walk into white's position stockfish now tries to seal its shut tries to seal it shut to prevent any further leakage into the position leela plays f3 you know why it plays f3 because the pawn is like a forbidden fruit if you don't take it this pawn becomes a weakness and i'm gonna get my rook to f4 from where i will put permanent pressure on the pawn if you take the f file is open and you are up a pawn but i am going to infiltrate on the f file now rook to e6 rook to e6 is a multi-purpose move i am going both sides king h7 just steadily improving the position bishop to e7 no queen trade because the queen is the only piece in the black position that can get to that rook unless you get to an end game and the king goes there but you know we're not chat gbt knight c4 rook to a7 kicking the queen off the file rook a8 rook f8 f3 seems like stockfish has created a fortress and if you look at the evaluation stockfish still doesn't fully understand that it's in dire danger queen a4 putting pressure queen c2 bishop g5 stockfish finds a moment finds one rook c3 it's not a sacrifice of a rook if you take you lose your queen if you go here stockfish gets out now it's going to win now stockfish is calling the shots because it no longer has this rook problem but queen b5 back the rook the rook now has to go back or else it's gonna get taken rook a six rook f7 it's just a matter of time lila is just finding its moment it's shuffling it's shuffling it's got pressure look at this rook f4 it's done everything it's wanted to do queen d6 and now it's over look at these last couple of moves stockfish still thinks the position is roughly equal you know what's the domino that's going to ruin this position forever leela perfectly prepares leela defends its pawn which this allows this rook for moving leela has an eye on the rook which forces another piece to play defense the domino that is going to pry apart the white position completely is a pawn move that's why pawns are super important bonds are worth the least they are expendable you can trade them off it's over once that last link falls it's over if black had played for example g5 this would end in a draw this would be a defensive fortress there is no way for white to lose but that's game over you either take and allow that pawn to become weak and open the g file or you take this and now my friends do you see the final pawn break i've been telling you how to play close positions peace maneuvering and pawn play here it comes you ready pawn to h5 look at the evaluation suddenly stockfish is realizing it's been playing four on three that's what it's been doing it has been playing four but it's been playing four on three because of the rook queen h2 and now leela absolute king of the jungle rook g6 and suddenly suddenly stockfish is coming to the realization that it's game over a desperate counter-attack pawn takes f4 the queen slides over constantly threatening that rook white plays pawn to g5 trying to keep it shut but bishop takes g5 reopens the position and now bishop to e7 and my friends you're going to get two rooks for the queen take take take but here's the bad news the bad news is that anywhere the rook moves like rook g2 for example that stops queen c2 but you can't stop that move forever the black queen has infiltrated and despite all of this happening that rook still can't move h4 by black sliding the king a little bit queen c1 and at some point look at this queen d1 look at that and not only this does le leela has a sense of humor which you're going to see a little bit later in this game um the rook falls this is move 93. slowly lila advances all of its pieces leela also at this point has force checkmate in seven it has fourth checkmate in six and seven moves and instead of doing that it completely for no reason makes two queens computers are such scumbags they know that they can deliver mate there's a mate here with the bishop and the queen but computers have bad manners it's like when your opponents don't reside on chess.com you promote to seven nights it makes two queens for absolutely no reason literally no reason just like a sense of humor to the to the computer then it takes the pawn and then i'm not it makes another it makes another queen it makes you know it should have made a night it should have made a night and then checkmated with bishop and knight it makes another queen and on move 115 it wins now you may be asking yourself where's the history this is the first time in two years stockfish lost the game with white you might not understand why that's special computers don't lose with white why because computers play games against each other in pairs meaning these first seven moves stockfish played with white against leela and then they flipped and leela played with white against stockfish that is how they determine which computers are better than others because they make them play opening pairs computers don't lose with white they don't some do against stockfish stockfish doesn't lose with white except against leela it's first loss in two years because on the 25th move of the game it played rook b3 i asked you on move 25. take a look at what just changed stockfish put its rook on b3 and that's where it lost the game isn't that insane if the game is over right now like just think about that for a second it's over i i know i know that stockfish itself doesn't realize it leela realized it was over leela realized that after a few more moves and all of this it realized immediately it was winning how insane is that it realized that no matter what white did for the remainder of this game it would be like trying to play uh jenga it just wouldn't like isn't that an unbelievable that is so crazy and two years ago stockfish lost to leela in the exact same way kind of i'm not going to show you the whole game maybe i'll make a separate video about this i didn't want to spend another 20 minutes look at this game this was two years ago stockfish played a benoni which is an opening just like that last one which is slightly better for white and in the middle game leela prepared the move pawn to b5 which stockfish completely shut down by controlling four different times but leela did something insane it gave up its king's bishop for the night in order to successfully play this which is like unheard of why would you damage your king like that and you got to be really careful and then it pushed the pawn in front of its king and then it did this do you see what i'm talking about do you see who's trapped in this position the bishop is stuck but behind these pawns and can't get out this way and literally i'm you see how stockfish thinks it's better in this position leela already said the position is -4 this was two years ago it said -4 stockbridge was like it's plus one it's plus one i'm cooking this stupid bot and leela was just like i'm gonna win and what did he do two years ago it traded all the pieces defended defended defended defend the bishop can't get out and slowly stockfish went wait a minute i'm playing without a bishop its bishop was completely walled off from the game and slowly methodically leela walked down stockfish and one it forced it to lose the bishop and it won the game stockfish is the best chess engine in the world it's 3 700 strength and even it has a random blind spot for getting its pieces strapped that is so insane does that not blow your mind like we're out here hanging queens these bots are playing moves and 70 moves later 70 moves later their pieces are getting trapped and captured leela knew this was gonna happen that blows my mind completely blows my mind i like it played rook b3 on the 25th move of the game leela went here defended its pawn and covered the escape the game was over on this move it just goes to show you that these some of these bots understand just in the most absurd and peculiar ways stockfish loses his first game with white in two years that is insane at the 3600 level and i wanted to share it with you and and just this is some other worldly alien chess that i'm just trying to break down for all of you um hopefully i'm doing a good job that's all i'll see you in the next video get out of here
