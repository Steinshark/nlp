so i wanted to take a moment and show you two things in typescript that actually are pretty dang dangerous uh if you have any cool things you know about typescript that actually causes really wonky behavior let me know i'd love to make like a full length video out of this uh be able to get a few more at least i'd like to at least have three of them i don't have it five would be ideal but here we go so the first one is this function uh change array and i'm gonna pass into here say uh items and it's gonna be a number or a string this is just this can be extended to any kind of union type item okay i'm just doing number and string here to make it really obvious and go items.push69. all right so all we did is just mutate the array a little bit change the array you're like well it didn't really technically do that okay here mutate array is the name better for you there we go so now i'm gonna go like this const items equals is going to be a string array equals hello uh world uh please sub there we go and like the video my right hey sorry uh anyways so let's go like this mutate array items now that we have that yes we can jump over here and i can actually execute read numbers and it will do nothing because i didn't simply console.log items out but if i were to do that well guess what it would put a number in a string array now that could be kind of dangerous right because later on you could have something like do something two strings only and inside of here we have items which is only a string array and guess what this uh does something that could blow up on numbers and then in here you're like do something two strings only items and guess what kab boom boom goes the dynamite you don't even realize that function could throw due to a series of operations before you so really union types with mutations in a race can be quite tricky with typescript okay but here's the second one now the second one is a ringer are you ready for this one type uh we'll call this thing read only result it really does doesn't matter it's any object you want right so this thing is a read only foo which is a number a read-only uh bar which is a number there you go huh this looks pretty good now we're going to have the exact same thing except for we're going to take off that thing and we're going to take off these right here there we go so we just have resulted they're the same object one is read only one is not read only and we're gonna have this one uh produce read only result and this thing is just going to simply produce a read only result right read only result so let's return that and let's have foo at 69 bar as 420 the only two numbers in any good example and so now oh my goodness now that we have that let's produce ourselves a read-only results const item equals produce read only result and look at it it's a read only result now let's have another another function mutate result and this thing is going to take in a result a result a result i know i keep saying that right and uh we will do something to it what can we do here well let's just go like this uh how about a result dot foo uh plus equals one three three seven boom do the same thing with bar look at that just did a quick mutation now i'm going to take my read only item right here mutate result and just throw in item okay so now first off what is item item is a read-only result you can't mutate this thing okay we have specified you can't mutate this thing so what is going to happen here is typescript gonna barf what is it gonna do here well let's find out it uh doesn't do anything okay at all it just lets you mutate it it just straight up mutates it right like to me this is even the more dangerous item read only on properties on types are completely disregarded due to uh typing it's i mean it's quacking like a duck but it's not a duck that's the problem uh anyways so i hope you enjoyed this if you have more of these type of things toss them to me i'll be glad to make a full length video on this because i think this is just amazing so please comment section make it happen and if you enjoyed this you know what you need to press the like button or something i don't know what do people do on youtube anyways the name foreign i gotta press stop now
