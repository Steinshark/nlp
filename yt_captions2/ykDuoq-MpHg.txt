oh really fast card hey ow that turning back the clock on nvidia's biggest gpu releases we find plenty of wins but also some elves so big that nvidia's own marketing team openly mocked them which got us thinking tier lists are easy views right sorry excuse me which got us thinking with the benefit of hindsight what were nvidia's best and worst generations have you been a savvy shopper or did you throw your money at the wrong horses like you're about to throw your money at our sponsor the ridge are you tired of your old bulky wallet the ridge wallet will keep your pockets light and organized follow the link below and use code linus to save 10 off your purchase and get free shipping if our only consideration was performance this would be a pretty simple exercise best worst rest but there's a lot more to delighting gamers than frames per second so as we make our way through 17 generations of nvidia hardware we're going to be looking at the bigger picture with particular attention to efficiency new features notable controversies and of course price let me set the stage for our first generation it was 2003 cargo pants for everywhere i cracked open a copy of the computer paper and was shocked to discover that anyone would be deranged enough to spend 500 us dollars on a card that does nothing but make games run better oh how naive i was the good news is i kind of dodged a bullet there to say that nvidia's first directx 9 gpus were controversial would be a gross understatement depending on the gamer benchmark performance gains compared to the previous generation were up to 55 but could be as low as just 10 percent and that uplift came at the cost of noise and the pain kept coming nvidia marketed the fx series cinematic rendering capabilities as cinefx and image quality was indeed a big discussion point for this generation just for all the wrong reasons not anticipating that new games would use the baseline 24-bit color precision mode of directx 9 rather than 32-bit fx cards ended up falling back to the 16-bit mode to increase frame rates the result was a noticeable degradation of image quality worse still nvidia attempted to slip this little trick into driver version 43.45 without acknowledging it until the obviously lower image quality forced them to come clean additionally the implementation of msaa on these cards was distinctly inferior to atis leading to more pronounced stair stepping on the edges of ankle geometry to top it off ati's 9700 pro not only performed better but came out earlier and was the same price as the fx 5800 ultra the fx line of gpus ended up being about as damaging to nvidia's brand as later fx cpus were to amds clearly a cursed naming scheme d-tier the good news is that after a less embarrassing mid-generation 5900 series refresh of the fx lineup in 2004 seat here nvidia would follow up with a real banger the performance gains of the geforce 6th generation were outstanding the mid-range 6600 gt outperformed the previous flagship for less than half the price and if you went from flagship to flagship you could double your performance or more that's right it was in 2004 that sli made its triumphant return from the dead early adopters had gotten a taste of this dual gpu wizardry under the 3dfx name back in 1998 but it would take nvidia four years after acquiring their rivals to reintroduce this technology to a much larger gaming audience the competition with ati though was tight in this generation flagship cards were neck and neck in both price and performance with ati's crossfire offering similar dual gpu capabilities though team red's solution was flakier and required a special mastercard along with a silly external dongle furthermore the best board partners were definitely available on the nvidia side with many offering lifetime warranties this has got to be s tier moving on as we saw with fx the g47 family got multiple flagship gpu launches first came the 7800 gtx built on the same 110 nanometer manufacturing process as its predecessor but with a larger die higher clock speeds and graphics optimized gddr memory contributing to a healthy 60 uplift in performance even if it did come at a higher price but then we got the 512 meg version with vastly higher clock speeds and performance and a super misleading name then we got the 7900 gtx that cranked clock speeds to 11 thanks to a more advanced 90 nanometer manufacturing process but then barely managed to outperform the 7800 gtx no no not that 7800 that one oh and then the 7900 was at a lower price do we have an m tier for mixed bag you know what though nvidia clearly won every mid-generational battle with ati this time around this was the last generation to be available for both pcie and agp slot motherboards and it was full of fun oddities like the sample that we have from this generation the 7950 gx2 that frankenstein's two sli gpus together into a single pcie slot oh yeah and the 7900 gto that's right nvidia used to bless us with limited run cards as a way of clearing out old or not quite peak performance inventory and in this case many gto cards could actually be unlocked to full gtx specifications it was also the last time we saw a flagship gpu offered in a single slot form factor and fun fact the 7800 gtx was used as the starting point for the playstation 3's rsx gpu i'm going with a tier this time around and as for you 7900 hmm you get a b geforce 8 was in a word revolutionary s tier i'm doing it right now but we've got to talk about it a bit more before we move on first up a single 8800 gtx was able to outperform a pair of 7 900 gtx's running an sli it is still the single biggest generational leap in performance we have ever seen and it cost only a hundred dollars more than a single 7900 gtx leaving the ati 2900 xt absolutely in the dust crying to its mama it's new mama amd who is probably feeling like entering the ring with nvidia might not have been a very good idea the tesla architecture's big innovation was doing away with the fixed pixel pipelines of previous micro architectures so instead of separate vertex and pixel shaders we've got unified shaders meaning that any one of them was able to handle any type of shading task this flexibility was extremely important as gpus made the transition from graphics accelerators to the general purpose accelerators that power workloads like simulation and machine learning today also key to that transition was the release of the cuda api which is still in use today and enables developers to run general purpose code on gpus less in use today but certainly interesting was the introduction of three-way sli for enthusiasts with more dollars than cents and plenty of patience for tinkering and if all that wasn't enough this generation also welcomed nvidia's first gpu using tsmc's 65 nanometer process the 8800 gt was less than half the price of its big brother gtx but offered anywhere from 70 to 90 percent of the performance depending on the application and this was in a single slot form factor it was such a clear winner in terms of value that nvidia has never offered anything similar since now i already declared geforce 8 to be asked here but it's worth saying it again s tier which is how you'll feel and look in our underwear from lttstore.com take it from me i would know after a wild previous generation geforce 9 was a bit of a rest on the old laurel's time for nvidia we went straight from the largest generational performance jump to the smallest one the g92 core that was at the heart of the 9800 gtx i mean it was no slouch it handily dispatched the ati hd 3870 but it was based on the same tesla architecture and in fact based on the same die as the 8800 gt just shrunk for a smaller 55 nanometer process node which was good for a healthy clock speed bump but only about a 10 performance increase versus last gen unless of course you sprang for the dual gpu 9800 gx2 sandwich edition i guess we also got pcie gen 2 support across the entire range but it would be a while before cards and it wouldn't be these ones managed to saturate that connection i'm going with c tier what was next right nothing all five cards from the geforce 100 generation get we're oem only we've seen recent examples of gpus that were sold exclusively to system integrators the gtx 1065 gig is one that comes to mind but an entire generation nvidia the good news is we didn't miss out on anything because every 100 series card was rebadged from either the previous or the following generation you get a big fat d tier but ooh this is new nvidia's tesla architecture is back again with the 200 series but the gtx goes before the numbers now in all seriousness though the flagship gtx 280 and its mid-gen refreshed 285 used what nvidia called their second generation tesla architecture on tsmc's 65 and 55 nanometer process nodes respectively and they were hefty mamas topping over 1 billion transistors for the first time ever this was also the first and only time that we saw nvidia use a whopping 512-bit memory bus granting gamers a very respectable 60-ish percent performance bump and while the ati hd 4870 managed to take the frames per dollar crown nvidia's top tier was in a different league altogether and still hovering around that 500 flagship price point sli had also matured significantly by this point allowing gamers to drive high resolution 2560 by 1600 displays and it was even beneficial for lower resolutions with scaling that could reach 70 to 80 percent that means that two mid-range cards was a great value option compared to a single high-end one i personally went that route with two gtx 260s i'm going a tier as for the gtx 300 series but this again another generation of five cards that was oem only thrilling except that no it's actually worse than last time because they were all rebadged from the previous generation let's say f tier for forgettable this next one wasn't the first directx 11 capable generation arrived five months later than planned but with over 50 performance gains relative to the gtx 280 and it managed to edge out ati's hd 5870 so clearly all those cuda cores were worth waiting for gpus still used thousands of these computing cores for everything from rendering scenery to drawing character models to calculating lighting and shadows in a game environment and all this performance came cheap okay not cheap but at an even 500 the gtx 480 was priced identically to the flagship fx gpu from seven years prior making it a hundred and twenty dollars cheaper in today dollars if you account for inflation oh yeah and it also cost 150 then dollars less than the gtx 280 that it replaced it wasn't all rainbows and sparkles though it was also blazing inferno the gtx furnace barbecue card and thermy jokes were so common that even amd joined in on the mockery in terms of tech though we got two big new arrivals first thanks to nvidia's acquisition of ajia who up until this point had made i think powerpoint presentations and promises no sorry uh a weird standalone physics card um well yeah that technology runs on the gpu now and second was support for tessellation a technique used to add detail to surfaces that might otherwise be rendered flat unfortunately it was still early days for tessellation and it incurred a 20 hit to frames per second making it one of those features that doesn't really run so much as walk on first generation hardware or tx excuse me sorry uh we're gonna go b tier here the gtx 500 series though was a solid tick in that it focused heavily on improving rather than revolutionizing nvidia's existing fermi chip micro architecture this is a strategy they borrowed from intel that resulted in lower temperatures noise and power consumption and also less mockery performance gains in the 20 range were a little on the low end but nvidia did widen the gap compared to amd's best and pricing stayed the same at 500 bucks for the top end single gpu card notably geforce 500 saw the reintroduction of the ti moniker which hadn't been used since 2002. we're still not sure how to pronounce it gtx 560 tie ti but we are sure that at the time cards with this designation represented incredible performance for the price fun fact if you've ever had the misfortune by the way of buying a fake gpu from a site like wish or aliexpress you probably got a card from this generation with a modified bios i'm gonna go a tier now one of the most notable things about our next generation gtx 600 is that nvidia's kepler architecture was the first time they tried to pass off a mid-tier gpu as a flagship so here's the thing the gtx 680 uses a gk-104 chip but the flagship die of each generation almost always ends in a zero and then the higher that last number goes the smaller the die and the lower end the part what that means is whether it was for cost concerns or an utter lack of competition from amd the gtx 680 that we got was a lesser version of what it could have been but if you were expecting it to come with a discount think again to be fair overall performance was up 20 and it was an enormous leap in performance per watt thanks to a risky strategy of dramatically shrinking the process node and significantly altering the architecture in one generation and this is the point where nvidia's strategy of differentiating based on features starts to really make its mark with the 600 series then we got some basics like support for pci express gen 3 and displayport 1.2 but we also got gpu boost nvank hardware accelerated video encoding g-sync less demanding fxaa and txaa anti-aliasing and support for the vulcan api and that's not all a personal favorite of mine was the introduction of game stream rip nvidia's end-to-end solution for streaming games from your geforce powered pc to a shield handheld device so cool it wasn't all roses though driver issues that caused stuttering with adaptive vsync were widely reported and confusingly the total number of skus ballooned from 15 to 27 and that's without factoring in the super clocks and super super clocks of the world making matters worse amd sayonara ati branding took its first performance crown in some time with the hd 7970 i think we can go b tier but i also think i'm being kind of generous here gtx 700 on the other hand can be best summarized as more kepler due to the slowdown of moore's law nvidia was stuck with the same 28 nanometer manufacturing process and kepler architecture but this time bigger much bigger that gk 110 chip that was exclusive to enterprise compute cards last time around finally made its first appearance for consumers in the form of the gtx titan and boy was that thing ever interesting depending on who you asked at the time nvidia would tell you that titan was intended for gamers or for professionals or for somewhere in between and it did have two key advantages over geforce gpus namely it had a whopping six gigabytes of high-speed gddr5 memory and eight times better double precision floating point performance but then in subsequent iterations of these titan cards those advantages would ultimately disappear and in retrospect i think the titan project was simply a way for nvidia to test gamer's tolerance for much higher prices a thousand dollars for a gpu we said whole young linus you ain't seen nothing yet anywho the definitely for gamers real flagships for this generation were the gtx 780 which managed a 25 increase over last gen for 150 more dollars and the 780 ti which came only six months later and managed a similar performance jump for only a marginal increase in price meanwhile amd's codename hawaii cards were hot and loud with the bigger issue being that they were plagued by driver issues and wouldn't really catch up in terms of performance for a couple more years 7 series then comes away with the score of the 6th series should have gotten a tier as for gtx 800 series once again it did exist but instead of more kepler the theme was less kepler in your laptop d tier now there were plans actually for a desktop line of 800 series cards apparently but they were intended to be based on nvidia's new maxwell architecture which would instead make its debut as the gtx 900 series maxwell is notable for a number of reasons it was the second time that nvidia passed a mid-tier gpu off as a flagship it was the third desktop generation that was stuck on tsmc's 28 nanometer process moore's law was looking well and truly dead at this time and it was the last time that we would see a new generation launch on a close enough to yearly cycle impressively though maxwell offered a 30 performance increase for wait less yes the 980 was a 550 card at launch a hundred dollars less than the 780. on top of that it was amd's turn to phone it in with a rebrand of their 290x to 390x leaving nvidia essentially alone at the top of the performance charts it it was also so efficient that for the first time ever nvidia used the same desktop gpu dies in 900 series laptops they had some interesting ideas for how to use their performance leadership one was dynamic super resolution which was possible to do before but simplified and allowed you to render your game at a higher than native resolution then down sample it for a smoother appearance another was to push gaming on high resolution monitors and tvs less demanding mfaa or multi-frame anti-aliasing and hdmi 2.0 made 4k 60hz gaming a major marketing point for nvidia but with that said even the properly high-end 980 ti that came as a 750 mid-cycle refresh struggled to deliver a playable 4k experience in aaa games i mean to be clear these were fast cards and shockingly efficient considering that the transistors were the same size as kepler but nvidia set our expectations maybe a little bit too high notable 2 from this generation was the introduction of vxgi even if voxel global illumination would ultimately give way to path traced rtx lighting which we'll get to later and finally it's impossible to talk about this generation without bringing up the three and a half gig gtx 970 debacle for which nvidia eventually had to settle at class action lawsuit the cards did have four gigs of ram as advertised it's just that only 7 8 of it was actually accessible at full speed whoops yeah you know what it's still eight here in my book though maybe not as a tier as the gtx 10 series we finally got a new manufacturing node guys let's go tsmc's 16 nanometer process meant a healthy bump in well everything at launch gamers could pick up a top tier card sort of they did that thing again where they withheld the biggest die for a ti refresh with a very respectable 60 increase in performance for 600 bucks while drawing less power and producing less heat 10 series also gave us our first taste of gpu boost 3.0 which could best be described as self overclocking allowing the gpu to scale its clock speed well beyond base clock depending on available power and thermal headroom for their part amd's flagship rx 480 was the value king at the time but thanks to nvidia's investments in gpu encoding and the explosion of online game streaming it was well overshadowed by the mid-range gtx 1060. which one you ask ah good question in another example of nvidia using extremely misleading product names the three gig and 6 gig version of the 1060 have performance differences that go way beyond their frame buffer size for shame three and four-way sli were dropped as was sli altogether on mid-range cards but nvidia did introduce a high bandwidth bridge as a bit of a swan song to two-way sli speaking of bandwidth the new displayport 1.4 standard also continued the trend of catering towards high resolution high refresh rate and shiny new high dynamic range monitors 4k 120 hertz hdr anyone nothing not at that time but it was so close we could smell it i think i'm gonna go s tier here it's just too bad that in hindsight it turns out that what i smelled was the wet fart that was around the next corner alongside the confusingly named rtx 20 slash gtx 16 series came ray tracing i don't know if i can remember the last time gamers paid so much for so few frames in return remember that really cool marble demo that nvidia put together to show off the capabilities of these new cards yeah that ran at 25 frames per second at 720p and with these capabilities came a 100 price hike that's right 700 for a yes they did it again mid-tier gpu diet launch with the proper big ti one coming later after the huge leap forward last generation nvidia's performance gains in traditional games cooled to a more tepid 30-ish percent but i mean hey alongside our ray tracing rt course we got tensor cores for cool machine learning accelerated features like background noise removal and deep learning super sampling which kind of sucked at launch but is like freaking amazing now it's kind of wild seeing what a long game nvidia plays sometimes ray tracing is still making its way into the mainstream gaming space but they were so sure it was the future of immersive realistic in-game lighting that they went as far as to change their whole gaming brand too bad the rtx 20 series never ended up being capable of powering full-fledged ray traced games newer demos like rtx racer and the new rtx portal look amazing but they only really run on newer cards and rtx remix looks set to rewrite the history books for people who skipped rtx 20 series sorry buddy you're gonna have to be seat here is what i would say about the rtx 30 series in hindsight but man at launch this generation was lit gamers were so hyped to get their hands on these cards that our announcement coverage was the most viewed gpu announcement video we have ever done the comments were so full of hope more than double the total transistors and cuda cores at the top end the 3070 was outperforming the 2080 ti at less than half the price what too bad it was not to be after the initial availability issues dampened our enthusiasm the subsequent crypto mining boom completely dissolted secondary sellers drove those coveted 500 rtx 3070s and every other card this generation to prices beyond double their msrp and there they stayed i mean on the plus side amd returned to competitive form and was able to offer similar performance at lower prices unless it came to real-time ray traced lighting and then i mean they too were shipping cards by the boatload to crypto farms so boo amd as well sli also officially bait us farewell at this stop in our journey but we got to say hello to pcie gen 4 a stopgap 12 pin power connector and support for direct storage which allows your gpu and your ssd to talk directly basically eliminating loading times assuming any games ever show up with support for it as for our tier assignment i feel like we need to kind of split this one up for anyone who got one of these legitimately ray tracing capable cards for msrp 30 series is an easy a no you know what s tier s tier it delivered on the promises of last gen but did it at attractive prices for everyone else though oh bringing us to the present day basically nvidia's 40 series offerings aren't all out yet but based on what we've seen so far we can make some pretty safe guesses in the coming months we'll probably see some unlaunches just kidding that was weird that probably won't happen again more likely we'll see some yes launches fleshing out the lineup with presumably rtx 4060 and 40 50s of some sort and we also wouldn't be surprised to see some kind of new halo card launch farther down the road similar to how the 3090 ti arrived a year and a half after its non-ti brother we're gonna have the ones that are out linked down below similar to last generation we saw a pretty nice 40 increase in performance it's just that unlike last gen prices didn't stay the same they didn't even increase a little they increased to a degree that i don't think we've ever seen before like really nvidia from 700 the previous two generations to 1200 i think you guys got hooked on that pandemic kool-aid and haven't figured out that outside of the really wacky buyers who have always existed buying titan z's and the like gamers are not gonna spend that kind of money to play video games hence the shelves full of 4080s and 40 70 tis for their part amd has retained a strong value proposition but hasn't been able to match the insanity of the rtx 4090 and we got to meet a new power connector again the 12 volt high power connector has been a hot topic of conversation it theoretically offers some cool benefits like allowing the gpu and power supply to communicate their power requirements and capabilities to each other but uh with all the melted connectors and adapters that got memed all over the internet it's been a bit of a pr nightmare for nvidia who hit back saying that user error was the problem with pretty much everything that happened which may actually be true please do make sure you plug things in all the way in summary if we're going by the kilogram 40 series offers a fine value but we aren't so be tier it best and i'm generously baking in some future price drops once nvidia pre-kains their senses all that remains then now is for you to come at me bro seriously we couldn't get into the nitty-gritty of performance or talk about every new feature for all these generations so let me know on our forum or in the comments down below if you agree or disagree with our reasoning what's your
