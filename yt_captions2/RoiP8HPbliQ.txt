ladies and gentlemen welcome to norway chess 2024 norway chess is one of the strongest tournaments that occurs in chess every single year and it's limited to 12 players six in the open six in the women's and the format is very unique the players play a classical game of chess against each other that is worth three points and if they draw their classical game they restart white gets 10 minutes black gets seven minutes and black gets draw odds and that is the format of the event and then uh winning the armageddon gets you one and a half and uh losing it gets you a point it's a very unique format and today we have magnus carlson versus hikaro nakamura in a classical game of chess something we don't get to see very often they play each other in blitz they play rapid they play bullet but they don't play much classical and it is a fascinating story when they play against each other i will show you all the games uh of the round in uh the second round of action here and i'm also testing out this new overlay i'm on uh it's slightly different than normal but because there's so many games and there's so many armageddon uh we will uh we will keep it here do let me know if you like the for uh this one or you know you're bad with change and you hate change let's go around the horn and then we will take you to the main event of the evening so dingly ran versus prague yesterday ding and magnus had a very weird game can i just say that was a very weird game it was drawing 15 moves magnus spent 15 minutes eating noodles so today ding shows up and he plays c4 plays the english yesterday he uh he showed up and he played a catalan this time he shows up plays the english e5 principal move from uh from prague now g3 and here the cutting edge line is c6 or you can play c6 like this and basically you are trying to play d5 without actually trying to put a knight this is actually nowadays the modern antidote to c4 and g3 it's kind of insane that basically a few years ago people were like why don't i push the c pawn and then the d pawn and this entire variation has died basically now you have to play moves like knight f3 induce e4 put the knight on d4 black plays d5 you you usually take it by the way you take it you play queen d5 but this is not what happened in the game uh and uh instead of that we have d3 very strong move going to turn off my air conditioning my air conditioning would like to participate in today's recap you know anything about air conditioning in new york city is loud d3 bishop c5 knight b3 bishop b6 all of this has been played before and now ding trades all the pawns in the center and plays castles and knight c3 and we have this to work with black has this pawn white has this pawn they're kind of dynamically counterbalanced uh you will also notice neither player has spent uh rather both players have spent a considerable amount of time right like they are both thinking and then in this position ding decides after some 14 minutes to do this right and now prague castles i don't know what else he could have possibly been thinking of but he decides to castle so we have this position now we have knight c6 bishop a3 targeting the rook the rook moves e3 ding is trying to disallow this pawn from coming forward however ding has a very big weakness of his own which is why right here he decides let's get rid of each other's weaknesses okay rook c1 knight2 and now ding has a one on two that is a queenside uh majority for prague uh and there is a four on three on this side of the board it's an open space i mean you talk about an open position that is an open position if i've ever seen one but the problem is both players are extremely good and ding tries to hammer away at the queen side prague completely leaves his piece there to kind of strike here we have knight e4 and prague misses a chance he could have played queen h5 allegedly that was a uh that was a strong move putting a lot of pressure on the position he goes here though and ding very quickly builds up a kind of nice pressure looks like he's going to win all of prague's pawns but here comes prague with the vicious counterplay and uh we have rook d1 rook c2 is apparently a mistake again the events page puts these annotations i kind of i kind of wish they didn't so i could just talk about what happened in the game uh and uh but but that's that's just sort of how it goes also there's the captured pieces this overlay is a little bit finicky rook a2 queen b1 and ding here could have played queen b7 which would have given him a very strong advantage he could have put a lot of pressure here he would have been a a comfortable pawn up but instead of that he brings the queen back and we trade we have this end game and uh this is just a clean draw there is no back rang checkmate because it's protected so they draw which means they go to armageddon which means ding gets five uh 10 minutes versus seven a lot of you wrote in the comments of the last video why is it 10 verse 7 if you listened with sound which is a much better way to enjoy a youtube video than without sound you would know i'm going to speak directly into the microphone 10 minutes for white seven for black but if the game ends to draw black wins to get that second guaranteed result which is a massive thing you need to give some sacrifice so you start with three minutes less that is why so if you're watching this and you still don't know it's your fault you have terrible reading comprehension auditory comprehension i don't know how to help you okay so this time we have this approach knight f3 and d4 and prague just plays like c5 e3 knight c6 d3 and now this move bishop to e7 so instead of playing bishop d6 which is another very normal way to play the position we have what's called a reversed bononi all right or rather yes it's it's a revers bonon we have knight a3 the idea is very simple you want to play knight b5 or knight c2 since there is nothing to target on the on the b5 square we're going to come back here we're going to support the advancement of this side of the board and there we have exactly that prague is already actually a bit worse this is not a position that you really want with black you know white is going to very slowly prepare b4 and you're simply not going to be able to stop it right so now prague starts fighting in the center yeah haven't been able to stop b4 bishop d6 c5 right and ding is playing a very nice positional game this is this is ding l ran at his finest abab this is if you have to play rook b i mean rook b8 doesn't even look real the fact that prague had to play a move like rook ba just knows he was not comfortable in the position like he has the open file right and the reason he played rook bat is he was annoyed rook a7 you know ding is going to play like rook a1 b5 like he's crash through prague didn't like something in the position but rook b8 is not the solution to the problems and now he has to play like b5 and and and knight b5 is actually not the best move ding could have played knight g5 and taken this knight and started taking everything but knight b5 is going to get it done probably knight d6 ding is just in i mean he is in there queen a4 targeting the pieces remember he's got a win so he has a nice time advantage he has all the pressure prag doesn't have a lot of time and uh we get into a little tactical skirmish just two pieces white just has two bishops for rook even if black has an extra pawn two bishops are worth more than six points when they're combined cuz that's how chess math works and now ding is just up a bishop and uh you get a few more moves uh prague basically trying not to lose the game on time but uh i i i don't actually know how he played so many moves just by the way like i don't know how it's even possible to not lose a second of time how is that even possible how did what can we just how did he have two seconds for like 20 moves that's not even possible i don't know anyway prague goes down ding wins very nice game from ding only problem with the what i what i see here is this was in the armageddon like ding had a very nice position in the classical as well but we want to see the world champion you know put put put the pressure on and you know he did it in the he did it in the armageddon it's absolutely welld deserved victory we see what ding is capable of when he's comfortable when he's moving when he's got a position that he he this is this is right here this is dingly ren hopefully we see a resurgence and kind of a re awakening uh if you will and uh yeah the overlay looks a little bit silly it looks like the black clock is cut off but it but but it's not now vali versus humpy cono this is the present uh versus the the future if you will this is the future versus like the the the the incumbent generation i mean these two are maybe a decade apart in age humpy is a pioneer of uh of chess in in india and particularly women's chess and vali is the future she is the best young star they have uh especially on the uh on the women's side they also have diva they have um uh sava and they have a bunch of other strong players uh vagal they have like a bunch of strong players so she plays e4 we have an italian knight c3 knight f6 four knights very boring game but not anymore because we're going after the bishop all right a3 knight e7 take take bishop e3 very solid and we're not being solid anymore uh yeah this is this is crazy this is that's h4 baby like and and and and listen you want to attack me on the side here comes humpy d5 all right ed9 d5 and i mean here this is just ballistic stuff h5 is what are we doing i mean it looks like it looks like they're already playing the armageddon knight e7 cheap now this move this move see the thing is when you watch with no evalar this is crazy this would have been mik tall style but engine right away is like no no no no no and actually black and strike right back down that same line she does b5 first and she doesn't strike back and she allows she allows uh vali to kind of consolidate like humpy tried to trade pieces and that was the way she tried to deal with the attack and tried to create her own counter play but somehow vali got time and time is very important and now vali is like not losing there's not really a way through so humpy brings the rug vali brings her rug but but now black you got of sitting there with black you're like i was supposed to win she played so ridiculous like how how can i not be winning king c1 i must be winning i'm i'm rotating 97 great move right you're looking maybe i'm going to win the end game v still trying to fight now b6 is winning she misses it now we might be heading for a queen trade and humpy here has 5 seconds on the clock apparently here humpy has literally 5 seconds on the clock i mean that is that's nuts and what happens next is she has seven moves moves she has to make seven moves in 8 seconds apparently she goes here rook d5 is a mistake because you lose the pawn and she has three seconds she has three seconds she plays this move which is apparently wrong you have to go queen a4 right now both players now now humpy has to make three moves in two seconds to not lose the game on time first of all if white plays knight c5 here the best move is queen a2 i'm not even sure you can move the queen that far she manages to move a p one square knight back to g5 and rook f3 and now there's bonus time but unfortunately the game is lost because here black gets her bonus time but she plays b6 and uh that's uh instead of that black could have went back to e6 it was a very tense game but she got a little bit low on time rook a1 and and yeah i mean she she did not look back now white is a pawn up with complete control and the black queen gets trapped in the center of the board it's crazy absolutely insane game complete chaos in this game um and uh well let let me move this over here so you can see the captured pieces they should be showing up over here as well there we go that's a little bit well we're making some progress with this overlay this goofy overlay yeah insane game i mean vali bro v showed up and was like someone's losing v did a max hallway all right that's from my ufc she went like this she pointed that she's like let's go right humpy was also throwing the hooks it was crazy it was unbelievable and ultimately got a little bit too low in time and a big win for vall massive win now fuia versus fabiano carana my man fuia is so funny dude i love fua style he's like dude i hate preparing for fabby london dude straight up is like i hate preparing for fabiano one of the best prepared players in the world 2805 london london 3 c5 kn3 kn c6 now there's a lot of lines so many lines here now fabby plays bishop g4 it's one of the lines it's a million lines e6 bishop b7 bishop d6 kn there so many lines f plays this way queen b3 and now there's a line here with white bishop d6 it's a gambit line you uh noe no wrong line wrong line wrong line no not not here that was stupid of me that is not where is the line is it in a slightly different move order there's a line queen b3 bishop six i swear maybe maybe the i i swear i'm not stupid anyway there's a line where black plays bishop d6 against queen b3 maybe it's with the queen on c7 some some something like that i it's not in this position though clearly because it was plus4 and gotham should shut up but there is a line i swear just apparently not here boys and girls um which is why fabby played queen c8 and didn't lose the game like me hey h3 bishop f5 h5 rather and and you know he he can go g4 but he's not doing it oh just kidding and now he grabs the bishop sorry i'm allergic to stupid moves c4 queen d1 insane position bishop hits the knight knight is hanging by the way knight hits the bishop bishop is hanging as well what do we do well first we're going to take the knight we're going to give a check move the king bishop's got to go we're going to trade and i'm going to play king to g2 and i'm going to try to win this pawn back or i'm going to play knight f1 knight g3 and try to win this pawn back now fabby has to act now he does let it be known look at their clock look at their clock this is all theory they didn't think this entire thing up until king to g2 has been played what the what how is this even possible yeah it's possible and sometimes what happens in these crazy forcing lines by the way fua just up a pawn you can see it say plus one rook g1 he's just you know but his pawn's a little bit ugly but he's up a pawn i mean he's completely cruising here and here maybe bishop g5 a little bit better but he plays knight d2 you may be wondering why can't fabby just take this pawn and g7 is hanging so that i actually can see now we have bishop f6 bishop g5 fiano is down 40 minutes on the clock i mean oi resa is cooking he is cooking and here what he had to do is he needed to use his rooks he needed to use his queen he tries to use his knight that move allows king to f7 a very very cool defensive resource defending e6 against knight c5 and preparing rook g8 and now the advantage is gone and it looks like white is still breaking through he's not because rook g8 the knight on the pawn on b7 does not matter you can take it look at this incredible move rook g6 insanely accurate defense if queen f3 white goes rook f1 and you lose because queen e4 knight d6 so you got to go this way and then i get in with my queen and now now you're in some serious trouble i think ali reza missed rook g6 that move cuts the white attack off and now we got all sorts of h file counterplay the real threat in the position maybe what ali resa had missed from a distance is that after queen to b5 there is this and it gets a brilliant move do you know why it gets a brilliant move if you take the knight if you take the knight it looks like there is nothing right well the illusion is that it's not the g file it's the h file and you get mated out of nowhere you you're completely winning that's the defensive idea a crazy defensive idea from fabiano 98 ali rza gives him a counter punch rook has to go off the g file and now we get a we get a draw queen h7 played and uh alira offered a draw because it's just going to be repetition queen f2 queen f3 queen e2 queen f there's nothing better nothing better you take here you lose probably just get mated so don't do that game was on a knife's edge and if ali reso was patient for a moment if he didn't play knight b3 if he played rook g2 rook g1 and just slowly went to g7 didn't rush honestly it's good advice for myself as well but he allowed this absurd def rook g6 is crazy with the a to go here and sack the queen and that is why this game ends in a draw which means we have armageddon let's go knight f3 d5 b3 again a man who wants no part of fabiano carana repertoire bro played the london and he played the the the nimo larson which is what hikaro plays in blitz i love oi rza he's like bro let's just play some double i'm going to put all my pawns like what the what is he doing bro bishop g2 e5 gives fabiano the center but he's just he's just like it doesn't matter it doesn't matter that it's m one because it's the it's a it's a it's a it's an armageddon game d492 he's worse i mean he's just worse like his knight is goofy h3 right his it's minus 1.6 what is alira doing bro h it's minus two but it's armageddon we d1 not only not only is it minus two bro he's not even up on time anymore what is all oh my god this is what is ali rza doing he's got no moves he can't move any pieces oh my god knight d2 i mean he's going to try to do his best how do you get a three-minute time advantage and now you're losing oh my this is a terrible turn of events ry resa oh my goodness i mean it is it is worse and worse i mean like he's playing 20 48 with his pieces you know that game where you slide the oh my goodness king f1 h5 and king g2 and oh my he's pawn down now b4 a4 knight e2 okay this is an unnecessary move from fabiano but i get it like take take and then you know the pawn is strong but i pres gives up the bishop and suddenly it's game on okay but he's he's going to lose he only has 30 seconds on the clock bishop c8 one bishop b4 okay it's complicated blunders everywhere knight f3 and fabiano hung a fork oh my god he hung a fork and and now it's 13 seconds versus' bishop d7 no bonus time it's armag get in and fabiano loses a he just loses knight g5 he can't go anywhere rook b7 br this is this is absurd dude it was fu's position was was was dead i he had nothing it was minus 6 and fabiano was up 90 seconds what is going on this is bananas this is crazy what is oh my god he won he won from here it oh boy and ali ros wins i i'm tell this tournament is crazy like this format is is is so goofy it leads to some crazy games leting versus p kremling this was a sicilian sveshnikov one of the most complex openings that exist knight d5 take take knight b8 this was surveyed in the fabiano carana magnus carlson world championship match of 1918 just kidding it was 100 years later castles 97 all of this has been played before and basically the the idea is black plays f5 and checkmates white and there she goes and as you can see as you can see the computer already likes black's position she plays rook f6 rook h6 and i mean g4 is absurd absurd move but you try to get rid of the pawns and now you're trying to create counter play the engine hates it as a human this is this is very normal and um instead of that pia should have went knight f6 should have been a little bit more active but it's kind of a weird move because after like knight f6 g4 it's not really clear what you're doing with the rook or the knight well you go like this and you try to play for h5 but not even that quickly like let's say white plays a5 you can play h5 now but actually even e4 is a nice idea so pia probably needed to put her knight a bit more actively she does it this way and gives lei enough time to make this little setup which completely restricts black's pieces like four major squares are now covered and pia finds it very difficult now to you see her pieces are kind of all stuck meanwhile lei is like well if you're not going to mate me i'm just going to win the game like i'm just you know i'm going to play b4 and it's plus two and white is completely winning basically in these positions like if black doesn't checkmate white it's it's over lei should have been patient though she should have went rook f3 first she goes here game turns into complete chaos both players have to make n c6 looks completely winning she should have taken on a6 she should have taken this and attack the rook she goes here excellent move from pia joining the pawns and creating counterplay but both sides have seven moves to make or else they lose on time and look at this look at this and the ewn sneaks in lay gives up the rook but a queen instead this is gangster stuff from p kremling ladies and gentlemen and we get a repetition of moves crazy game i mean that was a heavyweight fight and now these two play an armagon right so we have e4 sicilian and remember it's a draw ods this time we have a we have a we have a kalashnikov e5 instead of sveshnikov bishop e2 pia going for these kind of sicilians trading the dark squared bishop and remember white is up 3 minutes to start the game but not anymore uh now it's a barely a 30- second time advantage and black has completely equalized so again we're seeing this kind of thing but the thing is with the pressure on it's not that easy to play and suddenly leting j is crashing through that's a threat and that's a threat and uh yeah p knight c7 is just losing there is unfortunately no way to make a comeback here uh i think the game ended in some 105 moves she tries to create some counterplay but rook versus knight is a pretty tough disadvantage the king gets hunted and she had she had some question marks here for the position but lay always had everything under control queen g6 rook c8 and lay wins this one uh in the armageddon and that's you know again like this is armageddon for you it was it's equal here and all of a sudden you make one bad trade you kind of underestimate the tactics rook c8 you can't play here because knight f5 is crushing you play rook c8 knight d5 and it's crazy because it was actually very even on time but a couple of you know bad decisions you have to go knight c6 knight d4 it's life lay wins j and june anam musuk women's ro champion we have a bishop's opening kind of a vienna this is actually in the e4 course bishop d5 is the recommendation in the course in my course i recommend bishop d5 uh jan jun does not study the gotham course uh because she's only slightly you know she's a little bit better than than us but g6 and she still gets kind of a very imbalanced game here but not much happens queen f3 they trade a lot every piece basically white had a little bit of pressure but the rooks are about to come off and we just have a night end game honestly like the the the the peace trades came very quickly in this game it was a trade from the opening two trades and then there was like a trade of bishops and then there was a trade of queens so it's going to be tough to to win a position where after 17 moves you know this is what it is but obviously j and jun was not particularly thrilled with the opening result so she's going to try to win this in the armageddon all right and uh she goes for the same opening by the way but this time she plays knight f3 instead of 92 also not in the gotham course and we still kind of get a vienna is structure but what the heck is going to h how you going to get this bishop out how the bishop's an imposter dude it's a pawn f6 and white is much better how is that even possible like she's just a dude she doesn't even care she has no bishop the bishop is a pawn rook g3 she just generates this massive attack but what about the bishop what and and i mean now you can already play moves like bishop a4 and trade it she plays c3 and anna just gets tired of waiting she sacrifices a piece but unfortunately it's not it's just not going to be good enough and j and june absolutely bulld es and now that bishop comes back in to deflect the queen from the defense look at that that's that's funny it's iconic that's the 29th move of the game uh on the 12th move of the game she walled in her own bishop and she knew the bishop would be returning and that's exactly what happened and ultimately she broke through uh in a violent fashion with uh rook f6 b bishop h6 if queen h6 you take and then you take the rook she wins the queen and uh crazy game but jan jun ultimately comes out on top a lot of white wins today uh ding beat prague uh fuja beat fabiano in one of the dumbest games i've ever seen in my life uh no disrespect just was absolutely hilarious i would have lost it with both colors just you know white as 4 and0 in the in the armageddon today and now we here we are my friends we are at the game magnus carlson hikara nakamura now let me just tell you right now if you if you just skipped ahead recently there has been a resurgence of this rivalry you know between magnus and hikaru historically though before the chess boom magnus had a ridiculous score against hikaru in classical chess and so that was sort of like the rivalry that never really happened because they were supposed to be you know these crazy rivals and somehow hikaru would allow advantages to sort of dissipate over the years he had the very painful game in zurich he made a video about it i think it takes insane amounts of mental fortitude and i look up to hikaro a lot to bring this rivalry back to the forefront there is only one man on planet earth who can consistently keyword consistently challenge magnus in rapid blitz and bullet and it's hikaru it's not glazing as the kids say all right it's not uh riding as the kids say none of that stuff all right look at the stats there's a couple of people that sporadically beat magnus like ali resa recently did some of the indian guys like gukesh and prague only one man consistently so it's very interesting to me will that translate to classical chess for hikaro if hikaro starts beating magnus in classical chess the whole world opens up i mean it it it is bananas but it's going to be really tough to do with black right so he you know he plays bishop b5 and now he plays bishop c5 which is something he played in the candidates tournament the idea is to sneak the knight to g6 where it overprotect e5 he played this he played this against n nishi i don't if you remember that probably don't i barely remember that myself there's another way you can play here which is just putting the knight on g6 period he plays this c3 97 hikaru's got this new style where he likes to provoke magnus into a fight he doesn't play the berlin okay he's not playing the berlin against he's not like oh dear oh dear i'm playing magnus i've got to i've got to equalize also i don't know why i turned british also this is a terrible accent by goam like that's not what he does he's not like oh dear oh dear as he doesn't do it he he placs to fight he's trying to get into a fight knight g6 d4 bishop a7 all this has been played before now napo here against hikaro played bishop g5 and bishop he played the setup with bishop e3 knight d magnus plays rook e one so magnus knew at this point hearu is in his candidates prep i should do something to take him out of his candidates prep and go into what i know so he plays rookie one it's probably nothing wrong with the move rookie one it's why he spent six minutes by the way notice no noodle eating from from magnus this game ain't nobody leaving for 15 minutes castles bishop e3 hear plays queen f6 that's crazy that's normally where the knight is in this opening this is bananas this is this is like chess from the'80s hikaru is playing like steinet when they would put the queen on f6 and be like do your worst it works because you can't put the knight on d5 right so now magnus thinks for 13 minutes and he takes the knight on c6 hearu zich kugs pawn takes z4 and then he trades all the pieces and goes here look at the evaluation and now not just magnus down 24 minutes on the clock magnus tries to speed up here a little bit plays knight d2 knight f5 knight f3 he's worse magnus is worse with white not only is he worse with white he went to the confessional booth and said that his play here was embarrassing he mentioned that the move queen f6 kind of like annoyed him bothered him kind of like threw him off and he tried to kind of clarify matters by taking he should have kept the tension instead and from the opening it is hikaru nakamura who is just better with black against the goat now it's about how you play the position from here rook e8 king g2 f6 it's going worse and worse rook e 3 it's minus one on deep engine analysis it's sort of like black controls the position black controls the diagonal what do you do well apparently all you got to do here is you got to play a5 the best thing that white can do here again according to the deep engines is to play a move like rook c1 i can't even explain to you what rook c1 does trying to like get him to take now you play a4 then maybe white plays a3 and apparently this is like minus one and a half the game is over on deep analysis here from from the engine it loves just taking queenside space it does not see a plan for white it doesn't see a plan like i don't even know i don't know i mean knight e1 i i don't know if you try to play h4 to try to play h5 black can just play h5 it loves the position hikaru plays knight h8 and the idea of knight h8 is to play g6 is to kick the knight out and then bring the knight like this but this gives white a little time to improve his position and again karo is like i don't quite understand how i'm supposed to break through here so he you know makes a couple of improving moves but now the position locks up he doesn't take the necessary space on the queen side the position locks up and magnus kind of escapes of the worst of it and now the players agreed to a draw but i found it absolutely incredible that the engine thought you push the pawn to a4 and white just doesn't have anything at all now the plan that hikaro chose and ultimately the queen side locking seems to be what went wrong in this game maybe he kind of was like well i can't ever lose so draw is fine but it's kind of wild because yeah that plan this was apparently the only plan the only plan of action the way he caro played it was again i'm not i'm not a 2800 gm i can't break the inner workings of this position out for you but i can tell you allowing white to have a little bit more time to consolidate seemed to be the issue here and once magnus locked the position there was you know you you still had some nagging pressure but magnus is kind of well equipped to defend this position and it almost felt like you know a draw is completely fine for black so why risk anything which means we got to play arm again and now we go for the exact same thing if it ain't broke don't fix it this time magnus plays more aggressively now the chest com thing gives this a brilliant move it's ridiculous it's not a brilliant move but it doesn't know any better knight e5 d4 magnus clearly had some time to prepare bishop b3 take take d6 c3 from magnus c castles and c5 from hikaru hikaru very well prepared gets himself into a position where he's completely comfortable magnus plays rook e1 queen c7 remember hikaru down 3 minutes and he has to draw the game rook d8 now magnus plays knight magnus playing quickly he wants to beat hikaru he's not happy with how the previous game went he makes maximum improvements to his position c4 now a very big moment they both played' moves they've made maximum improvements to their position now we begin the next phase of the game we're trying to go here we're trying to go for f4 knight d3 hikaru tries to clarify matters and take the pawn on e4 magnus takes and plays rook d4 he has that target on d6 hiar says take it magnus says no i'm good i'm going to reinforce rook d6 yeah because here hikaro could have played d5 and sat there for the remainder of the game defending this ugly pawn he decides you know what no magnus says bro it's a free pawn free pawn i'm not going to reinvent the wheel let's go knight e3 queen d4 and he is just up upon he's up upon pa opposite color bishops he does not care if the bishops are of the opposite color we don't trade into the opposite color bishop endgame we keep the knights on the board we bring the king to the center this is masterful this is the worst place to be versus magnus carlson the king makes it to be six look at how iconic this is starting on g1 started from the bottom and now we're here king goes to b6 makes a couple of necessary preparation moves hearo creates counterplay it is not enough you take the pawn king b6 white swept the armageddon today 5 and0 this is such a weird format and magnus beats hikaru uh in the armageddon after a very very very good showing may i just say from hikaru uh in the classical game it's a shame cuz i he it's it's almost like he was okay with the draw there wish he just you know i wish he thought he was playing me not easy to do i guess but you know if he was playing if h carter was playing me in that game he would have destroyed me but i guess draws all right and uh but but yeah white sweeps in the arm again today um i don't have any final standings for you cu uh again i can't actually pull them up so tomorrow i will have a picture instead because i can't see the results for some reason they're just not they're not there probably because of the weird scoring system anyway uh get out of here
