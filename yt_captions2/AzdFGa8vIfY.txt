this thing is actually pretty darn close to being a cd well not in the sense that it's a standard compact disc but it does use freaking laser beams to save data we're going to look at some really weird optical discs today starting with the floptical disc and in case you don't know what optical disc means it's just a cd or anything similar that uses lasers to read or write like a dvd an old gamecube disk or these really big laser discs you might have used back in school the idea behind the floptical disc was to take a standard three and a half inch floppy remember those they weren't actually floppy and then sharply increases capacity while a regular floppy disk could only hold about 1.44 megabytes in typical pc format the floptical held almost 21. even though the actual data on the drive was stored magnetically similar to a plain old floppy disk floppedical used lasers to stabilize the read and write heads the little part that almost contacts the disc and actually writes and retrieves data this allowed the head to be much more precise meaning that there's much more data that could accurately be written to the disk per unit of area but if floptical delivered more storage in this same package why does it remain such an obscure piece of tech well it originally came out in 1991 and by that point the standard 1.44 megabyte floppy drive was already very ingrained in the pc market and while there was demand for higher capacity removable storage floptical was very delicate and just not reliable enough to straight up replace standard drives it also didn't help that iomega came out with their zip drives in 1994 which held at least 100 megabytes and were much faster than floptical drives and of course floptical didn't have any chance of competing against rewritable cds once they became popular in the late 90s let's talk about this thing looks like a regular cd but it's actually a cd plus g the g standing for graphics but these weren't graphics in the sense of like a full-length video you'd get with something like a dvd movie cd plus g was actually introduced back in 1985 and used blank space in the original cd audio format to encode simple graphics some of these were images that were included as a promotional bonus with certain music albums but more commonly cd plus g was used for karaoke machines since showing lyrics on a decorative background image didn't exactly take up a lot of space cd plus g quickly became a standard for amateur singers on margarita night the world over although they didn't see much use outside of karaoke a few game consoles like the sega cd and sega saturn and later even the sega dreamcast as well as some home dvd players could read cd plus g disks you can actually still get cd plus g karaoke machines today and some standalone albums that made use of the tech are now sought after by collectors but while cd plus g had its day we're going to talk about a format that one huge company sunk tons of money into but had

portable which is an absolute beast when it first released back in 2004. its graphics put the competing nintendo ds to shame partly due to the universal media disc those little guys that were about the size of a cookie despite its diminutive size the umd could actually hold up to 1.8 gigabytes of data meaning not only more detailed games but also the ability to hold full length movies that would actually look good especially on the psp small display and indeed hundreds of hollywood blockbusters came out on umd along with music videos from big name acts well-known tv series and even porn if you lived in japan how always a crowd pleaser even if it is blurred but these days umd has disappeared from the market completely even though it's still easy to find cds and blu-rays for sale why well some as a proprietary format it was a kind of a follow-up to the mini disc back in the day meaning that no device except for the psp could actually use the disks although watching movies and shows on the psp was undoubtedly convenient watching a movie on the go for most people at the time meant popping in a regular dvd into their laptop meaning there wasn't much of a market for umd video especially considering their high price this meant that even though the psp was a successful console not many people were buying emds for anything other than psp games and by the time the psp reached end of life streaming video on smartphones was really starting to take off meaning that sony didn't really see a need to come out with a lineup of boobies on physical media successor the ps vita of course if you really missed those little discs mini blu-ray is actually a thing but seeing as we're out of time let us know down in the comments if you'd like to see another video on more weird discs
