all right so apparently carter cararta the private equity company is finding themselves in a bit of an is with some credibility situations going on here now here's the deal uh i i've had shares on carta multiple times over the last couple decade or last decade last decade and a half so you know like cter can't go down because what what happens to your private equity i don't even know what happens here but anyways let's look at this okay this might be the end of carta incorporated as the trust platform for startups as a founder it feels kind of shitty that carta who i trusted to manage our cap table is now doing cold outreach to our angel investors about selling linear shares to their buyers you know the ever increasing demands for profits make people make just dumb decisions just like purely dumb decisions like there there just has to be a point where you say hey we're making good enough money we don't have to be a publicly traded company we don't have to make billions yeah it's it's yeah yeah exactly carta is basically a management platform for non-publicly traded stock companies it's what you use to be able to give your employees stocks in a company that's not on the public market and so if they're taking that information and then using it as a means to sell like that's kind of wild that's kind of wild so can you explain i i think that pretty much explains everything that you need to know okay let's read this happy new year i hope things are off to a good start i'm an investor cover let's see i'm on the investor coverage team at carta liquidity the capital markets division within carta i'm reaching out because we have a firm buy order for blank nation uh notional of linear shares at blank our buyer is contractually obligated to transact at that price but might be willing to flex higher please let me know if you'd like to discuss in advance i have attached a brief overview of our process and frequently asked questions for your review thanks damn that's kind of wild it is pretty scummy especially this part right here like because okay so so a real strong problem so this is what this so in if you're not familiar with the real estate market in the united states of america which i mean granted only 20% of you are even from america uh effectively what happens is that often we have these uh rent seekers called realators and the realators as far as i can tell file file a bit of paperwork and get paid 3% of the property price each and so what ends up happening is that you have one realer on the buy side and one realer on the sell side and what happens is they talk blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and they come back and say okay they will accept or not accept your offer pretty straightforward so what's happening here that's kind of that's like super duper shitty is that they are on the buy side and they are on the sell side that's a real problem if you have a realtor both on the buy and sell side whoever that person likes more is getting a better deal and so the fact that they're literally saying hey this person needs to do some share swapping and they're required to do this contractually so they are forced to do it but they will be willing to flex higher is literally saying hey this guy has his arm behind his back saying uncle and if you want to come in a touch higher or touch lower you can do that like that that's super [ __ ] like forc to sell and then letting people know you're forced to sell and then using that information to let other people know like that dude that double dipping is just it is it is one of the scummiest practices of all time there is almost no worse thing than doing double dipping this is exactly why we have regulators exactly this is the entire reason why markets end up getting um what's it called they end up getting uh uh like a bunch of regulation wrapped around it is because once you get into the the taker maker and they're both just like dude you somebody gets taken advantage of every single time uh judo you think this is an sec violation i have no idea if it is an sec violation but it's an ethical violation for sure it may not be illegal i have no idea the legality of the situation and nor am i but i am most certainly positive it is ethically scummy it's completely legal but completely immoral yeah i have no idea how legal it is honestly there may actually be some rules against this like if you hold a bunch of private equity if i because there's like all these different versions of what kind of company you could be if you're a holder of money you're you have you're beholden to different regulations so i have no idea the regulations uh i know that in america we're effectively slowly reducing down how many banks can even exist due to more and more intense regulations and i don't know if cardas falls under the banking umbrella or what they fall under but it's it's it's wild and this is wild i'm pretty sure i signed a best interest agreement with them and let's see and it would violate that yes that that's a good point if you signed a best interest agreement with them and they're literally saying might be willing to flex higher like you already know like that's not that's not your best interest okay interesting let's see let's see if there's more more information by the way the buyer would buy the shares exactly at let's see at our series b share price not that this information is unobtainable secret but makes me paranoid carter is playing both sides here really parano that carter literally stated right there they're playing both sides cter knows who has shares and how much at what price they bought it and when what other transactions have happened and when legal docs compliant docks headcount revenue and other information if they have connected it you guarantee they have connected you you bet your sweet ass has been connected by the way this angel is someone family member who we have never mentioned publicly and they have not published their investment in linear anywhere either they are hardly on online somehow ca was able to find their email address and the fact they own linear shares i'm just going to pretend that ca isn't that scummy and that there must have been some sort of agreement slail put somewhere in some system in which they just had access to i'm just going to pretend that because i just have this it just sounds wild i am perfectly fine with the idea if carter has a secondary sales platform for company's approved tender offer or secondary sales actually this would be really great honestly this is actually a great way to exp ca's market is to allow a public private uh sales market to me that seems really reasonable it's just that carta can't be involved they can only provide the medium they can't provide they can't be selling right it it it is most certainly bad public private static void main string args sl money uh same thing let's see even could be okay if buyers could submit their interest and cter could inform the company about the interest yeah that's fine uh i think where it crosses the line where ca uses their employees to solicit their these sales and i believe use private cap table information to reach out to stakeholders to get them to sell knowing company or board hasn't approved any secondary sales let me know if there's companies who have experience this dms are open oh damn this joe fella right here okay jo joe you know it's joe dude why am i pressing dude i'm pressing i'm literally pressing command click why are you not opening in another window fine i'll just click it whatever um had a similar cold call uh or had a similar cold outreach about a company i'm an angel in company was similarly pissed dang oh look at this update carter reached out to me okay carter's coming in here we go let's hear carter carter did reach out to me they didn't offer any details what might have happened but some of their leadership is wanting to have a call i did recommend them to post something publicly in case there has been a mistake or something update i pulled the investors so far at least three of the earliest angel investors were contacted with the same email gives me more indication that the reach out was targeted based on some information and random oh the ca the ca ceo's coming in all right all right oh o henry ward all right ceo at carda okay the man the myth the legend the ceo is coming in now all right carrie you are free to share our conversation what i remember is that you appreciate we made a uh let's see i remember is that you appreciated we made a mistake that affected you and two other companies thank you for understanding we [ __ ] up and i'm sorry we [ __ ] up i hope you will forgive us you acknowledge that calling for the fall of carta when you've been a customer for 10 years over an email mistake might have been a slight overreaction thank you for recognizing that as well by the way prayer emojis dude you're a ceo man just throwing that out there the prayer are high five they might be high-fiving this might be a high five right now now they might be wearing this dude carter ceo has no eq i know this this is wild okay you've also acknowledged if the roles were reversed and i had a bad experience with linear and publicly broadcasted that you had been nefarious lying to all of your customers and illegally violating their data before calling you first founder to founder and asked what happened you would find that really unfair you didn't think it would be appropriate if i did that to you but despite feeling so upset about our mistaken email that you are calling an end for carta and eliminating 2,000 jobs and strand strand 40,000 customers you didn't ask to cancel your contract with ca it seems you you are still planning to stay with us despite all the public bashing i don't understand was this just a firebomb us for your personal twitter and linkedin exposure damn ceo of mean girls dude founder to founder is so sus yeah dude it is sus dude that okay so that's kind of wild uh so the problem here is that i don't have enough information to tr truly understand it cuz the problem is is that he's saying it was an email fup but when you hear email f up the thing that i have a hard part about is this indicates that somebody was told to do something and then that person who was told to do something went out did some research and came up with some sort of idea here do you see what i'm saying like they came up with like oh okay so actually these people are contractually obligated to do something and i bet you we could get a little bit more out like this so like this it looks like maker taker at the same time making a transaction to me this is what this is what i smell i'm just going to throw this out here and i could be completely wrong i'm not saying this is the truth or anything but what i think i personally see is that they started something new they did a little bit what we call a painted door test right they're just doing a a little bit of poking just a little bit of seeing like how do people react to something send out a couple emails got destroyed and then said oh okay uh never that was just a dude we're just joking bro bro we're just joking i'm sorry that you are the [ __ ] here but you're kind of the [ __ ] here it's just a prank it was just a mistake it's just a little bit of emails what's the big deal like that's i mean that was like as bash bunny just said that i mean the the founder of of of carta is not looking too smooth here you know what i mean like a really good move so just to throw this out here a really good move is if you if you end up having a public problem uh a person who recently called me racist before that he called me something else and i went and privately messaged him and instead of becoming upset online or even more so being like see he admitted he was publicly wrong or privately wrong instead i just said hey we resolved that's that and that was good i you know a good move is you don't try to drag you don't continue to drag it on because then more people jump in you know what i mean you could say hey we talked i think we have some things resolved we might need the meet more it was our mistake we [ __ ] up like he started off great we [ __ ] up we made a mistake okay he said it was on accident that he accidentally told somebody to accidentally go and investigate accidentally somebody's cap table and who is willing to buy and accidentally even suggest prices and how you could manipulate the situation just accidentally but it happened just a freudian slip oopsy dosies oopsy dupsies didn't mean to accidentally do that one all right anyways getting back to this now was making dinner american beef stew by uh kenji by the way i can't tell okay first off i don't know what that is but second off that actually sounds like an episode of silicon valley where it's just like not only are you making food the food you are making has like an author to it it has like a signatory to it bam this this isn't okay first off this isn't just any beef stew this is american beef stew by kenji it's just like i don't even know what that means henry if you insist i'm happy to share details or my version of the call this is also a good move right here good move right here uh this is why i hate doing these calls because everything becomes i said you said first of all i posted this publicly because i suspected there is a broader systemic issue or systematic issue with carta a company that is dealing with extreme trust corporate cap table and other private matters should take safeguarding of confidential information seriously space with the period uh since uh then i've learned from multiple companies that this has been going on for months or even years where investors or employees of private companies are solicited by ca employees to put their shares on sale crazy this accidental mistake that looks like some specific set of information was taken accidentally oopsy poopsies just happened like two or three times are bad everyone's saying the the the the the recipe for the american beef stew is really nice oopsy doopsy poopsy whoopsy accidental reproduced it over the last couple years not a big deal okay guys shut up about kenji's american beef stew okay we're we're focused on the on an issue here and all you guys can think about is beef stew our stream now kenji beef stew let's go kenji beef american stew let's go okay anyways these people haven't opted in uh to this and companies haven't approved these sales if ca and ca mark marketplace employees have free access to company information and cap table information in order to generate secondary sales which companies often don't want it's all starts to seem rotten my comment was about losing trust in cara to safeguard our corporate matters nothing you or cararta has done so far has been able to return that trust the simple fix here is to state that this is not a practice of carta going forward the call oh by the way this is also a really good reason to not live in california i live in south dakota you know a priv of south dakota or texas is single consent state i get onto an important call i hit record i've consented i can record just saying single consent state it's very nice because when when when you have a high stakes call and something like this goes on you don't want some person just like just saying something in one way and then doing something else you can be like yeah really well look at this i have never used it but i have the ability to do that cuz here's the deal oh i i don't record any of my calls because i don't have any important calls you know you realize the phone calls that i have is like me talking to my editor flip media by the way flip media by the way uh he grew up on uh 88th street in la and he thought it was like really cool and he had it as his uh he had it as his moniker 88th place and then somebody's like nazi and he's like what the hell's happened so now he's not that anymore he's now flip media great flip media absolutely love the guy uh but anyways that really happened um i don't know apparently they do he could i don't know hey that one company just got owned because they had a company called what was it insurrection 88 or not insurrection uh infection 88 and it like had like the little tick for the year 1988 people are like not this not material they had to rename their company people get people get upset about that one all right anyways the call i share my disappoint pointed and surprised that carta is doing this after 10 years of using the product in other companies i have been approached by other companies in the space but i always believe ca is the best in class in the business i asked him to explain to what happened henry starts explaining that ca marketplace is a separate business from carta weird then how do they know about this they have investors that come to them with their portfolio in order to off offload shares mostly with growth companies he mentioned several companies who they transact with all the time he claims that in this case our existing investor a fund they deal with time to time was interested buying linear shares i reached out to a handful of investors who have funds or potential to-do funds but so far everyone said they don't do this and wouldn't consider going around our back like this unconfirmed hold on i reached out to a handful of investors who have funds or potentials to do funds but so far everyone said they didn't do this and wouldn't consider going around our backs like this unconfirmed okay okay so it's it's no no one in okay okay i see what he i i i see what he's saying that whoever was trying to buy these funds is unconfirmed he doesn't have any idea who they are okay i see what's happening i i don't know if the cla oh oh the claim uh well it says that uh he claims in this case our existing oh our existing investor oh oh gosh i missed that part oh oh oh he can't even confirm that this exists now granted maybe the investor saw all this blowing up and and people who were doing this played dumb you know it's a real deal that does happen but he says he cannot confirm this statement at all amongst anybody okay so that's a real deal he explained commonly ca marketplace looks for sellers and buyers in their platform who have opted into it but in this case the employee in question again not employed by carta but a separate business carta marketplace convenient huh you ever wonder how people get around getting in trouble you ever have any questions about how somebody's able to kind of work around a system damn not ca employee that's not ca employee at all that's uh it's a different employee completely different you wouldn't understand that's that uh again not employed by carta but a separate business carta marketplace was able to gain access to our c data by their break the glass system which requires approval to see customer data a front end wang yeah this is a front end wang this is not a back door wang this is a front door wang like the guy went right in break the glass system like how is how is this even like how i assume it's only a separate company because they don't want to get sued into oblivion for various things he didn't know it was done or how it was done he offered really you're telling me that a company that deals with financially sensitive information doesn't have a simple events table what does break the glass system mean well you can imagine that there exists a place where the safety's all at and you want to get in there to go look at the financial information and so you have these very very specific ways you can break in and go look at a specific piece of information and come back out that's what it's trying to say they have a break the glass system you can get through the firewall and go find out what's happening but it's it's like a it's like a sniper rifle it's not like a rocket launcher you can't just get everything you can get the one thing you're looking for and that's that the fact that they don't have an immediate audit table for exactly what happened this person approved it for this reason after talking to this manager or whatever right you would assume that since it's financial information and cap tables you have to have like an except an exceptionally specific and detailed audit log for exactly why this like oh [ __ ] handle has been pulled he offered uh that potentially the employee self approved the request the employee in question was put on administrative leave the employees getting [ __ ] here guarantee you this the employee is the one getting screwed here it should notify people when the glass is broken exactly i mean there's a whole you could just imagine that anytime you have financial data there's like an entire series of of of like hurdles one has to cross to be able to get to this data to me what i'm seeing is that doesn't sound like there's much of a hurdle here yeah employee in question equals fall guy yeah dude we're playing fall guys at this point uh henry acknowledged that uh mistakes were made i don't think mistakes were made i think it was well i mean it's a good point mistakes yes accidents no this sounds like it was told to be done somebody approved dudes making excuses they don't have an audit trail sl aren't showing you the audit trail to me it seems more likely that they have an audit trail they're just completely ignoring it because the audit trail includes incriminating evidence in which they do not want to get out i bet you that audit trail has probably been deleted uh getting caught was the mistake getting caught was the mistake i commented that since i've heard from multiple founders that companies that their investors and employees have approached that it seems there is a culture or integrity issue with the company if these things keep happening i asked henry henry if he plans to do anything about it he answered that he will reflect on it that is such a silicon ass valley answer the term reflect i swear the silicon valley it almost sounds like like like a like a high school church group sometimes you know i'm going to take that i'm going to reflect on it you know i'm going to spend some time in self-reflection and just really consider my actions in this okay you know it's a process it's a process of going from better to best bro you work at netflix yeah i know i hear the term reflect all the time i don't use the term reflect because it sounds stupid bro i'm just going to you know i'm just i i hear what you're saying i need i need some time i'm going to go self-reflect on this one you know i'm just gonna i'm going to meditate on it it's not you know i i meditate and i'm going to go meditate now on it cool bro you know people who say they meditate don't get me wrong i don't believe i don't believe they're ass one bit i don't believe their ass one bit i meditate no no you don't no you don't he continues saying that they will start uh they will still want to pursue liquidity even if they make mistakes now and then it's new and people don't get it it's a real girl you wouldn't understand oh that's great he can okay let me reread that just so i really understand he continues saying that they will uh still want to purser pursue liquidity even if they make mistakes now and then it's new and people don't get it he also mentioned that most ceos are happy to hear that there is a demand for their shares they were also supposedly planning to contact us but it just didn't happen again you would assume that a company doing good due diligence before attempting to make some sort of sale of shares of private companies would first go and ask ceo or at least inform them or at least give them some sort of message hey by the way we are now contacting people because there is interest in your shares if you have a problem please press eight at the end henry blames me for making a big deal out of the email so far i've heard from six investors uh where or from six investors were contacted over the months and other companies that had happened to investors and employees as well okay after the call i've learned henry has been trying to explain this is an isolated incident over t tier 1 vc email group and saying the only way this happened uh this oh my goodness sorry sorry i'm having i'm h i'm having a stroke i'm legitimately having a stroke okay after the call i've learned henry has been trying to explain this as isolated incident over tier 1 vc email group think about all the people that weren't contacted they're like hey i'm i thought i was tier one hey hey i thought i was tier one and saying the only way this to happen is if the company has opted into carta x you know i'm an investor i've invested in in companies i guess i'm not a tier one vc this article is a pre-read i guess i never got contacted by carta that's cool uh my trust in carta is lost and the only fix i see here is that there are controls put in place between the marketplace and the card cap table management information management information shouldn't flow freely and companies should be asked for approval or given heads up when there is activity yeah you'd almost think that this audit trail you would almost think that like an audit trail would require the company itself to sign into its information being accessed by a third party you think there'd be some something there you know ooh get entry 50% chance if they try this with sentry i would have used all my power to move us off what what are these little arrows for uh the simple fix is to state that there is not uh that this is not a practice of cter going forward it's funny well going forward the simple fix is that this should have been stated that this was never a practice and then nobody should have said oh this happened to me too the quote but the that wasn't a quote that was just a that was just a statement right that's just a statement anyways yeah deadly obvious this is a practice they do he's trying to talk around it cu he wants to and will continue to do it c is break the glass system i you know what honestly i think what we all should do right now is just remember people don't know how markdown works you know like real talk i think everybody here the the real loser here is that one person at ca investor or whatever it's called ca management that um that literally was just doing their job and they sent out the emails that they were told to send out and now they're the fall guy and who knows what crazy crazy fallout there might be from all this right they're gonna they i mean who knows if they're going to get like hit with legal stuff all that the employee like that employee is is surely getting getting effed and i feel genuinely bad for them and i sure hope that somehow at the end of the day that employee is able to sue ca for millions of dollars in emotional trauma money that's my personal opinion because is that's just shitty that's just shitty of them it was jeff the nerves of this guy uh judo uh priment if you work for a finance company you know that you shouldn't do this and you are complicit if you follow those instructions yeah well i mean that so that's the curious part if you work for a management company that buys and sells stuff and you get the go like the hard part is is is every employee expected to know all the stuff that's just the person sending emails out hey you need to send emails to these 10 people and describe these things now i feel like you should probably know based on the original email for those that forgot the original email the real the real crime is just like this this last line right here just really irks the [ __ ] out of me right like this is really bad this is really really bad uh because even if they just had some sort of miscommunication they thought they could sell shares maybe maybe linear did sign with ca x and didn't realize that that meant they could sell shares you know oopsy poopsies happen but this right here is wild right this last line is really where where the whole thing gets like just completely effed up anyways rip that guy r hey good rule of th don't work in the finance industry unless if you really know you're in a good spot and and and you're not going to get effed because honestly the finance industry is extremely regulated it's extremely difficult and if something gets effed up you know it's not going to be the top brass going down okay we all know that somehow in 2008 goldman sachs somehow had hundreds of millions of dollars of loans that all got defaulted the government paid them for all of it they ended up holding those houses for so long and then they end up selling the houses making hundreds of more millions of dollars okay if you're in the financial institution be at the tippy top because for whatever reason you get to make all the money i don't know what it is but it's stupid it's stupid millions of millions of millions of millions the name is the primagen
