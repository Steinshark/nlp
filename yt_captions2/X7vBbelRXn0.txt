welcome, everyone to 
 mcoding with james murphy, that's me, where we try to get just a 
 little better at programming every episode so that we can take unknown hours 
 to automate our 30-second interaction with the coffee machine. today, we're talking about parallel programming. specifically, how to unlock and 
 use all of your cpu cores in python. i'm also an independent consultant. so if you or your company needs 
 python consulting, please check me out. i'll motivate this with the following 
 extract transform load (etl) workflow. we start off with a bunch of audio files that 
 we want to read in, process, and then write back out. we use scipy to read in 
 each audio file as a numpy array. we then operate on the numpy array. in this case, adding 
 random normally distributed noise. : ) and then we write back out 
 our new transformed audio file. obviously, adding random noise to a bunch 
 of files isn't necessarily a very useful thing to do.  but please consider each of these 
 steps as just a stand-in for a real workflow. extract data from some location, 
 whether it be a file, a database, or whatever. do something useful to transform it in memory. then you take your transformed 
 data and store it out somewhere else. let's see how this primitive 
 etl performs in a loop. here we have 24 audio files. they're just sine waves for about four minutes long. : | : ) now, let's process each of 
 them and see how long it takes. right off the bat, it's taking 
 about a half second to process each file. maybe for a single file, you 
 might be okay with waiting half a second. but if you're starting to process 
 hundreds or thousands of these files, this is going to add up really quickly. but let's take a look at the handy 
 cpu monitor and run that process again. as you can see, although it's 
 going to take 12 seconds to finish, we're only utilizing 24% of our cpu, approximately.   wouldn't it be great if we could utilize all 
 of our computing power to get the job done faster? there are three big contenders for 
 how to deal with multiple tasks in python. there's asyncio, threading, and multiprocessing. as the name suggests, asyncio is 
 primarily concerned with i/o-bound operations. asyncio is built to allow tasks 
 to cooperatively pause themselves. and allow other tasks to run, particularly while they're doing nothing, just waiting. so, if the bulk of your program 
 time is spent reading or writing to disk or waiting on a network connection, then asyncio might be a good choice. while we're definitely reading and writing files, assume, for the sake of the argument, that the transformation step, the 
 one we're actually doing raw computation, is where the bulk of the time is spent. in that case, we'd say we're compute-bound. 
 and asyncio wouldn't be a good fit. okay, what about using threads? in a lot of languages besides python, 
 using threads would be the answer here. the ultimate reason that we didn't 
 see 100% cpu utilization was because python is just running on 
 a single thread on a single cpu. that one cpu might have been close to maxed out. but the seven others were just sitting idle. however, just take a look and see what happens when we swap things out for a threading solution. here's the cpu monitor again. and let's run it. okay, here we go. things look like they're going well. but we're still only getting 32-31% cpu utilization. it was a little bit faster, 
 almost eight seconds, not 12. but we still didn't get 
 anywhere close to full cpu utilization. with seven extra cores, we should 
 expect things to go six or seven times faster. and here's where we get to the big 
 elephant in the room with python and threads. python, well specifically cpython, which is the  python that 
 99% of you are going to be using, has what's called the global interpreter lock (gil). a lock is a parallel processing primitive that helps threads prevent themselves 
 from accessing the same data at the same time. in particular, to prevent one 
 thread from reading or writing some data while another thread is writing to it. only one thread can acquire this lock at a time, which is ensured by your 
 operating system and by your actual hardware. if two threads are trying to 
 access the same data at the same time, one of them will get the 
 lock first, and it's able to do its thing. then it releases the lock, 
 and the other one can grab it. well, as the name suggests, the global interpreter lock is a 
 global lock around the entire python interpreter. in order to advance the 
 interpreter state and run any python code, a thread must acquire the gil. so, while it's possible to have 
 multiple python threads in the same process, only one of those threads can 
 actually be executing any python code. while that's happening, all the 
 other threads just have to sit around and wait. now, we did still get some speedup  here. and the reason for that is simple. you only need to acquire the gil to run python code. your python code can then call 
 out to c code or other external code that doesn't care about the interpreter. during this time, it can drop the 
 gil, let another python thread do its thing. and wait on that c code to finish simultaneously. in our case, this is what happens 
 when we read and write files to disk. at the os level. it's possible to wait on 
 multiple files to read and write at the same time. and that's where the savings is happening here. however, for our transform 
 operations, we don't get so lucky. threading in python can still 
 be useful, mostly for i/o-bound things. but it can also be useful in say a gui application where you want to run a long-running calculation off the main thread to maintain responsiveness. however, in python, at least for the near future, we're not going to be able to use 
 threading to get maximum utilization out of our cpu. therefore, we turn to the third option, 
 multiprocessing, for our compute-bound tasks. in our case, it's going to work fantastically because all of our tasks are 
 completely independent of each other. processing one audio file has 
 no impact on processing any others. while you may eventually need to dive 
 down to the level of managing single processes, most of the time, you 
 don't need the process object. i'd say 90% of the time, 
 what you really want is a pool object. a pool object represents a process pool. you just tell it what tasks you want to execute. it takes care of creating 
 the processes, scheduling the tasks. and collecting the results, 
 all in a thread and process-safe way. you can control the maximum number 
 of processes that you want it to start like this. but if you just leave it 
 blank, it'll just use one per cpu. each process is its own python interpreter. in particular, they no 
 longer have to fight over the gil. they all own their own gil. we're using a with statement here to ensure that 
 all the processes coordinate and terminate gracefully. there are three basic methods that the pool offers. map, imap, and imap_unordered.  `imap_unordered` immediately returns an iterator. then asking for an actual element 
 of the iterator is what blocks. `imap_unordered` will return the 
 results to you in whatever order they finish in. so, if some tasks complete 
 quicker, you'll get those back faster. let's see how it goes. i don't know if you saw it, but we 
 did have a full spike to 100% cpu utilization. and the total time was only three and a half seconds. also, notice that because we used the unordered 
 version, our results did not come back in their original order. this is actually part of the reason that i 
 return the input file name as part of the result. if i'm getting things out of order, i 
 need to know which task this corresponded to. let's try again with the normal `imap`. once again, we had a brief period 
 where we had maximum utilization. and once again, it finished 
 in about three and a half seconds. this time, the results are guaranteed in order. that means that we may have waited a little bit. for example, 0 to finish even 
 though example 1 was already done. it just queued up for a bit. and then finally, there's `map`. `map` just blocks and waits there until 
 all the results are ready, returning them in a list. once again, it took about 3.5 seconds 
 total, and the results are guaranteed in order. now, that's more like it. just two lines of code, and 
 i get to fully utilize all of my cpus. then i can scale this operation to as 
 many tasks as i want, just by having more cores. with access to relatively cheap 
 core hours from online compute services, this can be a surprisingly scalable way to 
 process a lot more data without waiting a lot more time. okay, great! we've seen sort of the 
 best-case scenario using `pool.map` here. next, let's take a look at just a few of 
 the ways where everything can go wrong. let's just take a look at a few different scenarios. one, running normally on just a single cpu. and the other running multiprocessing 
 using the pool stuff that we just talked about. in the normal case, i'll just map the given 
 function `do_work` over the given set of items. and then convert it to a list. and in the multiprocessing case, we'll use `pool.map`. pitfall number 1 trying to use multiprocessing in a situation where the overhead of creating 
 processes and communicating between them is greater than the cost 
 of just doing the computation. suppose all we wanted was a 
 quick calculation, like multiplying by 10. let's see how the multiprocessing 
 and normal cases compare. using multiprocessing, it took 0.77 seconds. but just doing the computation outright on 
 a single cpu took less than 100th of a second. creating processes and communicating 
 between them can be very expensive. so keep that in mind and 
 only apply multiprocessing to things that are already taking a long time. pitfall number 2 trying to send or receive something 
 across process boundaries that's not picklable. threads share virtual memory. so a variable that you create in one 
 thread can be accessed in another thread. processes, on the other hand, have their 
 own address space and do not share virtual memory. without specifically using 
 something like shared memory, a process cannot access 
 variables from another process. the way multiprocessing gets around 
 this is by serializing everything using pickle. it then uses an inter-process 
 communication method like a pipe, to send bytes from one process to another. the takeaway is that you 
 can't send anything that isn't picklable. if you try, you'll get an error like this. in this case, this lambda function, 
 `lambda x: x + 1`, is not a picklable object. of course, the same 
 thing goes for the result objects. you can't return anything that's not picklable. pitfall number 3: trying to send too much data. remember, all the items that you're using 
 need to be serialized and sent between processes. if you have a lot of data, like numpy 
 arrays, then this can be a big slowdown. instead of passing the data from process to process, consider sending a message like a string that informs the other process  
how to create the data on its own. for instance, in our audio example, we didn't read the wave 
 files here and then send them over. instead, we just passed the file name 
 and had the separate process load the file itself. pitfall number 4 using multiprocessing when there's a 
 lot of shared computation between tasks. here's a basic fibonacci implementation. we want to compute the 
 first ten thousand fibonacci numbers. we go ahead and try our 
 experiment, and what do you know? doing it on eight cores was 
 actually faster than doing it on one. but of course, we've been tricked. it is a huge waste to be computing 
 these ten thousand fibonacci numbers independent of each other 
 since there's so much overlap. if we just changed our 
 implementation to reuse shared computation, then we could compute the first 
 ten thousand fibonacci numbers instantly. and pitfall number 5: 
 not optimizing the chunk size. `map`, `imap`, and `imap_unordered` 
 all take a chunk size parameter. instead of submitting each item as a separate 
 task for the pool, items are split into chunks. then, when a worker grabs more 
 work, it grabs an entire chunk of work. bigger chunks allow individual workers to have 
 to take less trips back to the pool to get more work. however, there's also a 
 trade-off because a bigger chunk means that you have to copy more 
 items at once across process boundaries. this could potentially cause you to run 
 out of memory if your chunk size is too large. if you're running out of memory, 
 consider setting a smaller chunk size. and also consider using `imap` 
 or `imap_unordered` instead of `map`. remember, `map` keeps 
 all of the answers in memory in a list. whereas, `imap` and `imap_unordered` can 
 give you results as they come in rather than storing all 
 of the results all at once. so, a larger chunk size tends 
 to be faster but uses more memory. and a smaller chunk 
 size uses less memory but is slower. so, if you really want to optimize the 
 performance as much as you reasonably can in python,   then don't forget to optimize 
 that chunk size parameter as well. and that's all i've got for today. thank you so much for watching. there will definitely be more 
 multiprocessing, threading, and async content coming. as always, thank you to my 
 patrons and donors for supporting me. if you enjoyed this intro to multiprocessing, please consider becoming a patron. and as always, slap that 
 like button an odd number of times. see you next time!
