ladies and gentlemen today started just like any other day for me i woke up i walked my dog i grabbed some coffee and i started scrolling on my phone and when i started scrolling on my phone i saw something that was very disturbing and i'm going to share it with you right now i pulled out my phone i was scrolling through youtube shorts and i saw this from hikaru oh we got past tino oro we get the uh the famed argentinian junior player a fastino oro is i believe nine years old it's about 2300 this is gonna make for a good game this is gonna make for a good good game for a youtube video i have to make sure i don't lose this game so otherwise levy's gonna steal the content let's go bishop g7 so hikaru was playing in title tuesday which is a tournament on chess.com and he was paired against faustino oro faustino oro is this wonder kid the messi of chess from argentina he's currently the youngest ever player to cross 2200 and 2300 and hikaru said he had to win that game in title tuesday because if he didn't levy would come in and steal the content now hikaru if you're watching this we don't have any beef let's just play it up for the audience they'll never know he did he did win the game but i'm still gonna steal the content i mean that's what i do i can't play chess at the level that hikaru can play it but boy oh boy can i talk about chess and you will enjoy watching it not if hikaru is still watching this maybe not you because you're better than me but you know for the other people my friends i have not one but two games for you today between faustino oro and hikaru look at the changes in their ratings one of these games was actually played in february 2023 and the second one that you just saw on your screen was played a little bit later so let's see how hikaru the current number two rated chess player in the world plays against a superstar chess player uh from argentina a young kid with a rating of 2700 and very very very high hopes in chess much higher than mine maybe not he maybe he will not have as many subscribers on youtube but he will definitely be a grand master uh if he keeps going um anyway yeah there's there's no drummer beef at least not from my side i was vegetarian for six months so uh now actually what's funny is both of these games start with a modern defense from hikaru this is all i'm gonna spoil uh but they go a little bit differently back in february uh faustino played uh like this he played bishop to e3 bishop e3 is a very committal move what i mean by that is uh you want to get your nights out before your bishops at most levels of chess i'm not coaching him i'm coaching you you really would rather move the knights out because you kinda know where they're going you don't know if the bishop is going here or here or here it could actually go to any of those squares depending on the setup so when you commit the bishop to e3 very quickly um things you know are you they're a little bit different now and now you're kind of forced into a structure also hikoro plays c6 so kikaru doesn't actually play bishop g7 he plays c6 which is an indication that he's he's trying to play a karo khan that's what he's trying to do and now white has a lot of different options personally i really like to play the fantasy setup with pawn to f3 uh knight c3 and then queen to d2 back in february hikaru chose excuse me faustino chose to play e5 uh e5 is uh the advanced setup uh what black will now do is play bishop g7 and either try to hammer away at this pawn or play h5 and just try to fight on the light squares uh and that is actually exactly what hikaru does he plays bishop g7 he waits for white's next move and now white plays f4 um f4 is a good move for gripping on the dark squares and kind of keeping black at bay it's a bad move if you're kind of trying to avoid a locked struggle because after h5 this is like hikaru's bread and butter i mean he has an absolutely dominant clamp on the light squares of the position uh he will now try to probably trade off white's light squared bishop then he will try to put his knights on the light squares and at some point he will break in the future this is a very close structure in close positions you are looking for peace maneuvers and you are looking for pawn brakes and to potentially win the battle on a certain color complex um so c5 is going to be very much in his wheelhouse hikaru plays bishop g4 he is completely unafraid of white playing a move like h3 um he probably sent that bishop in with the plan of dying and if he didn't send it in with the plan of dying then he's gonna back up and white is going to have some dark squared weaknesses but faustino does not play h3 he plays knight c3 hikaru plays knight h6 he's playing that h6 because he wants to play knight f5 faustino still is not attacking the bishop on g4 so hikaru plays e6 and knight f5 look at this setup i mean this is like wicked light squared stuff here everything is on a light square literally all hikaru's last like six moves all had to do with light squares h5 bishop g4 knight h6 e6 knight of every look at this and he might as well play a62 just for aesthetic purposes the bishop goes back to hikaru yet again makes a move that has to do with the light squares just developing on the light square complex very very interesting and now white plays this move h3 and there's a very common idea in this position remember the bishop was sent in with the plan of taking and now you want to avoid white expanding with something like g4 uh you want to clamp on the dark squares you want to use your fusion approach of light score control and dark square controlling hikaru plays this move h4 um does he have to play h4 no but he plays it in 0.3 seconds so he obviously knows what he's doing can he play like rook c8 and queen b6 and attack on this side of the board yes the computer also likes bishop f8 but reasons i don't fully understand i think it's because just anywhere here the bishop is dead but the bishop can come here here and then maybe even trade on h4 so hikaru plays h4 and then he plays this plan of bishop f8 i mean it's it's kind of nuts right like if if black shows lazily castles here he gets blown off the board this is just gonna be really bad king g2 rook h1 queen h3 queen h7 made just very bad stuff so that doesn't happen right he's not gonna castle he plays h4 bishop f8 bishop e7 it takes one of the best players in the world who has a grasp on the position like this to just understand i'm not in a rush like i i i don't it makes no difference to me like i i have a clamp on the position and the only pawn breaks that white has are g3 and c4 i've told you this is a closed position so you are looking at pawn breaks and peace trades like this only benefit black because white now has two very passive pieces he can't break out the knight is going to rotate or go the other direction uh not to mention why black could even do this and then play knight f8 knight e6 and just have a god night on that square so that would be really nice my friends i'm going to show you how this game continued in a second but first a

a guarantee all right let's get back to the video faustino plays rook d1 and hikaru is like look white is not threatening me so i'm gonna take some more space so that he cannot play b4a4 faustino now plays c4 he's had enough so he's trying to open up the position hikaru doesn't even hesitate he plays that move in two seconds two seconds you know why he took on c4 because the negative is that he's losing a central pawn the positive is that now he has knight b6 knight d5 knight b6 knight d5 look at this light squared clamp he has his knights just in the center of the board like this and that is exactly what hikaru expected to happen in this position on the fourth and fifth move of the game hikaru knew what was gonna happen 15 moves later he couldn't have possibly predicted his opponent's moves but he knew that that's a very natural path that the game could head to and he knew that when his opponent committed to the dark squares he would get the light squares in return and the computer still claims white has some advantage here but it's extremely difficult to find faustino plays knight c3 hikaru plays the move king f8 why does he play the move king f8 because black literally doesn't have to do anything black doesn't have to go here or here he's gonna play king f8 with the intention of maybe putting the king safely on g7 and again black is not rushing to castle because you don't really know that you want the rook over here you would like your king to end up there but the rook might actually be better defending this pawn so king 2 f8 played and now faustino rushes in he rushes in and hikaru cool calm collected trades the queens completely unafraid of the open file looks very scary rook c1 hikaru just plays bishop d8 it's a little ugly it's a little passive but every square is covered you just can't get in and now you are stuck in an end game against hikaru it's not quite as bad as being an endgame against magnus but it's bad bishop b6 and now only one person has a weakness only one person has a structural deficiency here and it's the person playing with white and now kikaru switches the plan for moving his king that way to move his moving his king to the center why is he now moving his king to the center two reasons he wants to connect the rooks and number two the king is better in the center in the end game the king is better over here when there's queens and pieces on the board it's rooks and pieces i mean white has control of the file but look at this hikaru comes in and white cannot take his eye off the pawn there's nothing he can do he has to stay guarding the pawn the way that white played this he took a lot of central space early he over committed his pawns but the idea of that was to restrain the black pieces and make sure that in the future he can cultivate some sort of attack he can you know he can do something kind of like emphatic in the position that that will offset any positional difficulties that he has but he hasn't done any of that and akikaru goes back to a fate throws out a4 he's got other ideas maybe he's going to bring the knight around to c6 he just doesn't want to get hit with a check the reason why hikaru played king f8 is that in the future he would maybe like to move his knight and the only way to do that would be to move the king and also maybe he can go over here and he's just waiting why does running out of moves king e2 a4 and hikaru plays a3 he's instigating he's instigating if you take him getting my rook in so you're probably not going to take but if you don't take i play rook c3 so you have to give up on the dark squares notice how kikaru is now winning the battle on the dark squares he is now targeting the pawn on the dark squares while creating a fully light spread approach i mean this is the way you have to beat prodigies get them in a close position get them into positions where they can become like an avalanche rolling downhill bishop back to d8 and the king is on the outskirts of the board knight h6 knight h6 is checkmate so faustino has to block hikaru's rook rook c8 the bishop goes back to a5 setting up attacks the goes back to b6 setting up an attack king g7 faustino grabs on h4 but hikaru swoops into c1 he's got this he's hunting the rook down he actually could have been i mean again according to the machine a little bit more accurate he could have taken on d4 here but he keeps up the pressure and listen i gotta tell you credit to faustino because uh he's keeping he's he's staying in the game i mean it's a rook and bishop end game black is definitely playing this for a win but faustino is fighting back it's really it's really not as bad as it looks rook before bishop d4 hikaru anchors the bishop on b2 and he's looking to potentially target but the rook is covering everything it's just gonna be whose nerves are gonna be stronger oh my goodness oh my goodness rook takes b3 though oh rook takes b3 what a move rook b3 you can't take cause the pawns thinks through but white is still okay it's not checkers white does not have to take g3 g5 hikaru a wrecking ball takes in on e5 king goes back to f8 to avoid any sort of pins rook b2 check and it takes 50 moves but hikaru grabs the pawn and now he's gonna run away with pawn to a2 and faustino resign because a1 queen i mean you go back a few moves faustino was still hanging on he was still in a more or less back and forth game with hikaru and a rook and bishop end game now make no mistake hikaru was calling the shots in this game the entire game like at no point was hikaru in danger but what are you gonna do this is the second best chess player in the world and this is the highest rated you know the the fat the the the most talented nine-year-old chess player to ever live basically uh we will see how he ages um and then they played this game this was the game played on june 20th uh and that was the game that of the of the youtube show that you just saw now this time hikaru just plays a pure modern periods type of thing uh he does not play d6 um and um he wants to maybe play here maybe wants to play here all right pawn to f4 and now we have b5 so knight f3 d6 and this time faustino does not get himself into any locked structure it's a very open game so very different type of game hikaru plays c5 early faustino could lock the position which is not the most accurate way but he does this bishop b7 and he he takes on c5 trying to get hikaru to take back so then he could go here and block out his bishop hikaru was like no way bishop takes c3 and now we have this position a very very very open board very different from last time now you'll also notice that this time faustino played very slowly uh last time he played very fast he actually was not down a minute for most of the game bishop is open bishop is open bishop is open center is much more open this game it's just very interesting to see how hikaru handles uh the prodigy that is uh that that is faustino um knight to f6 queen e2 he brings the rook hikaru gives a check and they both bring their rooks what a position i mean we we are just like ready for an explosion here at any moment the board is just gonna blow up someone's gonna play a central pawn move it's very very tense faustino plays f5 that is a declaration of hostilities now it's very important hikaru reacts the right way if you take this white opens up the e file and the g file could be a little bit weak and unpleasant however there is also the bishop and the queen which are laser beaming down to the to the white king i mean it is a very very tense position hikaru plays e5 e5 locks the center it also kind of puts a very unpleasant question to the white position do you take on passan or not if you try to continue an attack over here and you try to sacrifice and open things up that's one thing uh but if you play knight g5 i i don't really have to go here um i might even kick you out with my bishop and then i'm gonna strike back in the center the most principled way in chess to deal with an attack on the side of the board is to attack somebody down the center line just the way it works because the bishop hits air there is nothing here you're not going to put a rook there or a queen or a king right so it's a very difficult decision hikaru is trying to lock the center and then fire away with d5 the reason why he can't go d5 right away is because white will play e5 and then white will play e6 and then black will lose so you can't do that so e5 and now faustino spend some time and he plays fe ar if i spent some time i mean he spends like two seconds fe6 the problem is that while this opened up a lot of possibilities for white it opened up only one possibility for black and it's a very significant one essentially hikaru said i will trade you activity of a knight and a rook for my pieces to target your pawn but the problem is that this is a pawn hikaru is threatening something tangible in faustino's position and that's that's a problem so queen f2 very nice move by faustino if this queen f7 but hikaru just rook d7 very smart i mean that's why he's one of the best in the world this is now defended and that's not going anywhere this has three things attacking it and two things defending it and i'm i mean you can play defense but in playing defense you give hikaru more targets he now opens up the bishop he now opens up the the the knight on the queen and hikaru plays a very very nice idea here it has absolutely nothing to do with the center pawn it's not that it's not that it's this and of course he spots it of course he spots it bishop takes d4 c takes d4 and pawn to b4 and this move is a nice bit of counter play by faustino but it's just not good enough because this bishop is trapped forever it's not a matter of time i can take this anytime i want so hikaru just plays d5 gets in the way of the attack trades down and picks up the bishop and when it's all said and done one man has an extra knight and that man is also the number two ranked chess player in the world which is you know a really bad odd situation in this position faustino had to play queen f2 he needed to be able to respond to this move with queen takes d4 so that b4 is not possible uh and how do you played queen f2 i don't know what hikaru would have played next i mean he would have maybe gone back he would have tried to keep the tension the opening of the position was beneficial to hikaru but unfortunately and and by the way you you never know i mean i'm assuming this was a blunder that he missed take take b4 but uh you've maybe it was a mouse slip um but uh hikaru takes on d4 and and now the rest is relatively straightforward he takes the bishop and he he does have a piece for two pawns but offers the queen trade immediately white says let's trade but on my terms hikaru brings the knight back to attack the rook and now very simply just takes the pawn on d5 and hikaru is being very stubborn he's still not taking the queen now he does and now it's very clean you get the rook down to the second rank white tries to counter attack you take you get the pawn in the center you're up at night for free you're going to put your rook down get the rook behind the pawn and activate the knight and that is exactly what hikaru is about to do rook is behind the pawn he gets the pawn he makes sure that he can move the knight away because of the pin and faustino resigns because it was just a matter of time um gonna move over here with my pieces and i'm gonna win your pawn rook and knight versus rook is a draw but rook knight and one extra pawn is definitely not because that pawn can become a queen so 2-0 for hikaru versus the young prodigy uh that is how it goes sometimes but uh i believe in faustino in that first game it was it was very tense it was very close and uh i mean i would hardly say that uh you know this is some resounding sign of um of of negative things to come in in the young man's career and well this game just shows that if you get into a shootout if you get into a tactical slugfest with hikaru it's so crazy how how quickly he can make you pay hikaru is like an adesanya israel ada sonia in the ufc the second you throw a punch i mean he hits back twice as fast and three times best powerful right i mean it's just instant you make one inaccuracy the game's over just wanna you have to be perfect for 99 of the game and um the other game which was a bit more close than maneuvering fast you know faustino did a great job i mean listen this first game was very close very very close but the better player one the more experienced player the better player one and in this game hikaru was just unstoppable played at 95 accuracy he didn't lose but gotham is still gonna make a video about it my friends i hope you enjoyed this little deep dive into their two games i look forward to covering more of them in the future maybe magnus is going to get against this game against faustino uh if you're watching from argentina let me know in the comments the argentinian fans for chess and any sport are just sensational so uh i believe they yell muchachos which here on faustino which here on hikaru and um yeah that's all for today i will see you in the next video get out of here
