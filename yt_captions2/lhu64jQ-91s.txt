ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the qatar masters 2023 this is an open chess tournament with some of the best talent in the world specifically magnus carlson and hikaru nakamura are both over there on the other side of the planet playing some chess with a lot of other indian stars and stars from all over the world this is the round three recap as i already said and in round two we had a little bit of a historic day a dramatic day magnus carlson suffering his lowest rated defeat in classical chess in nearly 20 years if if not more and after the game magnus put out a tweet uh on social media where he talked about the fact that his opponent was wearing a watch and he brought this up to the chief arbiter which should be against the rules to have any sort of device whether it's a smart device or an analog device uh and the chief arbiter assured him that it was okay to have a watch and there was another question brought up of anti-che measures i'm going to show you a lot of the games today but let me just quickly address this point because i do think it is important now in round three they changed the fair play measures now there is a 15-minute broadcast delay the moves that are being made in qar are on a 15-minute delay spectators are probably not being allowed as much into the playing hall with smartphones there are photos that were out of a player uh of a of a spectator standing near chessboards with a smartphone just like taking photos that's a potential fair play thing and now people can't bring in watches so it's a shame it takes such a uproar and such a post from the world champion given the fact that we know what happened in 2022 uh for any changes to be made now my friends just give me a minute or two this is important i want to address this issue uh with a lot of you and with the broader chess community and anybody that might be watching yesterday after magnus put that tweet out obviously it gave me canon fodder to put out a very good recap with a very click baity title so i did that and obviously so did hikaro we're both putting out recaps and magnus actually went after hearo this is not something that i uh expected because magnus generally doesn't break the fourth wall of content like he lets his games speak for themselves he lets his results speak for themselves and magnus put out the twet um just to be clear i'm not accusing my opponent of today of cheating constantly using my name for clicks is fine yes i'm in the clear my career is uh safe but this is just lame do better and whether it was hikaro or the editing team the title that was put out is magnus loses and then accuses with question marks and exclamation points and for the record this was mine i said new chess cheating scandal with a lot of question marks and so on and so forth right both clickbait right uh and actually when i first saw that i was like oh my god he's going to go after me too and if you look down on that thread uh people were also criticizing me justifiably so i am fully aware of when i put out that title that people wouldn't be happy um i'm not going to get into like which title i think is worse like you could try to make the argument that well i just said new cheating scandal with a lot of question marks and it was vague and you have to click into the video to actually get the fact that he didn't accuse him and he probably also completely addressed that the title was just not so great he has you know uh a layer there because obviously he probably has some editing team i might need to be more responsible because maybe i'll get some more views on my recap also there was an ad integration there for full transparency i didn't have any sort of like view guarantee like i had to hit a threshold of views and that's why i click baited i had a flat fee for that ad integration i was just laid on a deadline i was going to put that out yesterday no matter what regardless he put that tweet out about hiar okay and i think it's good for me to address the clickbait just once i like to do this every couple of months um i clickbait 100% but i don't lie and i don't cross a line of ethics i don't cross a line of truth and falsehoods just to get views chess is a difficult game to constantly package every single day over the course of four years into a 30-minute video and so when i name things exactly what they are in the recap they do do worse in fact yesterday uh after i put out this video with this title this is how it performed for the first 23 hours up until right now it's the best performing video that i have in probably about 20 days that clickthrough rate is way higher than average my average is about 7 and a half% and it was 133% for about you know 12 to 14 hours after putting it out it's a very good performing video it's performing very very well and that's what the purpose of a youtuber really is to a point my job is to make sure as many eyeballs are on the chess world as possible and if that is through a dramatic thumbnail and a dramatic title that does not cross a certain line i'm not just blatantly slandering or defaming anybody and it's just catching your attention so you click it i reveal the truth to you in the first minute or two i tell you exactly as it is and i don't think for me i am crossing that line at all maybe once or twice out of like 1, 1500 videos i should have just not named a video a certain way but i don't know what i would have named a video yesterday i don't know that's the reality and i thought that i despite some of my clickbait thumbnails and my clickbait titles i am always delivering you a good 25 to 30 minute product that you can watch while eating watching your smart uh on your smart tv while you sit in your living room and just enjoy and just have a good time like you're going to have a good time you're going to enjoy watching my video if you can get past some of the all caps because i changed the title of yesterday's video for about 30 minutes and it was getting 300 views every minute less i'm sorry guys that's a lot of views and this is my job the amount of views i get will completely dictate how many people have eyes on the chess world how many people are going to be playing chess on a day-to-day basis of course my ad revenue and all that stuff but at the end of the day this is my job like this is what i have to do if you ask me can will your do you prefer your videos average 400k or 800k i'm gonna say 800k as long as i'm not you know doing something completely egregious and alienating a massive population i don't think that i'm doing that i am pissing some of you off unquestionably i'm completely aware of that but i also have the largest chess channel like the strategy has obviously worked i've definitely made several several hundreds if not thousands of you kind of upset and the content has changed since like 2020 but i think i'm the same dude the packaging of the content is just you know changing a little bit anyway uh that's how uh this video uh is starting it's getting off the ground um and uh now i think we should get into the games cool terrific um magnus carlson is playing an international master from india uh and uh another person from india that does not have a profile on chess like there are so many good players from india in this field that don't even have i me it's just incredible e4 e5 and his opponent plays a petro defense mag magnus takes gets his knight kicked out and now in this position there are two main lines which are pawn to d4 uh and knight to c3 but magnus plays d3 kicking out the knight and then d4 so that's kind of interesting like he spends two tempe on this and you would expect that at this point black would just play d5 and they would play a completely symmetrical position which i think is what normal people would would would but not normal people i just think it's a very normal approach and then you know you develop the bishops you develop the pawn the knight like whatever it might be uh no his opponent just goes for a very confrontational setup so pawn to g6 wow look at that pawn to g6 is epic stuff um and uh the bishop's coming here the king is going to castle we're going to have very interesting and imbalance game magnus develops and both sides castle and now magnus plays h3 preventing the light squared bishop from going to the g4 square black thinks for a while he can obviously do things with his queen side he can play b6 6 c5 uh rook e8 knight c6 developing the bishop now would be silly because if you put it on the f5 square this is just a very bad structural damage for black uh and if you put it on the e6 square it's just going to be a target not right away but i mean just like you just gave me something to attack so black goes b6 spends a little bit of time and plays this move pawn to b6 it's a little bit too early in the game to actually be making long-term commitments uh to be to be spending such a long time thinking about long-term commitments rather which which is why black spends just a couple of minutes and a magnus plays c4 a very common move in the petro because your pawn needs a little bit of help and then you're going to put your knight exactly that black developing his rook and magnus developing his bishop and black developing his knight all right we've played 12 moves um this is like exactly how beginners should play chess i'm not saying these guys are playing like beginners okay and hopefully nobody is wearing a watch um they've developed their pieces both guys have gotten their pieces out and i think white enjoys a very slight advantage because he has a little bit more central pawn uh space and black's pieces are just a little bit passive they're controlling the center from a distance but if magnus was black here you would probably assume he's going to find a way and if magnus is playing white which he is you're going to assume he's going to find a way so he plays rook to e1 and now black plays h6 and there's a reason black spent 15 minutes on that one pawn move it's very difficult to decide what to do here first of all black has forcing methods like knight to e4 knight to e4 simply fails because of take take uh and bishop to g5 which attacks the queen if black goes for tactics you can take the queen you get your queen taken but then you win the rook um so you can't really force with the knight you could go here but then you got to calculate a whole lot uh and then if you don't do that you know maybe you play rook e7 and queen e8 or something like that uh you can also play knight f8 and maybe reroute the knights there's a lot of choices and he decides to kind of play a very non-committal move magnus now seals the center shut all right it's very demoralizing when you think for 15 minutes and the goat thinks for like two and a half he just plays d5 the idea is very straightforward black now has to go here and black has to go here by playing d5 and making a very committal decision in the center sealing away black's control of the center he is leaving magnus's leaving his opponent with a very difficult decision to make he's going to have to put his knight on c5 he's going to have to play c6 that might be the only way that black can do anything in this position knight to c5 bishop to c2 pawn to c6 there it is and now it's just about clamping black down so magnus plays this very nice move queen to d2 and he's going to play rook here and just not allow black to move but black strikes back takes takes knight e4 immediately taking advantage of white's queen position obviously magnus knew that that was going to happen so he plays takes takes and i think you might have missed something my friends queen d2 doesn't just want to bring the rook there is actually an attack on a far away pawn a pawn that black moved himself out of of inertia right so black kind of did that out of inertia didn't really know what to do in the i mean definitely didn't know what to do i'm just saying uh and now magnus gives away his bishop but takes on h6 now another thing is the rooks see each other and the queen is overloaded the queen is defending the bishop and this pawn so at an elementary level you look at this and you go oh this is so stupid by but you know because just bishop takes d5 uh all of that happened all of that happened and it looks like why does just check mating black it is it is true i mean this is m like there is a mid coming but not if black goes here it's actually shocking white has no attack queen h7 there is nothing you can't mate and if you try to sneak out and play here i just go back i just i just go straight back to where i was so it looks like after knight g5 that black should just be losing but he's not so all of that happens knight takes c4 and magnus chops everything down and goes all right now i got to win this game right how is magnus going to work the endgame magic right this is this is magnus's best phase of the game this is a queen end game it's like a you could argue it's a middle game because there's so much heavy artillery on the board but it's it it's more of an end game it's more of an end game it's a bit more of a tactical end game because there's queens on right there's checkmating threats the top computer move here is knight h2 with the intention of playing knight g4 but you know magnus uh doesn't really believe in a move like this and instead plays knight d4 which probably is more human but stock hates it uh black plays queen f6 and magnus just retreats he retreats and this is like when you reset the offense in a team sport like basketball when you can't get a shot off you have like 7 seconds before the shot clock expires you come back you say all right let's reset this position and um let's go rook c8 all right rook c8 pawn to a3 now another question you may ask why did black not take the pawn great question bishop gets trapped bishop gets trapped slowly because i can't take cuz i would lose my knight but let's say black played something like a5 uh then i would play rook a1 and uh that would be the end so that would be nice but unfortunately that's not what happens how is magnus going to win this position first he brings the rook right white needs to take a bit of a dark squared approach because the light squares are being controlled by this piece but magnus also has a little bit of pressure on that pawn so knight undevelop itself and plants itself in front of the king and at some point magnus is going to have to go forward he's got no other way so he plays b3 kicking out the bishop kicks it out again and brings back the knight and magnus just plays like he's just he's just playing you got to make moves you can't just be like well it's equal look it's equal the game's over no you got to make moves so black goes bishop b6 magnus goes after the bishop now black plays a5 mirroring these pawns keeping these pawns on light squares for the future right so something like that you know uh and again at this point it's also it's important to keep in mind like what both sides want who wants a queen trade who wants what trade checked by black magnus kicks the queen out and just he's just slowly methodically improving his position and now he goes for it pawn to g4 restricting the light squared bishop and potentially an attack on this side of the board now at this point black needs to keep the tension instead with four minutes on the clock black goes for a rook trade i'm i'm allergic to rook trades take take black probably thought rooks are off now we're in a real end game queen and bishop versus queen and knight less pieces on the board lower losing chances but the losing chances are there because look at this pressure knight e5 pawn to g5 it's all there it's all there now bishop c6 1 minute and 50 seconds on the clock magnus's biggest advantage of the game securing control of the dark squares and now queen d6 now you may be wondering why he blocked this like why black did this um because paon to d4 is a dynamite strike and uh the queen cannot get back so g5 actually enables that because the queen has to take its eye off the knight so instead of bishop c6 black could have played a lot of things bishop c8 queen d6 but he does it this way and magnus takes a pawn and black now has to be extremely accurate king to f1 is played black plays king to g8 making sure that is not a check magnus grabs the second pawn and actually black is still doing pretty well he i mean pretty well like he's not completely lost he can play something like queen e7 and queen d7 and try to get in and try to hit the pawn but i think psychologically you're under a lot of pressure here and magnus finds a very nice idea you thought you were forking him but it turns out magnus does not care he can lose one of those pawns with check that other pawn is hanging but after check and just king e1 there are no no more checks i told you white takes a dark squared strategy black plays uh white plays knight d7 there are checkmates as long as the queen can somehow get into the back rank also knight to f6 is absolutely lethal black now has to play queen d1 and in this position has to disallow white from marching a king he has to like play like bishop i don't know i don't even know but instead of that knight f6 check and unfortunately it is just a force checkmate magnus finds checkmate in like eight moves here with knight f6 double check sneaking to the back uh to to to to right here to force the king back and now after king to h7 it's knight f6 and the queen gets in so endgame magic this is exactly how magnus beats like 99% of players on the planet stockfish shows a completely equal endgame uh with just some stuff to play for and magnus is back a nice win two out of three playing against these anonymous indian title players who are very very strong uh and uh you know hopefully the drama of the tournament is behind us but uh um there you go now let's take a look at the leaders hikaru is not in today's recap not because of any youtube titles because he drew uh hearu played against strong usc grandmaster and uh it was a good hardfought game it was a draw we're actually going to cover the game of alisher sanov the grandm that defeated magnus yesterday and caused this little kur fuffle if you will he was playing against narayanan who is a an indian grandmas shocking and then there's going to be another indian grandm are covered in argi and i will tell you who leads the event five people are uh on three points out of three knight f3 knight f6 this was a groomfield esque cd knight d5 h4 very aggressive opening choice from s on the rhon and alisher invites him in for t g3 puts the bishop on g4 to hit the pawn and the pawn just goes all the way to h6 this is pretty ridiculous but this is chess in 2023 takes takes and alisher gives away his bishops damaging white's pawn structure but leaving white with the bishop pair leaving white with the sniper from the corner leaving white with the open b file and to me i would play this position all the time with white but black castes long and according to the computer it is completely fine so clearly black knows what he's doing he's got very good preparation i would still like pay a couple hundred bucks to get this position if i could start every game with this position i would be very happy look at this he's got the open b file active operations but black is defending himself and black is going to go e5 next then e4 and put the rooks and white can't castle white's king really has no home here maybe he's going to go to g2 or something let's see what happens d3 trying to bring out the bishop now here alisher surprises me i i i don't really know why he went queen f6 i mean i i felt it was very natural to go here i think he just didn't want to allow the bishop to g5 but the computer is totally unafraid queen f6 and now a4 just look at how natural white's position looks and feels alisher is about to go three out of three i mean look at this he's playing g5 he's counterattacking f4 he's going to lock in e5 with a big attack knight d5 all white has is this and you can't even play a5 so i don't really know how you're going to attack bishop b2 and now again alisher surprises me he doesn't play e5 he plays a5 which is a massive commitment a5 is a massive commitment essentially he no longer allows a5 but this knight is destabilized now now white can go after that knight there was no need to allow this in my opinion but i'm also sitting here on the other side of the world commentating the game i'm not playing it and immediately white does exactly that so alisher plays rook to d5 preventing bishop c5 which would hit that knight that you just weakened d4 is now played to allow bishop c5 e5 is played to undermine the d4 pawn which allows bishop c5 but bishop c5 is still played so what what gives why would would you allow your opponent to get any of this and guess what he continues to barrel down that side of the board one move changes the whole game by alisher a5 and now sl narayanan known online as indian lad that is his username is infiltrating and he's got a completely winning position the bishop snuck through jumped the fence at the concert even though they were at capacity and look at this look at this absolute unit of a bishop the barrel down here c5 is devastating because you can't take it cuz i checkmate you queen c7 and now on move 25 dude castles dude just castles cuz his king is safe and his rook is coming alish sure plays f4 i mean he is busted up here but he's not giving up rook e one he takes takes and plays rook f8 he still got a lot of active pieces and even though the advantage is with white suddenly knight c6 you can't take cuz you're pinned and the knight has arrived in the center oh my goodness apparently instead of that it was better for black to just play like like rook e8 first but he goes here rook takes now knight takes on f3 it it's essentially a race for whose king is going to die first pawn to g4 queen goes to e3 rook e8 and you know what's going to happen my friends black is going to lose defenders black unfortunately has no anchor for this knight the knight has to get out and it's just too late rook g7 that hero is that pawn on move 35 that pawn that you moved so early in the game the pawn that black allowed into the position 30 moves later becomes a hero rook to g7 and it's just a matter of getting all and that's it i mean that that h pawn is now a killer and white still has a very po powerful attack he just goes straight for the end game because you just cannot stop this and uh my friends sl nanan stops the magnus slayer and uh he has three points out of three he is on a perfect score another game vugar rasa from aeran versus arjun arayi excellent player e4 c5 knight f3 e6 this one a tyon of sicilian with queen c7 one of the most aggressive openings in chess you're about to find out why f4 both sides firing cannons at each other b5 and all of this pressure over here meanwhile white is going to line up the bishops and try to checkmate black b5 a3 preventing that and erigi strikes first you see if ery waited at all oh my neck is so stiff if ery waited at all if every guys he played like rook c8 this is devastating the sicilian defense is a game of one tempo and e5 is coming but now b4 and rather than take with the knight and go for the bishop eri takes with the rook and the rook puts pressure on all of this and this buar rasa plays knight b3 and eric gy knowing that the attack is coming plays a5 a move dealing with this on the opposite side of the board if white plays e5 there's not enough there and a4 is coming and i'm ready to win everything so now vugar has to remove the rook from the center to go to a1 rook b8 queen f3 still looking for his chance brings the bishop out of the center of the board ari maneuvers the bishop in front of the king now black's king is very very safe we might have a repetition but aragi says no e5 multiple ideas of this move first of all e6 is freed up it's freed up for a knight it is freed up for a bishop it is freed up for this bishop coming to g4 you also have more of an anchor in the center the bishop goes back now arigi a4 look at this expert bishop here pawn here pawn here playing on all three sides of the board opening up the center transferring in the night black has two rooks barreling down the b file white set up for an attack but the attack never got started bishop h6 is losing the bishop but he's getting in but i got news for you this is just not good enough and black's brick wall here is too powerful in front of his king bishop c6 a nice move queen defends the king knight c4 we kick out the queen and we continue firing and black is going to win this game over here if black is able to secure the king side and actually win on the queen side that is exactly how a sicilian defense is supposed to go bishop back to a8 knight goes to e6 and the rook takes on b2 knight takes a4 d5 this is the move this is a beautiful portrait of a sicilian defense pieces scattered on all four corners of the board some infiltrating some stacking on the file but d5 is game over because the rook is hit the bishop is hit there is absolutely ely nothing rook d3 rook takes d8 the rook is just hanging by the way but it doesn't matter because pawn to c3 what a move defended by the bishop from a distance and white resigned he resigned because the pawn is a move away from queening white now has to play defense and it doesn't matter that black doesn't have a rook he has two bishops and that is more than enough queen e4 bishop takes bishop takes c2 and you are completely winning arjin arigi also a very nice sicilian win also on three out of three and the last game that i want to show you is actually from your favorite streamer international master eric rosen good friend of mine playing against josiah steerman one of the young talented international masters in the united states will be a grand master in the future mark my words and it's ridiculous this dude does not have a profile i literally made this recap of this game so that chess.com would give josiah steeran a profile photo please this dude has like 50 photos of him online he plays so many tournaments anyway i i'm he played like us junior come on guys anyway eric rosen goes for a grand prix attack against the sicilian defense many of you probably play this opening i i used to play the grand prix when i was like 1700 but you know it's not a bad opening knight f3 and now bishop to c4 and there's this really goofy line here where you know normally if you're going to do this you want to play d3 to support your center those of you that play the vienna might recognize the setup this is not the vienna because played the sicilian i know you think everything is the vienna cuz like you know you learned the vienna from me now you're like vienna no that's a vehicle no that's not the same thing pawn to d4 and there's this very sharp line eric plays a gambit here with takes knight b5 uh which is trying to win this pawn back in a very exotic way and we get an isolated pawn position knight takes d4 castles pawn to c3 all right very solid opening eric playing against an isolated pawn here good central blockade maybe maybe he'll put his bishop here and here and then he's going to build up his queen and rooks josiah plays rook e8 eric plays bishop e3 probably anticipating this move and probably anticipating this move i wouldn't have given up the bishop though i would have went here uh and then when black develops you can play rook e1 or then bishop f2 and i just think like the bishop is okay but i find that pawn to be quite weak you know rookie one uh but eric said no imbalance i will give away my bishop and now i'm going to kick your rook out and then i'm going to bring my rook rook e four rook e one um f5 here is actually an interesting attacking idea just giving up the pawn completely and then you can just like play king h1 activate your rook but i that's not really human eric now plays rook e one and this game gets really spicy knight takes d4 knight takes d4 very nice idea here from josiah he does not want the bishop pair right now he gives away the bishop pair to reeal the center the isolated pawn could be weak for example if black plays like just a pass back move uh moving the knight that pawn could be weak in the future so he goes here giving up the bishop that's protecting his king because now the center is sealed and you're not going to pressure this queen to b6 and here eric instead of playing it calm instead of being solid decides to get on a roller coaster and plays bishop takes d5 rook takes d4 is just a pure fork it's just a fork there's no way to get out of this but there is rook e a check and queen c3 pinning the rook to the king this man josiah thans for a bit plays king to h6 this man walked to h6 he said your bishop is still hanging and i got news for you it's not just your bishop if you move your bishop discover check and and i win your queen or your rook so eric only defensive move king to h1 but he loses his bishop now eric has an option to take this bishop but after takes takes black would probably go back with the king and try to hunt these pawns try to win that end game so eric plays f5 whoa trying to play f6 and you can't take because you would lose your rook and if you play rook takes f5 then after rook takes f5 you have to take with the g pawn and this is not any good because rook g8 and there are mates i mean there are mates looming all right you got to be really really really careful here with black but now josiah queen d4 the best response and now eric has to give a check and then take the bishop or take the bishop instead of that he gives this check and the king is safe the king is safe safe and unfortunately eric kind of gases out here plays queen a3 looking for queen 2 f8 but black just blocks a very sharp and exciting game where josiah had to buckle up for a crazy ride and even though eric infiltrated on that eighth rank it's just a matter of time the king goes back to h6 and guess what it's not white who is getting checkmated it's black it is not black who is getting checkmated it is white that is mate you can take my rook leaving it there josiah rips out on the g file and in this position eric resigned because rook takes g2 is just a checkmate arriving in a few moves a very very fun game eric went for it against the very talented josiah steerman nearly 2500 elo uh and uh i think he has two grandmaster norms and i uh i i i am wishing him nothing but the best uh for his title chase qatar masters round three in the books five-way tie for first place magnus carlson back on two out of three hopefully no more drama no more memes and nobody getting called out on social media because we all know there is nothing scarier than somebody tweeting about you get out of here
