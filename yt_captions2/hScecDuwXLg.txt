your new phone didn't come with a charger so you run out and buy one from some other brand that says it supports fast charging but did you know there's a good chance that it won't work properly because the folks that make our phones tablets and laptops haven't agreed on one fast charging standard your device might charge more slowly than it ought to so today we're going to tell you how to make sure you've got the right charger and cord iphone and google pixel owners will want to pay attention to this first one usb power delivery or usb pd for short as the name implies usb pd is actually part of the official usb specification and some manufacturers have kept things simple by just using usb pd instead of some kind of proprietary fast charging scheme but that doesn't mean that all phones use usb pd the same way for example the iphone 12 pro max can pull about 22 watts while charging but the 13 pro max pulls about 27 more watts means faster charging so check your phone's peak wattage then buy a charger that provides at least that much power just make sure that it's usb pd certified or you might not get the extra speed the good news here though is that any certified charger providing enough wattage should work so you don't have to buy an official one from apple or google and instead can score yourself a sweet deal on a third-party charger oh and don't forget about the cable itself a modern made to spec usbc to usbc cable should carry at least 60 watts but again double check to ensure it actually meets that usb pd standard usb pd also supports up to 100 watts for larger devices like laptops and a 240 watt variant is on the way soon so it's a great one charger to rule them all solution if you have compatible devices across different brands qualcomm's quick charge is the next fast charging standard we're going to talk about and despite the fact that the san diego chargers no longer play at qualcomm stadium in a brutal twist of irony quick charge is still a very widespread protocol used in phones from samsung razer asus sony nokia and lg if you're still rocking one of those collectibles but just how good is quick charge we're going to tell you right after we thank govi for sponsoring today's video govi's immersion kit combines their led tv backlights with two smart light bars for full reactive ambient lightings its color sense camera intelligently recognizes and captures the colors on your tv and automatically applies them to your backlights and it offers multiple control options including google assistant and amazon alexa support click the link in the video description and grab your govi immersion kit today so quick charge is a bit faster than usb pd but it is proprietary still versions 4 and newer are compatible with usb pd though you won't get as much speed if you use a quick charge 4 4 plus or 5 phone with a usb pd only charger due to the extra secret sauce from qualcomm however you shouldn't need a super special cable as even the newest versions of quick charge are supposed to work with a regular 3 amp usbc cable qualcomm has promised that you can get a 50 charge on your phone in only 5 minutes with quick charge 5. and although that will obviously depend on battery size it's really impressive especially since quick charge has a reputation for running a little cooler than some of its competitors but what if you want to go even faster one of the quickest standards out there right now is warp charge from oneplus formerly known as dash charge now there's no chance that you'll find it on a non-oneplus device as it's a strictly proprietary standard and you will need a compatible charger as well as a special cord but the upside to all this special equipment is that warp charge is fast it gives the flagship oneplus 9 pro and its 4500 milliamp hour battery a full charge from zero in just about half an hour and if that's not fast enough oneplus's parent company oppo has another charging standard called supervooc though there's no word on when that might be available outside of china of course we'd be remiss though if we didn't also mention samsung and motorola's in-house solutions samsungs are called adaptive fast charging and the newer super fast charging and are only for galaxy devices the former max is out at' watts and the latter is at 45 watts so it's quick but with the way it's currently implemented it's not going to give the full 60 plus watts that usb pd would even though super fast charging is compatible with the usb pd standard if you want the highest speed super fast charging has to offer you'll need a certified charger and a cable as it uses a relatively high 5 amps of current on the motorola side they use a solution called turbo power while it's not as fast as some of the other standards we've mentioned the good news is that it's actually a variant of quick charge 3.0 for low wattage turbo power devices any adapter that supports quick charge 3.0 should give you full performance though if you're using the higher wattage versions make sure you've got a charger that supports quick charge four plus or higher hopefully now you'll have a better idea of what you'll need to keep your phone powered up in a pinch or you can just disregard everything i said and stop forgetting to plug it in before you go to sleep because then you wouldn't need to quick charge
