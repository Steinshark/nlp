gear and film making go hand inand like elon musk in controversies go yourself and the one thing that you can usually count on when it comes to film gear is that it's going to be ridiculously overpriced like how these tiny pieces of rubber for mounting lav mics somehow cost $75 each the manufacturers seem to know that we'll pay almost anything to solve our creative challenges but luckily there are some incredibly useful pieces of gear out there that were never marketed specifically to the film industry and so they've escaped the insane markups that filmmakers are used to seeing so in this video i'm going to go into eight everyday items that pro filmmakers love to keep in their kit that cost less than 20 bucks and will make your life on set so much easier i'm going to start off with a little story here just to give you some context for my love of finding unorthodox solutions to unexpected film making challenges 3 or four years ago i was hired by vice rip vice to fly to the great rift valley in kenya to film a documentary about bats and the role they might play in future pandemics apart from the fact that i love working in dark 10 m underground caves and it was incredibly hot trying to shoot with a 20 lb cinema rig while wearing a hazmat suit it was a pretty cool job everything was going smoothly until on day four of the shoot the director asked me to find a way to rig up a snor cam po shot on the lead bat scientist for kind of a unique perspective on what it was like to move through a cave and if you don't know what i'm talking about here a snor cam is that fixed camera angle pointing back at the character that requim for a dream use so well that was a great idea and i really wanted to make it happen but the problem was we didn't actually have a snor cam which is normally done with like this pretty chunky vest rig thing and we were in the middle of nowhere so there was nothing to rent so i got on youtube and i started looking for diy solutions to see if any of them were possible with the gear i had with me long story short i figured out that if i combine two belts some paracord and a really cheap travel tripod i could actually get a really decent poor man snor cam shot i think the shot turned out great and it did make it into the final edit but for me me the real satisfaction came from working out the answer to the problem in the field it's just a lot of fun and that's a great segue into the first everyday item that you'd be silly not to keep in your film making kit paracord if you need to attach something to something else there's really no better bang for the buck option out there than paracord you can lash down a tripod to a bag you can rig a safety line for a car mount or a light you can tie down diffusion fabrics or wrap it around a bad scientist waist to hold a snor can in place just learn how to tie two knots a bowan which gives you a strong loop and then a hitch knot which lets you lash things in place and you can do pretty much anything with paracord there's definitely fancier more specialized knots out there that professional grips use but with just those two you can solve like 90% of rigging problems you can get 30 m or like 100 ft of paracord for well under $20 and pretty much every army surplus store in the world will carry it if you don't like amazon and it weighs pretty much nothing so just drop it in the bottom of one of your bags and it's amazing how how often you'll find yourself cutting off little sections to help you out of a jam now a little more recently on a shoot in arizona in the desert near the mexican border i had to do a really long off- grid hike with a search and rescue group and weight was a huge issue like if you've ever tried to walk for even an hour holding a camera in your hand by the top handle you'll know just how tiring that can get but i did want to shoot at a really high quality so there was only so much i could do to strip my fx9 back without compromising the functionality but even though i got it pretty light i still needed to get the weight out of my hands if i was going to keep up with the rest of the group i had a pretty lightweight camera strap actually it was an old rock climbing strap but even that has to kind of go around your neck and shoulder and no matter how many ways i've tried straps always seem to chafe like right here at the end of a long day so i knew i wanted to get the rig attached in another way and having done this a bunch of times before i knew the best place to anchor it was right here to the shoulder strap of my bag hanging the weight from here takes all the pressure off your neck but still the problem is if it's tied there you can't get the camera off the shoulder strap so you don't have full freedom of movement and as useful as those two knots i just mentioned are they're too slow to untie so i had to bring in the next cheap item from our list carabiners you know what these things are they're for rock climbing but they're so so so helpful for running gun filmmakers too especially when you team them up with our old buddy paracord from lashing bags onto the roofs of vehicles or hanging lights in trees or food bags in bare country for that matter uh to replacing my camera strap like i did in the desert i use these things in too many different ways to list here but literally every backpack i own has at least one of them hanging off they're super cheap and if you spend a little more and get the good ones that are actually rated for climbing you can hang insane amounts of weight off them without worrying okay so carabiners and paracord are great but what about when you need to attach things to your camera rig like you can't exactly lash a lav mic to the back of your battery or dangle a time code box off a carabiner for a monitor or something big maybe you'd use a friction arm or something similar but those are too heavy to use for all the little bits and pieces you need to get on your rig sometime like i'm not going to use a one pb arm to attach a tiny weightless time code box it just doesn't make any sense so how do pros deal with this well in my case it's with the most low tech piece of gear out there velcro double-sided industrial velcro tape to be more specific if you take a look at my cameras both my fx9 and my fx3 have velcro all over them it's on the back of all my vmount batteries it's on the audio top handle both the front and the back and my fx3 it's even on the cheese plate of my fx9 anywhere i have flat space really you just put the soft side on the camera and the hard side or the hook side on the accessory then you can really easily get things on and off your rig really fast my standard fx9 setup is the lav receiver velcro to the back of my vmount batteries and then the time code box velcro to the top and no matter how much money i spent on little arms and stuff over the years i don't think i'd be able to find a better solution like i'm not even sure how i'd mount a lav and a time code box to my fx3 without it unless i wanted to have stuff like sticking up all over the place and just getting in the way just get a small roll of 2in double-sided tape and cut off tiny bits as needed and it's going to last you a really long time insanely handy okay moving on to the next everyday item i keep in my kit at all times is all about audio like i already touched on with paracord getting things to stick to other things is a situation i run into on pretty much every shoot but sometimes need a slightly more subtle tool than military grade rope the big one that jumps to mind for me is for audio more specifically when you need to attach lav mics to your characters but don't want to clip them on the outside of someone's clothes like they're a news anchor and even worse in my opinion the dreaded dji clip on mic that's taking over youtube but i don't think mics should show in ver film making ever so maybe i'm a bit of a snob and obviously we can't tie the mics to them so we need to stick them to them usually directly to the skin and most people don't want industrial velcro on their skin either so we're out of options there if you're a member of my documentary cinematography course you might have already heard the conversation with the professional sound guy where he explains the best place to position your mics like right at the center of this rough triangle between your neck and your chest so you might even think about using gaffer tape here but gaff tape tends to slip when skin gets hot and sweaty so we do need another solution luckily the solution is super cheap and easy and you don't need to go to b&h to find it and that's medical tape this stuff is especially designed to stick to skin no matter how swe it gets and most of the time i just feed the mic into one of those stupidly overpriced rubber squares i showed you then i'll put a strip of tape across it and then stick that directly onto the character's chest right about here i've done this hundreds if not thousands of times and it's pretty rare that it fails or falls off i'll roll of this stuff costs less than $5 on amazon or at any pharmacy and i always keep some with my audio gear you can add complexity to this by using snot tape or toupe tape to add a layer of cushioning between the medical tape and the mic but honestly just the tape on its own will get you 90% of the way there and it only takes a couple seconds to set up it's perfect for the small crew who needs to work fast like i do so often so that's great for securing mics in place but what if we need to protect the transmitter itself like if it's raining or snowing we can't just stop shooting because we're afraid of frying our kits so we need to find a way to protect our gear that's fast to put on and doesn't create a lot of extra bulk i've tried this with little ziploc bags and even saran wrap but while these things keep the packs dry they do make them really hard to access to change batteries and they create unwanted noise as they crinkle around in people's pockets so what's the answer well most of the time my go-to solution it's a condom now you might get some weird looks pulling them out on set so maybe don't store them in your wallet if you don't want to creep everybody out but they're the perfect solution to this problem they're waterproof they stretch and they'll wrap around the shape of the lav pack perfectly now there's definitely some dirty jokes to make here the one that comes to mind is something about practicing safe sets but let's all try and be adults for this one because because they're just such a great hack for this very specific film making issue to be honest decent lav packs are pretty water resistant and it's rarely raining so hard that i'm worried about ruining them for that odd time when i need to shoot audio in a downpour a condom is my best friend i usually buy the largest size available just to make sure i don't rip them while i'm stretching them around the mic and we'll just leave it at that absolutely no follow-up jokes to be made there okay so now that we got our minds out of the gutter for a second the next everyday item i like to keep around is basically a beefed up version of something most elementary school students will recognize from craft time like let's say you need to mount a small light to the bottom of a bookshelf like right back here or maybe you want to fix a gopro to the dash of a car or maybe you're even trying to hang gels from the ceiling to cover an existing like that you don't really like the color of we could use tape but that runs the risk of ripping the paint off whatever you attach it to or if the paint isn't so much of an issue the other problem with tape is that there are all sorts of surfaces it doesn't like to stick to anything cold for example like a car hood in the winter or anything rough like a brick wall even the stronger gaffer tape is going to struggle to stick to this stuff the answer is this stuff industrial grade adhesive putty as long as whatever you need to stick isn't really heavy this stuff is going to stick to a lot of surfaces without damaging anything and you can fit it into all sorts of small cracks where tape just wouldn't work i think the weight limit on this particular brand is 2 lb but that's more than enough to make it useful like a gopro or an aperture mc se light like this weigh a lot less than that and that's the kind of thing i'd be most likely trying to hide in weird places anyways like you can see here if i just stick four pieces of this stuff onto the back of this tiny light say i want to get under this shelf just push it down and that's not going to go anywhere there is also a film making specific version of this stuff called black tac which i'll link to in the description it's essentially the same thing but quite a bit more expensive and a fair bit stronger as well so if you really want to go hard with this that's your best bet but this everyday version of it works really well in most situations putty or tac or whatever you want to call it is cheap it's reusable it's moldable and i've used it to rig up to nine gopros to a car everywhere from the dashboard to the front grill and we drove around with it all day without them budging try black tac if you want to be extra sure but for how cheap this stuff is there's no reason not to keep some of it around okay so let's change gears here and finish this video off with my two favorite everyday lighting accessories things that i always bring with me and see a ton of action the first is for diff using light and the second is for cutting it and both can be found on amazon for really cheap in fact you probably already own both of these things uh but i'm just going to come out and say what the first one is because we've talked about it so much on this channel already that it might not be a surprise at this point and that's a shower curtain a frosted white shower curtain to be exact now i don't have mine in hand right now cuz it's in my storage locker with the rest of my lighting gear but this is just such a great standin for super expensive pieces of diffusion fabric and mine has bailed me out of so many tough situations you can hang it off a c stand to make a big soft box or maybe a book light for interviews you can tape it up over windows to bring down the harsh glare coming into a room uh you could even use it as a giant bounce or a poor man's cove light setup i'm not saying it's better than a 6x6 piece of grid cloth or muslim because it's probably not if you pixel peak but it's about 10% of the price of professional fabrics and that means you can afford to be a lot rougher with them or if you already have pro diffusion fabric why not just chuck an extra shower curtain in the bottom of your bag anyways just in case shower curtains are one of the best value you to use ratios of anything i have in my kit and it's just a no-brainer to have one yourself so that's great for diffusing lights but what if you need to cut light instead of just modifying it like what if you get to an interview location and it's just so full of light that there's no definition to your frame and your key light can't overpower the ambient source or on a big set you might call in the grips to rig huge pieces of dutin or set up some big frames with full black cloth on them but small runand gun productions don't usually have that kind of crew on hand so what do you do well the answer is easy just use garbage bags garbage bags are amazing at cutting light and if you need to block out a window fast just open them up and slit them lengthwise and tape them over the glass you're not going to win any awards for elegance here but who really cares if it's doing the job from skylights to floor to ceiling windows a few ordinary garbage bags can cover them all super quickly and allow you to take back control of the light in your shooting space plus if it starts pouring rain you can hide your gear inside them in a pinch i typically keep two garbage bags around when i travel but the good news is that they're so common most of the time you can just find them sitting under the sink in your hotel or your shooting location they're everywhere these are priced in cents per unit not dollars and at the end of the day when you're done you can just pull it down and use it to clean up the garbage on set before you leave it doesn't get any easier or cheaper than that so there we go eight everyday items that pro filmmakers love using limited resources to get maximum results is one of the things i love most about documentary film making and it's a job that as much about creative problem solving as it is technical mastery for me anyways that's a big part of the fun and while traveling and meeting people and learning about the world are all big draws there's something about trying to figure out how to get that weird shot you have in mind using whatever random gak you have on hand that's just so satisfying hopefully that gave you some ideas on how you can expand your kit without spending a ton of cash and who knows you probably already have some of this stuff laying around win-win see you still stuck [music] [music]
