so i am now officially a full-time software engineer hooray but before i got my current job i tried quite a few different jobs as my first ever proper job i was a personal banker for a summer because i was studying economics and everyone who studies economics wants to work in finance i was very much in the banking part and i also did a six-month placement as a corporate banker again back in finland and i absolutely hated both of those internships so i was like well what am i going to do now i've also ended up working as a management consultant at mckinsey and through all of these experiences i have had to really think about and i've been able to really learn about what are the sort of categories and qualities that the perfect job for me has and i believe that now with software engineering i have finally found a career that meets all of these points so in this video we're gonna go through the seven reasons why software engineering is the perfect job for me but also in general [music] you're obviously aware software engineers get paid really well there will always be a lot of people who say like well money doesn't matter to me but i mean come on we'll given the chance would choose to work a job that pays us more money because why wouldn't you money allows you to do a lot of things it allows you to build yourself a life that you cannot have otherwise and perhaps more importantly the more money you make and as long as you know how to save money the quicker you're gonna get to the point where you have so much money that maybe you don't even need to work anymore if you don't want to so really no matter how much you actually care about or a nice lifestyle or anything making more money is always a worthwhile goal in my opinion you might as well right the peak picture if you want to make a lot of money you want to do something that influences a lot of people and creates a lot of value and in society it's just a fact that every skill and every job does not create the same amount of value therefore some industries and common careers pay more than others because of the prevalence of technology if you have those skills if you know how to code you are going to be able to provide a lot of value that influences a lot of people in this world and therefore because your skills are in high demand and in low supply because learning the code is hard you're going to be paid a lot and that is just about all the economics that i can remember from my economics degree please leave a like on this video so that at least i can say that my economics degree was useful somewhere the thing is the money that you can make with coding while working as a software engineer is only the tip of the ice pack and if you watch till the end until 0.7 i'm gonna talk about exactly what i mean by that the thing with money is that the sort of counter argument that a lot of people give against working in high paid industries is that where's the point in making money if you actually never have the time to spend that money and that's really the crux of the reason why i wanted to get out of banking and consulting as fast as possible those people work insane hours when i was at mckinsey i was working until 10 pm every single day which brings us to point number two about software engineering which is that software engineers actually have very nice lifestyle and very chilled out work-life balance because your skills are in such high demand quite frankly companies cannot force you to do that because there is so much demand for yourself dave some company was making people work until 10 pm those people who could just leave and go work for someone else the google guy at the mckinsey guy are going to be paid roughly the same probably in long term although to be fair with all the stock options and everything the google guy is probably gonna make even more major difference between these two people is that the google guy is going home at 5 pm 6 pm every single day whereas the mckinsey guy is out there sweating making powerpoint slides until 10 pm or if you're an investment banker or a lawyer good luck trying to get six hours of sleep every single night if you're loving what you're doing then i guess it doesn't matter but for most of us we actually want to do other things right and this also brings us to point number three is the culture i worked in all sorts of different working cultures and obviously all of this depends on the company but in general tech companies really work hard to have a really good culture people are always really nice the work life and the culture is a lot less formal than many of these other industries and even at our company was a massive company our tech division so our digital division we have our own new office coming which is going to be very akin to like the google offices and all of those the open office layout is that something that you're into again working for a tech company is where you want to be [music] so money is important lifestyle is important but obviously the most important part about your job is the actual work that you're doing if you cannot see yourself enjoying coding don't become a software engineer like even with all of these all these benefits all this money if you cannot ever see yourself enjoying coding you shouldn't become a software engineer however i would say like for me the type of work i do when i'm coding is a lot more intellectually stimulating and a lot more challenging in the ways that i enjoy being challenged in if that makes sense because coding to me is logic at its purest form so if you are the type of person where you enjoy logical problem solving rather than let's say creative problem solving that you do as a consultant making slides for example then i would definitely say that software engineering is the absolute best career for you because your literal job is to solve logical problems that is all that coding is when you really boil it so if you're the type of person that i am that enjoys that and software engineering is the absolute best job in the world and it's very rewarding as well because as we've discussed coding is the most in demand skill in the world so whatever you're doing you know that you are creating something valuable unless you're working for like a gambling don't work for a gambling company but number five i put job safety and future proofing we obviously don't just want to build a career and skills however now we want to build skills that are going to be relevant throughout our careers the prevalence of technology is only going to keep going up in the future and sure we've got like ai and machine learning if you're looking to actually where ai is we're actually very far away from sort of a general ai that's going to be able to solve any problem and when it comes to coding a lot of the job is not actually just writing out functions to do something it's translating human requirements from what the client wants or what your company wants to create in to code and i just strongly doubt that we are going to be able to create this general ai that can take a human input and transfer in into code in exactly the way that the client wants anytime soon and if anything the software engineering industry is growing even faster than it has before because there's even more technology being created even more other industries being digitally transformed is like a huge trend in so many industries the demand for software engineers is only go going to go up in the future in my opinion [music] if you take a step back and look at the big picture sort of what we discussed is that coding in general in the world is arguably the best way to create value in the world and therefore make a lot of money and when you're working a job for a company that company is making even more money from your output than what you're making because they obviously have to do that otherwise they'd be making a loss so if you think about it in the big picture the absolute best way for you and in general the best way to actually get rich is not to work any job it's to become an entrepreneur an entrepreneurship is actually not for everyone because it doesn't require a lot of risk and there is a very good chance that you're going to make absolutely nothing but if you do want to actually make this serious money you want to ask yourself what are the skills that you would need to do that and you might think that those are skills like consulting skills or business skills in general or something obviously those are important because of the fact that most companies today are technology companies right it's sort of helpful if you actually know how to create that technology so that is why in this day and age a lot of the entrepreneurs that we see like elon musk mark zuckerberg they are engineers this thing is the people making a lot of money the people creating value in the world are people who can create something people who can engineer some solution to some problem and obviously even beyond this there are so many more avenues for people to make money with coding you might become a freelancer where instead of working for a company you are doing a lot of small projects or or broadly a contractor which is something that's very common here in the uk or you can talk about coding and make videos about it on youtube but that brings us to the next point which it what sorry sorry some annoying salesman look you need to listen to me they found you wait what do you mean who's they the bankers you've been slandering them the whole video what do i need to do you need a secure connection quickly go to nordvpn.com internet encoder down how does a vpn actually work and i still don't quite understand why i should use one a good vpn service provides you a secure encrypted tunnel for online traffic to flow nobody can see you through the tunnel get their hands on your online data or find your real ip address and location so it basically hides you gotcha okay so essentially if i use a vpn no one can track my browsing or find my ip address essentially yes exactly okay right but what about stuff like malicious files i heard that's also a common strategy that they might use that is exactly why not vpn recently introduced their threat protection feature which automatically scans your files before you download them identifies threats stopped you from landing on malicious websites and much more it all included and all you have to do is just turn it on okay okay okay how do i sign up again and this won't take a long time right because if they're coming i want to be protected like instantly it will take no time at all just go to nordvpn.com internet encoder and you can get four months free with two-year plan and in case anything goes wrong they have a 30-day money-back guarantee yeah i think i'm gonna like like this is all the time now i'm doing a speed test and it's like super fast as well thank you so much i didn't catch your name thank you for no vpn for sponsoring this video i've personally be using nordvpn for the first six months if you're serious about your privacy a vpn is just a thing that you want to have and not vpn is one of the best in the industry so go grab your four months free of the two-year plan by going to nordvpn.com internet encoder today but obviously after all this the overarching reason the number one reason why you should become a software yeah i think coding is quite fun it's a very fun skill and i used to be a video gamer and i also used to love playing chess but the thing with coding is that i can essentially activate that same part of my brain that really loves improving at something and sort of and pursuing goals and pursuing improvement in some craft while at the same time creating value for society with coding i can do that and i'm you improving myself as a software engineer and as a programmer like a video game like i'm the main character in my own via your game and i'm trying to improve all of these skills and obviously this is even more broadly in my whole life i'm trying to improve myself in all sorts of different ways but improving at coding is at the same time really fun really engaging and also extremely valuable and extremely lucrative in the long term so that is really why i believe that software engineering and any tech job in general is the best career in the world if you enjoyed this video if you resonated with any of these points definitely leave a like down below in this video because that will mean that this video is going to be shown to more people on youtube so in that way we can all together spread the good word of coding and of becoming a software engineer so that hopefully some of those people sweating away in some office in some bank doing excel can find this and also join us becoming software engineers instead i'm gonna get so much hate from all the bankers and the consultants who have essentially been thrashing for this whole video it's gonna be very fun now that i am a full-time software engineer there are a lot more videos coming up on what live as a software engineer is actually like everything i'm learning along the way as well as actually showing you what it's like to do a job so if you want to see any of that subscribe down below for more videos i'm gonna finish my coffee and i'll see you in the next one bye
