ladies and gentlemen norway chess 2023 is getting real spicy welcome back it's round number four and in today's video i'm going to be taking you through multiple different story lines including a new number two ranked chess player in the world a man who is absolutely on fire i will show you the games of hikara i will show you the games of magnus and i'll give you an update on the overall standings today a very big and important thing happened in the world of chess magnus carlson shaved his beard now this is a big deal he's had uh he's had some facial hair for quite some time so we can calculate the metrics of how he performs with and without a beard i feel like this is like what you know major news stations would do based on lebron james this is currently happening in the national basketball association two teams are in the nba finals but the media is still talking about lebron so uh magnus's opponent today uh was uh gukesh very strong uh indian uh teenager and actually gukesh defeated magnus in the blitz tournament before the event gukesh began with uh a an italian uh knight f6 played by magnus and relatively boring stuff that i will not really bother you with magnus played the move a5 this is a preemptive holding back of the white position who cash castled bishop d7 bishop d7 is certainly not a move um i mean it it is but i think in general that if black is going to play the setup black really should be playing for g5 uh and uh if black uh if this bishop is coming out to h4 you know this is the most this is kind of the thing that white has prepared for the most magnus thinks for six minutes and plays bishop d7 gukesh immediately plays the move knight to a3 and magnus just takes lukash takes back and now magnus plays this and gukash has to think on his own and it was at this moment you know gukesh spent 20 minutes now to move rook b1 in and of itself is not something that you need to spend 20 minutes on but this was magnus's attempt uh at uh at getting gukesh out of his comfort zone and he said as much i am not putting words in magnus's mouth magnus said in the confessional booth which is this thing they have during the games the players can go and they have a private area to record things uh to the public they you know um magnus said the guy is really well prepared so i figured i would be a little bit worse but at least i would get out of his preparation magnus gives up a very decent bishop to damage white structure over here who cash plays rook b1 this move is probably not worth spending 20 minutes on um because it's a very natural move uh magnus definitely had something in mind and virtually instantly played the move rook b8 i mean literally without i mean any hesitation 30 seconds is hardly any hesitation at all and now kukash plays bishop b5 this clearly was gukash's idea did he have to play bishop b5 no he had a lot of options could play a4 could have already played d4 because this pin is not really doing too much um you can't take on e4 so bishop to b5 and now he does this and it's very clear that he wants to play d5 it's also very clear that if magnus takes on d4 uh go cash still has d5 and if you play something like this i can actually just sacrifice like my position is so strong that all these different things are coming in bishop c6 and so on i'm also threatening take take take take mate so position looks very promising magnus plays bishop g4 uh take take and now we're gonna have a lot of pieces fall off the board pawn takes pawn bishop takes knight rook takes rook queen takes rook queen takes and now knight d7 uh if magnus had played here he would have gotten a completely losing position um this would have been under fire and this and this and this and this so knight d7 is played and this now gukesh is a pawn up um but uh he has doubleday pawns that are not really impressing uh anybody and uh queen f5 can threaten a couple of things here right rook d1 all these different ideas gukash has several pretty ambitious approaches thanks for some time and he plays something that isn't as accurate like again lining up here is what the computer liked uh just in general rerouting this way but queen e2 okay and now bishop here but now this gives magnus enough time to create counter play here and then create just all the counter play in the world right rook knight queen on the b file and what happens is we get all the central pawns gone gukesh is still a pawn up but that's this extra pawn it's not particularly impressive uh bishop e3 and so on rookie six and this knight is hanging out here but uh you may ask yourself right the bishop had to be defended so we attack the queen more pressure here and gukesh takes i mean kukesh did not have to take he could have come back but it really seemed like the same he was just trying to keep magnus at bay and he does not have a good pawn structure magnus gets a pawn back and gukesh is like um but i won't lose which i gotta tell you is definitely a legitimate strategy but i won't lose uh also he might win like this is a very very decent way for black to lose this game is to accidentally end up in a losing king and pawn end game this is not lost but it's very annoying and it's very close so queen d8 and around this moment i thought all right well magnus is just gonna win this game with black i mean right it's magnus like that's what he does this is literally how he beats people he just takes a while and magnus very slowly very methodically it was advancing his pieces his very mobile pawn structure over there threatening me look at this two on one and he got really close and actually right here was the moment in the game that after some 55 moves it was a very close advantage uh to being winning the computer wanted queen e5 check here to try to either push the king back and allow black's king in uh or to play g3 after which queen e2 and queen d1 wins this pawn now clearly magnus didn't go for this either he did not see this whole sequence or he thought this is still a draw uh but he is upon up uh but instead of that he went here he did not do that he did not play queen e5 he played queen d2 instead and uh that was his chance and he ended up giving up the pawn and trying to create some checkmate threats and he tried and he tried and he tried but despite all this that pawn made it all the way down and gukesh fast enough with his counter play and this game after some 80 moves ends in a draw and you might feel bored well i got news for you don't be we got more chess lucash with white again magnus with black again gukesh up three minutes on the clock this game was crazy this game was a crazy game of chess it was an italian again and this time it was a6 not knight bd2 friendly reminder in the armageddon portion if you're very confused about the time or anything like that white has three extra minutes but if black makes a draw black wins the game so black gets three less minutes and this is how points are determined in norway chess for the standings if you're just joining you don't understand what you're watching um well you'll be fine 27 a4 light squared bishopless position white wants to play knight e3 and so on and maybe b5 and maybe d4 and all this good stuff take take this is the position and go cash wins a pawn on b5 but the thing is his pawn his rook on b5 is going to be very uncomfortable it can always be trapped if as long as i defend the bishop the a file is just beautiful and life is good i'm very happy uh g3 knight d7 and magnus anchors in the bishop he's gonna play c6 he's gonna win gukesh's rook sensing this plays d4 the idea is that if you play c6 right away i'm just gonna give up the rook then i'm gonna go here and after the dust is settled i have two pawns and a bishop for a rook which is equal your king is weak and you have a very big weaknesses so actually gukesh here is asking some serious questions to magnus's position he plays c4 gives this up and continues hammering away go cash is just taking the fight to magnus carlson in this game knight d7 and kukesh is a fantastic position not only does gukesh have a fantastic position he's crashing in i mean gukash is calling the shots here against magnus and doing a fantastic job he is almost winning if 95 bishop b5 you can't take because that's a fork of the king of the rook i mean gukesh is on the verge of being completely winning against magnus carlson magnus plays rook a2 and in this position gukesh does something i don't really understand in this position gukesh can just play queen d3 or queen d1 or even queen c4 but kukesh gets cocky and he sacrifices his queen he barely even thought about it he sacrifices his queen for the rook in the night and his idea is these two past pawns and the knight hitting the rook is kukesh winning is gukesh losing is gukesh a psychopath what is he doing knight f65 look at this is go cash winning or losing what is going on in this position queenie2 f3 everything is defended this is nuts this is insane queen before just h3 and he's gonna hide his king he's gonna push his pawn and hide his king is gokish winning or losing dammit what is going on black plays king e6 the pawns are blockaded a little bit now what cookies plays rook c1 looking for this max's defense lucas plays knight e4 attacking the pawn the puck comes forward crash plays knight d6 the queen is now cut off knight f7 ideas he gives away this pawn to win the pawn on c4 so 96 c3 magnus says no but knight e4 in the pawns come off and lucas is still playing for a win potentially i know you can't do this right away but i'm saying you want to get into the sixth rank and take these pawns the only thing that magnus has is the first rank king d8 rook c6 here comes magnus who cash kicks him out rook c2 solid rook d2 position is good bishop back to f2 magnus has four seconds on the clock folks are you seeing this this has been magnus carlsen has four seconds on the clock bishop g3 rook a1 e6 gukesh is going for it he's going for the win c1 bishop d6 king e6 magnus takes the pawn who cash makes a run for it the knight is guarding everything is winning or losing h5 oh no magnus hangs knight g5 oh my goodness who cash can just come back or play rook d5 rook d5 check king g6 knight e4 backed by goo cash plays here fork the game is over magnus carlson wins close oh my goodness what a game i mean this man nearly sacrificed his queen and defeated magnus carlson that was unbelievable so magnus wins magnus wins and uh my friends that's not the end of the story we had another absolutely massive result today not just for the tournament but for world ranking so stick around ali reza ferrugia fabiano caruana two of the players that are having tremendous success in this event fabi plays a french probably looking for a fight bobby had the french played against him in the first round of the tournament when he played against magnus well now he plays magnus his opening i mean it's not magnus's opening but bobby playing the fabulous french isn't it fabulous when fabi plays the french all right i'm gonna stop classical french e5 knight d7 this has all been seen before now in the magnus game we had a6 that's what was played in that game followed by some queen b6 stuff bobby please uh take taken queen b6 uh this is one of the variations where you try to put some pressure on this pawn uh in many lines like for example white can play a3 here you can't take because the queen gets trapped um but there is uh there is queen d2 just giving up this pawn queen a3 uh and in this position i am familiar with rook b3 i know with some line and there is also a line bishop b5 i think bishop b5 has been very very trend trendy as of late you know there are some screaming children outside of my window and i cannot tell if like somebody is i don't i don't know if y'all can hear this but this is like pretty crazy like i think there's either 10 kids or one extremely loud one and uh yeah they be they be yelling i guess it's saturday kids be getting turned outside or whatever anyway knight b5 is the move that uh fairuza chooses to attack this queen on a3 queen a2 knight c7 and he comes back you'll notice that black has spent no time and farusha has spent a very limited amount of time uh clearly in this variation uh white is deliberately giving up two pawns on a2 and b2 but it's very difficult for black to make any moves black king cows right knight c5 borussia plays bishop d3 take take and fabi plays bishop d7 now if i were to ask you what is the most natural move in this position for white most natural uh no i couldn't get the crack out of my neck the most natural move by far is castles we don't it's just castling and then continuing some attack here plays a move that's kind of crazy he plays knight d6 and he spent some time on that move and fabi was like okay bishop takes and what if i just go here fabi is uh two pawns if fabi trades all the pieces he's gonna be winning because he's up two pawns and the entire like element of white's position that makes sense is the pieces in the attack should this move i think fairuzia just really overestimated his position and fabi just plays f6 and the idea of f6 is a solid central barrier and a little bunker for the king on f7 i'll leave russia takes on c6 check after some 20 minutes of thought plays queen a5 and just just he's ready to walk his king in fact he is the one checkmating it is fabiano caruano who is checkmating alireza it is not and it is not reverse and also if arusha cannot cannot castle anymore and you may be asking yourself isn't queen ah check winning a rook yes yes yes it is it is winning a rook in fact fabiano planned this entire thing back here b tech c6 queen f5 yep the whole thing was planned queen c2 we need to keep playing the whole thing probably gave up a rook probably gave up a rook bobby's going for mate you castle mate you go here mate ali rosa ferrugia is up a full rook but his road can't move and his other pieces can't do anything and this queen's not threatening anybody the queen needs two moves and i got news for you it doesn't have two moves probably just play c5 see fabi didn't play c5 queen d8 would have been a problem but fabi plays c5 because now after queen d8 you just play queen e4 you take here comes the bishop brutal h4 played by alireza and takes takes check takes check takes with check check check fabiano caruana just did his best impression of a vacuum cleaner this man said let me clean up all this garbage let me grab the bishop let me grab the rook let me grab this pawn with check let me grab this pawn with a check forcing your king but let me check you again into another check this man has the walkway the hollywood walk of fame right here look at this dude dude and ali reza farouza resigns as his queen is trapped in the corner and ali reza is not going to save this end game with black having five extra pawns fabiano caruanas back up to the number two rated player in the world damn and he did it in style damn meanwhile you know who else is cooking hikaru he drew his game against anish giri very quickly with black they went to an armageddon hikaru played the berlin because he's playing black right and this is the main line berlin like this is the end game this is the opening that killed chess h3 bishop d7 bishop e7 and this is just like this opening that's an endgame with rooks and minor pieces and black essentially says you gotta beat me well anish did his best he centralized all his pieces he played very nice positional chess putting his rooks in the center right and he's trying to poke at the dark squares but look at the time hikaru confident nice and easy king g7 absolutely equal position bishop rotating backwards rook to centralize and he's trying to make forward progress look at a knees just every piece getting involved h4 look at this b5 hikaru tries to break on the other side of the board but he's safe with ponto c6 but now here comes a niche on the dark squares alright he's gonna try to infiltrate on the dark squares bishop b6 g5 and each taking life away from the dark squared bishop but hikaru is just sitting there in his bunker oh now kikaru is looking to trade that night now kikaru centralizing the bishop oh trade rook a4 hikaru asking questions and here comes look at this the pendulum the infiltration from both sides here comes one rook the other rook's coming down as well hikaru dancing dancing he knows the niche can't make a draw so anish sacrifices a rook but here come kikaru's rooks gets it down to a rook versus knight oh but the king is going to arrive one pawn is gonna fall another pawn is gonna fall a third pawn is gonna fall and it was in this position after 70 moves and each geary resigned hikaru doing well magnus winning some matchups fabiano caruana cook in the tournament my friends after four rounds of action these are your standings fabiano caruana is up to ten and a half points bro three wins in classical chess one win in armageddon 10.5 hikaru is in second place magnus is in eighth now a couple
