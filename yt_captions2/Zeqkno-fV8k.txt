ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the candidates 2024 the biggest chess tournament of the year the winner of which plays for the world chess championship later on this very year this is round number 11 out of 14 including this round there are four rounds to go time is ticking and it is a very close race particularly on the men's side yan pom in first tied with gash from india and then it's fabiano carana hikara kamura and prag nanda vidit is a half a point behind them and today there were some big standings shakeups you're going to want to watch this whole recap not just because it increases watch time but because oh my god get ready for what you are about to witness we kick things off in the matchup between none other than prag nanda and hikaru and prague's name is so long that it's cutting off at the very end here we go my friends prague opens up with a move d4 and my man hikaru against the queen's gambit plays the queen's gambit oh and before i continue we launched predictions on chesley for the last three rounds you can check those out i'll put a link in the description 100% free you could sign up and play the predictions or if if you already have an account

completely free you can go ahead and play uh we launched it and we we will be doing it for all major events moving forward hikaru just played a queen's gambit against the queen gambit this is ridiculous stuff in this position what you play with black is this and this you don't play anything else there is literally nothing else maybe you play slav defense but at the high level it's not really seen that much anymore hikaro plays a queen's gambit against the queen's gambit this is a ridiculous opening to play at the candidates and prague thinks for 10 minutes and the reason for that is when he was preparing for this tournament he did not expect that one of his opponents would play a queen's gambit now taking this queen's gambit is not particularly good black plays e6 and very quickly wins the pawn back it's impossible to defend the pawn with moves like b4 cuz black will undermine very quickly but cd5 is the best move and after cd5 hikaru mirror image captures and he's got a very simple idea his very simple idea is to take back with the queen and prog thinks 10 minutes again so clearly the opening gamble has paid off but i got to tell you even with the opening gamble paying off prag just very calmly very calmly develops his pieces and is just a touch better he's down 20 minutes but you can't play a queen's gambit against the queen's gambit i mean it's just not going to work but hikaru is relying on his super superior opening analysis which he has clearly done and judging from the speed at which that hikaru is playing trying to dislodge the knight from the center of the board followed by the quick development of this knight he's still in his prep right so now the prep probably will continue bishop to g2 which is what prague plays hikaro plays a5 without thinking he's trying to dislodge the knight from the positioning on b3 now big decision for white what do you do the the best move here is to block with your knight and try to play to b6 i think prague didn't like this check and then he probably was like i don't really know what i'm doing after that but it's the top engine move another way to play if you're not going to play knight to a4 is to play bishop e3 and after a4 go forward he didn't like that either because he probably didn't like the pawn going all the way down the board so after a5 he decides i'm going to fight back with knight b5 he is now down 40 minutes in the opening but because he's playing with white and the queens are traded it's not like he has much of an advantage but he does have to spend a little bit of time to give this check bishop d2 and now so that you don't get forked you can castle but it's actually even better to put the king in the center believe it or not because you're in a queenless position and as you can see there's going to be more trades so since there are going to be more trades probably there is going to be uh a relatively stable position for this king in the center of the board prag plays a3 targeting the bishop and finally we get out of the opening it's a pretty boring game i mean all of that was pretty explosive when it happened but yeah i mean other other than that that nothing was particularly exciting uh it's a and b versus a and b it's these four pawns these yeah it's a pretty symmetrical position karo plays a4 so he's just trying to lock the queen side uh proc plays knight c4 threatening knight b6 not really threatening but you know and then putting his eyes here he's not going to do it right away but that's sort of the idea now karo plays bishop b6 right he's targeting the knight trying to say prag where you going to go defends his knight with the rook yaro plays rook a6 stabilizing the position uh he can't move his rook anywhere but you know it's life and now pro castles and the position is completely equal all right proc goes back to e3 opening up some line of sight on the knight on c6 and now hikaro plays this move rook a5 okay fine i guess the knight has to depart but he takes on c6 so this is a pretty big decision from prag who decides okay i'm going to take this knight right and then i'm going to bring my knight back and hikaro has stupid looking pawns hikaro says that's not very nice of you i'm now going to play bishop to b3 good luck ever putting a rook on d1 you bozo all right prag says actually you're the bozo cuz now i play knight b1 who's going to protect this pawn and i'm going to play knight c4 and put this knight on d2 you bozo car plays rook back to a6 he doesn't call prag ab bozo here because he's not playing from a position of strength now prague plays f4 that's a big decision prag can also play rook c5 here and uh probably play like rook back and you know knight d2 and you know the engine already is potentially thinking of repeating moves um but he plays f4 which is opening up a front of attack hikaru plugs the center shot he doesn't want the position to open and now prog starts bringing his king and his knight a very tense position g6 from karu simultaneously defending against knight f5 and also maybe this pawn will help build this in the future now i don't like prog next move it's rook b1 i think prog saw a little bit of a ghost here with the bishop moving and then the pawn hanging you really i mean rook b1 is a tough move to play he's kind of lucky the position is closed hikaru puts the knight into the center he does that because he wants to make a trade and improve his structure prog says okay i'm going to go back and now karu locks the cage and he's just made maximum improvements to his position if br continues to shuffle hikaro will make this trade then he will play bishop c2 removing the rook and he will win this pawn it's a very big moment in this game now and prague has to fight back but he's right there he fights back best move on the board and now the position is getting spicy pawn takes on g4 the best move is to take back and that's what prague does that is the best move and now this is hanging knight to e5 is another possibility very tense moment hikaru grabs the pawn on f4 and in this position pr play king e3 so he's going to win the pawn back in the center as well but apparently he should have went here and then if hikaro went to d5 the knight could go here and had he gone to e1 this would have potentially been a draw but he went forward and he went very forward and now his ki okay his king's in the center but what you know watching this with no eval bar is a very different thing than watching it with an eval bar hikaro plays c5 and suddenly the rook has arrived and the rook is going to come down to d2 as well white is having some real difficulty here defending his pieces h5 you can't play knight e5 because rook e6 and you can't play knight f2 because rook e6 king d2 and even bishop f3 with a discovered check and it's an avalanche and suddenly prs pieces are all like tied up this rook has been passive the whole game that rook has been a problem he has to create some counterplay hikaru puts the bishop all the way in the corner it snipes the entire board and the only safe move for the night is this and as you may imagine the knight is not returning king to f2 hikaru trades rooks and the knight is trapped completely rook f1 king g7 oh my goodness prague has to sacrifice and it's still not over because he can win some of these pawns and at the end of the day this pawn and this bishop versus this king is a draw believe it or not because the color of the promotion square is wrong so there's many many ways that black doesn't win this position position but hikaru puts on his best uh scrubs and he performs an operation of masterful precision the rook protects the pawn the bishop hits this one the rook can't move anywhere because there will be checks and my friends in one of the most clutch performances of his freaking life hikaru nakamura defeats prague in the 11th round of action at the candidates because after takes takes the pawn is going and you cannot stop it from the beginning to the end this was a master class in surprising your opponent making him uncomfortable and using experience and a slightly better nervous system it is the last four rounds of the candidates the last quarter of the event and hikaru just beat prague with black there is nothing you can do but clap nothing doesn't matter if you're a hater doesn't matter if you're a fan prog showed up to fight he put hikaru under pressure prague played all the best moves but hikaru's prep was a little deeper he made practical difficulties for prague and they got into a fight and hikaro was the winner and he is now in first place pending the results of gukesh and nepo now another quick game for you ali resa fuja versus niat abos of these guys obviously are having rough events niat perhaps expected because he was the lowest seed but the big story is definitely ali reza with a massive massive struggle um this game was tense early it was ready then it was a queen pawn relatively unexplored territory uh but then on the 13th move ali reza went here nad offered a trade of bishops ali resa said no thank you i would rather attack your queen and nan just had to retreat here and the game would have proceeded he went e5 and what he missed about the move e5 is that it doesn't really i mean he didn't miss it he just missed white's response um he missed knight c4 and the pawn's going to fall it's going to fall um you can't take because you're pinned and if you try to defend yourself beautiful move rook d5 threatening a trade of rooks and yes i do mean threatening because if you decline a a pair of rook uh rook trade i just win material you are stuck you're just completely stuck like let's say you play b6 i play bishop 2 e7 let's say you were oh okay well that's easy i just play king f sorry i play king f7 you can't play bishop e7 yeah then i play like h3 and bishop g4 and g4 and you just lose like you just can't defend yourself it's unbelievable and uh oli resz is winning and uh he's winning because black can't move he just cannot move these pieces bishop back he can't move his entire queen side he starts sacrificing material and un fortunately he just loses all his pieces and he just resigns that was it the recap of that game was about 2 minutes long uh a win for ali resa he's up to four and a half but um yeah nad unfortunately continues to struggle in particular with the black pieces now we also had gkes versus fabbi massive match up for first place we also had vidit versus nepo a massive massive battle also with first place implications but we have battles all over the place i just did an interview with leting some of you saw it i also did an interview with gukesh i posted vishi hikaro a lot of the players lei is in the running for first place this one was an italian c3 a5 a very aggressive italian disallowing white from playing this move and this game was really complicated black went on the attack on the diagonal uh leay took on c6 and black was sort of instigating on the queen side then it was knight g3 and lay started building up some sort of initiative on the king side lay is a very aggressive player and as you can see here bishop h6 she sacrifices the bishop she's um uh she's uh tied for first place with tanong queen h6 and suddenly lei is winning she's got a big attack brewing and here all she has to do is just play it slow and the idea of king h2 is let's say black plays rook b8 you play knight g5 and knight h5 knight f5 and then you just slowly bring your pieces but lei takes t instead of that she plays knight e5 and her idea is that the rook and the check here is possible black takes and it all settles with white having a rook for two bishops but black is better and within a few moves lei is completely on the defensive so this the push through didn't work black is now converting queen c3 masterful stuff that's it i mean white is simply losing all her pawns and time is taking four minutes remaining for lei wait a minute did she just lose a rook in this position leting said i'm chucking all the pieces over the ship all the pieces i'm getting rid of them why because even though i'm down five points of material i have knight to f5 here check here queen gief it might be a draw she's down eight points of material but she might have found a draw the king goes here it's another check queen g7 oh my god okay black escapes the checks pawn takes what if you take here threatening a checkmate it's check here check here you can't escape how how did le even find that so the only winning move is f6 which black finds giving up the pawn and now in this position the king you see the king is running the king has to keep running you sacrifice the bishop on c4 like this then you run even further and the point is that you make it to the corner king b8 king a7 and you are safe you are safe from the checks it looks like white might win but it's actually black who is going to get there first so in this series of checks f6 takes the king has to just run but anna brings her bishop back after thinking for 20 minutes and it's the wrong move and leting down two bishops two bishops finds the drawing technique the what what anna had miscalculated was queen g5 queen e7 threatening to take the bishop with another check unbelievable defensive find and leting j does not take the bishop and black is completely stuck one of the most unbelievable escapes i have ever seen she found a way to sacrifice three pieces this is absolutely heartbreaking if anna was in the running for first place and needed a win this would be unreal but unfortunately she's having a bad event but lay survives and she gets a very needed half a point unbelievable hold completely unreal and who would have thought blocking with the bishop saving your bishop was the wrong move v shali versus alexandra gashina this was a sicilian defense black needs to win remember lei i just showed you she has 6 and a half gka is the only one who can catch her with a win and she plays a sicilian and she get gets very ambitious bishop g4 you can't take because knight takes bishop and vall is having a tough event but from the opening there was not a whole lot here i mean it was a very stable position if anybody is better it is the person playing with white and you see here vali basically threatens a draw yes that is a threat because black must win another threat of a draw and vali just begins building up an advantage because black is taking unnecessary risk knight e2 by sh playing very smart you know if you want to give me chance says now i'm going to attack you rook c2 but white continues to make improvements but we've seen in this event time and time again vali has had great positions but at some point she makes a mistake not in this game so far all beautiful game rook queen h4 rook look at this she's playing an absolute master class against the wait a minute in this position she needed to find rook f3 knight h3 and that type of regrouping and suddenly with time ticking she's being put p backwards and the game spins out of control white is still winning but there it goes she was completely winning in this position right here and i think she needed to right here uh queen h3 rook c6 yeah she needed to go bishop d6 and the point is you're threatening knight c5 you're also threatening things like rook f4 and then removing but most importantly you're threatening something like like let's say black plays like b6 you're also threatening this and the pawn no longer has a defender and you win and suddenly because of the time situation vali gets her bonus time but she is no longer winning she's still going to try and she's still going to try but she can't win and now unfortunately for black she also can't win so she's going to have to settle for a draw uh there is no other way or is she i think gachina couldn't kind of find that balance of playing for a win or not and suddenly d8 knight a gangster under promotion from vali she was already winning in this end game because her pass pawn was so strong and if black had played something like king d7 there was this you can't take because of this and suddenly after clawing all the way back and desperately needing the half a point alexandra gach going to loses by shle wins her second game in she's regaining some rating she's not in the running to win the event if some of you may be wondering why black didn't queen i think you're just not going to win a endgame down a knight and a pawn at your level maybe at the candidates level no um what a win and gkin is probably out of the running i mean she really is and um that is a shame for people that wanted her to win uh but if you're a vali fan you're hyped now gesh fabiano hikaru won his game spoiler just kidding now if gukesh wins he's got seven he's completely alone in the standings by the way check out his interview i i i did an interview with him and fabiano uh and fabby in this game he doesn't play the queen's gambit mirror but he plays knight bd7 which is a pretty provocative system uh it's kind of a sideline you know an exchange variation normal stuff both play what the he just played g5 these guys are taking massive risk knight h5 and then he grabs the bishop so black weakens his structure and takes white's bishop but it gives gukesh a very straightforward plan in the queen's gambit declined exchange white has three pawns black has four so white goes on a minority attack all right white just plays with the three pawns and plays like b4 rook b1 a4 very very methodical fabiano plays a6 but now he's created weaknesses in his position and gz just goes straight to c5 fiano gets absolutely nothing going he gets a horrendously sad position knight c5 bc5 and basically if fabby saves the game on the b file he's going to be fine or he's going to fight back f5 he pushes another pawn forward he's looking for f4 and gash's we little king is over here so gukesh plays queen c3 up this move made gukesh spend nearly 40 minutes of his time all right 40 minutes while fabiano went to the toilet to get to work on last knight's food all right no i'm just kidding queen c3 i mean maybe he did i wasn't there rook f7 and clearly black has very good defense here now rook b4 queen c7 now knight e5 at some point is going to become useful how about right now takes and maybe f4 is going to kind of close everything up like i said if black holds that pawn he's he's fine it's just a draw h5 oh my god what is fabbi doing lukes plays f4 queen d8 back takes on g5 the queen takes on g5 look at these pawns are on gha's king rook f3 holds everything gesha has 12 minutes to make 12 moves fby plays queen back to g7 rook f2 about to take on f5 bishop back to d7 and in this position gukesh plays queen to b4 targeting the pawn on b7 the engine loved queen b2 with the intention of going here just all in now i think that was g's idea anyway but for some reason he went queen b4 and bishop c8 was played and if you had gone here and bishop c8 was played you can take on f5 now that is the major difference and the positioning of the queen matters because i guess after take take take take queen g3 i i don't know i i i don't know maybe there's just queen f2 and this is a winning end game so kukesh needed to 50/50 it he chooses wrong i'm not saying he would would have won the game if he chose right but now he decides you know what i got no time let's make a draw oh my god a nervy game a very nervy game queen g3 and the game ends in a perpetual check oh this was stressful a queen's gamit decline where fabby just went absolutely bananas hunting gukesh down on the king side made gukesh spend a lot of time gkes was a little bit hesitant he could have maybe absorbed some of that risk but spoiler he's now tied with hikaru six and a half out of 10 11 sorry six and a half out of 11 so they're both tied for first and they're waiting to see what's going to happen in the game uh between uh vidit and nepo nepo with the black pieces videt has to beat him to get up to six points uh quick summary of two other games these players are not in contention for a first place finish uh this one was a slow slo that is literally the name it's called the quiet slav yeah find me one of those uh queen f5 queen g5 and nurul's had a pretty good tournament uh and she played very provocatively very interesting chess in this game she push pushed a lot of humpies pieces back but if you count the pawns white is just up a pawn and she kind of just took that to the bank not actually cuz i don't think you can go to the bank in the middle of a chess game but a very clean methodical game from humpy showing her experience showing the class and she went up two pawns at some point her pawns were very powerful and uh this was a long grinding process where actually nuru did make a little bit of a comeback in this game but it was sort of never in doubt and it simplified into a rook end game which is completely winning uh this is just a two on two with the extra pawn white slowly methodically despite only having a minute on the clock walked the king over there and then proceeded to create two pawns very very instructive game and uh the pawn will be stopped and humpy wins and the final game from the women's side tandi in first place now i will remind you what happened in leting jez game she drew tanong y playing with the white pieces uh versus katerina lagno she plays not she doesn't play a catalan she plays a sideline queens pawn opening so we get a very imbalanced game but generally these queens pawn games as you can see here pieces get traded draws happen very quickly white doesn't really have a whole lot going for her so she takes on c6 kind of licated but nothing particularly special uh white still trying to make some sort of attack happen but uh yeah as you can see we're about to have a bunch of exchanges rook b5 [music] bishop so already things got a little bit out of control cuz black lost the pawn but she goes for bishop b3 and after rook d8 she's just losing she's just losing she's losing because you have to take with the big bishop but white takes on a7 with long-term pressure on this pawn and a pass a pawn and the bishop is hanging goes here knight c6 it's very difficult to stop checkmate the only way to stop checkmate is to go like this and then queen d7 is a fork oh my god bishop h5 she loses another pawn and in the tactical skirmish tanong y king g3 is a gangster move by the way because you don't want to get a perpetual tanong y wins another game in the candidates threatening a mate take take king h4 what a move queen h8 is mate you cannot check the what a game i mean she has seven and a half she has seven she's winning she's seven and a half out of 11 leting j has seven they are one and a half in two points above everybody else with three rounds to go it is all but over and they already played each other so somebody has to beat tan and l has to get another win and this this was one of the most unbelievable games of chess i've ever seen if you had the patience to watch 26 minutes of this recap i'm about to blow your freaking mind vided gti is the man e4 e5 knight f3 knight f6 goes into nepos petro plays a sideline cuz you you can't play main lines against the petro petro is like the death of chess and then he just goes you know what let's play a queenless position it's kind of an edgy move by yan in fact he spent 12 minutes on it you can't take cuz you're pinned take take and you know what let's play play d4 and this is their position this is the position they have to work with when i saw this opening i was like i think the yan is going to outplay vidit like i i just thought you know yan hasn't lost in this candidates uh he's been an absolute candidates juggernaut and then and then you know vidit started putting all his pawns on the fourth rank i was like vid's playing like me you know this is the way i would play chess against like a 2400 on chess lecom blitz um yeah this is kind of nuts and i was like well nepo is just yeah i mean he's just going to be solid and at some point vid is going to start taking too much time and there it is it vidd now has 39 minutes for 24 moves he vidit showed up to a game surprising his opponent in the opening and by the 15th move vidit is the one surprised like and and and this is why i was like why did vidit do this to himself i mean it's like time and time again right he plays bishop d3 he's down 40 minutes and he's just under pressure but vidid started proving me wrong and he started fighting back you cannot take on c3 because if you do i play king d1 and there's still a fork this is not a pure fork because of this vidit sacrifices his bishop cu he was going to lose it anyway takes takes and plays king e2 it's a very imbalanced position both sides have their pluses and minuses rook d8 and vid it g4 like the freaking terminator f4 g5 two time defending candidates champion more like two time lost in the world championship match i mean it depends on which way you look at it right he plays g4 g5 he's like i'm going for this man handing him his first l in this tournament a5 this was gangster behavior rook in on the seventh rank forcing yon to trade take take rook to d1 how is jan going to get any of his pieces out lowkey like he can't move any pieces knight g4 jan has to take the open file and vid by the way is keeping even on time 17 minutes down plays rook b2 check king goes to f3 y plays e5 but the v but yeah vid just comes back and these pawns are so weak knight f6 h5 is on the way knight b6 knight f6 king h8 here comes videt king he's winning vid gudi is going to beat yan pishi pawn goes to a4 now vid just has to be a little bit careful rook a1 rook b3 vid's winning vid's winning but it's it's it's really really really tough he has to completely chuck this pawn he has 9 minutes the winning idea here for white is h5 if black takes this pawn the king walks in what the point is you lose all your pawns but you go to g6 and you know what the point is after that let's say rook c4 rook h1 the black king is mated pawn to h4 f4 disconnects everything so vidit has to play h5 rip open the h file now what's crazy is let's say rook c3 rook c4 or you just go here and then you go to h1 anyway and that that's the point you get this cube of pieces and play rook h1 black can only defend himself with rook h4 then knight e8 king f6 king f7 g7 unreal but vidit misses it because he's trying to defend his pawns like kind of understandable kind of understandable but that allows yan now to play a3 bishop c1 and now when he's going to lose his pawn on a3 yan plays knight to a4 targeting this pawn on c3 right and that is what he's going to no no jan gives vid another life jan was like well i there's no point defending this pawn because i'm going to lose it but there's no point counterattacking either because i guess white will play defense somehow no he makes a massive mistake and suddenly he plays d5 essentially at this point vidit has six minutes to make four moves or he loses the game on time so vidit takes on a3 yan plays d5 and he is completely lost you can pause here try to find the win put yourself inid shoes the move pawn to d5 sets up something very simple cd5 rook takes rook takes c4 you lose the rook and you're going to be down a bishop that's what it sets up so what do you do instead what you do is you don't take with the pawn vidit has six minutes to figure out this this chess puzzle the most important chess puzzle of his life knight d5 knight d5 cd5 c4 or rook a3 doesn't doesn't really matter take take c4 take you're down you're down a bishop you got to resign no you're not down a bishop you are up two pawns king to b5 and even f3 is more accurate because f3 prevents e4 but let's say king b5 e4 with the idea to to get to this pawn c4 a4 c5 bishop c5 king c5 a3 d6 and in this position white is winning if king h7 you trade the queens king g7 you trade the queens it's a winning end game vided has to find knight takes d5 and he doesn't he doesn't find it and now it's a fortress black plays rook b5 and the players make it to the next time control and the game is headed for a draw then the game is headed for a draw and now there is absolutely nothing you can do knight d2 bishop d6 knight e4 bishop e7 knight g so king g7 knight d2 and vid's like i'm not done so this position look at this this position just happened right so you can repeat the position if vid plays knight d2 here bishop d v says i'm not done oh my god he's not done he's like no no no no no no no i know i missed a chance in this game i'm going to beat you all right rook b3 from yan but it's it's going to be tough i don't know how you're going to going to try to do it knight e4 yeah but vid it vid it's it's probably time to make a draw yeah knight b6 there's nothing here you can't really break through bishop e3 yep knight d2 oh my god oh my god why is the king here rook c1 okay we're okay but it wait jana is chucking his pieces now he's chucking the pieces king a4 is vid winning or losing is yan winning or los they both have like six and six and four minutes knight c4 v it is a pawn up but jan activates the e pawn which is going to get the king to the center oh my god i can't watch and i watched the whole thing live oh my god i can't watch the king is walking into d3 it's still completely equal knight to e5 king to d2 rook e1 and everything is holding somehow there's no checkmate knight c3 check the king walks up bishop d8 the king walks up and all the pawns are hanging white is still probably playing for a win it's actually kind of a miracle the king is not getting mated but vi it plays bishop g3 which is still fine it's a little bit scary knight c3 check you can take take take take and suffer in an endgame here after bishop e5 but it's probably a draw vidit doesn't even do that he plays king a3 the rook is hanging knight e5 is still on the board vidit has to play knight e5 and he doesn't at this point it was already a very difficult position even if you played knight e5 and white went king d2 you had to play the only move which is rook to g1 creating enough distance between you and these pieces i don't know why rook h1 doesn't work but i think it's because of knight to b1 you have to be here i can't explain it um and my friends uh he plays rook b4 and knight b2 and um now he's just getting mated and and what you have to do in this game is you have to respect vided gti's fighting spirit but you have to just be absolutely dumbfounded by the fact that yan pishi still has not lost a game in this candidates and now after 39 rounds of playing this tournament over like four years is still in first place completely on his own i am speechless this is a heartbreaking defeat for vidit he had multiple chances to draw even in the end game he declined a repetition he had i would say one and a half chances to win knight takes d5 will probably haunt him for the rest of his life like the move on move 36 simplifying to that end game i don't know how he's going to sleep maybe maybe he's got a better nervous system than me i don't know how i'm going to sleep yanomi wins again iaru gets the first place with gukesh only to be overtaken by the final game of the round yanyi seven points and we have three more rounds to go this is so wild get your predictions in for round number 12 have a chance to win some free courses get out of here
