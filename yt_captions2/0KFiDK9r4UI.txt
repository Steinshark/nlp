the grub-brained developer a layman's guide to thinking like a self-aware small brain that's me this is me okay uh this collection of thoughts on software development gathered by grub brain developer grub brain developer not so smart but drug brain developer program many long year and learned some things although mostly still confused drug brain developer try to collect learns into small easily digestible and funny page not only for you the young grug but also for him because as a drug brain developer getting get older he forget important things like what he had for breakfast or if he put pants on big brain developers are so many or are many and some not expected to like this make sour face think they are big brain developers many many more and more even definitely probably maybe not like this many sour face such as internet no greg ones think big brain but learned the hard way this is me okay it's not me actually uh but i do know who wrote this and they are from montana i'm also from montana and they don't follow me on twitter you know who you are and you know the worst part about this you will make a meme of you not following me on twitter after i make this video which is very upsetting okay very very upsetting um anyways it's fine is free country sort of an end of day not really mattered too much but grug hope you fun reading and maybe learn from many many mistakes greg makeover long time programming life okay here we go so we're gonna start with part one the eternal enemy complexity uh apex predator of grug is complexity complexity bad say it again complexity very bad you say now complexity very very bad say it twitch thank you thank you i was pretty upset no pin joyer what the hell is that man's name what did p joyer say to me not p and joyer that's not pin joyer but you could imagine if it was his name would work out with the drug report okay anyways uh let's see given choice between complexity or no one won against t-rex all right hold on whoa given choice between complexity or one-on-one against t-rex grugtech t-rex at least grug's ct rex complexity is a spirit demon that enter code base through well-meeting but ultimately very clubbable non-grug brain developers and project managers who not fear complexity spirit demon or even know about sometime hahaha yes oh my goodness oh my goodness oh no oh no the the complexity spirit even real one day code base understandable and drug get worked on everything good next day impossible complexity demon spirit has entered code base in very dangerous situation grugno able to see complexity demon but grug's sense presence in code base demon complexity spirit mocking him make a change here break unrelated thing there what mock mock mock haha so funny drug love programming and not becoming shiny rock speculator like grug senior advise club not work on demon spirit complexity and bad idea actually hit developer who led spirit in with club sometime greg himself sadly often grug himself say drug say again and say often complexity very very bad all right so let me kind of expound upon this one and so as i see what grug is trying to say let me translate okay from one small brain to another small brain um how i see this and this is something i've been really trying to do for the last couple years is i call it one dimensional programming i literally try not to abstract ever i only abstract once i find myself using the thing enough times right like i don't proactively abstract i react reactively react reactively abstract and what i mean by that is that especially with typescript typescript is by far one of the worst languages for this uh typescript what you're going to do is you're going to create a function and you're going to want some fancy autocomplete right you're going to want your keys and everything to be like specific strings and you're gonna kind of go into it and you're going to build all the right stuff and then what happens well when you need the refactor which because you inevitably got it wrong the amount of typescript type programming you have to go back through and re like retroactively change is enormous and then you have to change the code itself like typescript is by far the worst candidate for this um and i i find myself doing this all the time i have built so many typescript projects at this point my current one is just growing still it's growing wildly out of control and for the for like the last two months in this one i've done no form of abstracting and it's been one of the most maintainable things ever because by the time i need to abstract i create in my mono repo a new section and that new section contains my new like piece and then it's very easy to abstract right i don't know it's just it's just nuts it's just nuts because when i was younger i always did like the clean code approach right oh what's this thing oh i better make it an enum i better do these kind of things i better make these accessing methods i better create this thing like good job good job good job right and it's just like one line of code in the end if i would have just made it stupid but instead i didn't make it stupid and i threw in generics everywhere like if you're finding yourself using generics before you even know you need to actually for real use generics you're doing it wrong and typescript just really lets you do it easily because you don't even have to like define the bounds on generics or anything you could just you just go just go just go all after it it's crazy it's wild reject five head returning to grunk yes let's go you don't understand anything i'm talking about oh man just build a couple projects and just go for the power of the old uh percent s old new statement in code maintenance should never be underestimated this is so true if you make your code stupid enough it's easy right our teacher gives us a b plus because he thought it was too simple oh your teacher okay so again this is why academia sucks right so the one problem about school in the larger sense is that what happens in the real world and what happens in school are two very different things okay teachers sit around get out of whiteboard and produce whiteboard masturbation for six months on end and then when the grant starts running out they then go and get a second grant and everyone's happy then they hire some stupid naive the world is still amazing junior and being like we're gonna do this incredible project they circle jerk that person around for another six months and creating uml and sequence diagrams and by the time they're done with all of that at the end you have to get another grant everyone's clapping that man this project is incredible look at them circle jerk and whiteboard masturbate next thing you know they're gonna have clipboards and and science lab coats going on and guess what still haven't actually made anything because the measurement is not based in real world impact it's based in grants which means the more pedantic and the more unrealistic you can make it the more successful it is by the way i in no way at all i'm talking about the years i spent writing uml diagrams and uml masturbating for months on end without actually writing any code i did definitely not me that's not about me okay that's not about me the name is the ptsd agent
