ladies and gentlemen hans neeman has done it again hans is currently playing in a chess tournament in london called the london chess classic it's an annual tournament where they organize many of the world's strongest players in the past they've had magnus and hikaru this year they have players like hans gesh and so on and um this is his round four game and in this game hans neeman played a spectacular attacking chess game where he sacrificed not one but both of his chess god-given rooks and on top of that he sacrificed the knight it was a sensational performance it was a highlevel game i'm going to break it down for all of you uh and hopefully make you care about this spectacle the london chess classic this year matters because players like gukesh are trying to make the candidates tournament so it certain level of performance at the london chess classic will help him achieve that or not also it's my birthday not that you had to know that but lucy just got me this nice sweater so um wearing it in the video i'm a i'm a i'm a colorful dude uh i like uh you know i like to yell about rooks but i also i like to wear colorful sweaters and uh yeah the new york dress code is basically black gray and anything else uh but sometimes i i i do like to wear you know some more colorful and comfortable stuff anyway uh sit back relax i'm a little bit under the weather my throat hurts um but uh you know yeah have a great december 5th hans opens this game with the move e4 and his opponent is shus i always call his opponent shus royale like battle royale in fortnite but i think it's just shus royal i i i don't think his name is pronounced royale he's a young international master from england and uh he's um he's 14 years old so you know if you think hans is young at at the age of 19 or 20 i mean trus is very very young and he's playing in this tournament because he's the future of english chess hans plays kn f3 we have an e4 e5 knight f3 knight c6 bishop c4 this is the italian hans can also play bishop b5 which is the spanish the italian and the spanish are the two main lines generally at top level you don't see ponzani four knights uh you don't see the vienna because there there's a lot of equalizing lines for black that doesn't mean the vienna's bad at you know let's say 2,000 or'00 or 1500 level you you just got to know your lines there uh and so the italian one of the ways to play for an advantage black plays bishop c5 mirror image we don't have knight f6 which could potentially invite a fried liver attack or something along those lines and now hans already makes a big commitment he plays the pawn to d3 right away generally white plays c3 and then d4 but then against c3 knight f6 he no longer plays d4 and opts to play a closed italian game uh where he defends the center hans plays d3 right away i mean it's just kind of like a move order thing it's just like a subtle detail white leaves the option on the table to potentially play knight c3 in the future also white leaves the option on the table to develop the bishop before making other commitments uh the truth is for like 99.99% of you watching none of what i just said matters at all you just want me to analyze the the next move uh chess is just one of these things it's just small pawn move there so knight f6 castles and now d6 so black is still developing before he is castling uh white now has the option uh to play like bishop g5 and play a very provocative line where you basically try to bait black into doing this then you play a5 to make sure b4 never happens you can play bishop b6 queen e7 advance these pawns uh but instead of that you know we have d6 we have c3 so so hans still plays the the double pawn setup with d3 c3 he's either going to play for b4 or d4 he's definitely not going to play for b4 anymore because shes plays a5 now you'll notice that by the time spend of the players it's a 90-minute game of chess they gain 30 seconds every time they make a move they know all of this they are following top level games that have been played many many times before now i said my throat is bothering me a little bit b4 is stopped but the b5 square is quite vulnerable and uh the c6 knight will be under some pressure because if you get rid of that knight that knight no longer supports the center and it enables one of white's major plans which is to play the move d4 so we have rook e1 which is just the generally supportive move of the e4 pawn black finally castles and now both sides make h pawn commitments to prevent the moves bishop g5 and bishop to g4 respect uh respect i respectively not respectfully i mean respectfully they are also doing that hopefully um i don't know i wouldn't know in han's case cu the chess speaks for itself and i don't know if it's being respectful or not hans plays knight bd2 the other idea of rook e1 not just supporting the center is that you put the knight on d2 f1 and g3 these are like all of the little intricate details of the italian if you really do want to uncover some mysteries of chess and challenge your brain maneuvering and closed the talion positions will actually help with that for most of us in myself included i don't find this type of maneu maneuvering that interesting um but it definitely unlocks a whole component of your brain you also can uh explore positions that have been played in the italian over hundreds of years like this opening has been getting played in the early 20th century mid 20th century now 21st century right so bishop e6 is a major decision and now does white take does he damage black's pawns and open up his file here uh or does he play this move bishop to b5 basically surrendering the diagonal to black but saying i want to take the knight and then i want to play for d4 and you can't get me out of there because you have played the move a5 this has been played many many times so if you look at the database this position has been reached many times at to top level at at medium level at low level uh by low level i mean like 2,300 uh it's been played a lot and so here the critical move by black is this very odd queen b8 which you can tell from shas's time spend like they both memorize this right this is just top level chest they memorize to a point then they play on their own queen b8 serves two purposes anticipate the opening of the b file to have the queen there and the second idea is actually to bring the queen this way where it targets the f2 pawn which white weakened with his move rook e one because white was so busyy trying to make his plan work and also a4 and then bringing the queen there to target the bishop the move queen b8 queen a7 like that's a ridiculous plan but the second that it gets played once at top level chess it just gets played all the time because it's the silently agreed upon way at top level to equalize here for black because at the end of the day what are you trying to do with black and white trying to get to an equal position first and then you're trying to fight hans plays knight f1 instead of taking right away black plays queen a7 and here hans plays the second most common move so now we have follow follow the main line right in chess you follow the main line now we're going to two branches there's two choices here the more common move by far is bishop to e3 about 3 to one i think according to the database the second most common move is rook e2 which hans has actually played before hans played this way in 2022 in august at the united states chess championship or the singfield cup i can't recall i think it's the us championship but it could be the singfield cup in st louis against wesley so so hans has played like this before he defends his pawn this is the second most common move in the position now black plays this move a4 trying trying to play queen a5 and also advance here softening up this position hans now plays knight to g3 black plays queen a5 and already uh there are things that can happen in this position that have been played before hans himself against wesley in 2022 played queen c2 then he played c4 blocking the bishop and fighting for the center then he played bishop d2 that game ultimately ended in a draw the most common move in this position is right away playing knight h4 white has a majority of pieces on the king side so if white is able to put a knight on f5 exerting pressure on g7 and h6 then potentially bring the queen over there white has very serious potent attacking chances because black's queen is sort of wandered off black is relying on the element of timeliness he's going to time counterplay on this side of the board and you know done the right way he's going to break in and and white is actually going to have to play defense white is not going to be able to attack because the entire kingdom is collapsing behind him so that's all to say that after uh that after rook c2 none of that n none of that even happens so hans played queen c2 against wesley the most common move is knight h4 hans plays now a move that's been played three times ever so it has been played somebody made a small improvement but what is the idea right like this is kind of a new move to shus who as you can see spends about four minutes and responds but it's a new move it has been played before three times only it's a new move for you know like for for for hans let's say uh and uh what's the point like why did he go here why why get your rook away from the king's position well the idea is that white wants to create an attack right so we got to ask ourselves in any chess position what do you want what what do the sides want it's a closed position both sides still have eight pawns a closed position can have certain openings it does have an opening here so hans needs to make sure shes doesn't bulldoze this side of the board if he's able to lock that down now the next thing hans has to ask himself in any close position is does my opponent have a pawn break does my opponent have an opportunity to wreck the position with pawn play that could potentially jeopardize my my my my position or my control of squares or demand my attention to take away from my opportunity of attacking like let's say by putting my knight here what does hans want potentially d4 or or hans wants an attack like that is what hans is going to try to make happen so black plays rook b8 now it's a new game up until this point we were in known territory some some moves have been played before it's officially the brand new first move shes commits both rooks to this side of the board and says hans i don't think you have a sufficient attack on the king side hans plays c4 so the bishop is now blocked right this bishop he might try to put it there to defend and to pressure question is can black land the move d5 successfully we're going to find out shes plays queen b6 all right repositioning the queen to retarget this on f2 uh he had many options i mean he could have just played a waiting move as well like king h7 he plays queen b6 which puts pressure here and on the f2 pawn right so queen e2 han's patient guards everything patiently right patiently waiting just moving every just optimally and he's going to try to maybe put that bishop there maybe put the rook there this idea knight h4 knight f5 still very much on the cards monitoring this monitoring this trees plays king h7 another waiting move you can kind of tell black is just making slow steady improvements bringing his king a little bit to the defense you might think oh he's bringing his king out no he's just bringing it to defend the pawns hans plays rook b1 it's very clear hans is letting this go and potentially is going to prepare a b pawn advance but you really that's that's weird that's countering two intive but maybe that's the right decision now his opponent plays queen a7 he's still very much waiting like if hans plays rook a1 and and and black plays like king g8 like it's up to hans now he could say i don't want to do anything and black is not in a position to call the shots the second black starts getting aggressive he's going to lose a pawn right so he can't really call the shots so bahans plays bishop d2 he's not looking to make a draw he's trying to put his bishop there defend slowly rotate right you got to ask yourself as well in a close position which of these pieces do i want to trade bishop b6 and now sensing his opponent is going back hans lashes out and that's a very important decision it's an important decision because the existence of this pawn is a problem for black he's got to take it why let's say he just waits hans now will just play a3 you can't move any of this you move this pawn i and i look at look what happens to your bishop and i got bad news you move this pawn this bishop is really going to die he just going to perish it's a very tough spot so now shes has to play ab hans plays ab now even though he surrendered control of this file there's no way in white controls the infiltration spots white has a brick wall and now black plays c5 that is the top engine move but that move makes me a little bit like that makes me vomit you know a bit like what about the bishop well black is stopping d4 that's what black is doing and maybe black has a pipe dream of getting the knight there like here here here and then to d4 maybe the bishop is just going to maybe that's the idea he's just going to trade the bishop right well his opponent locks the position the attacking side benefits from a closed center so while all these pieces are mummified standing on this side of the board h says knight h4 and he begins attacking operations he plays knight to h4 wants to put the knight on f5 maybe wants to get in with his queen on the light squares or the dark squares this r is going to come here black is still looking for bishop a5 but he can't play it because all of a sudden he's going to lose his he's going to lose right you go here there's this so you can't do that so kn h4 now shus backs up he's trying to reroute he's looking to either go there there or there there there which is what i said and now as his opponent is retreating hans piles on the pressure while keeping the guard high f4 one of the most effective ways to start an attack in chess is with your pawns bringing the pieces that you have the most of they're worth the least get the pawn in the game f4 black takes if he doesn't take it could be really bad for example let's say he continues with his plan black is suddenly gasping for air the bishop is pushed back f6 the pawns are now split queen h5 hits this hits this game over that's bad so f4 pawn takes f4 hans takes back but that trade just activated a whole new piece what did that trade activate not the bishop that trade activated the rooks now white is gonna suddenly have the exact same position that he had but with rooks involved black plays rook e8 at this point you can sort of sense the entire opening black has played is intended to create counterplay over here right but all of a sudden black is playing on white's demands look at black bringing the pieces back the queens side attack was not successful rook to e8 and hans plays a move here i don't get he plays bishop d2 i think the idea is simply to put the bishop on that diagonal but i would have played rook f1 but that's also why i'm commentating the game and he's playing it so he reroutes the bishop to this diagonal right now black plays c6 the idea of c6 is very simple you just want to go here because what you're trying to do as black is create chaos white is still trying to attack you over here that's what i've been telling you since the beginning of this game that's what white wants that's why he built this wall in the center black wants to go here now black still can't get in and black has a terrible bishop on b6 so hans plays knight f5 low depth game review does not appreciate how good this move is if i ran game review it would call this an inaccuracy but the idea is really brutal this knight is being sent in to target everything but also to die what not like this that's not what i mean that knight is being sent in because black is going to create counterplay with d5 now watch this hans plays bishop c3 this move is designed to force a move out of black the move that hans is trying to get trus to play is d4 why would he allow the pawn to march all the way into his territory because the dopamine of hitting the bishop and blocking it after this is gone and black has the same problems he always did which is what do i do with that barrier what do i do with that barrier how am i going to activate my pieces i can't get my knight into the center now a locked center position benefits the attacking side stockfish of course thinks black is better stockfish goes here activating this bishop on this diagonal basically says black is better but if you let stockfish run high enough not like that type of high like high depth the position's barely better for black if at all hans now plays queen f3 looking to improve the pressure on the f file and remember a moment ago i told you this knight was sent in to die this is what i meant the knight is attacked the knight has no forward mobility at all it's got to go back and you can argue well this pawn move weaken the dark squares nope in this position an neiman sacrificed his knight g4 that knight has been sent in to die whoa and it's very simple if you take i take with my g pawn or my e pawn this one looks more natural to me you go back play queen h5 this is not a threat but that is if bishop e5 i reroute and i build my forces and i get in bishop c1 rook g2 so g4 and black plays bishop d8 he's trying to line up the bishops against his h's knights but it's just a matter of time right now hans is in a situation where he's playing hope chess he's improving his position but he's hoping his opponent is going to take when you have a position like this there's the first domino in the position that has to fall and then the rest of them fall but there we can't find the first domino we're hoping this is the first domino but trees royale is a really good player and he doesn't really like losing on purpose so he's not going to take on f5 so hans now has to reroute it's like how a plane has to land right sometimes you have to fly around the airport once knight g2 hanza is now coming back he is going to return on the f4 square or he's going to transfer that knight out or he's going to attack the pawn on h6 or he's going to play rook f1 get the bishop there and play rook rook to f2 or bishop f4 bishop e5 and black just can't do anything black had that temporary dopamine rush of pushing h's pieces back but he can't do anything so if hans waits let's say hans goes queen b8 sh f4 hans waits just played i don't know queen a7 she going to move back and forth soon white is going to build everything up get his knight there right play e5 right bring a rook here and shes no longer feels comfortable right he doesn't it's a matter of feeling a little bit uncomfortable here and he basically is like okay he moved back i don't believe him i take his knight g takes f5 and that is like getting on a roller coaster g takes f5 and uh here we go hunt takes now a moment ago i showed you this position with the knight still involved so the position that's here certainly has to be worse for white right i mean black has a whole piece covering white's attack well h nean down a full piece a full piece that he sacrificed for one pawn in this position plays the cool calm collected king to h1 what's the point the point is simple in chess one of the elements is time and right now white has the time white has the time to start construction on his own house he has the time he's is going to play rook g1 the only way you reject a move like king to h1 is by looking around and going which of these pieces can do damage to my position and when five out of six of your opponent's pieces are on the back rank and there's a gigantic brick wall in the center of the board you very quickly realize nobody can do anything and a lazy move like knight f6 will just immediately force the knight back so king h1 and i think at this point sh has realized oh i might be in trouble so he played queen e7 he brought the queen back to the center trying to defend himself the computer still evaluates his position as slightly better but here comes hans neeman rook g1 but where's the attack like okay i can see on g7 we have a mate right queen g4 queen g7 like i'm going to get the knight out of the way but shes plays bishop c7 he cuts this diagonal of access hans plays queen h5 it's like we all know what hans's pieces are going for he's down a piece he can't go to an end game hans is going to play king h1 rook g1 queen h5 bring his knight try to double his rooks and try to go for a win we all know what's about to happen can we stop it black plays bishop e5 centralizing the bishop hans brings the knight back to h4 the idea of knight to h4 it's not that the knight wants to go to g6 it's not that at all it actually just wants to reroute to f3 and what it's doing on f3 is permanently pressuring the bishop also potentially knight g5 so for example if black plays like rook b7 does nothing i have sacrifices looming around the black king so the knight goes back to f3 black plays bishop to g7 hansen proves yet another one of his pieces seizing control of this diagonal and the other thing is this bishop now opened up the path for his rook to play rook to g2 bishop f8 and hans nean is winning the idea of bishop f fate is to meet this move with getting the knight out and that is winning as well but bishop fed was played in this position and in this position hans neiman sacrificed the rook rook takes g8 but what could possibly be the idea okay well this is the idea now this is a check and the idea is to remove the pawn from the defense of the king so if you play king h8 bishop h6 is game over but what if you play king h7 well you lose on the g file you cannot stop queen g8 mate how insane is that if bishop g7 queen g7 you have no other way to move your bishop you can give a check i go here and you could sack your queen that delays the the inevitable so rook takes g8 rook takes g2 bishop g7 and in this position h demon decided to sacrifice the second rook kook takes g7 i can't fully yell because my throat hurts rook takes g7 both rooks sacrifice to open up the king the king is no longer with his knight and bishop this bishop has been walled out for the entire game the queen is hardly a defender of the king and it's not that we go in with the queen now we do it in a much more clean way we take like this the point is that the black king cannot go to g8 because then that and that is mate so after bishop takes h6 the king goes to h7 and hansan plays here oops he plays bishop g5 he takes the queen pawn to f6 it'ss the rook that's mate and if you go here i can play e5 i i can play here i can play check check check take everything so pawn to f6 and shas royale resigned that was a cool game if we hit game review on it this game review says some believe the greek gift sacrifice was named after g gino greco who was italian even though it was called the greek gift that's very confusing speaking of greek gift this game had a few of those uh i have game review set to 1 minute so i'm going to you know entertain you by flailing my arms on screen because this is funny and you guys probably you know you're probably very easily entertained they say my average audience age is like 11 but it's not it's like 20 something which is so three brilliancies knight g2 leaving the night to die which by the way i thought was even gangster to play g4 but uh a brilliant tech for getting rid of his rooks bril brilliant number two rook takes g8 boink and brilliant number three rook takes g7 that was a very sophisticated attacking game and you know hans did it in a way where he played a line he was very well familiar with a line that has been played many times by many top players and he played it himself including rook e2 but this time he went for this other line rook c2 which clearly he had worked on toay stabilize the queen side first with moves like c4 queen e2 rook b1 and this very interesting idea to play b4 which stockfish thinks is an inaccuracy on its game review but it's actually kind of hard to get through right kind of hard to get through in this position and then the way he just galloped to the other side of the board used his pawn to open things up transferred his knight in and then baited his opponent in to lock the center and i mean g g4 knight g2 this was some cool stuff this was some cool stuff black should have not probably not taken but i'm not sure what he would have done if he didn't i mean hans would have went for the exact same type of attack so hans is currently uh i think he's three out of five in the tournament he's uh made four draws and he won this very nice game and he's tweeting after every round so you know i wouldn't say that the chess is speaking for itself quite quite yet but with games like this i'm you know i'm happy to say that perhaps it is perhaps it might and uh yeah i mean what what more can you say this was a really really nice game really sophisticated game how to maneuver in a close position i'm going to go rest my throat pause hope you all have a great december 5th i'll see you in the next video get out of here
