okay i did see this i think this is very interesting let's just take a quick little looky at this one i just experienced a recruiter horror story today he sent one email that included the time and the meeting outlook made from it it was indeed for five uh he created an entire novel in his head about me uh by the way if you do a picture like this you should also include the email just so people people have the context and second i just have a quick question he created an email did was there not like a meeting was there not like a calendar meeting if there was no calendar meeting such that you have a place to go and join it' be crazy because this is crazy what happens here but right away like if you were like real talk if you got an invite to do an interview and there was no invite like to an okay there was no calendar meeting that's crazy like that's insane to be like yo bro let's have a meeting we're going to meet here at 5: you're like where are we going to meet call this number you're like damn that's kind of strange why don't we just make like a calendar invite where we can work together on this one n dog just call this number 5:00 you're just like my 5:00 your 5:00 which 5:00 are we talking about anyways uh the the absence of an invite calendar is crazy right all right amed why did you no show to your interview with blah today hello did the time get changed i have it on my calendar for 5 eastern in 30 minutes you are an idiot and super unreliable by the way that's crazy response i had somebody recently tried to give me a contract to work with them that would effectively take all of everything i worked on and make it their property like anything i worked on any tool that i used and that i would have no rights to it now do you want to guess how i responded to that contract well i find that this contract overreaches a little bit on what it allows for you to take and for what me to take i think we need to go back to the drawing board and be able to rehash out what needs to be done here what i didn't do is go yo you guys are [ __ ] cor corupt what's wrong with you dumb asses right like nobody does that nobody does that because you got to be you got to think ahead you know there's like a bridge okay it doesn't matter how much you think they're being dumb you always respond nicely right no matter no matter what it is you should always respond nicely i've seen so many people burn bridges because they didn't just take a moment and realize that everything you say might just fly out into the public right right being polite is the key being polite is very good because sometimes it's a misunderstanding and you could easily overcome a misunderstanding like oh yeah my bad not not if you have fu money i even think if you have fu money you should still try to do the like you should still attempt to communicate in a way that makes sense uh what if i'm the [ __ ] you never know yeah i know you're an idiot and super unreliable it's no wonder you did not finish college man bro bro went on linkedin and is like digging up this guy's past man i have one month left too wait hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on you have one month left so hold on does that mean you literally are finishing college i am finishing college in one month yes oh my goodness dude such a skill issue you should have finished college last year dumbass like come on yo why didn't you just finish college in the past if you were actually good you would have finished it sooner dude come on you're weak that's dude that's crazy you wasted many people's valuable time i won't work with you again and i will do my best to make sure other recruiters and companies know the same i sent you all of this information multiple times text email etc and you confirmed it shame on you okay okay okay again again i i strongly always recommend you put the you you put the receipts you put the receipts you make sure that you put the emails and and explain those things because here's the deal as an outside reader i may not know i mean i think this guy's communication is really unprofessional but if you don't also include the receipts like how do i know who's the who's who's the one uh saying uh the truth here no shot this is real this is real i agreed fighting words you got yeah so so put put a little put a little extra put a little extra ump on it uh this is incredibly unprofessional response if it's true that the time is incorrect or uh time isn't correct i understand why this may seem unprofessional but to berate someone who insults with insults is incredibly unprofessional i'll be contacting blah blah blah accordingly wait hold on you never picked up or returned calls confirmed with myself and in turn e7 and then no showed for an interview and played dumb after you missed the interview you put me in an uncomfortable situation with my client and their hiring manager by the way okay so okay so i see this person obviously works as like a hired hired head hunter by the way i don't see how that's uncomfortable real talk i don't see how that puts you in an uncomfortable situation be like oh man that's that's that's wild that's uh kind of sounds like his job yeah it it it sounds like this guy is having strong performance issues in finding candidates clearly doesn't use basic tools like a calendar invite and then a shook when things don't work out like i'm i'm surprised that there's an e7 that's like yo dog where's the calendar invite right yo where's that calendar invite i mean the whole thing smells of of of oddities here uh put me in uncomfortable situation with my client and their hiring manager and couldn't care less about wasting others times you need to grow up and remove your narcissistic personality from the professional world is that like a commit stop breathing i'm not really sure how to how to take that one is is the man asking him to go take some take a sidoku not really sure here uh take responsibility your actions impacted many people's valuable time good luck exclamation point what's with the good luck at the end good luck though hey yo wish you the best wish you the best i hate you wish you the best baby go out there and get them by removing yourself from this professional world i want you to remove yourself in the most aggressive way from this professional world but good luck out there on your job finds just like what what is this this is not passive aggressive this is not passive aggressive this is just aggressive br in modernity it's poite to wish people good luck after being uh super passive aggressive i don't know if this is not none of this is passive aggressive this is just aggressive this is just aggressive aggressive best best with love this sounds like a toxic interaction with the valerant lobby yo dog when you say a toxic intera interaction with a valerant lobby you could have also just said a valerant lobby like you don't really need to qualify that you know what i mean it's just like the call of duty battle royale ending credits you don't need to call it a racist experience you just say i made it to the end of a call of duty lobby and everyone's like oh yeah yeah i know i i know what happens then dude that that by the way that stuff is wild that like if you make it to the end if you win a battle royale in in any of the modern c call of duties it's just like get me out of here but i also want to watch me climbing into the helicopter voice chat is traumatizing voice chat is just hard traumatizing it's black ops 2 yeah y'll sof these days you don't know nothing about black ops 2 lobbies the lobbies were so [ __ ] up i like i feel bad for anybody that doesn't get to grow up with black ops 2 lobbies cuz i feel like you had to just you just had to have such the ability to let anything roll off of you like the amount of times my mom has been the center of attention in a black ops 2 lobby was insane okay my mother apparently has had sex with a lot of people on the internet okay i don't know what my mom's doing but i'll tell you this much my mom she's gotten around okay shocking i was shocked to find this out shocked shook to the core well there you go this just happened um by the way you know it's always good to remember that everything you say mayor may not make it into public domain you know it's why i have this general rule of thumb that if you took any of my dms almost exclusively none of them would get me in trouble and the reason why is that i i've learned over time that it's a it's it's dangerous or just delete your dms yeah if someone takes a picture though i always communicate in such a way that i i don't care if all of it came out cuz that that it's much it's just much smarter caught too many times sending dickpics huh yeah yeah yeah because you know what you don't want to be on this end of a tweet this is a bad end of the tweet to be on okay wild it's a it's it is wild that someone would communicate in such a way especially like this it's no wonder you did not finish college like especially if you're like you're a month away from finishing college like that that that just seems like a that's just like a weak insult also just one more piece of advice here if you're going to go out there and uh say some dumb stuff and then you get um you get called out i would strongly recommend you just own it never apologize never apologize is when people accuse you of dumb stuff right like when i fed milk to warren buffering and then got accused of racism because we drank from a gallon of milk did i ever apologize no i refuse but if i was just like yo [ __ ] that guy he's a weak ass hey yo you didn't even finish college and someone's like yo look at how he talked to me i'd go so damn you know what that was pretty shitty of me
