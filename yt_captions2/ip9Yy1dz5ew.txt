brandon what happened to your computer your whole house has been taken over by babies is this your workstation um and the dream office i painted for you as a nightmare looks like a prison cell in here it's clear to me that if there's anyone in tech crisis right now in need of a 5 000 intel extreme tech upgrade makeover it's our og camera operator brandon but i couldn't help noticing that you're kind of trying to double dip here because i already built you a computer that's true it is a little old now so what are we doing today we're building the best photography editing setup i could think of there's also a camera show and your wi-fi sucks right yes well i couldn't help noticing part of the problem is that you have it sitting on a box at the very corner of your house well okay we'll talk about that we'll talk about that we're gonna fix that thanks intel we're gonna have some fun today [music] the first thing we're gonna do is walk around his house and find all of the things that are not supposed to be here like say for example this ifixit kit has my name on it right but at work there's so many that we've had over the years why would you need to have it labeled brandon well hey is that how i set this up so that we could use it with the ifixit kit which explains nothing about this one well yeah but it's brazen it's brazen ladies and gentlemen he steals not one but two also this was supposed to be my office that's why it's here but now this is gonna be the baby's room yes it really is a good thing that you had this room painted by such a professional painter i don't know i see some flaws linus hold on this is actually not my finest work back on topic i'm assuming that this is not going to be replaced oh no you don't recognize this oh my god is this stolen from the office yes crying out loud it's a very temporary solution i had a much worse just telco router and i needed something that was performing slightly better but then my upgrade was going to happen soon so there was no point like you know setting up the brand new one so i borrowed one that means your wi-fi is decent now already just from having a better router so it can only get better once we have a multi-access point set up cool that's going to be awesome this i'm pretty sure you bought yes the good old razer blades does yours still work so i replaced the battery in this from an ebay battery it didn't work really so it turns on plugged in but it's soon i was i was testing yes these were our christmas bonus uh i used it for a long time six seven years ago uh prototype ltt mousepad what is it with the og employees thinking they're entitled to our prototypes well ed had more than one of these in the swag pile i can see why you need a camera stuff yeah i know it's just like oh my god brandon's a photography nerd and there's no reason for him to own a photography nerd thing unless it has some kind of specific purpose this made in china 35 millimeter focus free point-and-shoot why do you have it i found this in my mom's house she had no idea why she had this and i think it was like a toy camera that someone gave to her for me you could actually look at this and it's technically my first camera even though i don't remember using it as a child remember at the beginning when we were using my lenses for work i bought this at that time i couldn't afford lenses okay i'm 99 sure that this isn't stolen from work but like the guy needs a camera shelf that's my first camera what this you just told me a different camera was your first camera that was child's first so now you're a thief and a liar now i don't think what are you what is that face i'm just waiting for your judgment no i i i built this computer technically sort of very nice it has changed since you built yeah i mean obviously i didn't do this since you built me this pc the cooler motherboard and gpu have changed and the cpu so most of it's changed except for the power supply the cpu started to get pretty sluggish recently so i i kind of just stopped using this desktop honestly altogether because i got an xps and then that was working better oh oh percy would you like to go out hi he really wants to go outside okay buddy let's cut you upstairs no doubt this new machine is going to be a lot better now i know you've fancied the h1 for quite some time in fact didn't you buy so actually over here what is that another one this was the one i originally bought yeah and then nzxt heard that i was going to use my upgrade with the original version of the h1 which i'm sure many people know the problem set itself on fire technically to ndx credit they sent me the new screws and they sent me the new gpu riser okay so i have that actually over there also i will admit there's one more thing from the office still here that i you still have one of those yes you're not the only one but these lg 31 inch 4k monitors some of them disappeared because well linus went you know just temporarily i might need to use them at home to do like work sometimes and then none of them made their way back give me that give give me that there you go you're turning into logistics i'm gonna start unpacking computer hardware stuff then in the meantime maybe you build the computer while i build the shelf because that might take a bit and then also unbox some of the other stuff oh my god i see a lot more than just one ikea box here so yeah we need to call in an emergency logistics strike here let's let's ask someone to come help us and we have a surprise guest this is my partner sophia hi there we go there so there we go did i scratch it oh no that's not supposed to be there i saw this line i was like if that was you scratching it that's straighter than your paint lines oh david throwing shades oh are we gonna meet another surprise guest [applause] brandon's baby gives me so much joy because he's the first one of the other dads at lmg that has had a baby as challenging or more challenging than my firstborn he's happy about this because he wants me to suffer the way he did the good news is that like my son's amazing yeah and so you'll probably be amazing you know i'm sure there's a correlation i mean i was apparently a really easy baby and i turned out awful awkward question for you brandon i couldn't help noticing that this is a many generations old motherboard i bought this from the office with the cpu that's in this box it's still intel that's true the 9700k is a great chip it just felt wasteful i didn't need to buy more so i figured use what i have fair enough i've been cursed with front i o on every desktop pc i've ever used my office my office pc front i o doesn't work this computer that linus built for me the io front i o never worked so far the common denominator is that i built both of those machines but it's not me it's not me the fronto works on lots of other computers i've built the headers are plugged in it just didn't work so i'm going to be interested to see if the front tire on this guy works it'll work i give you my linus tech tips guarantee that your front i o will work okay i sincerely hope that this gpu fits what this is a really beefy i 3016 told that it would fit with all the cooling thank you evga oh that looks solid yeah we're good to go do you have the instructions uh i i couldn't find them in the box do they haven't instructions suck well the instructions suck but i'd still say you're better off with them without them wait what's this oh okay so she's more competent than me this is why she's taking care of a baby every day and i'm just pointing cameras at things yeah exactly great i'm kidding i'm kidding we work really hard we're working i'm joking yeah the one thing that brandon actually assembled before we got here you assemble the lamp oh but it's a stick this is okay how would you assemble this lamp minus that is a pretty cool lamp you didn't clean it brandon i yeah oh my gosh i actually probably need to it's so dirty on the inside yeah i need to take it off and take it apart so brandon be all like yeah i thought that's i built that too um by the way we're gonna have to take it apart and rebuild so actually you did negative it's a later problem uh steel case chair i've never actually tried a steel case i've tried herman miller i've tried like all the different gaming brands and everything i actually like the way they do the lumbar support it's like hard but padded okay that's a good quality foam you know what's funny about this i will have still not built my own computer why am i letting you get away with this i've already got my pcie riser hooked up they've got this really nice little plastic piece that keeps you from folding it too much or too little this is a terrible screwdriver totally unprompted okay she has no horses in this race but you're complaining that's a terrible screwdriver okay i'll give you i'll give you ours i'll see what you think i want your completely unbiased thoughts on it well yeah it's better because it doesn't shake the whole time it's not available yet but it's coming very soon one disadvantage to an older platform even though the performance might be fine is that you might not have support for the latest standards though brandon at best your front i o is going to be about 75 functional because you don't have a usbc front panel header on here wait does this even support m.2 it please tell me it does is it on the back of the board oh it is it is it is i thought it did i like looked at this okay oh my god linus you're gonna give me a heart attack let's put your ssd in wow you went with a rocket four plus okay i can tell you right now you're not getting the most out of this ssd because this is gen 4 and this is a gen 3 board yeah ikea furniture wait what why does it feel like it's not fitting wait is someone making that noise or is that the ikea furniture that's the baby oh that's the baby can i just say how much i love my job today i think this is upside down because there's a hole up there cavalry is here surge from logistics apparently was out but not off hdmi power did i ever wire up the front um that's not a great sign this cpu and this motherboard are not compatible what oh no dude your board's only good up to seventh gen that's why it's not turning on so okay so are there any itx boards uh we don't have very many oh what's this 10th jen how much budget do you have left over brandon none i'm actually a little bit over budget okay give me some time okay i watched andy's upgrade back in the day and i saw his benq light bar thing and i just had to have one apparently this is the newer version that has a better controller said andy so i'm excited to actually unbox it and see how this goes well i'm glad you put so much thought into your lamp i mean while i'm sitting here shopping for motherboards linus lighting is a very important part of my life so is a functioning computer because this is the lowest floor of my house my garage door is actually behind david right now and the door to the outside being blocked by this shelf is where we go on walks so i always come in here and tractor in and yes you can get rugs that help with that but it's never perfect so vacuum we just had these at the office i think they're from the channel superfund where they sucked up sand oh yeah yeah so there's a very high chance there's already sand in this oh nice perfect there's nothing used nothing new nothing borrowed nothing blue just nothing i'm sorry cpus are so reliable that once it's a couple of years out of current there ends up being this like glut of cpu availability and almost no motherboards for them because the motherboards are dying and the cpus are not yeah and because it's itx i mean the sales volume of itx i could find you anything you need if it's atx if we're going 12th gen we actually have modern boards at the office this is hilarious he's like no man i'm gonna i'm gonna use like old intel it's like good enough and we're going 12th gen after hey but your front io the curse is lifted it's true yet to be lifted the computer isn't on yet you know what why don't we send surge to get the 12 400 and find a motherboard okay i'll get the wi-fi fixed oh sure this monitor is going to be such a game changer for you i am so excited about this monitor it is everything i've ever wanted in a monitor and more so when it comes to just editing photos you're not after necessarily the brightest freaking display so what you want is calibration what you want is size obviously now the thing is i think i actually was the one who shot the short circuit for this you were i don't remember anything about it because we're in a quite vertically tall but small town house it doesn't really affect us that much because they're not going to be so far from each other that it's going to be a real problem for them to talk to each other the main thing we need to consider is how we stagger them from floor to floor we've got three stories to work with so we want to go like this then like this then like this in order to optimize the coverage of each one that means our next order of business is doing some scouting i know there's ethernet here because this is where brandon used to have his desktop and there it is we're going to use that for one of our decos i'm installing this fully monitor arm if you can tell right here david there's a slant of the wood on my desk so it's not flat when it bites which i think might be a problem because that monitor is not super light this can just go like this cable managed gorgeous the way that this is attached is just like a screw here so if we loosen the screw we might get more play heck yeah come have a look at this it actually worked amazing better than i could have expected oh my god that's like that's clean on there yeah we could put the deco here in this room but it would basically be right under the one that i put in the kitchen okay the other place for it would be in the garage but there's really nothing wi-fi in the garage so oh wait you do ota updates on your car i do well that should it would be good if those are fast yeah okay i'm gonna put this in the garage then i'm just gonna put on that shoe rack okay sure okay just got the vase amount on hopefully i do this right does it slide in this way there we go hey oh okay so i clearly have some tension adjustment to do you had slash half yes and eight it's already right here oh there it is here's my eight bay that i've had forever it is filled with four terabyte drives right that's not a lot of capacity these days no it is not and i didn't really want to have to go through all the trouble of moving all the data from that nas to maybe the server at work temporarily and then put it all back onto something else so you're gonna be a two-naz household now yes this is a not a perfect solution to my problem because eventually this will also run out yeah but it's kicking this can down the road yes future brandon will find another solution to this long time future brandon because each one of these individual drives and you went with exo's enterprise nice each of these drives holds as much as half of that nas so you've doubled tripled this will be used for parity you've tripled your storage yes in only five bays instead of eight yes nice this should be just absolutely killer perfect wi-fi all over the house now these tend to be a little bit sticky in terms of which access point they're connected to i doubt i'm connected to this one i'm probably connected to the one on the other floor but i mean even connected to the the mid-floor one it's very usable i just don't see wi-fi being a problem anywhere in this house from now on okay let's go fix that computer the good news is you're getting the most out of your gen 4 ssd now here comes our 12 400 this is six performance cores and then four efficiency cores for a total of ten i mean the more important thing is that alder lake compared to what did you have a 9th gen yeah 9th gen yes way better single threaded performance which for applications like photoshop can actually be more important than your multi-threaded performance depending on what you're doing we've got oh what even is this 5200 mega transfer per second 2 by 16. here's one thing i expect well here is the kingston workflow station sd card reader micro sd card reader cfast card reader is this kind of a spiritual successor to that lexar thing we used to really like we have this at the office now oh okay cool and i was like well i have to have one for myself you have these little modules that have different io like this is a type c one and a type a and then these ones sdsd more more sd i probably only asked rest the king of sd he's a standard definition kind of guy and the cool thing about them is that you can use them in here right where it just uses a single usbc connection to your computer or because it's all usbc all the time you can just plug a usbc cable into this and it's just a super lightweight small card reader and you can take it with you on the go thanks kingston i'd say that the fit and finish of the molds we actually have tape around the ones that are at work not amazing but uh minor critique guys please tell me you have thermal compound what what i'm kidding i'm kidding when i went back for the motherboards i got some don't do this to me why you have to leave soon we're not even close to done yeah i know but i'm not the one who's getting upset how are you planning to connect this computer and those nas's to the network i had a switch upstairs so i could bring it down in a perfect world i'm gonna get like best of storage or something for above my desk and i'll drill a hole through it run the nas on the top so that this cable just goes straight up instead of going down and then brandon's gonna celebrate his kid's sixth birthday because that's how long it's gonna take to get to that i'm getting real close on this pc by the way boys okay well my speakers are about to get plugged in nice okay we're close then is this non-ltt desk pad part of your upgrade yes surely you knew you were gonna take some flack for that as much as i like the ltt store design it doesn't quite match my setup that's fair we do need some more colors it's kind of amazing for how far away we were 20 minutes ago you're not bad how not far away we are now oh buddy there it is hey did it just post it did nice 32 gigs ram core i5 12 400 k everything's detected there's our m.2 drive hey that looks pretty good hey that looks awesome one of the last editions i haven't talked about yet is these 95 cri 40 watt led bulbs that i'm going to put all in the light fixtures in the room and that is also what is in this lamp and why do you need those color accuracy no i know you're explaining to the audience god these these are pretty bright pretty efficient and dimmable and it'll make the pleasantness of the color of this room a lot better day to day um brandon do you have a usb type c something that i can plug in and make sure your front i o works does the keyboard work sure does okay all right how about now wait wait wait we're not done yet does the keyboard work yes okay third time's a charm does the keyboard work wow the curse is over okay what's the dance of the front port working oh my goodness okay don't break anything you've gone full dad now yeah that's hilarious i don't think the brandon lee i first met would have done a curses over dance it's j it's something about just not sleeping for a year yeah you stop caring this is not bad i don't know dude i cannot say that i'm sold on this particular does this turn it turns it does but why would you ever want to shine light at your monitor it's not going at the monitor it's going down it's going straight down you know what the setup looks beautiful let me just turn off the light there you go now you're like you know you're taking some notes i can see without having to have a lamp that only shines in one direction not in where i'm looking and then i have my other lamp there with the higher cri bulb that's also just adding a little bit of ambience so you're in the zone now yes well there's no doubt in my mind this is about as ultimate as it gets for a photography editing workstation we've got powerful single threaded performance with an intel 12 400 another 64 terabytes of storage added color accurate lighting for the room not to mention a color accurate monitor all the ingest capabilities that any one man could possibly desire on top of a camera storage that takes all the random stuff that we found all throughout the house and gets it out of brandon's poor eso's way not to mention prevents all of it from being chewed on by the baby yes the only thing it still needs at this point is a little bit more tlc in terms of cable management but we'll get that sorted out by the time you guys are looking at this gorgeous glamtage of the finished setup i hope you guys enjoyed intel xtreme tech upgrade brandon lee edition massive thanks to intel and if you guys are looking for something else to watch then maybe go check out man what would be if you enjoyed this one you might enjoy riley's as well the minimalistic setup
