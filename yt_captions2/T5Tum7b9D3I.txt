log base e hickie do channel hix's natural log that's pretty funny what am i looking at reflecting on' years at google i joined google in october 20 uh 2005 i actually was interviewing at google dearing nearish this time and handed my in my resignation' years later last week was my last week at google i feel very lucky to have experienced the early post ipo google unlike most companies and contrary to the popular narrative googlers from the junior engineer all the way to the sea suite were genuinely good people who cared very much about doing the right thing they of mocked don't be evil truly was the guiding principles of the company at the time i actually can i can immediately relate to this being at a company for a long period of time uh i i always have this one story i reflect back on where you know we had a big internal secret that was about to be made public but we held on to the internal secret uh for for a year and we are able to do it for a year straight with thousands of people knowing that secret and it never got leaked yet nowadays could never do it the difference as time goes on in companies really does change the the that initial momentum culture that really made it great to begin with and so i can totally understand this as well it's like the initial people maybe they really wanted to do some good stuff right maybe they really wanted to make great great things happen uh largely a reaction to contemporaries like microsoft whose operating procedures put profits far above the best interest of the customers and humanity as a whole good thing they have 49% of open ai you know you know what i mean good thing they h uh many times i saw google criticized for actions that were sincerely intended to be good for society google books for example i remember interviewing in boston they had some of the google books like dude they would literally like they would take a book and like cut it they had all these machine things to actually physically try to make this possible for uh for example much of the criticism google received around chrome and search especially around supposed conflicts of interest with ads was way off base it's surprising how often coincidences and mistakes appear malicious yeah i mean this is more of a bias problem right if you have someone you like who makes an accident you look at it as endearing you look you have someone who you don't like who makes an accident you look at it as if it was like evil or wrong or they're doing something against you you know what i mean like this is a very normal thing to happen and it extends to companies as well if you don't like a company that's just that you know what i mean like uh people are comparing uh right now asmin gold and pokem man because pokem man effectively called her chat a bunch of broke boys because they couldn't af afford her $7 per 4 ounce of cookies cookies and asmin gold said twitch chat or twitch culture is for losers and uh pokemon man got on but asmin gold didn't and i think there's a couple reasons for that but i think one of the biggest primary reasons is it has nothing to do with bias and it has everything to do with selling something versus just insulting in your audience hey all of you you're just a bunch of js andes little script kitties a bunch of little react devs out there who don't even don't you learned react before javascript okay yeah yeah that's what i'd say true and factual canell i think there's a huge difference now if i was selling you something and i said that it's just different you know what i mean if i'm selling you a high priced item and then came down with yeah you guys can't afford this because you guys are a bunch of react devs all of the sudden we got ourselves a bit of a situation developing you know what i mean seems like a cash grab that's how people look at it i often saw privacy advocates argue against google proposals in ways that were not net harmful to users some of these fights have had lasting effects on the world at large one of the most annoying is thee prevalence of pointless cookie warnings we have weighed through today i actually met one the people who were the initial pushers of this in like 2015 2016 man knowing that conversation i had with that dude and now crazy it might have even been earlier might have been 2012 crazy i found it quite frustrating how teams would be legitimately actively pursuing ideas that would be good for the world without prioritizing short-term google interests only to be met with cynicism in the court of public opinion you know i can again i'm just going to side with this guy i'm sure early days at google people were just trying to build a good product and make money you know what i mean i'm sure early days are much different than today just like it is at my current company just like it was at any company that before you know when they first got started it just is different than what it is today it's fair it is completely fair uh early google was also excellent place to work executives gave frank answers on weekly basis yeah i used to i used to act ask reed hastings things regularly ted sandos would sit down at the you know just like at the standard kitchen table and we would chat you know that that that will literally never happen again it's just different uh about their inability to do so eg for legal reasons or because some topic was too sensitive to discuss broadly eric schmidt regularly walked the whole company through the discussions of the board the success and failures of various products were presented more or less objectively with successes celebrated and failures examined critically with an eye to learning lessons rather than assigning blame the company had a vision and deviations from the vision were explained having experienced dilbert level management during my internship at netscape 5 years earlier the uniform competence of people at google was very refreshing it's cool this actually a really cool article to read it's also a little sad do you read these things and get a little bit sad like how you know like even though i would not work at google today the idea i can't read the idea that a company could have been great and was great for some period of time where people who are running the company are walking through explaining what the board's doing right like there's a real connection between like seite and the employees like that's really nice it's really really nice and maybe it's just purely the number of employees problem maybe there's just a certain number of employees that it no longer works cuz i know there's like there's numbers for humans in all sorts of kind of um in kind of ways like uh if you have like more than 140 people people quit knowing each other and you can't really have a strong community you have to break it off into sub little small communities right like there's these numbers that just kind of naturally appear where people don't where just like things kind of get fractured and so maybe there's the same thing at companies where once you cross a certain level or time period or maybe it's a certain amount of a plus new people that didn't have the original culture whatever it is it's like there's maybe there's just some level of something that causes this to happen and it's inevitable at all companies or maybe it's different i don't know i' i i' i'd hope that you could fight this and actually make a big company be good yeah new new devs will never experience what it was like to work at google during these days right and i think that that's really sad that's what i'm trying to say it's very sad that this can't exist at google maybe it still exists in some small subsections you know where maybe the director still really champions that that mentality and really tries to bring stuff in but it it can't happen this this is the inevitable of all companies if you really love your company and your company keeps growing this will happen this happened at my previous company this is not just some like one time off only big companies i watched it i' i've been a part of multiple companies that grew well and it's and this has happened each time all right for my first nine years at google i worked on the html and related standards my mandate was to do the best thing for the web as whatever was good for the web would be good for google i explicitly told to ignore google's interest this was a continuation of the work i started while at opera software google was an excellent host for this effort my team was nominally the open- source team at google but i was entirely autonomous for which i owe thanks to chris debona nice good nice job chris uh most of my work was done on a lapt top from random buildings on google campus entire years went by where i didn't use my assigned desk in time exceptions to google's culture strengths developed for example as much as i enjoyed vic gand ganda's enthusiasm and his initial vision for google plus which gained which again was quite well defined and if not necessarily uniformed appre uniformly appreciated at least unambiguous i felt less confident in his ability to give clear answers when things were not going as well as hoped he also started introducing silos to google eg locking down certain buildings to just the google plus team a distinct departure from completely internal transparency of early google another example is the android team originally an acquisition who never really fully acclimated to google's culture android's work life balance was unhealthy the team was not as transparent as older parts of google and the team focused on chasing the competition more than solving real problems for users i totally get this first one you see this a lot when you get into a big company and now these big mountain efforts are happening and people's jobs and really their reputation are on the line because they make this multi-year effort to make something successful you start seeing these gamed metrics why is this thing good well if you look at it this way you can see why it's actually good it's not it's not see trust me if you take the metric and and you and you this massaging you can see why we're actually succeeding and you can start seeing these weird stories being built that aren't necessarily good you know what i mean like i've seen this many many of times of why something should be good despite the fact you're looking at it and you're like i don't see how this is good what do you mean what part of this is good they're like no trust us it's good the stories pro sometimes aren't even true i mean i i i just i don't think i've ever been uh i don't think this is capitalism at all so this is opposite of of capitalism this is like this is your ability to make something this is you like any person directing some large project inter internally at a large company it's not capitalism at that point this is someone's reputation online and if your reputation goes so does your ability to keep working there potentially if you massively fumble the bag people like the people higher will blame you like i don't think this is a cap capitalism problem here this is just like this is putting your like you become your project you know reputation is really hard being able to say you're wrong early enough is really hard because you want to be right right you really want to be right my last nine years were spent on flutter some of my fondest memories of my time at google are the early days of this effort flutter was one of the last projects to come out of old google part of the stable ambi uh ambitious experiment started by larry pig shortly before the uh the creation of alphabet isn't isn't th isn't th flutter like the thing that that theo just loathes i can never remember there's like ligma and flutter and all these other weird ones i never remember any of them flutter is dead flutter sucks he doesn't like angular as well yeah well i mean that's angular's fault on that one i'm going to put i'm going to put the f in the category of angular not necessarily in the category of theo for that one for sure i don't know anything about flutter so i actually have zero zero ideas what's ligma i think you might need to go see a doctor uh all right we essentially operated like a startup discovering what we were building more than designing it the flutter team was very much built out of the culture of young google for example we prioritized internal transparency work life balance and data driven decisions making greatly helped by the uh ta dong and his uxr uh team we were radically open from the beginning which made it easy for us to build a healthy open source project around the effort as well was google known for its work life balance bance i don't think that's the case is that true for whatever reason i don't remember hearing that google was was known for that you go to google to retire now yeah you go to google to hit that l5 and just keep ling it and work 10 hours a week right 400k 10 hours a week i mean maybe i need that maybe i need maybe i do need the work at google uh flutter was also very lucky to have excellent leadership throughout the years such as adam bar as founding tech lead tim sneath as pm and todd vulker as engineer manager look at that whiteboard look at that that i can't even read sca scaffold scre what i'm not even sure what those are okay at this point this looks like elite code problem we've hit official elite code problem you've worked with tim oh cool scuffled we also didn't follow engineering best practices for the first few years for example we wrote no tests and had precious little documentation this whiteboard is what passed for design doc for the core widget rendering object and dart ui layers this allowed us to move fast at first but we paid for it later nice nice uh flutter grew in a bubble largely insulated from the changes google was experiencing at the same time google's culture eroded yep so i i i really do i i do want to go back to this i really do think that culture erods when two things happen companies i've seen especially tech companies prioritize big hires vps um se sues and even some directors you know the big hires they prioritize them external to the company and i think when you do that you hire whatever al amalgamation of culture comes from that other that other company and i think there's something that really hurts that uh really hurts what do i mean by external to the company i'm not sure if i could be more clear that's not within the company that's without the company right when you hire someone from amazon that is a vp at amazon you get vp at amazon vibes coming in and naturally whoever's directly under vp of amazon directors of netflix or wherever they're going to start acting like amazon more than they're going to start acting like netflix and that is like that's just that's just how it has to happen i do think there is a lot of value in prioritizing hiring from within your own ranks if you can right there are sometimes where you just can't right like if you wanted to start if facebook wanted to start a new av training division for the for the aven transport protocol you'd have to hire externally some aven experts right you couldn't just like ah we've never done anything with birds even though they're government drones i guess we got to hire people from the government right like you have to kind of you know you there are times you have to hire on the outside yeah and it happens bring back the carac right you just do if if you don't know aven pigeon it's it's it's it's an old rfc if for those that don't know aven transport uh protocol for those that don't know there is an uh there is an rfc that's how to do ip over pigeon so you know get with the times okay get with the times packet loss is real packet loss is real then google had layoffs the layoffs were an unforced error driven by a short a drive to ensure the stock price would keep growing quarter to quarter instead of following google's ur while strategy of prioritizing long-term successes success even if it led to short-term losses the very essence of don't be evil i'm going to have to like give a strong disagreement on this one but okay people are saying i missed i missed a part of the paragraph okay let's see transparency evaporate yeah okay i remember that okay i remember this this okay i remember this c google culture eroded we were here here decisions went from being made from uh for the benefit of the users to the benefit of google to the benefit of whoever was making the decision transparency evaporated where precious previously i would eagerly attend every companywide meeting to learn what was happening i found myself now able to predict the answers executives would give word for word today i don't know anyone at google who could explain what google google's vision is morale is at an all-time low if you talk to a therapist in the bay area they will tell you all their google clients are unhappy with google i got to figure figure out how to get i got well i just want to get that 10 hour a week at google come on baby then google had layoffs the layoffs were an unforced error driven by shortsighted drive to ensure the stock price would keep growing quarter to quarter instead of following google's ur while strategy of prioritizing long-term success even if it led to short-term losses so i think that this statement by itself is incorrect along with this follow-up statement which we're not even going to get into because now we're just talking i mean you've you've left the realm and you've you've somehow mixed this i mean now you're getting into some weird philosophical twisties um so the reason why i think that google did all the layoffs is very very simple is that in 2020 the world went fully online right for a little while you had all of the delicious covid money just pouring in uh companies online companies were going faster than ever and what did they do they took that and invested and hired a bunch of people assuming that the world was now online and the world when the chance came to not be online so much did what probably would have normally been done and stopped being online so much okay twitch had its highest viewership during those times everybody had the highest everything during those times and guess what when you plan on the world continue to grow at a pure online rate that doesn't really exist it's just like a pure vacuum strategy of course afterwards you realize you've hired way too many people and now that the world is actually starting to shrink back you have to buy the very uh you know necessarily pull back what you've done so am i shocked that google ad layoffs no because a bunch of companies did this doesn't every company assume infinite growth i'm not so sure but during that time i think it was very very hard not to you know what i mean i think during that time people really felt like we're entering into this new world of fang amazingness like netflix went all the way up to like 690 you know what i mean it was wild and then it just fell apart right it's not that in my personal opinion it's not that those companies grew they just simply pull forward that's it they just simply pulled forward from what they where they would have been in three years they did it in six months and then that was assumed to be the new starting point but that wasn't the case we were not doing that instead we just simply pulled forward by 3 years and then everything was like and halt growth uh we're kind of slightly declining right it was like very difficult that was classic executive stupidity i don't think it was classic executive stupidity because i think classically you would have been the stupid person making the same decisions given the same situation you know i think everybody loves sitting in the the armchair of today looking back at 3 years ago's mistakes and being like i would have definitely been different i personally would have been able to see forth the future realizing this as a pullback situation and would have invested puts nearest the 10th month as a new uh exchange policy being put in place right like no you wouldn't have done that okay very few people made good decisions during that time it just that's just how it works okay we're not that great um all right let's keep on going let's see the effects of of layoffs are insidious whereas people before people might focus on the user or at least their company trusting that they're doing the right thing will eventually be rewarded even if it's not strictly part of their assigned duties after layoff people can no longer trust that their company has their back and they dramatically dial back any risk- taking this is a very fair statement i do like that i do like that responsibilities are uh guarded jealously knowledge is hoarded because making oneself irreplaceable is the only lever one has to protect oneself from future layoffs i see all of this at google now the lack of trust in management is reflected by management no longer showing trust in the employees either in the form of inan inan corporate policies in 2004 google's founders famously told wall street google is not a conventional company we do not intend to become one but that google is no more dang that i mean that is a scathing revie maybe uh all because of cyber security same at meta everyone hates the company now yeah i'm sure i'm sure engineering at facebook was super cool hacker news people were outraged he named and shamed his manager people should name and shame i don't know i i i honestly don't know how i feel about that and why i say that is that it depends on where do you know what i mean like if if you're talking about a vp of an org they have significantly more impact than a manager a manager typically i mean a manager is just playing ball i you know it's hard for me to blame i mean yes you should always be a better manager and managers who don't play or who play the game and really act uh you know conniving i i really have absolutely no respect for but the the incentives were put in place and the game is being played and so yes should the manager be fired should the manager or be whatever absolutely but that doesn't necessarily mean that the manager is the driving force here and the real problem comes higher up right so it's like kind of a mix you know what i mean change it to circus music maybe much of these problems with google today stem from a lack of visionary uh leadership from sundar uh from sundar and his clear lack of interest in maintaining the cultural norms of early google a symptom of this is the spreading contingent of the inept management take janine banks for example who manages the department of somewhat arbitrary contains among other things flutter dart go and firebase i that's where my job offer was was firebase that's where i almost went and worked almost they offered me 10% less than i was making at at at netflix and i said well you're paying me wait you want me to make a lateral move you want me to do a lateral move to a new company okay hold on hold on hold on so let me just say this again so google offered me the job at firebase specifically firebase right here and when offered they offered me 10% less than i was making or actually about 15% less than i was making at netflix at the time and i came back and i said hey why why are you offering me this this this little like you got to understand that this is very hard for me because it's a not only is it a lateral move it is also being paid less so why should i take this jump and i kid you not the recruiter's exact response was this well this is a starting point after you work here for a while you will you're going to grow and it's like yeah it is a starting point a starting point behind where i'm currently at like what do you mean what do you mean i should take a worse position for no benefits at all other than working at google you got to come back with more and then they said no negotiated themselves out of me at firebase all this explains uh by companies uh making kpis for metrics that should be just as informative for a retrospective not for direct base for rating any metric made kpi will be played and cultured disappears then yes any time i mean it's the general problem of it's very very it's all extremely hard like i i know i i am not someone who thinks that i could fix this overnight i'm not someone who thinks all my ideas are the greatest and therefore if only i was in control therefore i could do it but real talk i could probably fix it her department normally or nominally has a strategy but i couldn't leak it if i wanted to i literally could never figure out what any part of it meant even years of hearing her describe it her understanding of what her teams are doing is minimal at best she frequently makes requests that are completely incoherent and incapable she treats engineers as commodities in a way that is dehumanizing reassigning people against their will in ways that have no relationship to their skillet she isn't completely unable to receive constructive feedback or she is completely unable to receive constructive feedback as in she literally doesn't even acknowledge it i hear other teams who have leaders more political politically savvy than i have learned how to handle her to keep her off their backs feeding her just the right information at the right time having seen google at its best i find this new reality depressing damn janine janine i've had a janine we've all had a janine damn that is a call out that is that is sorry janine um i i you know i it's again it's always hard for me to say whether this is 100% true or not right what what misunderstandings are there that we don't quite get from this article to hear but damn that is i mean if this is true you got you got to figure this out you know what i mean i live and breathe janin damn there are still great people at google and i've had the privilege to work with amazing people on the flutter team such as uh j young lee and kate love it and kevin chrisol zoe fan danfield and a dozen more sorry folks i know i should just name all of you but there's too in recent years i started offering career advice to anyone at google and through that met many great folks from around the company that's it's definitely not too late to heal google it would require some shakeup at the top of the company moving the center of power from the cfo's office back to someone with a clear long-term vision for how or for how to use google's extensive resources to deliver value to users i still believe that there's a mileage or i still believe there's lots of mileage to be had from google's mission statement to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful someone who wanted to lead google into the next 20 years maximizing the good to humanity and disregarding the short-term fluctuations in stock price could channel the skills and passion of google into truly great achievements even my computer hates these these type of quotes even my computer hates those quotes i hate you and so does my highlighting um i don't know i i don't know like honestly i don't know cuz the problem with google i mean google has a lot of problems and right now it's in a very difficult position search becoming less and less useful as chat jippy is more and more useful okay dude i i got i gotta know i got to know spike i got to know is this it i got to know you i google google google google okay i thought you've said this several times i just had the know i've seen it many times and i just had to know is that real is that what you got i hate google my [laughter] bad you know what i'm not upset i'm not upset anymore i was upset but i'm no longer upset what a great response let him know all right the name is imagine if in 3 weeks i'm like by the way i'm i am now working at google you'll know why how good would that be just tell me how funny would that be but i think i could do it the name is the prime agen the flutter aen could be hey i could be the flutter aen okay i'm just letting you know the fire based a genen i was almost there director of firebase coming in hot a jen
