nvidia's employees are suddenly so rich and happy that the company has got a semi-retirement problem so a very similar thing used to happen at netflix so the year i arrived they ended their previous stock program and their previous stock program was so good that i had several members within my org within the next year quit cuz they all went semi-retired right afterwards it was it was impossible we we were losing people like wild because the stock went from like $40 to $700 in 2 years 3 years uh it's hard to see now netflix stock please tell me oh we're so back we're so back it's so green here go to max so when i started back here so right here during like this time remember you got to times that by 7 so $77 and it went from $77 and then it just went all the way up to 700 and something so it just went like 77 to 700 and the previous stock plan was so damn good that it just it just just it just exploded this is also when trash dev started i kid you not this is literally when trash dev started this is when trash dev started right there and then this happened like coincidence no i don't think so this is this is when i started right here coincidence no i don't think so okay you know what i'm seeing i'm seeing trash dev is bad for companies okay we are so stocked right now this is so oh my goodness we're so back look that 38,000 up all right anyways okay let's see what they have to say here nvidia stratospheric ride this year has engendered an unusual problem some of the long tenured employees sitting on a wealth of company stock are no longer doing their fair share of work this is so glorious by the way this is like why you should work at a company you believe in if you don't work at a company you believe in then why even get stock what's the point of stock if you don't think your company's going somewhere if your company goes somewhere so stoked it's a big enough issue that nvidia ceo jensen uh hong felt that uh the need to address it during last month's internal all hands meeting people who were in attendance told business insider by the way people that leak internal stuff i just would like to let you know that you you suck okay you suck did you know that during when when netflix went global that day that reed hastings stood up and was like we're going global 2,000 employees knew that we were going global for almost a year straight and nobody said a word tell me that was not the coolest thing ever that was i to me that was the pinnacle at being at netflix people were in it to win it we were there to win it was so cool i mean i don't think we could go 14 seconds without someone trying to leak something at at netflix now i mean we've gone from 2,000 to 12,000 it's it's gotten really big people don't feel like they kind of like are all in a bubble together it's just not nearly as awesome you leaked it now no we've talked about it quite a bit it's so awesome from a list of pres submitted employee questions hung picked one that asked what to do about old-timers who appeared semi-retired mode senioritis damn senioritis man answer that we're getting nidia is like voluntary sport i love i i like this i like where this is going so every employee should act like the ceo of their own time he acknowledged that some employees have been at n nvidia for a very long time and jokingly called them out these are judgment calls to be made by adults he added his broader message was each person should determine how hard they work but do it responsibly i love this actually this is great this is honestly this is really really great for me this is how a place i like to work i like the idea of people saying you need to act like your own boss and try to figure things out that's a very heavy netflix thing i don't know how true it is at nvidia but i like to be able to be in more in control of my own destiny versus like you will cut the sausage at this angle right here from here on out that's it right so like i don't want to do that i don't i don't want you to tell me how to how to do that many nvidia employees are becoming incredibly rich after the company stock is up about 1,200 % over the past five years this is yeah this is super dangerous for a company you know what the worst part about this is that you develop this company that's absolutely killing it right you everything is great and you hire all these amazing people they're all getting stock and then your company takes off and then all the top talent that helped you get there all go i'm rich and cash out sucks to suck man all right let's look over the last five years what do we got what do we got damn let's look at netflix over the past five years what do we got let's what do we got what do we got well that doesn't feel as cool okay you wondering why i'm not cashing out right now you wondering why i'm not cashing out on all these these gains these sweet thanks gainings well now you know okay i don't i can't even quit on purpose okay okay it's where's my, 1400% okay stupid all right let's go back wait there we go let's go back all right okay many nvidia employees have become incredibly rich after this one unexpected byproduct of that success has been growing tension between employees where some staffers feel the oldtimers are simply not pulling their weight bi talked to 13 current employees and two hr professionals with the company's reputation that is like total okay how many engineers does nvidia have okay probably uh how many employees you probably can only do employees they probably don't do that okay so there's you're saying there's about 26,000 employees in 35 countries and you're telling me that you talked to 13 employees and you're you're just saying that they're feeling this way you know stats aren't necessarily the greatest and the and and second off hr professionals can also be talent hr doesn't necessarily mean they're running an org and talking to 500 employees each right their weight can't be you know i mean a data is literally the plurality of anecdotal it's just the plurality is not too big we got weak anecdotal data weak okay so some people do feel it okay some people feel it nvidia employees are almost religiously support h as the ceo who founded the company in 1993 still these people blame the overly employee centric culture he's created oh my goodness let me get this straight first you're like ceos just think they're awesome some guy creates an employee first company then people like you know what's really bad employee first companies okay now we got another problem can somebody just be happy could can can can the company with relatively hands-off management style in companies that new found near dominance with advanced chip market to me this seems like a great thing i would literally never complain about an employee centric culture what yeah my company cares too much about me me um i would like them to uh stop this okay uh they don't text me on the weekends or in the evenings asking me to do things you know i want to be abused a i want a semi- abusive relationship can we please get a semi- abusive relationship okay i don't you know i don't want abusive i just want like semi okay like i want maybe trauma i want like maybe trauma please exploit me more this actually sounds like a great thing how the hell have we got to a how how did we get to a place where we're complaining about an employee centric company it's also possible that uh the newly minted stock rich millionaires at nvidia are simply less motivated to work as hard yes shocker absolutely shocking when life has no when there's no reason for you to work it's hard to work hard like real talk real talk how many people press one in the chat if you've been in the industry for 10 years type one in the chat if you've been in the industry for 10 years okay so we got quite a few we got we got quite a few old h old handsies around here now for those that that have been in the industry for 10 years can you go back to when you were first starting did you work more aggressively more intense to get where you're going type 69 in the chat for me oh yeah like i was so effing committed i had to like i dude if i was going to get a job if i was going to get successful i pulled all nighters regularly i was just like i'm going to be the best at this thing i'm going to go i'm really ready right it's crazy it's crazy to think that uh i had i but i had like such a reason i was married i was we were we my wife and i could only budget $2 per meal per day so i'd skip breakfast so i could have $3 per meal dude it was like so the guy below us would try to literally threaten to murder us methodic like i was working i we had to get the hell out of there i'm a try hard to this day but i'm not try hard like that there's just a fundamental difference in try hard when you got someone trying to say they're going to kill you and smoking meth right like that's just not a problem i i deal with now you know what i mean why he said that cuz he smoked meth and that's what meth people do meth people destroy their frontal cortex makes you got like little brain worms in your brain and then eventually you get schizophrenia meth andu schizophrenia is like really common you know that you know the scene on uh beautiful mind where he sees flashlights in the woods my brother is a pretty intense meth adic he in fact just two days ago he got he he got hit with 12 years going to the clink the amount of times i've been on a phone with him talking to him about seeing the lights in the woods is like real like that scene actually was so well done in a beautiful mind where because he has that schizophrenia and he's like seeing these shadow people out in the distance it's actually really really really really really well done and like that's a real that's a real situation a lot of people feel that's happened to my sister yeah it's crazy it's crazy it's real crazy it's it's been going on for a long time you know it's you know i i'm kind of numb to it at this point i feel genuinely bad for him but i mean the reality is is what would you want a methodic on the street living on the street street in cold ass colorado during the winter with the possibility of freezing to death or going to prison like really which one which one would you want the answer is you want a good system but a good system is very very hard like a good system is very very hard we'll move on i i can talk more about that at a at a different time i have many thoughts on what a better system would look like and not all systems are good you know it's hard it's a very confusing confusing world out there all right the brewing discord among nvidia's corporate ranks could one day become a more serious risk as the company faces intensifying regulatory pressure and the competition from rival chip designers amd and intel as well as other big tech firms like amazon and microsoft yeah so this is so this is the interesting thing it's the problem of when you are very very successful as a company and you're doing all the right things and your st's going very very far up you can accidentally polish the diamond too long that may not make a lot of sense to people you have what works and you focus on what works you're not focusing on how to stay ahead and that's that's a real thing jensen making a serious point which is do your damn job yeah do your damn job nvidia spos per declined to comment really shockingly invidious spokesperson didn't didn't comment on your internally leaked conversation harder to get hired than fired almost every tech company at some point faces a similar problem where longtime employees who know their way around the company coast through their jobs silicon valley has a word for it rest invest for employees who get paid without doing uh too much work waiting for their stock awards to aest but at nvidia the company's famously pro-employee culture can further accentuate this type of behavior i somehow doubt that i somehow doubt that it's famously pro-employee culture means that you also have to be protective of your employees i'd be pretty i i i'm i'm kind of hitting doubt on here because a culture that's very pro employee sets up safeguards and protections to ensure that employees are doing well letting people not work because you're pro-employee is not pro-employee this author has shorted nvidia probably you know what i mean like that's not pro-employee right that's not pro-employee that's anti- employee letting people not do anything and making other people disgruntled is not employee first for example nvidia has a history of avoiding layoffs during tumultuous times cool and during the early parts of co 2020 and crypto collaps of 2022 when nvidia stock wildly fluctuated uh hung repeatedly assured the company staff there would be no layoffs the last formal job cuts took place 15 years ago in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis okay netflix laid off 100 people but it's i i believe it's because they reduced their bet in in i think the reported stuff was like reducing their bet in in animation but we are going to close that it sounds like we're closing that down no matter what what so we didn't we didn't lay off anybody either we also don't overhire so i mean i think nvidia probably just doesn't overhire you know what i mean company lore is that top executives took pay cups during these down periods to reduce the impact on rank and file employees one employee told bi that they received additional stock awards in 2022 to make up for the drop in compensation as nvidia's share price declined nice okay very good very good i like to hear that it does sound like a good company sounds like maybe i got to go work for nvidia i mean is this a is okay hold on is this an nvidia anti- nvidia article or a pro- nvidia article nvidia employees are also rarely put on performance improvement plans unlike some of its competitors like amazon no that's cuz amazon's crazy amazon did you know this straight from an amazon hiring manager's mouth her goal was to or her stated goal that she was told is that you want employees to stay there for 2 years that is also why at amazon your first year you get 5% investing your second year you get 15% investing your third year you get like 45% vesting or something like that like they they intentionally try to keep you for less than two years and push you out amazon is like not a good place if you compare people having a shitty employment experience to amazon you're like that's like not a win amazon's stock vesting employee schedule let's see if we can pull this up yeah look at this 5% year one dude i i dude i nailed that so effing hard 5% year 1 15% year 2 40% year three do you see a problem here anybody want to tell me you see a problem the company is incentivized to fire you right here or right here like their their goal is to well not fire you to push you out make you want to leave you also work at amazon rip buddy but i mean this is true like this they they this is designed to make you want to quit like it is it is incentivized in their favor right which is which is tough right that's tough what does vesting mean let's just say that i say hey i'm going to hire you and i'm going to pay you $100,000 in monies and then i'm going to pay you $100,000 in stock you're like oh nice you're like all right it's a fouryear vesting schedule so i'm going to give you $400,000 over four years you're like awesome that's super cool year one goes by we they go like this we have a year one cliff so meaning we're not going to give you any of that money for one year and if you make it one year then we pay your uh stuff you're like okay that's fine year one comes around boom you get 5% of that $400,000 you get $20,000 and you go to your boss and you're like what the hell does that mean they're like oh that's our vesting schedule so after our one-year cliff you get 5% after the next year or progressively throughout the next year you'll get 15% so you'll get $60,000 after your $20,000 so then your third year though even though you thought you getting $100,000 in pay and $100,000 in stons instead you actually got $120,000 total comp and then $160,000 total comp and then the third year assuming no raises no new stock or anything then you're going to find yourself getting that like 220 or not 220,000 160,000 you'll get 260,000 what happens after year four where you're supposed to get stock refreshes every year right like that's called golden handcuffs where year two they're going to give you another bonus in stock maybe another $200,000 over four years but it has the same vesting schedule so then you're constantly like oh it's so close oh it's so close all the all the millions oh the millions are right there just just you got to stay one more year it's super trashy you know what netflix does netflix says okay how much stock do you want we're going to pay you in all cash you choose how much of your pay you want in stock okay you chose you chose 0.5 let's just say you chose half your uh half your payment in stock we're going to give you they still do options which options are great if your company grows i'm actually happy with the options and you don't have to pay you don't have to pay taxes on it until you exercise i actually am very happy about the situation so we're going to pay you that every month we're going to pay you one 12th of the money you put in that you invested over the year in options now options when you leave the company or the option that you got is a 10-year strike price a 10year window option with whatever the first of the month right prices it's a very good deal so that means when i leave netflix i don't have to sell all my stock right a lot of companies what happens is when you leave netflix you actually have to sell or when you leave your startup you actually have to uh sell your stalks because if you don't sell your stalks your options expire so my the expiration date of the uh option is 10 years which is super cool like it's actually a pretty employee first like style it's really it's genuinely a very nice way that they've done things i'm very happy about it the problem is is that options also as you can see that netflix stock price went way down i my my stons worth i have a lot of ston worth zero so i have a lot of moneyy that i put in and it's just worth z so would i prefer rsus i don't even know if i' i right now i may have made more money with rsus but you know if if it goes way up maybe it'll be different but it's there's a lot worth zero right now i have a lot of zeros let's keep on going while this type of culture can breed intense loyalty it can also lead some people taking advantage of it it will always lead that like no matter what you do this is 100% it you make a highly no matter whatever you incentivize people will do it's harder to get fired than hired here okay interesting and people have no reason at this moment to quit jim herd ceo of executive search uh firm herd fred harts told uh bi that in his experience nvidia has a lower attrition than any other tech firms i i have never ever ever read an article where somehow having pro-employee low attrition rate is viewed as negative he said nvidia has built a very strong culture that leads to higher employee satisfaction and there's simply no incentive for them to seek other opportunities now nvidia should continue to have lower attrition than its appears herd said there is too much momentum in financial gain to leave now that man that sucks what a bunch of who'd want to work there who'd want to work at a employee first low attrition rate company disgusting the explosive demand for nvidia's advanced chips is only adding to the complacency nvidia's gpu chips have become one of the most sought-after products in the tech this year as they serve the backbone for many generative ai services like chat jippy the popularity is making some nvidia employees jobs easy one person i don't know how that's making it easy one person said nvidia now has more leverage than ever with their customers as cloud providers and ai companies are desperate to get its gpu chips prospects jump to answer their calls and current customers are willing to spend more money on nvidia's technology a dramatic shift even in the last year but this also means it's ripe for some other company to take advantage of that's why you see these uh you're starting to see like what amazon developing its own ship google's developing its own ship facebook said they're developing their own ship the thing is is when you get when this type of market happens within the next year nvidia is going to have a tough time competing against it right like it's but it's the very nature of this type type of stuff happening one proxy for this change shows up in nvidia's latest financial statement in its third quarter august through october 2023 nvidia generated'.1 billion in revenue a whopping 207% increase from the 5.9 billion uh recorded in the same period last year wow year-over-year that is outrageous wow damn good job nvidia well well done well done nvidia developing their own still means relying on overseas fab labs for the next 5 years absolutely it's i mean i'm not saying it's it's it's simple taiwan is still center of the universe when it comes to chipm also which is kind of crazy can we all agree that it's kind of crazy i'm not going to read anymore because now it's just about stock price and all that and stuff like that uh but this is this is a very interesting article in the sense that this is a real problem people don't realize that uh companies have to face where have you ever seen a company that started off really amazing and then becomes really complacent and and and just doesn't matter anymore a lot of times this this can be you can or not a lot of times some of the times you can contribute this type of behav behavior where things are like you're really focused you're really crushing it and then your stalks and everything goes up and then employees just go and it kind of falls off i've seen it a lot of times you're a victim of your own success uh one thing that one might my boss always says at netflix is we don't we didn't plan for overwhelming success do you know there's like 38 leaders at tsmc and nobody there knows how the whole thing works i don't know what tsmc is suffering from success is a real thing it's very interesting it's it's just an interesting ect anyways cool stuff the name i like this stuff is the primeag
