so as i mentioned in the title i am leaving to japan for 3 weeks and i'll be back in december so don't worry i'm not really going anywhere but i really wanted to take this opportunity to share a few updates the first one is more of a promotion if you enjoy my shorts and my quizzes on youtube check out my instagram page on this instagram page i post the shorts or the reals and the quizzes far before i do it on youtube so if you're interested in learning everyday facts or tips about python feel free to follow this page otherwise if you're more curious about what i do in my daily life i also have a private instagram or it's not really private it's public to everybody also i had this idea to create a python speedrun challenge and this isn't about learning the language this is about performing some sort of specific task in python as fast as possible and i'm still kind of fuzzy about what this challenge should be i do want to offer some prizes it could be a cash prize or it could be some sort of other prize i'm still very fuzzy on this idea but i absolutely want to create a python speedrun challenge if you have any ideas of what the python speedrun challenge can be please leave it in the comment section down below i will use these ideas to further create this challenge someday so that we can have some cool python speedruns and again i'm not talking about learning the language as fast as possible i want to create some sort of challenge which challenges the python programmer to use their python skills as fast as possible the test or whatever the challenge must be consistent in some way just like with video games if you speedrun there's always going to be some glitch that's very precise and can be hard to take advantage of but once you get it you'll save a lot of time and that's what i want to get with the python language i want to create some sort of speedrun here so do let me know what you think about this idea in the comment section down below but yeah otherwise i don't really have any other updates so i guess with all that being said as always thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next video
