i have three apples that do not support pcie gpus this one this one and this one but guess what i also have an apple that does the apple xer 3 comma one is the very last server that apple ever released for their commercial and education customers and compared to modern max it has many abilities that some consider to be unnatural like upgradable memory upgradable cpus and even yes the ability to run a graphics card wait are we about to game on an apple server yes and we're about to tell you about our sponsor govi turn a regular old wall into a showcase for your creativity with govi's curtain light with a diy mode versatile effects and voice control the possibilities are endless it's also ip65 water resistant for when things get moist i don't know why you'd need that and i won't ask check it out at the link below i know we've talked about this machine in the past but there are just so many things about it that are utterly unlike anything apple does today check this out onboard power and reset switches not only does it not have a chassis intrusion that prevents you from powering it on when the case is open they outright enable it and this is great apple actually delighted the nehalem architecture xeons that were at the heart of this thing and then used a shim to prevent the dye from cracking just like you can buy from der bauer today because these are regular socketed cpus we could actually upgrade them however most of the higher performance xeons from this generation have much higher tdps ironically this use of enthusiast class cooling solutions does make apple's x-serve machines a little bit tougher to upgrade because you'd have to de-lid any off-the-shelf xeon that you wanted to put into it but fortunately the e5520 that we have in here is only about 20 percent slower than the fastest chips that shipped in this machine and while there are faster ones that you could install aftermarket they run at significantly higher tdps and this cooling solution has a hard time keeping them under control so we're just going to uh leave those for now replacing my one gig sticks i have oh wow these 16 gig sticks from kingston that's good i'm gonna give us a total of 96 gigs of ram in this that is over a 15x upgrade in memory capacity oh yeah every stick i put in has more ram oh yeah then the whole system had when we oh yeah started it's the double-edged sword of upgradability you can change out your hardware but will it work i don't know now it's time for the big moment where we pull out our network card and install any gpu we want in that pcie 16x slot that's right before apple had their big falling out with nvidia you could put geforce cards into a mac this one specifically okay so we're gonna pause for a second and you guys are gonna click on the card that you want me to install go ahead i'm kidding there's no way for me to do a poll like this you guys just pause the video what do you think you're doing also we have a problem there is oh okay i just ripped that off which may be helps it doesn't that's okay i have an idea oh that wasn't the idea this is my idea by putting a pcie riser in this slot right here we should be able to quickly and easily hook up any card we want find a good spot for it no why would i be worried about that the fan's right here no no i mean on for the rest of the system oh hmm yeah so the gpu needs to be outside of the chassis ah that's why i thought of having my writer bring a much longer pcie expansion oh i think i get it haha oh boy this is not good there we go yeah you can hear the ghost of tim cook just screaming in agony okay now we're good to go is what i would say if we had any way to power this thing which we do by using one of these jumpered 24-pin female connectors all it does is bridge the green and any ground wire but we can turn on a power supply without a computer connected to it so um here what an elegant solution then we just need to power everything up all right i'm forgetting something hdmi cable also i need somewhere safe to put this gpu you were just going to let me put this back down on here weren't you he was look at him no back plate that would have shorted out that would have actually been very bad got the 12 volt the ground right there yeah that seems much better now we just plug in our hdmi cable thank you colin i am not seeing a lot of action here uh probably help if you actually turn the computer on oh that's right i forgot this is not on yet it just makes that noise when it's thinking about turning on good boy now the question you're probably asking yourself is what environment is he going to boot into are they gonna game on steam in mac os are we yeah yes yes we are remember what we're gonna try uh how long is the boot up cycle uh we should be seeing something by now i think we're getting dangerously close to time to start trying stuff oh yeah that's my favorite oh oh we got something it's gray you got something we got a gray screen there i am going to try something i'm going to start by turning off the computer then i am going to remove this pcie card i think it's possible this cable may have gotten damaged when we were jamming it through that pci slot for the second time so we do test things ahead of time but sometimes that's not biting us in the butt go figure right how dare you test things wow there's so much cool stuff on here i didn't even see this last time look at this it's got a whole bank of led code lights here for memory pll voltage core voltage amazing another possibility is that when i reseeded that cpu one of the pins got a little misaligned so let me pop that off and put it back in maybe ripping things off it damaged in some hmm do i ever make things better rather than worse i'm pretty sure it come on baby you can do it well that was something i'm gonna reseat the ram [applause] come on baby i believe in you thought maybe we're at a platform memory limitation i'm gonna pop two sticks and see what happens whoa hey we're up okay interesting cool that doesn't make any sense uh from what we were able to find the platform supports well over 100 gigs of rent but not necessarily at this density but what was the maximum ram supported by this platform again so for the processor itself it says it's 144. but if i'm looking at every mac which lists all of the different versions of this it says official max is 24 and 48. obviously that's not right because we currently have 64 in here but one thing that i did find out when i was just trying to look up this blinking light here is that at least on the older versions of the excerpt for the g4 g5 a blinking light like this could mean an ecc or i see do we settle for dual channel or do we try the other set of three slots and see if maybe we've just got a bad memory slot but we had a bad memory slot it wouldn't be booting with the other set of ram sure would if i took the stick out of the slot i put these back in the slots you had them in so if one of those third ones is bad then it could be bad valid let's shut it down yep now we find out how much of a problem it is to populate the secondary memory slots first in this particular particularly want 96 gigs of ram not because i need it but how many people have a mac gaming rig with 96 gigs of ram come on no okay ah do you notice what's happening right over here yes yeah so those lights are flashing angrily at us now though that doesn't usually happen oh that's that's probably still a some sort of issue with the ram so we're running dual channel then well that's an interesting thing for us to find out totally by accident in that case let's go straight for maximum points put our pcie riser back in see if this thing fires up yeah are no longer on this bodes well i'm so confident i'm moving around to this side hey there we go there you go yes mac gaming this is titan x black this is maxwell this is geforce 900 series that's right we might actually get somewhat decent gaming performance out of this thing what just happened is this steam yes it is buddy whoa hey it's back uh wait is this farther than you it doesn't happen normally it stays black oh okay well this is wait oh uh well what did i click on no i had it working oh i could just click on things if i click the right spots can i launch a game yes game will also be pitch black oh really every game as far as i'm able to tell i can't really click through to most of them now you mentioned that someone some foolhardy beautiful soul was still updating nvidia drivers on mac os this looks fairly old though they're taking older drivers that aren't normally supported for this and and making them work they're not taking the absolute newest drivers however i don't think this is a graphical issue or necessarily i don't think this is a gpu driver issue oh i do have a solution for it but i'd like to just take one second to talk about why it might be happening i think it's because chrome no longer supports this version of mac os and steam uses a lot of chromium underneath it just basically a web browser makes sense okay work around are we heading for the terminal we are and the command that you're going to use is up in that file at the top right corner and here is where we see that steam no longer cares about this version mac oss of september stop running in 76 days this is the second time this has happened in like two weeks where we got one of these notifications that it was about to be unsupported on our platform we're like thank goodness we made this video today ah i am so excited right now there's gonna be a great gaming computer for just over two months we could play shadow the tomb raider portal 2. batman arkham asylum game of the year edition i mean it is a good game how about we install portal 2. 64 gigs 1066 ram that's another thing that we would be able to upgrade if we had better cpus is our ram speed we'd be able to do 13 33. wow that is a slow ssd wait is that a hard drive in the front the hard drive in the front but you might be downloading directly to the ssd inside of it i doubt it not at the speed this is going what happened to my desktop half of my desktop is gone oh my god this is so slow i think we need to find a way to get the library working properly steam library folders yeah see this that's what this is okay so how do we edit this wait a second i have an idea what if we just try to launch whatever the mac version of an executable is from that other drive hmm that could that could work uh where is our other drive i mean it's here untitled right there should be one that just at the root has a steam games folder so our other drive is not even in here anyway no that's that's just the two partitions on the internal drive well let's hot swap it unplug it and plug it back in again number one tech tip it is not spinning i think it may have died on the way over here why does this happen every time we come to set things work perfectly until cameras roll i think that drives dead dude no how much does that matter oh really but there's only so many of those that still exist oh okay but it doesn't matter for the video no i'm totally over it i never recover from this tanner apparently had all of our mac compatible games installed on this drive i guess we're gonna play some portal 2 then to make ourselves feel better why did apple have to give up on gaming my friend had all the cool games on his mac when we were kids my mouse is not working look up i mean boy am i ever trying uh hey tanner hey what what's happening are you expecting the mouse to not work in this game nope were you able to play portal 2 i did not attempt to but i did play counter-strike successfully okay boy is that over a lot of tearing is that expected yes ah okay i think i found a fix you need to go to windowed mode then back to full screen and it should fix it and this bug has existed for six years i've got oh well hey yes we're looking around we oh wow that frame pacing though but restarting the game totally fixed it i am gaming this does not feel like 300 frames per second i am going to turn on vsync words i never thought i would say the leg though andrew can look at this can you see it oh yeah we don't even need a high-speed camera to show how bad that input lag is that's like 60 80 millisec it's awful no i'll take the tearing oh and i think we crashed didn't even make it out of the tutorial while i was waiting for our second game to finish installing i was poking around and struck by the fact that for a machine from almost 15 years ago these specs at least on the surface look shockingly modern they have eight processing cores in here 64 gigs of ram okay 12 gigs of gpu vram i mean many modern cards only have eight batman arkham asylum game of the it's a really good game i played it through this is very much running but that's a solid easy 60 plus fps i think it's more it's really hard to tell with the motion blur like oh man early motion blur particularly looks like garbage look at the little artifacts around his ears can you see that tenor yeah oh whoa that was weird if i move the mouse too fast it activates the pointer finder feature and puts a gigantic mouse cursor in the middle of my screen and aside from these odd bugs you can see that out of our pretty large library of games here very few of them are natively supported on the mac so what are our options then because this is an intel based mac actually nothing would theoretically prevent us from installing windows except the absence of support in boot camp for this particular model folks have tried to emulate a uefi pre-boot environment on this machine but they haven't found any success which means this is about as good as it gets and once steam stops running on mac os 10.11 in 76 days the x serves time is a weird niche very limited gaming platform are pretty much over and that's not even just the software nvidia cards haven't had support in almost 10 years but even amd cards are looking like they are not going to be supported by apple moving forward on their m series apple silicon but there is good news the game porting toolkit that was just announced at wwdc 2023 looks like it could address a lot of the difficulties that developers have had porting their games to the mac all that remains to be seen given that it was clearly possible to port your games in the past is whether developers will support it and it remains to be seen who's going to do a segue to our sponsor grammarly we're always looking for
