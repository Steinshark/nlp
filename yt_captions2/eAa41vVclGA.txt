it isn't that i get my kicks out of reigning on intel's parade and honestly speaking the 13th gen cpu announcement went pretty well overall turns out you can still use last gen ddr4 memory if you want to save a buck can i get a whoo and some of the gaming performance they showed off was impressive to say the least i mean if the 13 600k gets anywhere close to the numbers that the 13900k can do intel could absolutely clean up for gamers on a budget but during the presentation intel created some serious trust problems that are making it difficult for us to take everything at face value first there's this fine print right here you see that why on earth are they using mid-tier memory on both of the competing platforms and now that i think of it they've got another big problem not only is the ryzen 5950x not running at its full potential but it's not even amd's competitor to 13th gen i mean to be clear i don't exactly blame intel for the awkward timing but amd lifted the embargo yesterday on their lineup of much improved ryzen 7000 series processors and yeah those are conspicuously absent from any of intel's messaging but what isn't absent is our sponsor team group team groups delta rgb ddr5 ram kits are compatible with various rgb software and offered at speeds up to 6600 mega transfers per second buy your kit today using the links down below despite the issues we've pointed out already intel really does know how to do a lot more than charge they phone eat hot chip and lie and today's announcement gave us a bunch of stuff and today's announcement gave us a bunch of stuff to talk about that isn't the 13900k their extreme tuning utility or xtu tool has been improved they showed off intel unison which makes working across multiple devices more seamless and they casually announced that their arc a770 gpu is on its way to the masses for just 330 us dollars but enough about that let's talk about the sweet sweet gains that we're getting with this cpu generation the flagship 13900k is getting eight more efficiency or e-course eight more total threads and an extra 600 megahertz of turbo for a total of 24 cores and up to a whopping 5.8 gigahertz not only that but ceo pat gelsinger mentioned that six plus gigahertz could be coming early next year maybe a 13 900 ks once amd brings the heat with 3d v cash who knows moving down the stack we've got the 13700k with four more cores and threads and 400 megahertz more turbo then finally our beloved core i5 the 13600k is also getting four more cores and threads with a 200 megahertz clock speed boost while turboing though of course like all k-series skus it's going to be overclockable so uh who knows where we end up oh and across the board we're getting more cash per core cluster for both the e-cores i mentioned before and the new higher performance p course as well and of course like last gen the best value parts may actually be the non-k ones that intel isn't talking about today they didn't share really many details about them but they did confirm that the rest of the core i5 lineup will also no longer be pe course only on paper 13th gen kinda sounds too good to be true up to 24 cores almost 6 gigahertz like is there a downside like maybe a burning hole in your motherboard where the socket used to be apparently no thanks to their upgraded intel 7 manufacturing process intel claims that 13th gen is actually a step forward in performance per watt so of course that won't be impressive until we know what that performance is let's talk about graphs right out of the gate intel is claiming that in some games they are seeing a 24 improvement over the 12900k good gravy the 12900k is already blazing fast unfortunately what they glossed over just a little is that you cannot expect this to be across the board horizon zero dawn actually performed slightly worse somehow and several other games performed either the same as last gen or only slightly better now to be fair most titles did demonstrate some kind of uplift and i guess they deserve credit for showing us the less impressive results i mean horizon zero dawn isn't even a particularly cranked game they could have just excluded it but anywho the point is that that 24 improvement is actually exclusive to league of legends and similar improvements were found in other lightish and esports titles but when it comes to aaa games where you really actually do need another 20 fps ah the data was underwhelming to say the least though it does kind of make me wonder if both amd and intel kind of jumped the gun on these launches and if they would have been better served by waiting for 40 90 as well as radeon 7000 to be generally available so that they could really let these new cpus stretch their wings i mean half the problem here could be that gpu bottlenecks are hiding performance jumps we would otherwise see on the subject of hiding things intel was happy to compare against their last gen top of the line and amd's price competitive 5950x but as we outlined in our ryzen 7000 review yesterday the real gaming champion of last generation was the ryzen 5800 x 3d to intel's credit they did test against it and they did include it in some of their performance graphs but notably not in the one percent lows graph and in the weirdest possible way when they did like clearly it would have been too cluttered to just add a fourth bar here right a long uncomfortable fourth bar of course that's not even the issue we started with here if you check the fine print you'll notice that the test benches are mostly the same but memory speeds are kind of all over the place now part of this is unavoidable you can't ram ddr5 into an am4 board pun intended but even considering the challenges i do have some questions about intel's configurations the 13900k was tested with ddr5 at 5600 mega transfers per second c28 that is fast premium memory for the 12 900k they went with 4 800 mega transfer per second c28 it's not trashed here by any stretch but it is significantly slower when faster kits have existed for a year and are widely in use on 12th gen platforms but wait there's more the amd processors were tested on a hyper expensive asus crosshair motherboard and yet intel claims that 3200 mega transfer per second was the fastest memory supported and so that's what they used except um it's pretty well known that amd takes great advantage of fast ddr4 with the point of diminishing returns being more like the 3600 range they also mentioned the lower power limit of 105 watts tdp so is amd's precision boost overdrive enabled we reached out to intel and we'll include a response and a pinned comment once we get it but either way it's something that should have been disclosed to be clear this chicanery persists across the entire industry and it's a big part of why ltt and other tech review channels get to exist so um yay no all right i mean i i get it whenever a company is going to show off their latest and greatest whether it's amd nvidia or anyone else they are going to want to cherry pick ing at you apple so to know how these products really stack up you're gonna have to wait a little longer for our full review but that doesn't make these announcements pointless because they often inform how we can best evaluate a product and it looks like we might actually have to rethink how we go about multitasking benchmarking thanks to a little bit of magic called intel hybrid technology they're calling users who want to do it all at the same time mega taskers you know gaming streaming recording maybe even running a render in the background and they're saying that 13th gen can do it all at once without a hitch it kinda sounds like nonsense but this demo they ran is pretty cool they utilized p-course the performance course to render an animation in one program then minimize that program and brought unreal engine 5 to the foreground and started building lighting at this point the p cores change gears and swap to handle ue5 while the e-cores pick up the rendering slack and chug along in the back background that is pretty wild stuff if you've ever hit the build button and then had to walk away because your pc basically became unusable for 20 minutes well now you can hit build and then check out exclusive ltt content on floatplane.com while you wait like this extra hour of footage from the build with my sister back to the cpu though what's really impressive is the efficiency gains the numbers intel showing are with the 13900k running at about 12 more watts than the 12900k so yes power consumption really did go up but according to this graph that's only because they're pushing it to the red line and if you don't do that efficiency is also way up so you under volters out there could have an absolute field day with this platform they claim validation absolutely needed that at just 65 watts the 13 900k can match a 12 900k at 240 watts that's a quarter of the power that could mean that our lower tdp chips like core i5s and core i3s might absolutely rip and without turning your system into a space heater and it gets better remember how they wouldn't confirm early on whether ddr4 would be supported on 13th gen raptor lake well it looks like it is going to be a thing at least until the end of this socket cycle so if you like me are disappointed by the lack of both lakes and raptors at least we can both be excited about what this means for budget oriented gamers let's say you haven't upgraded in years you're still running a 6700k or a 1700x maybe even older how do you modernize well grab a new chip grab a board maybe a cooler adapter bracket throw in your old ram even if it might cost you a little bit of performance and you're off to the races for under 500 bucks for a platform upgrade want to save another buck well the z790 platform improvements aren't really all that huge for most people like we're talking a few more pcie gen 4 lanes you know maybe for some more storage and some more usb 20 gigabit ports so you could grab a last gen z690 or even a budget b660 board and call it a day that is on all brand new all readily available hardware once 13th gen releases on october 20th and if you're just a baller who wants z790 and 3900k with the latest and greatest ddr5 well the core i9 this generation is only 590 dollars that's still a lot of money but it's over a hundred dollars cheaper than the 7950x giving you plenty left over to pick up a wan hoodie from lttstore.com obviously and i can't state this enough we need to do our own testing for our full review which is on its way and we will be sure to give the competition a fair shake by the way but so far the improvements to 13th gen do look extremely promising we've been impressed by the performance of 12th gen for the last year despite the absolutely bonkers temperatures that intel just seems to ignore particularly the 12 700k when it comes to gaming that thing is not and if intel has also managed to put out the inferno while improving performance could be a no-brainer or is it i mean on the amd side you might pay extra but you'll be in on the ground floor of hopefully another long-lived socket or maybe that doesn't matter to you because you only upgrade every five years anyway either way it is nice to have so much choice isn't it just like we chose today's sponsor
