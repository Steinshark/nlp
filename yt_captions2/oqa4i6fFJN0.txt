how to become a full stack developer if you 
are someone sitting here watching this video   and you've googled this i can guarantee one 
of your first thoughts that came to mind is   there is a lot of information out there where 
do i start i can guarantee this because i have   been there as someone who has been a full 
stack developer for almost five years now   when i started out my self-learning journey 
ended up going to a coding bootcamp but at   first i was like where do i start there is so much 
information out there how do you know what is good   information what is bad do i need a certified 
certificate do i need what what do i need   you get what i'm saying in this video i am 
going to break down for you what exactly   is a full stack developer and how to become one 
before we can get really into how to become a   full stack developer we need to understand 
just exactly what is a full stack developer   well to answer that question first let's let's 
go to our trusty friend google who knows all   do they i don't know as a developer you always 
think google knows all according to google the   first thing that comes up for me is full 
stack developers straddle two separate web   development domains the front end and the back 
end front end includes of course the client side   uh or site viewer and anything that a user can 
interact with and then of course by contrast   the backend is the servers databases and 
other architecture so that sounds like a lot   is it even possible nowadays to become a full 
stack developer and this term full stack developer   has really gotten carried away some people say 
no one is even possible it's not even possible   to come become a full stack developer and i 
really think it is because i really think the   term really refers to both the front and back and 
side of things when people start saying full stack   developer means that you're also doing uh devops 
or that you're also doing qa i think that's taking   a little too too far and we're going into other 
roles today we are going to break it up into   two sections let's talk about the front end and 
then let's talk about the back end okay let's go and in this video i'm going to be reviewing the 
two meta courses around front end and back in   development these are two courses two programs 
that you can take and go through which will   really equip you for front-end and then also 
back-end so if you take both of them of course   we get a full stack one of the things that really 
stood out to me about each of these courses is   when you are complete one of them so say you have 
completed the front-end course you will actually   have exclusive access to the meta career programs 
job board so this is really a job search platform   that connects you with over 200 plus employers 
who have committed to sourcing talent through meta   certificate programs so i think it's a kind 
of win-win situation one hand you are learning   and growing and then on the other hand once you 
complete the course you actually get to utilize   that to network and meet other people and i've 
never seen anything like this before so i think   it's really cool that they have really combined 
both the education side of things and then the   networking side of things because really if you 
want to get a job and you're an amazing developer   amazing front-end developer but you don't have the 
right network or right connection it's going to be   really difficult okay let's just dive into what is 
really required in a front-end developer or as a   front-end developer well of course let's start 
with the basics we gotta know html i know it's   not the most exciting thing for people to learn 
and they want to jump right to javascript but   html is something that you need to learn and 
i would say learn first alongside with html   of course is css equally as important and as i 
mentioned you might want to skip through these or   just power through so you can focus on javascript 
or a framework but at the end of the day you need   to have a strong fundamental strong foundation 
before you start going to the next step after   though you have a strong understanding of both 
html and css we can move on to the exciting stuff   which is javascript exciting but also if you were 
to ask me when i was learning it it would be more   like terrifying but this course really helps you 
walk through it and get a deep understanding as to   the basics of javascript and carries you on into 
becoming an expert in it now with a front-end   developer you are not necessarily if you're 
just focusing on front-end you're not going to   you don't need to be a designer or familiar with 
the back end per se but having an understanding   of how these kind of different roles work i think 
is really important and i like in this course you   actually get to learn figma and that's a tool that 
a lot of designers use so if it's something that   as a front-end developer you become accustomed 
to and familiar with it will really help you   when you are speaking to designers it will help 
you with the language or maybe they send you just   different mock-ups of their designs through figma 
and you will be using figma it's something that i   didn't learn until i actually started working in 
the industry how to use it and it's one of those   things that i don't see a lot of different either 
courses boot camps programs whatever the case may   be teaching it and this really stood out to me 
that they really highlight that and teach that   alongside that of course the everlove very in 
demand react i'm a react girl at heart so i'm very   happy they focus on react and then also bootstrap 
i think one of the most important things so   if you are a front-end or back-end developer 
that does not get spoken about enough we always   talk about the you know the javascript the react 
all the coding parts of it but we don't really   speak enough about the version control learning 
git learning how to utilize uh version control   content management systems uh is so important 
and once again when i was learning how to code   at first it's something i really skimmed over and 
then in turn when i had my first developer job   i really had trouble with it it was 
a whole thing so i was so scared   of it at that time and even using the terminal 
or anything like that i was like this is so   strange to me so the fact that if you can 
pick up uh git and version control right   from the get-go you will really stand out 
i think especially when you're looking for   you know your first or second job as a 
developer and in this course you will learn   github repositories for version control content 
management systems and also how to edit images   going back into figma now let's talk about 
money let's talk about what is an average   salary or total compensation for a front-end 
developer well for this let's go to my favorite   website if you know me these are my videos you 
know where we are going which is levels fyi   i'm going to literally right now real time people 
okay let's go salaries by title we are going to   go to what do we have here we have for options 
we have full stack no we want front end come on web development front end okay so when i google 
and this is just once again this can really vary   based on location experience so many different 
things but web development front end we're looking   at a median total compensation package around 142 
000 u.s so this once again can vary greatly way up   down depending on where you are located but 
it's a great salary a great total compensation   especially if you are someone who loves 
doing the front end work of things   seeing things come to life where animations 
come to life with javascript that was one of   my favorite things and it's such a job that you 
can really grow into with front-end development   and also vacuum development there are so 
many ways that you can really structure   your career for example if you start out as 
a front-end developer you can really grow it   into becoming a dev lead where you lead a bunch 
of developers to a manager to an architect to   there's just a project manager the possibilities 
are endless you can continue down strictly   front-end become a senior front-end developer and 
so on and i think that's one of the best things   for me that i love about coding and tech 
in general is the possibilities are really   whatever you put on yourself whatever you want 
to do however you want to grow your career you   can do that okay i feel like that gives us a 
good understanding as what a front-end developer   is what is required and once again if we have 
a checklist it's javascript html css learning a   library or a framework like react learning version 
control learning what else did we say i think that   covers it all sigma content management systems 
it's that's kind of it in a nutshell no big deal   you know it's okay but no with this course 
i think it's a really great way to check off   all those boxes and also too what i like is at the 
end of the course closer to the end of it you will   actually build a real world project so this gives 
you a project that you can put into your portfolio   let's talk about back end least last but not least 
i feel like you're hearing all my horrible things   last but not least back-end development when i 
started my career was the direction i wanted to go   and if i'm being really honest with you the main 
reason i wanted to become a back-end developer   versus a front-end is because of the time backhand 
sounded cooler and i don't know if that's still   true today i do both now i started out as a back 
end then moved to front end and i really like them   both but definitely have done more front end as of 
recent so i guess that's where i'm landing right   now back end is a great way for anyone who really 
is interested in architecture and learning more   about the systems and with this backend course 
through meta it will actually teach you how to   do the python syntax which is really the most 
popular choice when it comes to machine learning   data science and artificial intelligence so python 
is one of those languages that you can use it for   so many different things in your career that even 
if you start out as a back-end developer and you   want to go into machine learning or ai you will 
have the knowledge of that programming language   to move it over to do that actually and this is a 
10 course program put on by meta of course again   and it will teach you in demand programming 
skills will really walk you through uh how to   solve different coding problems not just how to 
solve but how to think as a back-end developer   and i think that's really important to highlight 
because oftentimes it's easy to learn something   new we can do that we can all do that but to 
train our mind to really think in a different   way that is another skill in itself and i really 
like that they put focus on that as to how to   solve problems and similar to front-end there 
will also be git repositories version control   and linux commands so what does a back end really 
consist of well as we know we are speaking about   a very popular programming language python we need 
to know a database and in this program they teach   mysql of course there is mysql nosql and right 
now they are focusing on my sql in this course   they also talk about how to craft and really 
develop sql queries which is super important and   one of my favorite things to do when i was 
learning sql i was like this is so fun because   it's kind of like english but in a secret code 
kind of way you feel kind of like covert but it's   pretty simple to pick up the other thing they talk 
about in this course is django which of course is   the most popular web framework for python and 
also though i like how they really focus on   how the front end consumes apis so as a back-end 
developer it's important for you to understand how   the front-end works to some degree of course if 
you are becoming a full-stack developer and doing   both of these courses it's it's kind of one of the 
ways to put the puzzle pieces together and then   similar to the front-end course this one as well 
focuses on how to prepare for technical interviews   and roles when it be front-end or back-end and i 
love that they talk about the interview portion   of this and as it's put on by meta one of the top 
tech companies uh one of the main companies it's   definitely going to give you insight as to what 
these companies really look for during technical   interviews similar to the front-end course as 
well there is a community and network that you   can join after you complete this course of once 
again over 200 plus employers who have committed   to finding talent sourcing talent through meta 
certificate programs so it also opens up a world   a gates of opportunity for you i think at the 
end of the day so many people get caught up on   the specific programming language to learn should 
i focus on front end or back end they almost   become frozen and don't just take a jump just jump 
into it and that's why i really wanted to speak   about these two courses today because one of the 
most popular questions i get is what course should   i take tiff i don't know there's so many out there 
going back to the beginning of this video where   to start and these two courses are places that 
i would start if i was to do it all over again   it's something that you can do on your own 
time at home but have come out of it with   so much knowledge and a network i linked them 
both down below so make sure to check them out   thank you all for watching this video i hope 
you found it valuable in understanding both   the front end and also back inside of things 
and i will see you all soon thanks everyone you
