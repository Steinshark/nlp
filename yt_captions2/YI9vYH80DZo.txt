okay chat is unhinged today chat is fully unhinged today i don't know what's wrong with you chat but today y'all are unhinged we want to see it okay okay this is the single greatest achievement of my life to date this kid's like 16. and he's already accomplished more than i'll ever accomplish and now look at me now i already hate my life thank you internet kid that now made me realize how dumb i am this feels great this feels great as gutenberg with his press or eiffel with his tower i have brought forth my genus upon the world bro what's going on what you shouldn't be impressed because i spent 600 hours and five months making a punk club you should be impressed because it's running on a computer that isn't self-running inside of the game terraria [music] [applause] [music] yo i have kids i don't think i got time for this but man would i like to watch a video where someone else did this for 15 minutes you know i know he spent 600 hours and many weeks of his time but look at me i can enjoy it in 15 minutes [music] first off some background turmeria is a sandbox adventure game where you explore the world and fight bosses to progress okay you can basically think of it as a 2d minecraft clone although for some reason people get very mad on reddit if you ever say so inside the game i know you're not supposed to do this during watching a video okay i know you're not supposed to do that i know you're not supposed to do that but have you ever seen this person right here slappable jerk excuse me sir by any chance have you seen a brown cat around here did you just say cat yes my cat he's been missing since this morning there's no way that you're not trolling i'm sorry how did one lose a computerized axial tomography machine known to the layman as a cat scan when they were literally over 350 kilograms so when he says reddit doesn't like it when you call it a a 2d minecraft this is what i think of when i hear that this is what i think of as this guy right here just going full on all times oh my goodness that i love that comment that comment was beautiful there's a mechanical it's like the same thing when you call reactive framework react is desperately being like there's no such thing we're not a framework you use react the library and then you use a meta framework we don't do frameworks okay i hear you calm down why don't you take a little seat why don't you just take a little moment okay all right which lets you trigger certain tiles such as opening doors or activating traps when i say i've created a computer inside terraria what i mean is that i've completely simulated the inner workings of a regular computer except instead of electronics i did it inside of a video game boy but let's start at the beginning around five months ago i was playing terraria for a few hours and i was getting a bit bored so i decided to try out the wiring system on a whim at the beginning i knew pretty much nothing about it but i quickly realized it's super powerful and you can do some really awesome things with it here's a simple example whenever you flip the switch a signal i assume this is effectively just redstone in minecraft i mean sorry it's not minecraft i get it a few hours yeah a few hours and you're into the wiring system i assume that comes a little bit later in the game let's pass through the red wire that opens and closes the door it's the same for turning on and off the candle okay each different color of wire acts independently so if we cross the red and blue wire they just ignore each other oh cool most basic building block of how computers are implemented is the logic game these are tiny individual units that take in several inputs and emit an output based on some videos so he built literally a billion nand gates is that all he did was just just build nand gate after nand gate after nand gate forevermore on onto at infinitum oh my goodness computers are made by extensive combinations of these gates terraria has some traditional logic gates such as and ore but for complicated and frustrating timing reasons these are ridiculously hard to work with instead for my computer i exclusively use a different type of gate that looks like this there are three parts in each of these gates the input the state and the output whenever a switch is used to trigger the image does that mean it's a it's an xor gate xor in some sense has a state to it right a peen gate it's a peen gate is that where the state comes from put if the state is on then the output emits a signal otherwise nothing happens for instance you can see that the door only opens and closes if the state wire is on in real world circuits when a circuit is on it stays on but in terraria everything is just sent in pulses this means it behaves completely differently and a lot of traditional circuits have to be redesigned in this new paradigm you might think that we're just getting started i didn't get that part what was the purpose of the blue one and see that the door only opens and closes if the state wire is on um but in terraria everything is just sent in pulses this means that behaves completely i think i understand how it's working well no because you have this state so if you compound a bunch together you could effectively make andanores and you could make all logic gates definitely and a lot of traditional circuits have to be redesigned in this new paradigm you might think that we're just getting started but that's it the entirety of the in-game cpu exclusively uses these gates in various different copulated configurations and absolutely nothing else the complexity comes from the different ways that these logic gates can interact with each other i really hope this kid is getting a masters right now in this game i really hope that he got awarded some level of certificate that says you are hireable by anybody because this many hours building a cpu what i mean i spent a semester building a cpu out of a few little little this and that give you an idea of how we can make interesting mechanisms from these seemingly simple building blocks imagine hitting two of these gates okay there's the penis gate when the input triggers it checks the first date if that's activated then it triggers the next gate which checks the other state finally if both were on then the second gate emits a signal and the door opens okay okay so that's an end game if you think about it we've just created the world's least secure combination lock all we have to do is change the direction of the switches and hide the gates from the user and now only a single combination will allow entrances the length of the code can be extended by just chaining together more of this okay i really did not get that part hold on we gotta look at this what did he just do there hold on i'm going way too in depth on here we've just created the world's least secure combination lock all we have to do is okay so each one's feeding into the next one change the direction of the switches and hide the gates from the user and now only a single combination will allow entrances the length of the code can be extended by just chaining together more of this oh so you made some sort of code that okay see i didn't i don't understand okay as i was playing around with them i started getting really excited just by tinkering around with these things i was able to get many basic real world circuits working that are in every computer like adders and multiplexers okay making an actual computer with them was the obvious next step but that's a massive jumping complexity from what i had i like how it's just like i made an adder to multiplexer so clearly the next thing is to uh make a computer i'm gonna make an entire computer obviously clearly clearly next step so we decided it's not go update your arch drivers instead it is to make a a full computer itself wanted to spend the next two weeks putting in an unhealthy amount of hours making a prototype [music] thank you [music] there's so many penis gates in there they made 32 bits dominated in a functional albeit simple prototype computer here you can see it calculating the fibonacci numbers the a register shows the current value in the sequence and b holds the next both in binary i've displayed the decimal versions below to understand how it works let's talk a bit about how i can't believe you just used candles to light up which bits are on got you gotta appreciate it you gotta appreciate the fact that you just use candles if you just work on the inside computers at least in high level functionality are surprisingly simple imagine a computer as a combination of a button a huge list of instructions a calculator and some scratch paper every time the button is pressed the current instruction in the list is fed into the calculator then i actually have these at home i have this exact item right here this is what we use to store our granola in okay by the way great little buckets right here um i just it's just just saying the result is written onto the scratch paper in case it might be used again later the next time the button is pressed the next instruction is actually he is touching grass there's a serious levels here we see that the computer just moves endlessly incrementing by two each time that's quite simple but even programs as complicated as the app or browser that you're watching this video on are composed of millions of simple instructions just like this of course computer engineers have fancy names for all of these instead of a button that you have to manually press to execute the next instruction computers have extremely fast clocks that automatically press the button up to billions of times a second the list of instructions is the program you're executing which i don't understand how that works obviously i've never looked into these some sort of oscillating crystal to me that's just whatever that means it just sounds like magic to me can we all agree that that this if you don't know what the thing actually is when someone says that phrase to you you're just like sounds like magic i hope that means i don't know what you're trying to say but that sounds like magic you have something that's vibrating in there i don't get it why do you got vibrators in there what kind of computer are you creating i don't know what this means right crystals i know what a crystal is but mine are like blue and white and they come with like a hard rocky gray shell to them i don't get how that works why are my crystals vibrating the calculator is called the arithmetic logic unit or ale classical spanish paper corresponds to registers which are like temporary buckets you can store numbers in between calculations finally all the data being passed between these components has been written here in a human readable form but because computers can only interpret ones and zeros everything is represented in some kind of binary form yep how exactly each of these instructions is encoded in ones and zeros is called the instruction set there's one other component to add to this one to actually organize the flow of data between each of these modules something called the control unit is in charge of telling each of the other components what to do and when it's kind of enough can you believe all of this was created just so you could display a list of cat pictures on twitter like just just just for a moment just i want you to revel and appreciate what has been done for you to look at cat pictures okay just for a moment i just just remember that somebody came up with this idea it just didn't exist and somebody said well you know what came up with the idea then made it and it was successful figured out how to oscillate crystals i still don't know what that means this all seems pretty little micro program my prototype there's enough money for 32 instructions each eight bits long there's an alu which executes arithmetic instructions such as addition and it reads and writes to a pair of registers labeled a and b post other stuff is the control unit okay so these are all 8-bit longs uh because you can see with the candles the candle count was only eight and obviously the alu i assume each one of these represent a bit however this thing works this is just representing a bit this not quite sure i understand what's happening there of course it's not obvious how breaking it down this way actually helps anything all we've done is take one hard problem and converted it into five other also hard problems it feels like trying to cure yourself of syphilis by infecting yourself with malaria it's oh we did that okay yeah you know so you know humans in the past have tried a lot of dumb things okay i'm just saying it wasn't too long ago that uh that at one point it was suggested that butt chugging coffee cures cancer okay just because just because people said you used to be able to do a little bit a bit of butt chug of coffee to cure cancer doesn't mean it actually worked out i'm just saying it was a thing okay we did a lot of dub stuff okay coffee consumption and the risk of colorectal cancer don't budge don't butt chug coffee okay don't bathe in vodka i get that you can do it just don't do it how many gallons we talking here tobacco at them it turns out people did a lot of things seems crazy like we're getting nowhere but it actually somehow works a lot of computer science is basically that though breaking hard problems into more manageable chunks oh so that one just worked okay so it's not like butt chugging coffee all right i uh i didn't realize you could throw a little bit of malaria to cure that syphilis you know what i'm talking about it now science okay unlike the open-ended task of building a computer each of these units have very well-defined inputs and outputs for example the best part of waking up is folgers in your butt it almost even arrives it's a soft rhyme it's so good well to make a circuit that adds two numbers we know the exact rules of government addition and we just have to get clever in how we hook up the gates to match these rules just like how we did for the combination lock earlier this is a compact circuit to add to one bit numbers look at all those dick registers there were a lot of problems with this first prototype as expected yeah i remember how i mentioned that only the specific kind of logic gate should be used making this prototype was where i realized why the other ones don't work but not before some extensive cranial agitation in minecraft for a few days the instructions that i used was custom made and very limited i was literally adding new operation codes on a spreadsheet when i implemented it that's good though from a full skill computer i wanted to implement a real world instructions by the way you can definitely tell that this kit has a lot of experience making things because he did this right here do you see this nice gap going on here because when you don't do that you get just the worst things ever okay i like this i like what i'm saying smart kids exactly what this means but it's a massive difference that enables most of what i've done here but it involves firmware work and sharing complete compliance to a strict standard finally performance wise my prototype was pathetic my targets for the full computer was 100 kilobytes of memory and far faster running speeds at this point i had a plan for the full scale project now i just needed to implement it thank you building the full computer to think about like did he write unit tests for this like how do you know you're not just completely up at some like imagine trying to find a bug in this just imagine finding a bug in this oh oh gosh a long time like a really long time there are mods and editors that enable some copy and paste functionality but any kind of circuitry that isn't exactly copied has to be redone by hand all in all this took around three months of active development and along the way i learned a huge amount about digital logic and cpu design surprisingly spending three months playing terraria has improved my career prospects i would like to say that this is one of the reasons why i've always told you go explore and just build dumb things because at the end of the day building dumb things can genuinely help you with your life it doesn't matter that it was stupid probably got probably got more months that he would get would get class he took in college he actually understands it because he's applying what he learns and then having to do a transform to it and so there's just so much benefit to this this is awesome oh man my screen tearing is so good right now after all that though i had finally done it i designed and built a complete computer from scratch in terraria to give you a sense of scale here's the prototype i talked about earlier here's how big it is when compared to the real size of the final version looking back at projects like this in hindsight always gives the sense that things just work perfectly in the first try but they really really don't i wanted to give you a small taste i wanted to see the debugging so um you can see the problem right no well you can at least tell the difference between the right and wrong version right it has to be right there oh my goodness what are we missing boys what are we missing what are we missing here boys obviously it's right there oh come on hold on let me just give give me a second here give me a second just to really feel this out i don't think i don't think there's enough penis capacitors still though okay fine let's zoom in a bit i'm sure now you can see the difference right somehow you're making me feel stupider when you say it this loud out loud for me to not notice it i just feel more i feel more dumb way to wait a second wait oh no colors are just disappearing for my eyes you know that one okay nope no idea i'll even give you a few seconds the problem turned out to be that this green wire was the wrong shade of green which meant that the whole thing worked unpredictably you know what i'm fine working in react i'm actually i think it's okay to work and react honestly i think it's great yeah colorblind imagine having eight percent of males just simply cannot work in this language colorblind and i didn't even know where in the world it was it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack except for the needle is hay shaped and amber rather than the golden yellow that the hay is here comes the antagonist in our story though leg imagine you spent months building this monster's creation and you excitedly turn it on and then well that's what would happen if you tried to run it it turns out for reasons unbeknownst to me terraria an indie game from over a decade ago is not particularly well optimized for massive wiring projects the size of an entire world it's actually i genuinely felt that one i genuinely felt that one i actually just got i thought i i thought my internet cut out really really intuitive why it's so slow when the switch is pressed just as before the door should open every time the switch is pressed the game one by one looks at each wire along the way checks each of its neighbors and if it has any tries to go down those as well it repeats this process all the way through the entire level it's a 4n algorithm this wire is pretty short but when your computer is the size of a world going back and forth across thousands of tiles many times can grind the game engine to a halt instead remembered every time that this switch corresponded to this door without manually checking each wire in between the game could run at much more reasonable speeds there are many other more complicated optimizations you can also do all of this logic is set by the developers of terraria inside the game though so there's nothing we can do about it a terraria computer is just not realistically possible or is it my solution to this problem was just to take it head-on and re-implement the game's wiring system my mod called wirehead takes over and overrides the entire wiring system in terraria with its own custom version while keeping the in-game logic identical the game plays exactly the same but it is way way faster for reference when running without the accelerator mod the computer runs at around 0.1 instructions per second when using the mod i get a that my friends is beautiful that's giga chat that is full level giga chatting around 5000 instructions per second to give you an idea of how much faster this is that's like the difference in speed between a 95 year old absolutely booking their way across the street and a supersonic concord airliner that's not a metaphorical comparison either the ratio between their speeds is literally how much my mod speeds up the game but that's not all if you order now i'll throw in absolutely free and extensive and extremely over engineered software tool chain supporting development in computer area i've written wirehead to enable programmatic control of the entire terraria rope so you can use it to write arbitrary binary programs into the computer's memory i've also written a high level and easy to use rust application driver set up the official risk 5 instruction set compliance test to run in game and even published a docker image with continuous integration to automatically run regression tests whenever the world has changed there's a ton of cool stuff here but i won't get into it in this video as i think more people are interested in the terraria part of the terraria computer so just know isn't this how all projects end up isn't this just like how all projects end up at the end of the day it's just this there's just me that's actually interested i know that there's a lot of work in the background to keep things running smoothly enough weight let's take a look at what's possible with this thing i already showed pong so let's start there what's cool about pong is that it runs in real time and takes user input when i recorded this i was in game controlling the left pad a five kilohertz terraria character is converted into wiring signals and then interpreted as up or down which is why my character is jerking around like that it's unbelievably satisfying to play a video game live in a general purpose computer you made inside another video game another program i've written from my computer is conway's game of life the game of life is a set of extremely simple rules that produce fascinating patterns when applied repeatedly to a grid of cells that are either alive or dead here you can see it running in-game unfortunately i have never built conway's game of life i have never built conway's game of life do it now in rust why would i do it in rust when we can do it in go and htmx i'm just saying why would i ever build that idea in rust i mean that sounds entirely too simple additionally because it's quite computationally expensive it doesn't run very fast even after i optimize the program for speed quite a bit this recording is sped up by 240 times oh wow okay that's well i've saved the best for last so far everything i do has been pretty simple 2d programs if it's not doom but what if you could venture into the third dimension if it ain't doom amazingly even on a cpu as resource limited as this you can note that this isn't just playing back a pre-recorded pixel video it's actually rendering a full 3d world from the perspective of a certain xyz coordinate and displaying it on the screen you just say zed if this ain't doom i'm going to be exceptionally upset but i do want to follow up with you're not allowed to call it zed if you haven't if you have a freedom accent okay freedom accent and zeds don't go together okay uh you know i believe in crossing your sevens all right we all cross our sevens but we don't say zed as with the game of life it's currently too slow to run in real time since it takes 45 seconds just to render a single thing i can't take full credit here though a friend of mine wrote this super efficient program and all i did was optimize it for this computer while not quite a simple doom clone yet we're far closer to it than i was expecting at least he had mentioned doom clone so what's next a simple version of terraria running inside the game terraria is definitely something i want to do and i'm pretty close it might take a bit more work in the accelerator but that's the obvious next milestone everything i've done so far is open source and available on public github repositories linked in the description if you're curious about this project take a look and check them out the rust interface to write programs is quite easy to use if you have even a bit of software experience it's a lot like writing a simpler arduino program and i'd be thrilled to see some more programs for if you've made it this far thank you for watching please like subscribe comment and i don't know start my github if you're interested why start your github when you can just purchase stars we all know that just buy your own stars who needs it let's just buy our own stars private attempt to shut up i'm not tempted i honestly if i was if i was okay so real talk if i was a full-time creator and i wasn't working at netflix by the way full time by the way um i would actually do these things i would most certainly go on and build something in this just because that sounds amazing but the reality is that uh you know when you have um when you have a wife and kids and a full-time job and you're successful and you would like to get a kiss from my wife once a month you know you can't you can't play with terrarium or whatever it's called okay that's not how it works that's not you just that's just not how it works in life so you got to pick your battles and my battles most certainly aren't there okay i've just thrown it out there it ain't it ain't there yet it ain't it detailed video going over but if anybody happens to know any nigerian prince is giving away billions of dollars ready for me all i needed to do is add my bank account i'm ready i'm ready please let me know in the comments i'd be happy to go into it [music] [applause] let's go okay no we're not looking at asman gold we're not looking at asthma gold yes my recommendations are me myself literally my own video as men gold and miss monique okay i live a sheltered life i i live a sheltered life don't make fun of me that was absolutely the greatest thing ever please you know you don't have to build what he built okay obviously we some of us have less available time than he has to be able to build things but real talk build things build anything because you become an expert by exploring and doing dumb stuff you don't become an expert by just doing what you need to do during your day job uh real talk here i'll like that faux show like that one i'm already subscribed hell yeah i've already subscribed i didn't even realize that from scratch this must be the not first from scratch video i've watched oh yeah that's right i've watched some other from scratch video anyways very very good for you just to like build anything right maybe i need to build conway's game of life using go and htmx which might just happen here shortly okay it might just actually happen here very very soon the name don't have imposter syndrome the name is don't get imposter syndrome from this guy instead of spire and take confidence that you too can build the world's most absolute technology but become a master in doing so again
