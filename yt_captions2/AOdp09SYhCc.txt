i have built pcs for myself my wife my kids my colleagues even an nba star but the one person i've never built a computer for my little sister i brought in my favorite little sister to answer two questions for us one is growing up next to a tech nerd enough to just absorb by osmosis the skills that you need to build a pc from scratch and number two can we get you off that xbox and mac for your gaming and onto a pc sorry for the love of all that is good bella maybe we're gonna try oh and it's brought to you by our sponsor ridge ridge wallet has redefined the traditional wallet with its compact frame and rfid blocking plates the balls in your pants shouldn't be from your wallet use offer code linus to save 10 and get free worldwide shipping today [music] here's the catch this computer is yours but the deal is that once you experience it you have to decide do you keep it and trade me your mac or do you keep your mac my mac is old well then it looks like this is going to be a low bar for me to clear the sims [laughter] the sims are gonna run like you've never seen them before okay now do you have any idea where to start here open the boxes wow she's a natural which box that one wow that's a valid choice sort of that's not really you're just going to just going to grab things you thought that was a knife it was a razor i mean sure okay fine you know what no we're going to do this the bellow way it's called the rip jaw this is your case this is the fractal design pop air and it's not that we're stereotyping i just legitimately did think you might appreciate a case with pink accents i love it now i didn't get a chance to screen these first but they included some questions for you do you feel you have an advantage or a disadvantage when it comes to building computers because you have me for a brother i don't think that it does anything for me much except for today i might get a computer out of it that's a fair response for those of you who are wondering this is not the sibling that i have raged about on the podcast who damaged the finish on my crt i'm fairly certain it was a different one who's that what's this you don't know about this no my monitor don't you remember when [laughter] and like yes yeah still hasn't apologized for that or admitted it but i'm 100 sure no one admitted to killing my mouse so killing your mouse mystery still remains unsolved oh in the book yes you do know it was a hamster was it you no i thought that was a hamster so yeah uh her mouse got closed in a book i mean at least you weren't forced to eat it it was a crime that went unsolved you remember how they made me eat my pet goat right yeah i'd eat it too what it's a different time it's a different time okay you wouldn't understand yeah that looks familiar sure i'll get you another one of our questions while you open up your graphics card all right this is graphics card yeah you probably remember linus before he was actually any good at this stuff can you think of a time when he made the problem worse rather than better yes i have a specific memory in mind uh-huh you were doing something similar to this and you're trying to run water through tubes remember that i mean i've run water through a lot of tubes over the years anyway the water did not stay in the tubes i do remember that i lost a 7950 gt i must have blocked that from my memory yes i had a very you asked i had a very bad leak on the back of my 7950 gt sli setup yeah that um you used to ask mom to hide your video games and you would freak out and want them back i'd forgotten about this too why didn't they ask you these things you go through withdrawal and then she wouldn't give them to you you said swear to me you're not gonna give them back to me okay so this is what you call um a hard disk this is actually the last step oh so we're going to put this aside we'll save this for later yeah we'll save this for later all these guys this is really cool actually i do remember these and it made me think of like a aerial view of a city now it goes into the computer it could or it could go right here oh okay yeah now it goes here yeah corsair i know that company do you air mattresses hair dryers right are you but do you do your different corsairs okay whoa cool does it go right there yeah no it doesn't what do you mean no does it yeah oh wow cool you're messing with me you'll need some screws i would never in a hundred years mess with okay okay i'm going to show you how to use the screwdriver balloons on me from the roof it would flatten me to the ground it would not flatten you to the ground but it was really funny we had a three and a half story and rig the front porch with squirt guns and with trip actually pretty funny but later much later so this is your cpu this is kind of like the brain of the computer does all the processing you're really manhandling that cpu oh sorry it should not be touched is it not to be touched like with your fingers oil fingers it would be best not to oh my god yeah we're just going to put it there sure we've gone with a 12 400 it's got six p cores no efficiency cores but for gaming purposes this is more than enough okay that looks really good that looks really perfect actually awesome you just installed your first cpu feels good now do you want to go for the easy but not as quiet and not as cool cooler no let's do this one that's easy hey yeah this is the ltt edition nhu 12s it was a collab product that we did with noctua way back in the day we still have a few of them winning it it's an award-winning cooler it's not an award-winning like our logo being on it this is interesting looking yeah this reminds me of like big server rooms and movies yeah so this is a cooler this goes right on we both had the same dad does this go metal touching yeah i had an idea not yet though oh just kidding so first we need a mounting bracket first is a mounting bracket which is probably this that is a mounting bracket but nothing we need not the one we need sorry this princess is in another castle it goes right there right yep now we got to decide which way we want to put our cooler on oh so we're probably going to blow air toward the back where the exhaust is that makes sense we're going to put it on this way which means we're going to put these guys on a little something like this just like that and then you're going to use those thumb nuts to screw them into place was linus always on the family pc when you guys were kids often not always we grew up on a farm so there were many things to be done outdoors linus was often found on the pc or chopping firewood shoveling manure shoveling manure you know the glamorous jobs well i could be found you know beheading chickens or breaking the ice in the pond to collect water what year is this are you really so allergic to using my screwdriver is this product so i like it you are actually putting in screws by hand it looks like it's supposed to be putting in screws also we need thermal compound first oh of course you're going to apply glue uncooked pea sized amount right in the smack dab middle of that okay that's a lot more pee i mean we both had trouble controlling our pee so that's to be expected are you always waiting for that you took longer than i thought you would bedwetters big time yeah big time both of us like into our well into our teens yeah builds character though oh yeah all right this is really secure yeah that's not going anywhere that's like my city has a massive tower yeah that's actually called the tower cooler oh this is all done oh okay yep we'll need that pretty shortly but not yet that well that we put in already oh oh this nope oh these things sure razors terabyte what does this mean uh 1 000 megabytes gigabytes oh crap yes oh that's embarrassing this is ram does it go any certain way yeah okay you'll figure it out so you uh for the slots you want these these little guys yep oh i don't know what oh yay perfect okay now this is the moment where you are second most likely to bung up your computer okay see these little standoffs in here yeah let's show all you did a great job of applying those stickers but they made it a little heavy they're a little front heavy now mm-hmm so they fell right so you see all these little standoffs yes these are made of metal yep i can see that now let's imagine for a moment get scratched piece of metal scraping across the back of a motherboard i have hands like a surgeon good god um you're not a doctor medical school oh wow that's actually wait did you get it you got it ah no ah we have another question by the way which of you got into more trouble as a child as if you what you thought you would say me shut up i was a good kid you were constantly in trouble no you never ate you were always always made the family late you got lost at public events that's true constantly still happens how many times were you in the principal's office admit fairly frequently i was never in the principal's office never one time i did not get into more trouble i never got into trouble ever that's such horse you were always in trouble okay i did get in a fair bit of trouble for like pyromania related offenses how about the firecracker in the toilet who did that that wasn't a firecracker that was hair spray i just happened to get the mixture exactly right and it went off like a fire how about the bomb in the toilet sorry what about all the shredded paper in the kitchen well that i shredded paper burns really fast can confirm okay um we got another drive for you one terabyte is only enough to hold like a handful of modern games and i don't want you to have to think about like oh i'll delete that one and then reinstall that one because i don't know if your internet's super fast or anything it is not so we picked you up out an additional uh 2000 megabytes here i'm testing to see if she actually knows or she just read it off the other one it's 2 000 gigabytes oh no i had no idea yeah i was just reading it off the last that's good so we're going to install this bad boy back here okay all right i've got another question for you though okay oh okay is it a good one i never really thought of this one because i didn't really consider your opinion at the time rude but what did you think when linus decided to make a full-time gig making youtube videos oh so proud of you i always tell everyone i know you're the hardest worker i've ever met you gonna cry oh thank you you are you are no i'm not ivan looks harder didn't take a vacation sleepless nights long hours it was pretty rough but you had a dream it's very inspiring oh thank you when you want to do something you should even if it's hard you have to stick with it yeah did you think that at the time yeah oh hell yeah that you're thought you're crazy oh but like there it is but like you know i knew you'd do it i had no doubt that you'd succeed this is a 30 60 ti six months ago this would have been worth like twelve hundred dollars now it's worth less than half of that don't worry about it there's been a big gpu market crash from like you know like cryptocurrency right yes yeah so cryptocurrency has invested crypto oh really how'd that go i don't know i don't listen or pay attention to it it's sort of a set it and forget it mentality with investing okay yeah dang afraid not bad not bad for a first try so we're asking her what kind of keyboard do you want it's like a chest set do you want 10 keyless do you want the full sized and like obviously this guy is trying to sell her on like the more deluxe the most deluxe keyboards and brandon's like ploof's probably going to try and solo like a 300 keyboard i'm like no this guy's moved on from 300 keyboards this from wuche studio is a 600 keyboard are you ready i'm just going to hold it you unwrap it whoa it's really heavy it's probably like what like 10 pounds what's it made out of uh aluminum whoa was this a real diamond no it's moist tonight all right you're gonna press the power button where is it up here oh you'll find it okay that's a good sign oh yeah cool right really quiet nice airflow we have a small problem oh great you know what i realized i never actually checked that you plugged everything in right okay do we have video drivers at least i did install nvidia drivers i didn't do windows update because it was a different motherboard but we have steam cache now minus so it's fast so it should be fast if there's anything else you want to download if we've already downloaded it i have steam cash because i returned my last games i couldn't play it i'm glad you're rolling on that that's really not what that means it's cash c-a-c-h-e oh like about like a like a memory like a cash [laughter] masterfully done not bad it's beautiful i'm liking it wow okay this is it made in voyage oh we don't have audio it's okay i know how it sounds in my head i've heard so many times oh my god i hear the music sweet music in my head new cheeky items available yes don't make fun of me it's really fun i love all my digital content it seems like cool thanks oh my god okay four pop-ups later so go into options okay okay game options okay uh all right it's already set to ultra perfect ultra okay here we go this one okay so how long would that normally take like a minute oh really what really yeah like on your machine yeah oh so this is faster then much faster okay what is he doing over there he's knocked over the garbage can why did he do that why is he putting garbage all over the yard because he hates her he's angry it tells you why he's angry because he had to socialize and he's a loner oh she's mad too she should stomp on the garbage is this so silly i love it you know what the worst part is is that it's really not that unrealistic can i just point out how how smoothly it runs when you pen the camera oh heck yeah oh yeah it's like a tamagotchi kind of more complicated but not actually that complicated at all okay so does it run well enough for you runs it very well she's gonna try to calm him down let's see if that works why don't we try something a little more intense okay okay she runs kind of funny she really she's feeling injured whoa oh my gosh it's chasing me into danger not awake okay go uphill into the woods yeah i think it's bear rules oh god what does that mean over and downhill i'm just making things up at this point anyway how does it look looks really good running smooth enough for you yeah i love it it's really cool and are there any other questions
