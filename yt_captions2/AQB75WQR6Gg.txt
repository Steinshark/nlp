ladies and gentlemen recently i traveled to london i did a bunch of fan events to celebrate the launch of my new book and one of the things that i did was break into the google london offices to challenge 100 google employees it was incredible i didn't actually break in i completely had access i asked permission i had an id and everything but this is what i did at google london i played a three versus one simultaneous exhibition with over 100 spectators talking about the games analyzing the games it was a lot of fun and then i guessed the elo of every single one of the people that i played now one thing that might not be obvious from that image is this the fact that there was a lot of distance between every single board so basically what i had to do when i was playing these googlers is i had 15 minutes on the clock and i had to run from board to board to board as i was playing three onone with a 100 spectators talking about the board talking about the moves and and talking to each other and i played three-on-one with 15 minutes on the clock while running around the room it was incredible stuff and in this video i'm going to take you through each of these games i wish i had like live footage but we didn't have a cameraman because you know fourth quarter budget at google we barely even managed to get that room it was though in all honesty an amazing visit so thank you to google for hosting me and um this is basically three versus one guest the elo with 100 people watching and giving their suggestions and opinions uh the last game was against the final boss but i will take you through all of them it was almost like a pokemon battle it was like again all i knew is that i have 15 minutes my time is ticking and i have to run from board to board that's all i knew so it it was it really was a lot of fun and uh also if you're watching this video november 26th and 27th in 2023 it's black friday all my courses 40% off i repeat all my courses are 40% off but only for the next 24 hours and if you're watching this in the future sure you missed the sale bozo that's what you get for coming to the channel late anyway here we go google engineer number one by the way i have no idea if this is actually a software engineer or not but i just assume that everybody that works at google is a software engineer and is probably smarter than me so d4 d5 and i played bishop to f4 this person's rating is 9,997 the next person is 9,998 the next person is 99,999 uh in reality i had no idea what their elos were so all i knew was that i got to play solidly but i got to i got keep a time edge i got to move fast i got to not over complicate the position when you play three onone in chess that is the golden rule you play three onone you start spending too much time on each clock knight to f6 and i went knight c3 i was like okay again i have to assume somebody's like 1,200 maybe 1400 and you know my opponent played e6 so by the way while this is happening i'm running to every other board but for the sake of keeping this kind of more or less a normal video and not jumping around i will finish one game at a time so i play knight to b5 this opening is known as the london i had to do it i was in london how can you go to london but not play a london system so i played knight c3 the joob baba london which is trying to poke at black's queens side white surrender a traditional advantage in this opening to play for various attacking possibilities and so i played knight b5 and now one of the ways to defend this is with this awkward knight positioning on the edge of the board or to give up the dark squared bishop but have a very solid center that that is what my opponent did there's other ways like black could maybe bring the bishop that way my opponent did this now the reason i was happy to see this is that now i'm going to be able to clarify the position very early so i'm going to play knight takes because more often than not it's good to trade a knight for a bishop bishops are long range pieces plus when your opponent so early in the game gives away the dark squ bishop you know you're going to have ideas like this for the rest of the game so the second that this pawn structure gets clarified right away i'm thinking one thing in my head all right and chess is all about thinking what your opponents want to do with their their pieces and with their pawns with their pieces and with their pawns so of course i'm looking at things like queen here but i'm also looking at knight c6 and the only reasonable expansion in the position for my opponent which would simultaneously play for more central space which is important in chess but also open up the light squ bishop which is pawn to e5 so i played e3 while running around and and moving my opponent castled i developed and again it's not a time to go on an attack just yet i got to finish up my development and i can't underestimate my opponents i already learned that lesson in a recent video when i went to florida and lost to somebody who i thought was a beginner knight c6 my opponent is still not ready to play e5 but knowing that e5 is coming makes me hesitant to put my bishop on d3 because if my opponent does succeed with playing e5 not right now but that's going to be a problem right so what i did instead is i developed my light squared bishop to the e2 square i'm just sliding the bishop out one square i don't know what i want just yet i do know though that my opponent is probably going to play rook e8 and try to play for e5 and then that is exactly what my opponent did now one thing i need to also just add here if you haven't clicked away if your attention span is longer than you know whatever 3 minutes or however long we are into this video um one thing that it is worth mentioning is that i had to memorize all of these games after i left google we did not play these games on digital chess boards so just you'll see what i mean later castles e5 now big moment in the game if i take and open up the center for my opponent my opponent und doubles their d pawns gets two very powerful center pawns and frankly just isn't worse at all black will play bishop f5 and bring the queen and connect the rooks exactly what you're supposed to do in chess and then and then i have no advantage because this center is just so strong i'm going to have to fire pawns at the center to try to get it traded and black might even try to walk into my territory and deal some serious unpleasantries to my position um which is why here i did something instead called keeping the tension i just kept the tension i said you know what i want you to come forward or i want you to take me because if you come forward now your pawns can't advance and in chess keeping the tension is a very very high level and sophisticated methodology because you don't want to trade too quickly a set of pawns and now you gave up your center and you helped your opponent's structure you also don't want to push too quickly because then you lock your pawns and then your opponent starts creating pawn breaks and breaking apart your center so for black the best thing to do is also to keep the tension so my opponent also keeps the tension which is how i knew i was playing a strong intermediate like this is not a this is not a bad player at all this person plays e5 and doesn't overextend i also play a waiting move i just bolster my center a little bit you know maybe i'm going to play h3 maybe i'm going to play queen b3 my opponent also makes a waiting move so clearly at this point i'm like okay i think i'm playing a strong guy let me kick out his bishop let me defend my bishop with my rook while also running to you know board to board to make moves i'm like it you know it's better for me if my opponent thinks my opponent plays rook c8 and then i'm like wait a minute i think i've spotted something so i stop i stop at this board and i'm like wait this is deceptively protected what do i what does that mean well when my knight goes there our bishops actually see each other so i paused here despite having a time running on every board and i went when my knight takes if he takes me i'm going to take his bishop defended by my queen and if he takes my bishop attacking my queen i take this is a very very very common calculation sequence i take on e5 and by the way you can start calculating like this if you get the tactics master class of course it's not just on openings tactics end games middle games you go take take knight takes e5 opening up the bishops to each other if knight knight takes e5 then bishop takes h5 knight takes h5 queen takes h5 this knight can't go anywhere for black but if takes takes knight takes e5 and instead of knight takes e5 he sneaks in attacking my queen i can't just do anything i want because if i take back the bishop i lose the knight here but i throw in knight takes c6 zichun zuk he attacks my queen and i attack his queen take take knight e5 and this is under attack but there's also rook e5 but after rook e5 there's bishop e5 bishop e2 bishop f6 this is the way you calculate in chess if you had taken this bishop at some point you would have gotten a position where it's two knights for a rook which is losing like that's better for black and i spotted that despite it being a 15minute one versus three and i was like take take take bishop takes knight takes and if he takes my queen i take his queen and then we both get our pieces out he could also take my knight i take his bishop after takes takes takes takes i im merged a pawn up in an end game and this is relatively straightforward after getting the tactics master class for 40% off for black friday you can get the end gamees master class how do you win an end game like this well you are a pawn up with white you are very happy to make that trade as long as it damages the structure you plant your rook in the center you put more pressure on that pawn and you use a pawn break also in the game what i did is i did exactly that then i played f3 controlling my opponent's movement and i brought my king up enabling the movement of this rook and now e4 is next bishop here is next uh but actually the game ended very quickly because my opponent went takes takes and sensing that my b2 pawn was feeling a little bit delicate opponent played rook to b8 and unfortunately uh blundered his rook in one move now he was a good sport he played on but i don't remember the game the game proceeded rook b4 uh rook b6 rather rook b4 i defended both my bishop and my pawn and then we shuffled a lot and i went on to win the game because i was upper rook and i can win a game uper a barook now i anticipated that this person um was like i think i said about uh 14500 is is what i said he was 1700 so he was 1700 he he he played quite well uh i uh i i don't know why i thought he was 14500 i think i mostly got it from the sense of like he blundered a rook in one move and i just assumed like 1700 might you know not but again we were playing like little faster chess ner and everything and he just forgot i had a bishop on the other side of the board he played very well but i didn't have a huge amount of information to work with other than the fact that you know i got him with this with a really nice tactic by the way to not to toot my own horn here but absolutely to toot my own horn um and so that was game one but there was two other games going on right so like i'm running i'm running i'm running this was the first game to finish this game was really trippy so this game against google engineer number two he played a scandinavian defense i decided to to go for e4 to mix it up a little bit takes t knight f3 and his next move confused me his next move made me think he doesn't actually know openings which um again like he played bishop f5 which which is not a mistake it's not a mistake but more people here play knight f6 and bishop g4 and even knight c6 like voluntarily putting the bishop there as opposed to on the g4 square i thought to me gave me some info like okay is probably the weakest of the three he actually was not um and that's not that's not an insult like at all he it's just like i i put way too much value on the opening knowledge right because i i didn't play knight here um and i played knight f3 and you know he played bishop f5 and i right away i was like oh okay like you know this guy's probably like uh 13400 right like just just from the openings but let's see what's going to happen i went here he played the typical scandinavian move i took the center he played e6 i developed my light square bishop this game i remember uh the least accurately but i will still get you to the correct position and um and then here he just started developing normally so i was like oh so maybe bishop f5 was just a fluke like maybe you know maybe he he didn't pin my knight cu he plays bishop f5 and i saw okay so i was like okay maybe 1,600 right let's just say 16,700 right like every move that that black is playing here is very solid i mean he he hasn't made a single mistake he obviously knows that the idea is to go knight bd7 bishop b7 and castles i was also getting very frustrated because you know at this point like around move 9 i'm in i'm in move n in this game the game that i just showed you i'm around here i have no advantage whatsoever right like literally none uh in the other game that i'm going to show you i also have no advantage so i'm thinking like am i just playing a murderer row of some google engineers like what kind of a trap have i walked into right so what i started doing here is i started playing waiting moves i like slid my bishop back and the reason that i did this instead of playing aggressively and playing the best move maybe which is to make progress is i needed to get to a point i can make a lot of moves quickly without changing the texture of the position the same thing that i did here actually if you notice i'm a very aggressive player like i'm always looking to create an attack but what i did in this game for a long time is i just kept the tension i just waited i played very easy moves rookie one because i need my opponents to do the the bulk of the thinking in the early stage of the game if i'm already complicating things i can't run around the boards as fast so i'm running there i'm running here i'm running to that board and i'm just being as solid as possible right so so here my opponent develops and now i'm like okay the way to make progress here is probably to put my knight in the center right just making an advancement into my opponent's territory that opens up my queen that also enables my bishop to go there which would put pressure on the queen behind the knight so i thought okay knight e5 queen f3 bishop f4 that looks like a nice plan and you know i'm the higher rated player i'm the one playing the siml i should be the one attacking right so i played knight to e5 in any chess position in any sport you have to overtake the opponent at some point right so knight bd7 that move is is decent putting pressure of course i i don't have to move i should probably play bishop f4 in this position but i just decide okay i'm going to play queen f3 and then i'm going to play rook d1 if my opponent takes on e5 then i will go here strong post in the center and then i'm going to play like queen here bishop f4 bishop f4 bring my rook and let's just you know let's let's push him backwards right of course i don't have much advantage but he castled and that allowed me to put my bishop on f4 so so now i am threatening a few things right i mean the position is balanced see it's it's equal which is really annoying cu i'm you know i'm trying to like beat these guys as fast as possible but my time is ticking and i'm playing three onone i'm running there and back there's people talking like you know people are are are talking to me asking me questions distracting me it was it was a lot of fun really i have to tell you it was really a great time um but i'm you know i'm creating threats anywhere i move my night now was a discovered attack so the best move here for white is of course uh i was going to say knight g6 but the computer even likes knight takes f7 which attacks the queen and opens up the king here uh traditionally i would have thought knight g6 right and then just grab the rook i mean you might as well right grab the rook have a long-term advantage but my opponent went bishop d6 and so now i was like well this is really annoying um i got to keep the tension again you know i want to i want to bring my rook but then i was worried about something like this in the future so i thought all right bishop d6 again let me keep the tension i'm sliding my bishop back a square so that he's defended right so now i can move my knight at any point if c5 trying to trade that severely weakens the b5 square so i immediately get in on b5 and i thought you know i'm going to let my opponents try to instigate with me and pay the price that was sort of my game plan because we've traded nothing i have a very powerful knight in the center i don't have any threads just yet but i'm just going to you know i'm just going to improve my position what should he do the exact same thing so like rook d1 you know he he might not want to play rook e8 because there's tactics knight f7 and and something like this uh but uh point stands like he should also bring some more pieces and then i came back to the board and he he fell for my bait a little bit you know i made a lot of moves it seemed like there was a very tense moment building up but i still don't have any threads but just a little bit too much respect and my opponent played knight d5 and that's the thing in sometimes you try to make something happen right what my opponent had calculated here was that if i take with a knight he takes with a c pawn that's what he had calculated and he opens up his queen but what you always want to do when you play a move is look at the nonstandard capture as well you you you almost you you never think that white is going to play bishop takes d5 here but bishop takes d5 not only is the best move it's also not only is the is the move that he missed it's like a winning move because now black has two choices lose the bishop completely right completely lose the bishop for free terrible or allow this fork which is also really really bad because after that it's a direct assault directly on that and i immediately play knight g6 i win the rook he goes here and i play like queen c i don't know something like that right i play queen c3 defend all my pawns and and i'm just much better so he completely missed bishop takes d5 now in chess frequently it's not the first mistake that kills you it's the second right and so here realizing he had made a mistake what what he should have done by the way to prepare that let's just say maybe a6 rook d1 and actually then knight d5 is not totally bad there's still a tactical problem take take so maybe instead of doing that like you move the bishop to h7 which is also pretty reasonable and it just has scope and it's out of the way of my queen unfortunately after i took like this he decided to play bishop e5 and what my opponent had calculated is he takes my knight and whatever i take back with he's going to take my bishop so for example if bishop takes knight takes rook takes c takes then if knight takes there's even something like queen c2 maybe right but the idea of course is that the bishop is hanging so he played bishop takes e5 and unfortunately it was not the first mistake that he missed i just took his knight he just took a knight but he missed my next move i am now going to be able to get out of with this bishop how that bishop is hanging how am i going to do that whatever i take with here is going to get either taken or he's going to do it i'm famous for one thing right rook takes e5 critical idea which my opponent had overlooked a very non-standard capture right bishop takes non-standard and then taking first with the rook is crazy but the idea is that it's a discovered attack brewing on the queen so if this i sneak away with a bishop i sneak away with a bishop and if you take this i hit your queen and now you can't take this right you can't take this so you slide out of the way and i emerge with a knight and a bishop for a rook and again it was a nice little tactical sequence i was lucky that my opponent tried to like fight with me and now actually i converted this quite nicely i was quite happy you know you got to use your material advantage you either send this to an end game you trade the queens you trade the rooks you keep your center together you you disallow the opponent from getting a rook in here and two pieces beat a rook i mean they they just do um as long as the pawn count is about the same my opponent played a5 i restricted the queen side advancement with a4 i brought my rook to the center and then right around here i realized okay i think i can just start going for it you know because he's going to start playing c5 and things like this uh so i played queen g3 threatening checkmate i think i misremember ing the move order very very slightly uh but i believe it was something like h3 here to make sure i don't get back rank mated and my opponent played c5 takes and he should have taken with the rook he took with the queen and now with eyeballs here i realize this bishop is not really well protected because i have this and that move is tough because now if the pawn takes i get this that's mate that's hanging and i remember very very vaguely i landed a tactic in the game which was not even this and this it was like essentially this like i said i didn't remember the exact game but i do remember my opponent couldn't take my queen because of this and couldn't take my bishop because of mate so he ended up down a lot of material he ended up down uh might have been two or three pieces for the rook and i went on to win i simplified this down and i went on to win uh and really this was all because you know of a two move of a little two two-piece in the middle game it was it was actually equal but you know my opponent just unorthodox capture you know something like a tactical sequence that you learn as you get better rook e five is a is a tough move to see from from a distance because you really only calculate d takes and bishop takes and uh this person i i estimated at around 14500 he was 1,900 and i felt really bad about that um but i i i i put way too much emphasis on the opening like i probably should have and i just thought i got a really comfortable position right i just thought i played very comfortably and then right out of the opening he made a mistake and so i was like you know 14,500 maybe but it was the you know it was like the first moment to breathe and immediately you make a small mistake and then the game is over so i did my best i wasn't trying to insult anybody uh the last game though this was this was the final boss this was the google london office champ uh this was uh this was fun i had no clue how good this guy was but i heard rumors that he was the best i didn't know how good anybody was but i knew he was the best so he played d4 i think i should have some photos of me uh with him but uh yeah so he played d4 and uh i played d5 he played queen's gambit and then so what i decided here is i this is actually this was not supposed to you know promote my course at all but now that i'm here i played a6 this is my queen gambit decline course and the idea of queen's gambit declined with a6 is you decline taking until you are ready to take and defend your pawn like this so if white doesn't take you if white plays something like this you grab the pawn but now it's actually a lot harder for white to win it back because you're going to get the b pawn involved now my opponent who was obviously quite strong played a4 which is a very natural move a lot of people here paused and go wait a minute there's no b5 now actually this is available for free 100% free so i know i promote stuff and you don't want to spend money and that's completely fine this is free if you go to my coures website link is in the description chesley and you look up queen's gamb declined this whole free sample is there and the idea against a4 is to play knight c6 and knight a5 and what you do is you don't give the pawn back you say no you can't have the pawn now white needs to bend over backwards to get the pawn back white needs to play knight e5 and and really really commit to getting this pawn back going wait a minute wait my my my bad i messed up listen you know because if white doesn't if white just plays like bishop e2 uh you'll play like knight f6 castle oh well that would be nice uh castles then you'll play like c5 and and and by the time white decides to get the pawn back you have a very very comfortable position so i played bishop b4 he took and i played c5 and so i was ready to bring my queen put pressure castle and and all this good stuff and then he surprised me so i was far away like i told you you know dur during during this okay this microphone is is very moody i apologize i was trying to slide away and talk but uh it can it it can be very s sensitive anyway uh i was far away from the board right and i um and i saw he moved his queen so i was like what a queen move in this position i don't remember that from my course and lo and behold he played queen g4 so this is actually very smart if you're trying to play a siml right if you're trying to play so he knows i have to run board to board so he creates a tactical situation he creates an aggressive situation where i have to spend time at his board or risk losing so of course the easy move here is a just go here but that's not a good move because then i create a lot of weaknesses you know you really don't want to commit your pawns like this but i realized i had a really nice solution here so you does the mouse want the cheese right mouse wants the cheese well come get the cheese knight f6 and i realize that now white is engrav d so there there is a reason like sometimes you know you play your openings many of you have this you have opening courses or you know certain openings you play a certain opening something happens that you weren't expecting and you completely don't react the right way like it's not a move that's covered in the course then you look with stockfish and you know the evaluation is dropping but you can't couldn't punish it well i realized this move despite costing me a pawn gets me a lot of development and not just development the queen no longer guards this pawn you've got to remember what all your pieces are doing right your pieces are staring at certain things right right so after knight f6 and rook g8 i win two very important moves against this queen and now i take this queen is out here my rook has a bullseye a target on g2 my queen is going to defend the knight and create problems and attack things and the knight's going to jump in right and all of this so take queen takes d4 which was not the best move probably i think i should have probably taken and gone here but you know i did this and um i have pressure i'm threatening this i'm threatening knight b3 this is still defended and then at this point i'm like okay well i know i'm much better i don't know if i'm winning just yet he played knight d2 the idea of knight d2 was just to give me this pawn but in giving me this pawn he gets out of danger it's actually very hard for me to win here like if i try to just take his head off queen h7 and i might even lose so i got to be i got to be a little bit careful right so i'm thinking okay this guy's at least 2,000 defense ive skills at least 2,000 right so here i completely changed my approach to this game i thought this was very clever of me because again i have to i need to win all three games and my time is ticking right i got like nine minutes on each board and i'm running so i'm like okay i want to make sure he can't have an easy game white is giving me knight d oh computer's giving me knight d5 knight g4 of course i saw knight g4 i even saw this cool tactic queen takes f2 and then knight g4 sack my queen get it back but i was like now you know what bishop d7 let me just bring pieces to the game i don't have to do anything i'm just going to play bishop d7 what is he going to do i'm going to play bishop c6 and take the diagonal i'm going to play rook c8 and attack this what's he going to do he brought his queen back to trade and i was like you know what you know what normally the attacking side does not want to trade queens the attacking side wants to get out not trade queens use the opponent's queen as a target but i realize something i can trade i am up zero points of material after all that zero but white had to tie his shoes together to play defense and now look at the amount of pressure look at the level of activity look at my pieces every single one of them has a purpose every single one of them has a target i have no weaknesses literally nothing in my position like nothing back here i mean you could say these things are unprotected but he can't attack them and i was like wait a minute this is just easy now so he played g3 played g3 to enable moving the bishop there but i immediately grabbed the diagonal now his rook moves now he can't castle now here comes knight g4 who is going to protect this look at all my pieces swarming i was very happy with this performance and under this pressure he blunders he went for a trade uh but he walked into a fork of a piece and the square which would lead to another fork so a really brutal fork and right here i was like nice we're gonna beat this guy and i knew this was the final boss and i and i needed to apply a lot of serious positional pressure in this game he left that rug there uh because this way he wins my knight and now i just knew okay i have to convert so now i took finally because we're in an end game so i'm i'm i'm okay opening up the position because every pawn matters and the way i'm going to win this the mo the easiest way i got to get the rooks off with no rooks he has nothing nothing and the only thing you need to be careful about is hanging a fork this looks like a fork but i have check which is very important okay so for example if uh this is the position and here i play b6 all of a sudden i'm getting forked so i have to be careful right so i played he played rook b1 i pinned him he ran his king and i covered knight knight f6 in the future also trying to set up a checkmate net trying to set up a checkmate net he went here i invited invited him in because he cannot take on b7 see he calculated knight b7 take and then after this there is rook back to b1 but i flip the move order the knight is defended by the rook which is also defending the bishop rook takes c1 another rook sacrifice removing the defender and now i'm just up a knight in a rook end game and i won this game by bringing up my knight and advancing like this and here i do not remember but basically he brought his king i brought my king and uh we traded down and i mean the the rest of the game is relatively straightforward just don't blunder anything and do something like this f4 promote the pawn and what ended up happening essentially is uh let's just very hypothetically say something like this i pushed the king to the back rank i brought in mine and ultimately uh it was a uh it was a checkmate like i pinned his king on the back rank brought my knight brought my rook and he resigned i estimated this guy at being around 2100 like tw high 2, 2100 who just tried to play a little too aggressively in the opening and it backfired he was 2250 so he was even stronger than my estimate um but because he tried to play to the simo like he probably would not have played queen g4 in a long game but because we were playing rapid and he tried to uh try to be aggressive and confuse me a little bit it backfired a bit because i actually i played quite sharp and i was on my game so um that's how i beat 100 googlers um three volunteer to play me that's all the time that we had but everybody was chatting and enjoying themselves and and and talking and everything and what a spectacle i really had a great time uh over at google london uh it it was a lot of fun little q&a we did as well and um if you're watching this video and you made it this far or you know somebody who i'm about to give this pitch to if you work at a tech company like meta or in amazon or whatever like let's do chess at your company or if you work at any company you could work at a boutique investment firm a hedge fund that i do i like to do this stuff i'll visit we'll talk about chess i could do guest the elo live i could do a simultaneous against three people five people 10 people holler at your boy i'm available uh shout out to google for hosting me once again lot of fun if you made it this far friendly reminder about black friday again that's all goodbye get out of here
