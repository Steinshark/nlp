ladies and gentlemen i run a chess channel and to that end i apologize if you for some reason clicked on this and expected computer science cooking minecraft brain rot of some sort i don't know but this is a chess channel and on this channel i cover everything i cover drama i cover major stories i cover low elo chess high elo chess uh ai chess whatever in this video i'm covering some sort of hioz as well in particular uh played by alexander botes you may know her as the older sister of the botes duo her younger sister being andrea botes semi-professional boxer and dj at this point and alexandra recently played in a chess tournament had a performance rating 400 plus points above her own and won the tournament by one and a half points ahead of the entire field it was the best tournament performance of her life was so good i couldn't even say the word performance and i'm going to show you some of these games they're very instructive your goal is to learn three things in this video if you don't you're a bozo on that note here we go so the sisters travel to uh italy nice place to go to play some chess also just like nice place to go i was there obviously italy is quite big uh i'm going to take you through some of these games in one of these games she beat her own sister physically and also on the chessboard i covered that game already i'm not going to cover it again it's in the video bz versus bas which you can watch after this um here we go her first round game malfunctioned she won that game uh against the italian and in the second round she sits down and she plays ricardo dii italians have some of the best names period another italian uh lo and behold she's in italy and um her opponent plays a banko gambit she's a d4 c4 player she doesn't play the london like you know her goblin of a younger sister that is actually her nickname by the way i think they call her l goblina or something i i hope that means goblin uh and she's a mainline player and her opponent plays the bango gambit now white can take on b5 uh and then take on a6 and um that's what she does she takes both pawns this is the beno gambit accepted and basically white is like i'm up a pawn and uh i'm going to just consolidate i'm going to be up a pawn for the rest of the game and black is like well i'm going to you know ruin your right to castle and that i'm also going to use the a& b files beno gambit is one of the most potent openings that exists and uh you know in fact i would go as far as to say a lot of people try to avoid it uh but her opponent plays right into it she plays right into it she plays g3 she plays king g2 this might look a little bit brain dead to some of you watching but it's completely feasible the point is you need to get your king out of the center so you put the king on g2 you fen ketto your king and now you're going to develop your pieces both players are still within than their theory a4 and basically you're just like i'm going to push my pawn and i'm i'm up a pawn now black plays knight g4 he spends 4 minutes i think he's out of his prep um technically i think knight g4 is not the most accurate move i think black has to play faster on the queen side but it's very tough to tell the difference like if you don't know that you know she plays queen c2 so she spends a little bit of time and in general white's idea is to basically meet this advance with like various forms of defense and then consolidate and then you know black plays knight e5 she takes he takes and now she plays f4 which is a very aggressive move um and she played that very quickly so f4 probably she thought the knight was going to go somewhere and it was probably better for him to be more active but he goes back b3 queen b6 like neither player thinking too much finally rook to b1 and what's funny is that um rook a3 would have defended the pawn but rook b1 doesn't defend the pawn at all because of bishop c3 normally you don't want to lose the rook that's your bishop that's protecting your king but there's just rook takes a4 which is kind of wild and it looks like here you're going to get checkmated but you're not black can play rook d4 which is kind of a tough move to spot from a distance uh and then it looks like the rook is going to get trapped but it's not and then when you try to deliver mate then i'll block with the knight because my rook is no longer hanging so black had to play bishop c3 slightly counterintuitive move he doesn't and now she's just able to completely blockade the queen side and this is a worst nightmare for a bango player and this is why if you're going to play a gambit you better be sure you are ready to win your material back because now he begins maneuvering he puts the knight there but in the bko if white is able to create this light squared blockade white is simply going to win the game because you can attack on the king side you can also play e5 and alexandra consolidates her queen side waits for her moment and there it is she brings all the pieces and black gets absolutely nowhere you see white just has complete stability this is a worst nightmare and now this bishop is completely locked out of the game alexander doesn't look back knight to a5 is actually a crazy blunder by the way because there is queen takes d5 and uh maybe she thought this was still winning maybe she thought like she goes knight c6 and the pawn just goes but uh there was no need to allow queen d5 but her opponent missed it knight c6 and now it's knight e7 he resigned because king f7 queen e6 and knight c6 is checkmate and that is how you beat the banko gambit at the 2,000 level you accept it you put your king on g2 you vibe you just vibe um you do need to be a little bit careful how you do this i would not overextend with f4 i would play very quickly knight b5 rook up and b3 so for example queen b6 rook a3 b3 this is like the optimal defensive setup and then if black uh spends a little bit more time you play like bishop a3 rook b1 and i mean you will just never lose your bs and the b's tough it's a very tough opening to play in the next round she played mateo nardoni i mean i love these names i i i love them i i i don't i mean like i'm kind of stereotyping the accent but like dude italians are awesome like they are they got good food they got you know rich history all parts of the country uh like i i went to italy last year and i was told every part cuz italy became a country in the 19th century like there was no such thing as a country you know so it's different groups of people different dialects i learned that people within italy can't even understand each other did you know that you're going to pretend that you did cuz you're going to pretend you're like knowledgeable about stuff i didn't know that so i was like that's really cool you know it's the same way southerners and northerners in america can't understand each other and it's not just an accent thing d4 knight f6 i told you alexandra enjoys her main lines and she plays the sameish f3 is a very sneaky move order the idea of f3 is you secure a king's indian defense and you don't allow the grunfeld so she's going to put her knight on c3 but she's kind of going to she's kind of going to force d6 and what i mean by that is normally you play knight c3 d5 take take and the knight trades but if your opponent plays the gron field there is no knight to trade so you're going to get a nice position now i don't think black really cared about that i think black just wanted to play a kings indian c5 and this one gets really aggro alexandra castle queens side and um black now does something interesting so the computer here gives b5 is very strong for black and it's kind of being played in the bko style but here's the difference compare the two b takes a6 b takes a6 right white is castling into the avalanche you're buying a home when i tell you that within 6 months something might collapse off the mountain right so um yeah i maybe not but black plays a6 which makes sense to me alexandra takes right and now black is going for b5 she plays knight d4 if i'm playing black here i'm just going b5 i don't even care i i don't care literally physically metaphorically spiritually like i would like to trade because i know that even if you win this pawn from me i'm going here and this is a giga banko gambit this is a bko gambit where white bought that house at with the avalanche coming now black prepares it and now is the last moment you got to go b5 here bro prepares it again all right mato is like the most indecisive dude he mato you got to go b5 knight c2 the final moment buto goes back and alexandra is like you know what i'm not going to risk that again g4 and guess what the best move is still to play b matteo did everything to play the move b5 and then he started fighting back on the king side and she finds a beautiful combo here very nice combination the most principled way to deal with flank play is to strike straight down the center and black's position is an illusion of of like stability e5 shreds open everything e5 attacks the knight if the knight moves you're going to take you're going to put your knight on d5 you're going to take on h5 you're going to play rook g1 game over uh if takes the knight loses a defender excuse me the knight loses a defender first now the bishop loses a defender what a combo what a combo she picks up a bishop and uh she trades now black is just here black could consider playing rook d8 uh she would just actually take and have to win this end game two rooks and the knight i mean you can't really use the knight yet you got to go slowly but black doesn't even do that he plays e6 and right away she just defends and uh yeah here mato needed to just you know buckle in for the long haul but he tries to create counterplay and that weakens the king way too much and alexandra absolutely brutalizes the position takes on h5 rook d1 and uh yeah when the evaluation is a bmw type it's time to go home that is when it's time to go home or from matteo it's time to stay home cuz they're in italy yeah very convincing game and and a game where you know black did not play the the major idea of the opening he did not you know he didn't create this play and she just punished him for it i mean she just traded very nicely b5 was there but he didn't do it and she launched an attack which is exactly what you're supposed to do very nice idea chopped it all down and another big win for her now she didn't play every game with white uh because then you know that would have been that they rigged the tournament she played alexander becker all these people are around her strength i mean her strength is 1970 fet a and all these people are 1900 she plays knight f6 she's a king's indian player but her opponent you know played some uga system so she's got to you know figure out what to do here right she plays knight e4 the idea is to play c5 her opponent plays knight e5 which is a move i cannot explain uh knight e5 is some sort of witchcraft i i don't know why mr becker did not just castle his king or play knight d2 or c4 he was worried about something and now she plays f6 which i don't love this move but i mean i she's going to try to play e5 like she's going to you know now what you should do here probably is continue with this plan but she goes here then i moves and now she plays a5 very imbalanced game but this transformation really only benefits white because the bishop is a bit passive and so mr alexander just plays very normally actually i should say mr becker and here if white transitions the game properly he will get a big advantage by taking on e4 and whatever takes back the knight goes to c5 and the the point is it's not about this it's about this so black will play queen c8 and now this move g4 traps the bishop in the center of the board the only way to deal with this for black is to play something like g5 at which point we trade your bishop is very passive and it's very difficult for you to defend your pawns but some people don't really enter forcing variations unless they see a you know material advantage and he blocks the position which is not bad but he gets something a little bit better and in the game i mean alexandra is just clearly worse but here she finds a very nice idea this is this is actually very very smart um if she waits white is going to steamroll her so she trades knights she trades the bishop and she replaces all her pawns on light squares she spent a lot of time here this is the top engine line trade play f5 because sometimes in chess you got to shut up actually some of you could benefit from that advice generally you got to shut up and you just got to play the best moves based on the position it's ugly i mean i got to tell you closing the position like this it's ugly but it's the best because otherwise white was going to overwhelm you and win so rook c1 e6 everything is solid rook c2 very nice play by white trying to put pressure on the queen side bishop f8 trading the bishop i mean what are you going to do that bishop sucks so bishop back to b2 bishop to b4 okay takes takes and now b6 which was a mistake it was better for alexander to keep the structure like this why because anytime white takes you take with the e pawn and you do this so you wait you just wait play knight d7 you can't get much but you got to wait and now in a in a perfect world what'll happen is you'll go queen b4 and this trade is very nice for black with pressure but b6 now means you can't defend this pawn so easily and alexandra i get it i get what she was trying to do but she gave white all the play and what he has to do he's got to take this pawn and that's kind of counterintuitive considering i just said you don't want to do that but the advantage is that after cded this is not weak and this is super weak we need seven so there's this moment they're shuffling they're shuffling and now the position explodes and suddenly alexander's better alexander did not play the right way against alexandra and she goes to an end game with some play her king is a little bit weak but she's defending it's a very complicated game and suddenly she's winning she had a bad position for like 33 moves and a winning one for one move queen e3 queen e1 queen c3 rook a1 and rook a2 are all winning rook a2 threatens mate and there's you know you just hide your king on h6 bishop f1 and now black wins by playing knight c5 disconnecting these two and the rook is trapped rook c5 queen e3 take you win alexandra misses it hides her king first and now it's game on now it's game on and now mr becker tries to trade the pieces alexandra is winning by getting her rook into the game she plays rook a she plays here it's now back a complicated but here it's just time trouble king g7 and white has been reduced to passivity and it's just a matter of time and yeah alexander had to play g4 but instead he plays e4 which is just kind of a desperation move and i don't really know what the big idea was because now unfortunately the pawns in front of his king will fall and alexandra cleans up and ends the game of three pawns a complicated fight she's just going to convert it and uh she's going to move on to another perfect score she had a perfect score in this event for a very long time at some point she also beat her sister she traded king f2 and here white resigned because of all of this so complicated battle back and forth all right she had another game with black playing her french the patented french defense all her openings were tested d4 d5 e5 c5 she played bishop to d7 which is one of the systems and the idea is rook c8 and to trade and here her opponent played h4 which i don't even i don't i can't i don't i i i don't know while she was traveling europe italy germany france i i don't know what mr uh hugh benoa was uh like drinking before this game but it was potent now she played f6 which is a very principled move and she got this trade and played queen c7 and this is basically what you do in the french your king is a bit open but there's nothing there white plays bishop f4 and h5 and and now actually it's very justified this move uh and alexandra plays long castles but now white gets knight g5 so actually mr hughes looks like a genius rook g8 and now knight look at this oh my alexander just losing it's crazy just straight up losing this game which he doesn't she doesn't give up she plays g5 which is the best move she's ready to give up this rook and she's ready to create counterplay by taking on e5 look at that bishop h2 now knight f5 okay we activating some pieces knight d8 king d8 knight d2 she takes in the center so she's down a rook for a knight and a pawn i mean it's complicated white is better but it's complicated queen c2 g4 nice move covering the f3 square now nothing can go there now she plays c4 she's completely encroaching white is still better white is still better because white's going to put some pressure on that knight but she's defending herself now he takes and he plays g3 and he kind of does that to control the pieces bishop d6 back protecting knight f1 rerouting now bishop b8 by the way who's protecting this pawn and white just panics here he's sacrific a bishop he sacrifices a bishop to get to black but it's dubious and alexandra plays queen f7 and everything is protected not only is everything protected black is getting counterplay on white so white's got to get out of there and now you just got two bishops for the rook i mean very nice counterplay from alexandra king a1 and she just goes straight down the middle you're going to take my knight is going to get in very nice move d3 anchoring the pawn in the white position it's it's just going to be an an issue in every end game knight takes g3 you cannot take the rook because of the pin queen a7 and she just takes you can give me all the checks you want i block this looks scary a lot of people would avoid this position but black is completely safe black is completely safe not only is black completely safe white completely malfunctions rook to f1 queen back to c6 protecting rook to f6 looks very scary but just queen c5 just just queen c5 and alexander is doing a nice job managing her time the king walks all the way to safety game is over next move is rook g1 trade the rooks get to the back rank queen d8 she plays queen c7 and white just resigns straight up resigns he resigns because the options are trade the queens and once you trade the queens this is over because these bishops just go over here and escort the pawn uh the alternative was to play queen here which would lose a rook to bishop e5 this was crazy because from the opening white played this ridiculous system but alexandra shrug back with g5 which was a very nice move at this uh at at like in terms of the practicality of the position the computer liked white's position but black had a lot of space and a very difficult structure to break through here white needed to find knight e4 and then bishop e5 and then queen e4 this is how he had the sacrifice but he just did it the wrong way and i mean it's not even clear why this is better so another win for her so she was winning games confidently and she was winning games from positions that were bad she was winning games in positions that were unpleasant d4 d5 here's another queen's gambit takes takes she plays bishop f4 this is an exchange queen's gambit decline there is not much happening here bishop d3 takes takes and she castles long which is very bold you you go long castles this late into a tournament because you've won every game you've played i mean you just get a different level of confidence idence right so bishop to e6 knight to e2 now when you're playing against an isolated pawn like black has black wants to trade to get some advantages but not all the pieces because the more pieces you trade the bigger this weakness becomes so we have knight b4 and now we have um knight e4 which is bold uh black should probably bring the rooks first by the way if you're confused between carlo molinari the first guy named dielli and the second player whose name i can't remember yeah all those guys sound like i dude i love italian names like amazing i wish i had an italian what would my italian name be it would be like would i be a luigi because i'm an l i would be leonardo ros manini oh right there boom that's my that that's my that's my uh that's my roman name beautiful you know there used to be that the the rap uh name uh generator there used to be your wuang remember that like wuang name calculator or whatever oh my god amazing stuff knight to e4 now she trades and this leaves a big weakness in the center knight to f4 and and black just gets a little bit too courageous here queen e7 the best move here for white is the very simple queen d6 and what this does is force a queen trade after which white is much better because you're going to trade and then you're going to win the pawn bishop f5 is possible but rook b6 is a fork knight to d3 is possible but after trading and simply taking a pawn or even playing e4 first e4 first might be better um white is just going to win a pawn and probably win this one momentarily alexandra trades on e6 first which is okay but now you're not guaranteed a queen trade so we get into instead of that a very complicated and locked battle where this knight is a giga chad but alexandra has won every game and that is where you get confidence to play moves like g4 the best move is for black to take and call the bluff black does not take and call the bluff white opens up the g file f4 is now creating a very powerful outpost and black blunders black blunders with queen e4 and um queen e4 knight e4 or wait a minute did black plunder rook e4 rook d3 but knight b2 oh a very nice move now knight to d6 rooks are hanging all over the place and it's finally looking like alexandra is not going to win a game i mean kn and four versus night and four you're not going to win this king d3 g6 knight comes back knight c5 yeah you know i mean black's just way too active what are you going to do knight c3 king f7 and suddenly the position is getting a little bit tactical and black needs to be careful and black needs to play knight c3 but plays knight f6 and now rook c7 and e5 and alexander's winning again because after knight d5 there's rook oh there's rook d7 rook d7 and you win because the knight is hanging knight b6 rook b7 and you're just going to win the pawn but okay she plays rook a7 and black is still feeling the pressure still feeling the pressure and he's probably going to lose this pawn and now you're a pawn down and you've got 30 seconds okay okay you got your time back now you should probably make the draw king g4 knight e4 uhoh no no no no no the king is to walk in would have even been better to play king h6 with rook a7 but suddenly alexandra gets way too active and chose two pawns up again and you can't play rook f5 because after this this you get mated you get mated but first you have to play knight f6 and then you get mated king h8 there is this and king f8 you have a fork and alexandra battles and battles and battles and i mean she like sometimes in a tournament like this you do need a little bit of luck for everything to go right you need a little there's a little but in chess you make your own luck it's not like drawing a card you know opponent making a mistake is a skill issue uh but you you make your own luck and chess and sometimes you create winning chances out of thin air and this was her last round of the tournament her opponent was the highest seed 1990 in an under 2000 section some of you may have been watching this and going why is she only playing people who are 1900 she played in the under 2000 section you were not allowed to be over 2,000 so and she played now deon dimitro now deon or dejon i don't know how they would say it but i would say i would think he actually beat andrea so he beat her younger sister the older sister shows up and and puts the kings indian on the board and the funny thing about this game is they copied each other he played a kings indian attack she played a kings indian defense we got our imbalance like this now it's kind of a sicilian with e4 c5 it's kind of a very weird and locked sicilian and we get into a maneuvering battle all right both sides looking at those squares in the center knight h4 and now very principled b5 play where you have space knight e3 a5 taking space now he plays a4 she plays b4 big moment what are you going to do as as white bishop f3 not really sure what that does but she plays h5 because she was concerned about something going to the g4 square he plays knight g2 i don't know what that does either she takes and plays rook b8 i completely understand what that does it opens the b file computer hated it though but at least i understand what alexander is trying to do develops the bishop queens knights it's a very close position and i think only really white can control the breakthroughs if white goes for f4 or d4 we are going to get somewhere unless black goes for a breakthrough which is also possible rook here we trade we kick out the piece now alexandra that is that almost undefeated score talking you just give up a pawn here but you're looking to get to the e4 square white plays dc she takes on e4 now now the position is going to open up bishop c2 rook b8 i mean what the heck is going on bishop to f6 queen e2 now knight b6 wait a minute we're going to trade this rook and this was alexandra's plan all along those weaknesses that she created with the pawn play but queen d3 wait a minute which way are you going to take can you take what about the pawn here defense so she defends this pawn and c4 is going to fall that's it she's going to win something he goes for crazy counter play knights she she takes with the bishop okay queen e4 and now black just wins with d5 one mover she wins the entire tournament with a discovered attack right there queen e4 unbelievable she's just winning she trades though she trades and then she plays bishop f8 and she's not better anymore that much it would have been better to go here and simply go after this pawn so she kind of gets lost in the complications she plays bishop f and now she's better but it's still complicated you got to go d5 good move now you could play e4 she plays bishop c5 first and now she plays e4 okay this looks very convincing okay i'm playing black here i build the whole structure and then i start bringing my pieces she plays knight8 fancy move trying to go to b6 and oh now he plays f5 he gives her another pawn he's trying to be two pawns down but when the pawn back she goes here now her pawns are disconnected and suddenly he's back in the game he's threatening knight d5 he's threatening all these different things bishop d6 and there it is oh no oh no knight takes bishop c4 knight c3 and the question is with white where do you move your king because you're going to lose this pawn now you would think oh easy king e3 knight a4 king e4 right take take take draw yeah a draw but it's actually better to go here and when the knight gets here that's when you come here because nobody can protect this pawn knight c3 bishop b2 pins to the king knight c5 bishop d5 or bishop a3 for those of you confused this is an easy draw opposite colored bishops you sacrifice the pawn it's it's an easy draw so he plays this and i just told you that move is bad and now alexandra finishes her tournament by uncorking like a nine move combination bishop c5 check the king goes forward king to f6 threatening check mate white plays g4 g5 forcing the king backwards h4 forcing the king backwards and now in this and only this position do you take on a4 and this pawn cannot be taken black ends with two pawns up knight c3 both pawns are going both pawns are escorted now it doesn't matter if the bishops become of opposite color because black is simply up two pawns bishop c2 king e5 bishop c1 knight d5 she loses the pawn but she plays knight e3 and this is a winning end game you cannot stop two pawns like this e3 king e4 king goes there and that's it the game is over alexander botes wins this tournament with 7 and a half out of nine she made three draws and she won six games undefeated undes ed under 2000 section champion of the sardinia open with a performance rating of 2352 which is higher than my rating she performed against this field like a 2352 should and she gained like 65 rating points so she's now going to be 2030 very impressive performance very impressive games shows you how you can get to the 2000 level if any of you have those questions like how do i get to 2,000 over theboard she's like a 2300 online player 2400 online player she's 2,000 over the board you got to have pretty decent openings you got to kind of understand your openings blunders happen and ultimately it's the person that makes the last mistake that wins so hope you enjoyed this video now get out of here
