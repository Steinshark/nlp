ladies and gentlemen it is with great pleasure that i welcome you back to the champions chess tour finale here in toronto canada that is where i'm currently sitting in my hotel room with my crappy little webcam in this round we are covering the last match of the round robin and then the survival stage there are eight players the top two will auto qualify to the semi-final the bottom two will get eliminated and spots three three four five and six will compete amongst each other to see who are the last two people who make the semis and the last two people to exit the tournament iar nakamura on the verge of elimination on the verge of potentially his worst chess tournament of this year and maybe in a few years beyond that magnus carlson and wesley so up top fabiano carana gunning for that third place spot this is an epic recap we just finished about 8 hours of coverage if not more it's currently 8:00 here i'm sitting in my hotel room shout shout out to the oslo team they've been working super hard and i also just got a suit shipment so i'm going to be nice and snazzy for the rest of the event i'm looking forward to sharing all of my uh iconic fashion choices with all of you shout out to joe bananis uh amazing uh australian fashion house that has hooked it up uh so if you're looking for a nice holiday pres uh present for your loved one or for yourself treat yourself you know now's the holidays you can you can check them out um i got nothing more to say here's the situation hikara nakamura has to beat dennis lazovic and ali resa fua has to lose to magnus carlson that is the only way that hikaru will make the survival stage hikaru's got his fate in his own hands for now hikaru plays in a a a bishop's opening against dennis lavic the young superstar from bellarus and one more thing magnus carlson actually has to show up to his game if magnus carlson overs sleeps and ali resa just gets a walk over ali resa makes the survival stage and hear game doesn't even matter you literally cannot script it any better hikaro plays a bishop's opening we have a vienna we actually have a course line this is my e4 course i'm not trying to plug it be you know with hikaro as the as the guy here but this is literally aine in the vienna d5 takes takes and seasoned e4 course owners know that you know generally black will take and then white will play for f4 and stuff like that and and by the way hikaru asks lvic to take lavic says no and karu takes and plays f4 which i just mentioned is the idea and generally uh inexperienced players here will take allow white to get very good development or white will put the pawn on f5 put the knight on g3 put the queen on g4 put the bishop on h6 right and it's sort of an avalanche now lvic is a very very good positional player understanding pece dynamics quite well and he manages to kind of fend off hikaru in the early opening and he gets a really solid position so karu is going to have to grel not shovel all right he's going to have to gravel here to try to make something happen as lavic lavic is not a guy that likes to lose a lot he is really not a guy he's not a loser let's put it this way all right and look at this he is baiting hikaru to take his pawn on the opposite side of the board and then lazovic starts attacking hikaru and he is better this is absolutely insane lvic is completely winning dennis lazic has a completely winning position against hikaru this is about to be hikaru's worst chess tournament in a decade like i i okay maybe maybe a decade is overstating it but this is completely nuts las built up this insane attack he gets rid of his knight and then lovic had to be a little bit patient he could have brought his queen in but instead he goes in with his pawns and hikaru sacrifices the rook now you might be surprised why i'm not screaming that move like sacrifice the rook but it was for defensive measure it was not really to checkmate anybody it was to bring the queen back from the opposite side of the board home for vacation and now we go to this position you'll notice that hikaro has got 47 seconds and las has 16 seconds you might have not noticed it because it's a little bit small on this overlay uh and i apologize for that but there's nothing i can do i'm on traveling right now laptop setup is not as good as the home setup so hopefully you forgive me and hopefully my commentary is still interesting lvic looking for a perpetual check a potential drop it look at hikaru hikaru just playing with fire he knows lazic has less than 10 seconds but he's not really playing for a win or is he playing for a win or is he playing for a loss they start repeating no no repetition from hikaro rook d7 queen h2 no repetition from hikaro poking shuffling the queen oh my god has he allowed a draw no he hasn't allowed a draw oh a queen can a knight and those pawns actually get the job done maybe maybe there go the pawns which apparently a big mistake a4 apparently a really bad move apparently instead of a4 hear should have kept pawn hunting but it doesn't matter because all of a sudden facing this very difficult end game dennis lazovic hangs a fork just like we do online knights are tricky in low time and dennis lazovic blunders a fork he goes on to lose game two he's been defeated here's the problem iaro got the job done hikaro was the favorite in this matchup he's a very very good rapid and blitz player but it's not up to him it's actually up to magnus carlson the good news is magnus carlson showed up to play which means that the match is still official pawn to d4 pawn to d5 we have a slav defense all right then magnus plays into a this is a semi- slot variation ala playing in a very very sharp line magnus plays a crazy aggressive move long castles looking to create some attacking possibilities blows open the center of the board and right around here actually i was doing commentary with fabiano and fabby said this position benefits uh ali resa's playing style a little bit more because it's very imbalanced opposite side castling pawn blockade in center it's a pass pawn but it is blocked black is going to try to create some stuff over here and this game becomes complete madness alza opens up magnus's g file why would he do that well he's doing that cuz he wants to open up magnus's king so both guys got lot of lot of things to they can look forward to you know there's an attack over here there's a target over here we have g5 and queen a5 meanwhile magnus has to play wait he's lost the pawn which is apparently a mistake because of bishop h7 check which is apparently not a bad move which is bad move magnus now has too many problems he has this this can't be taken but the queen is really really delicate black is also threatening bishop a4 and here and b5 and all sorts of other stuff the bishop goes to a4 apparently a bad move because the queen can slide out of the way and suddenly magnus is winning complete pandemonium magnus goes for a queen trade and is just better the king goes to g7 bishop takes magnus is plus three and it is a convincing plus three how do you win apparently not by taking this pawn white should go here and try to cut this diagonal but also threaten the black king on the h7 square and the threat of something like bishop to a4 is a bishop to e4 is check here and now not necessar bishop takes actually also works but you just take on f6 you have back rank checkmate ladder checkmate but instead of that magnus goes here and on the next move it gets even worse because he has 5 seconds and he blunders a bishop he blunders a bishop the bishop on b2 cannot be protected and magnus carlson los es he loses to ali resa fua who just beat magnus with black and there was like jokes in the playing hall you know the players were actually joking i'm not going to tell you who said what but they were like oh you know magnus didn't look too upset he's actually happy to lose because that means that he car is not going to make it that is nuts i told the official tv channel in norway they interviewed me on tv2 which is a channel in norway that supports chess has been supporting magnus carlson and chess in norway for many years so big shout out to them i said the odds that magn over sleeps and doesn't show up are actually higher than him coming to the board and losing on purpose cuz that would be ridiculous and so we go to the final rapid game magnus has to win this game he has to win this game to force an armageddon he plays a sicilian to his credit trying to play for a win imbalance queen takes d4 bishop takes right knight c3 okay queen c6 magnus playing this very provocative approach multiple queen moves and ali resel looking to create a little bit of a queen side bind not letting b5 happen knight f6 bishop g5 knight d7 h6 kicking the bishop and now magnus blows the center of the board open this is typical magnesian type of stuff we have a big exchange very big exchange and now you can't take with the rook because you would lose your c pawn black has a rook sniping down at our pawn so we go here can magnus win what is traditionally a perfect advantage for him bishop pair he has two clusters of pawns like in battleship you have your two ship and your four ship al is kind of got a goofy setup he's got this weird pawn in the center we can't tell if it's an asset or a liability we don't really know like what are we doing we're going to push it is what's going to happen right he does and magnus takes he helps alli resa get rid of what is supposed to be a pretty big weakness bishop b4 and now magnus is going to keep turning the screws right look at the time he's got double ali resus time he trades ali resa's bishop magnus has a symmetrical pawn structure but alyza is overextended right so now it's bishop versus knight we know bishops are better than knights in end games but look at this is it in action the knight can't really do anything by going forward now magnus starts doing what he is encroaching this is like vintage magnus carlson ala trying to fight back right rook a3 magnus planting this pawn here because he knows in most end games that's going to be a major problem now he's bringing his king i mean apparently it's a mistake but rook d2 now magnus trading the rooks also a mistake really but alza has 50 seconds sur's not going to do anything about that and then he does and all of a sudden if you play rook takes a5 which looks like a free pawn ali resa is planning on let's say taking taking and whoops or you actually could take and then go get this with the pawn and then go back and play h4 you can actually use your two onone there's no way magnus messed this up though right this is all part of the plan res got 17 seconds there's no way there's no way oh there there we i i told you magnus knew what he was doing rook to h1 knight g5 now he's going to win the pawn he should have played bishop c6 but okay look at magnus okay there there we go there we go magnus is going to win this game in force an armageddon he starts pushing his pawns what apparently rook h5 magnus should have went backwards to push his a pawn but by going forward he allows white's knight to get in and threaten a fork and all of a sudden it's just a race and my friends do you know what happens with white's pawn white's pawn goes all the way he has to lose it and now we go to this end game this is a theoretical draw if you know the technique to draw this endgame you will draw it but not with 10 seconds on the clock white wants to uh black wants to push white's king to one of the back ranks using the king and the bishop and the rook then threaten different checkmate nets white needs to give deflecting checks from the end deflecting checks from the side and also waight there's also a type of defense called second rank defense where you put the rook like this in the front and sometimes you can sacrifice it and actually it leads to a stalemate well it's over magnus is going to do his best but alira is defending perfectly despite putting his king on the final rank king h6 there's no way to checkmate so alira had to keep his rook around he panicked he moved his king and one square makes all the difference magnus swarms him rook a6 the threat is to threaten checkmate and the black king cannot the white king cannot escape in time 93 moves and he beats alira fua but it's not over yet because we still have to go to an armageddon will hikaru even make it it's magnus with white alir a bid armageddon 9 minutes magnus in this game plays a chaotic opening i've never seen the move f3 in my life normally you put a pawn there but magnus starts firing pawns away we get a very imbalanced opening c takes d5 apparently considered a mistake magnus launching pawns forward playing with his king playing with his pawns knight h5 now magnus busts open the center of the board and he's even attacking on the queen side magnus can't get enough he's trying to play on every side of the board but here comes alira fire firing back with f5 magnus takes the bishop queen takes plants his knight firmly on the c5 square couple of moves later he wins the pawn on b5 magnus is now upon up but ali resa just like the last game fights back from a completely losing position to one of equality and all of a sudden alira is no longer losing this is insanity but there's a major problem there's no bonus time in armageddon until move 60 and it is currently moved 33 ala fua has 80 seconds to make 27 moves and as you can tell from the next time usage you're going to see he's not doing a very good job and magnus is doing a great job keeping the tension creating forking opportunities the rook is defending black plays e5 d e5 and now you can't take with the queen and you can't take with the knight because they're both trying to guard the rook he plays this which is the best move but he has 27 seconds to make 20 moves it's not physically possible he starts doing his best he starts throwing in checks but ali resa is now officially down to 10 seconds for 14 moves and magnus's king marches up the board and this is it you are looking at the final moves of the game as ali rza loses on time winning this end game is actually really hilarious because white has to make a knight and then take the pawn and then promote this one which is very funny but it's over magnus carlson saved hikaru hikaru has made the survival stage can you believe it i keep comparing it to deathly hallows it's deathly hallows malfoy potter room of requirement seventh book seventh movie just he couldn't let him he couldn't let him fall he couldn't let him fall my friends this is how it works the third seed and the fourth seed play each other the winner makes the semi-finals the fifth and the sixth seed play each other the winner plays the loser of the matchup that i just mentioned the loser of five and six goes home you got two matchups one guy goes up one guy goes down one guy plays that guy one guy goes home that's it fabiano carana is the three seed no abd satov is the fourth seed here we go we begin with a spanish this is a main line with b5 and d6 this has been played many many times before the brier variation is chosen by nck the idea is to put the bishop here and the knight here figure out a little bit later what to do with the c pawn we'll see will he play it like this way where you put the bishop on g7 it's a big maneuvering opening there we go there's the rook going to uh do you see that do you see this over here i'm getting some notifications here in my uh my my my my events um bishop f8 i mentioned all of this nock starts advancing on fabiano's queen side with his pawns bringing his pawns bringing his queen poking prodding are they going to repeat moves no rook d1 there we go with c5 fa takes and does something like this he has frozen the position fabiano is now basically saying in all future end games you're going to have liabilities these are not assets i don't know why you're trying to push them there frankly i don't know why you're trying to checkmate me look at all of this stuff coming there is nothing here that square exploitable that those pawns exploitable fabby just has to stay patient he just has to wait nre can't figure out how to coordinate his army right queen d2 oh now the pawns are really frozen and after a series of maneuvers that lasts basically the whole game everything that i just said came came true fabiano obtains a position where he has absolutely no risk on the king side he has outmaneuvered with expertise no ab dorov and he's going to point the bishop and the queen and it's just a matter of time and there it is a massive decision now you force all of your targets onto that pawn and this pawn is going to march through and fabiano carana in rapid game number one of the survival stage against no aboro is putting on a positional master class he crashes through by winning the pawn he plays bishop to c5 to make nob have to to defend the knight he then is ready for the opening of the position you just can't defend yourself too many things under too many bits of pressure noer beck's position collapses bishop takes f5 we are two pawns up in an end game but it's much worse than that because the queen is stuck to the back rank protecting the d pawn queen to f6 queen f2 check is prevented the promotion is secured bobana carana just completely destroyed no abdulov it's over i will show you the second rapid game just in case nock plays d4 c4 we have a nso indian there's not a whole lot of interesting stuff nowadays in the nso indian they basically just trade all the pieces isolate a pawn position bishop c2 queen d3 rook d1 normal stuff oh oh oh oh oh no nre's not ready okay n's not ready to go he's he's getting aggressive he's doing what he has to do he's putting fabiano a little bit on the back foot but he you know this is kind of like a no there's no there's nothing happening here it's just a whole bunch of nothing bishop f8 so so who cares wait a minute this doesn't look good at all wait a minute he's got the rooks now fab's pushing pawns in front of his king what is going on bishop f6 rook g3 i mean it looks like the game is just over it looks like you're just going to it's plus five and he loses a little bit of advantage but my man nerc puts on an attacking clinic fabiano puts on a defensive clinic there is somehow no way to checkmate him but he simply cannot defend so many elements of the position the constant threat of infiltration among the dark squares and the c pawn taking oxygen away and the b pawn being a spot where you can infiltrate this one goes down to the wire as fiano defended as best as he could but nck was patient he was calculated and he broke through he broke through on the dark squares he's threatening rook a shaden rook h7 but you know what else he's threatening to execute the black king in front of his troops queen f6 his mate n has struck back he struck back he went on a massive attack in a must-win situation and we go to an armageddon we go to an armageddon and the crazy thing is ner beck wagered 1458 he wanted to play white because he just had success fabiano wagered 10 minutes and 14 seconds because he had a feeling ner beck was going to want to play with white can nerb do it again fabiano goes for the same line okay plays b6 slightly different okay now we have a slightly different setup and he says no no trade of the bishop because i'm not going to be doing enough damage there all right d5 nre takes space fabiano oh my goodness nb's going right back to it he's going right back to it he's trying to create an attack here now remember when you're playing with white it's must win you can't make a draw all right queen e2 c6 fi trying to fight back now apparently that was a mistake apparently bishop e4 here and is giving a huge advantage because i guess white can slow play on the defile but instead of all of that the pawns just start taking a massive stronghold e4 shuts it down with f4 but nbe does have a positional advantage he has a very nice bind fab's going to have to really defend himself and instead of defending himself look at look fab just playing g4 fabby doesn't have to win the game he's down three minutes i don't know who the hell he thinks he is noj playing c5 wants to bust open this position we're attacking that we're attacking that we're attacking that we're attacking that we're attacking that we've got ideas to go there cuz there's a king on the opposite side we have hg with might break out this way complete pandemonium fabby takes the pawn which is apparently a big mistake apparently a big mistake nerre grabs the knight rook f6 and plays rook d1 and he's better he's better and fabiano's position is on the absolute verge of collapse he plays bc bc fabi's pawns are about to fall apart rook to c8 apparently a mistake apparently n big should have been patient you might wonder what's the idea here don't you just lose the pawn but then bishop b4 ideas and apparently you've got some very powerful cannons there but instead of that cd de and fabiano caruana against all odds is still three minutes down but white is no longer winning it's very difficult here for ner beck who very quickly realizes he might not be playing for a win at all i got news for you not only is ner not really playing for a win anymore he might be playing not to lose he might be playing not to get mated rook g5 and f got everything defended queen a7 queen c1 queen c4 oh my go oh my that that that's that's a mate right there try queen what's happening queen he's threatening mate again and the game is over the rook is threatened that's mate if you don't go to f1 and if you do go to f1 then after rook to f1 just play queen d2 and you cannot stop all of this you can play queen c2 but then i play rook takes queen takes and you lose this end game because you just cannot get off the second rank and my friends fabiano caruana king h2 rook h5 is the third seed and nir beck has to play the winner of hikaru versus mvl hikaro versus mvl begins hikaru's got second least on life like magnus just pulled him back up right he pulled him back up into the event hikaru playing a sicilian defense full of energy locks the position castle's the king it's a very locked game both guys not not too fond of exchanges big maneuvering battle nobody wants to trade aas b4 we go' moves before we trade one pawn and then hikaru takes the knight to remove some of the stronghold that black has that white has excuse me on the center and mvl just won't stop mvl keeps pounding it right striking back with his own f pawn is hikaru the knight goes to f3 bishop c6 qu okay hikaru tried to go for an end game instead of going for the end game there magnus uh not magnus mvl takes the pawn on a7 queen a6 takes takes cars a pawn down how's he going to oh wow look at that deflecting the queen and now seeing that he's going to win a queen of his own hikaru sacrifices his queen like a little desperado rook e8 rook f8 and he's going to have to guard this end game iaru is down a pawn uh mvl has three very very bad pawns but can he can he somehow fight that off like is is there a way that he's going to be able to to pull through now hikaru has lost a couple of end games in this event particularly in armageddon he has struggled a little bit in clutch time decision making in these deep end games because they're they're hard okay they're hard and he has 30 seconds to do it he's putting a lot of the pawns over there on light squares to make sure that the bishop can't get to them but the bishop can get to the queen side pawns and the way maxim does this is he plays a5 and he goes for the c pawn the computer does not like it but as a human stopping promotion and using your two pawns together is very very sound and hearu does what any normal human would do he starts pushing his a- pawn rook a5 take take and apparently after a2 bishop c3 it is a draw but you have to do it the right way knight a5 is tricky you can't take it but now you have to play knight here that's where you have to park your knight remember if bishop takes you queen but instead of that hikaro allows white to get too much activity and all of a sudden he loses his pawn and it's worse than that he loses all the pawns and hikaru goes down after waging a monster comeback he loses to mvl and now he has to win with white what better way to win with white than to play e4 and against the sicilian defense to play a smith moa gambit it is a must-win game hikaru plays a smith mora gambit knight f6 e5 and in this position not cd not knight f3 ne either of these moves queen takes d4 which is not a popular move mvl has to not lose queen c7 bishop c4 moves the knight out of the way so it doesn't get taken right g6 apparently a bad move why is that so bad caro gets good control of the dark squares good central bind knight bd2 and ail tries to break out really quickly tries to be forceful here right play bishop b5 nice move from hikaru positional understanding trying to fight for these squares trying to target the pawns in the center of the board knight d8 all right move there the computer didn't like so much i have these animations on i am sorry about that he's trying to dominate the pawns he does dominate the pawns look at that that is really nice now he's going to play knight d4 he's going to reposition his bishop f4 rook e1 position positional masterpiece here can higu get it done b6 repositioning the bishop as i [music] said a massive mistake oh my goodness knight c5 rook e5 rook e5 rook e5 it's over maxim blunders not bishop g2 to put pressure but bishop h3 to remove the knight as the center defender instead of bishop b s e4 and the position was in the balance white was better white was still playing for potential advantage but this move ends the game on the spot and against all odds hikaro has made an he he's tied the match one to one just like the nre backck match white won every game so white is four and0 nock and fabiano traded blows with white nck led one- nothing and then fabiano made a comeback um no the other way around fabiana won the first game then nor made a comeback insane completely insane now it's time for armageddon iaru out bids maxim and he starts with 9 minutes and 48 seconds with black now this was crazy think about what just happened nybeck destroyed fabiano when he played white and fabiano destroyed ner when he played white so you would think that you would want white in that match which is what noer did and he lost hikaru crushed maxim with white but he chose black and the armageddon i will remind you hikaru is 0 and4 in armageddon in this event 0 and four and he's been black in every armageddon that is the literal definition of insanity doing the exact same thing over and over and expecting a different result but in hikaru's case it's not a matter of insanity it's a matter of sticking to his principles and purely thinking things haven't gone his way because they're a bit of a a coin toss so can he hold he plays a damiano defense again this completely absurd opening that maxim played against them before they play an ultra uber sharp line where white sacrifices the right to castle but tries to hold on to his extra pawn they play a bunch of cutting edge theory maxim wins two pawns which apparently is incorrect because now he has to put his king in the center of the board and hikaro gets one of the pawns back this is completely nuts playing like this with black you are threatening mate though so i do suppose that is a good thing rook e1 queen c5 and by the 19th and 20th move of the game it was hikaru who had a better position despite being one pawn down and playing an armageddon so hikaro plays this absurd mutual symmetrical petro defense and after a firing off a bunch of crazy prep that he had he's not even worse in fact he's better and a couple of moves later he actually gets a totally winning position with this now he's threatening to trap maxim's queen the game is over b3 and now the winning move was bishop b4 check hikaro is winning if he just sacrifices the bishop that's hard to do it's hard to sacrifice the bishop and then apparently you can play bishop c8 there's a really really ridiculous line there if he doesn't have to find it no problem he's still completely winning but it is a little bit weird he has to play bishop d4 and maybe try to go here and then he blunders and now maxim is winning oh oh my goodness apparently queen f7 wins for white maxim goes here instead take take and now queen e5 and in this position maxim plays rook a1 first and then he plays here hikaru has checkmate on the board if he sacrifices the rook rook takes d 3 king takes d3 leads to queen e4 and mate rook takes d3 cd3 leads to queen b2 and mate and the point is that black can take the rook right away but if you take the rook right away then queen a7 and there's a devastating attack there after queen a8 but they both miss rook d3 car doesn't f oh my god oh my god f3 they're both attacking each other but when it's all said and done karu has a minute and a half to make 20 something moves but guess what he succeeds he plays every move in two to three seconds he gets the game to an end game and when it was all said and done he held off maxim and with his second lease on life in this event which magnus gave him by beating fuja hikaru beats mvl and he is now qualified for minimum fifth and sixth place finish fifth technically but now he plays nck nck lost to fabiano we already know three of the semi-finalists wesley magnus and um and fabiano and now it's noca or hikaru this is absolutely insane hikaru and noer made two draws and they went to an armageddon their two draws were relatively uneventful the first one was a very very nice defensive hold from hikaru and in this game nck outbid hikaru he went 9 minutes and 35 seconds taking a 5 minute and 25 second disadvantage he said that is how much it's worth to me because nre did not have success with white and in their rapid game earlier in the event he said he didn't get any advantage from the opening with white so he said you know what hikaro has to play and hikaro has to win he's going to have to beat me and i am going to have to not lose spanish main line hikaro plays d3 bit of a sideline not c3 and d4 nock takes a kings indian approach like this hikaro playing bit of a sideline with d3 and c4 controlling uh the position a little bit now nock for forces the issue he doesn't have a huge amount of time so he can't get into a long maneuvering battle he needs to force the issue a little bit c6 and we get a position with no horses just bishops hikaro plays b4 taking space on the queen side nc fires back he's not going to get bullied bishop b3 bishop e6 we have a trade and now we have queen h4 firing at multiple of white's pawns from the king side c5 hikaru opening the position against norer beck's king apparently f5 was a big mistake because of c5 takes takes king h8 and now f4 a nice idea is this pawn going to be a long-term asset or a liability for black it's a very good question fe4 rook e4 this looks really suspicious because the c6 who's going to guard the pawn this a horrible pawn and if you lose that pawn this is going to fall apart as well and now ner beck probably plays his most clutch move of his life let alone in this tournament of his life he abandons the pawn he doesn't play passive defense if if nobe plays passive defense here yar is going to steamroll him he's going to play rook f1 he's going to play queen d3 attacking that pawn nre can defend himself so you know what no does he hits a hell with that pawn g5 opening up the position now if hikaru takes this pawn you get queen f2 because suddenly the rook and the queen team up so that's not possible the best move after g5 is to be patient karu moves his rook with he's pion but he's on the e file and then he goes here and that's wrong apparently instead of queen f3 he had to really reconsider where he put his rook which is just impossible to play like if you just played rook e one you're not going to play rook f1 as a human now norre guards the sixth rank rookie but hikaru's better again rook e 6 he's repeating apparently after rook e8 rook f8 hikaru needed to take that rook to send black's rook to the shadows and after rook e6 it's really hard to protect this now you do have to go here and it's a now white can finally get the pawn back a little bit of a hiccup but hikaru repeats and now ner defends himself he's still worse but all of a sudden d3 sneaking the pawn in and queen g3 sneaking in the queen and we have to trade rooks oh my goodness nre is fighting back we're in an end game pieces are flying off the board all the pawns are collapsing hikaro rushing but wait a minute oh my god he's going to lose the pawn on c5 and he just doesn't have enough the pieces are swarming but it's just not enough bishop d4 trades into a rook end game and my friends yaru pushes and he pushes and he pushes but the pawns are too strong nock's king gets out and they have to trade their pieces and on the 63rd move of this game we were left with kings no abdor eliminates hikaru nakamura last man standing to qualify for the semi-finals hikaru a heartbreaking conclusion to the events for hikaru fans myself included but nothing to take away from the incredible effort of nock who outbid hikaru took n and a half minutes on the clock to play black it was hikaru's first armageddon with white little bit of psychology there a little bit of a decision- making from nck he holds the fort he is the last semi-finalist of the event commiserations to hikaru commiserations to maxim vrav ali resa fua eliminated before even making it to the survival stage at dennis lazic uh in that order but it's magnus carlson it's wesley so it's fabiano carana it's no abdor and because he was the top seed the way it works in this event is wesley gets to choose his opponent despite losing wesley lost to fabiano i didn't show it because it didn't matter wesley clinched the top seed and fabiano clinched the survival stage so wesley is the top seed despite tying with magnus because he beat him in the head-to-head uh wesley so chose nbe abdor he chose him because he's a young guy he's a new guy and uh fabiano has quite a decent score against wesley actually overall and i think wesley fancies his chances a little bit more against noer we now will have two days of semi-finals and then we will have two days of the final it is a set on each day best of four rapid and it's magnus carlson versus
