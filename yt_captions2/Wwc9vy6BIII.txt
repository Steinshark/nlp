foreign guess i need a new one this is the god king of gaming monitors i can't afford that linus hmm wait you don't need the god king of monitors i know we talk about expensive stuff all the time but you can get a really decent display for as little as a hundred bucks these days yeah right a hundred dollars yeah i'm sure it's only 75 hertz and 1080p but look at all these reviews isn't this some hunk of junk would the people steer you wrong tell you what let me figure out why the everyone is buying this thing give me a few days and i'm gonna get back to you and while you're waiting nice

the other one they have the exact same specs so we think it's either a newer revision or maybe a regional thing whatever this thing is it's got over 25 000 reviews on amazon with 76 percent of you giving it a 5 star rating that is really impressive there's not too much to it two hdmi ports vga audio in and out and a barrel plug for power no display port is kind of odd for a pc monitor and has some drawbacks we'll talk more about that later the stand attaches with a couple of screws and in terms of adjustment features this and that's about it we've got our speaker grilles on the back my hopes are not too high for these a kensington lock and then navigation buttons for the osd they're labeled but they're labeled on the back which is better than nothing but not as good as being labeled on the front as for the overall feel well it's light and cheap but kind of what we like about it and there's a lot more to like 1080p resolution isn't cutting edge but at 24 inches it's definitely enough and while 75 hertz refresh rate is less than you might expect for a gaming first monitor these days it is noticeably better than the 60 hertz that was standard for so many years it's also vase amountable includes speakers supports variable refresh rate really that's cool and boasts three millisecond grade pixel response times 95 coverage of the srgb color space 250 nit peak brightness all on a va panel va panel the hp that you guys are buying last time we did this was ips and it was just 90 bucks did we take a step backwards here well it might seem like it on the surface and the pavilion 22cwa is still a valid choice all these years later but last decades champion is only 21.5 inches is stuck at just 60 hertz it's created great response times also weren't great and the stand was pretty weird its main draw really was just being an ips panel for cheap which was unheard of back then let's see if our newcomer can hold up this is not bad we measured them the delta e's are eight out of the box and six with calibration meaning yeah you're not going to be doing any color accurate work on it but like it's poppy i mean va can be a drawback in terms of pixel response time we're going to play around with that once i actually get in game but it's a benefit when it comes to contrast like obviously it's not oled but it it it pops you know what blows my mind this is better in every way than my first like large format monitor it was a dell 2405 fpw and it was 16 by 10 and had a better stand obviously but it did not look anywhere near this good i spent like six seven hundred dollars on that thing second hand and this just traps on it in terms of the image quality oh hold on a second david oh my god are you seeing are you seeing this motion blur on the high contrast edges here oh it's playable for sure um what just happened okay hold on i gotta pay attention here where's my freaking oddball that no don't shoot me don't shoot me no damn it okay sorry i'm paying attention i was busy i was busy observing the smearing okay come check this out guys oh man you see how it kind of aside from the tearing okay let me find i gotta find like uh oh shoot oh god damn i'm trying to look trying to benchmark here okay it's two things okay it's the blurriness on the trailing edge as we're moving and then it's also the overdrive artifacting on the leading edge so it's just a mess when it's in motion see that something that really stands out to me is that compared to our last pick 24 inches is kind of the threshold to me for immersion it doesn't feel small and it might not have the sharpness of a higher pixel density display but this is super easy to drive with an inexpensive gpu and at 1080p you really want to stick to your native resolution uh at 4k 5k the interpolation is not as distracting but at this res it doesn't look great the speariness doesn't look great under any circumstances it's pretty rough 100 bucks easy that's like the easiest decision ever you know what the 2405 fpw was also va and also had wicked motion blur i remember it stood out to be the most in freelancer this is basically my first awesome monitor but it's a hundred dollars now like yeah how can you argue with that it's compelling uh 75 hertz is markedly better than 60. like it's a huge difference hey i got him yes sorry look i haven't played in a while okay it's taking me taking me a sec here it's not a gaming monitor if competitive shooters are your bread and butter i'd consider ponying up the extra 25 for this kurui model but it never claims to be and it's perfectly adequate for just about anything else and in my opinion good enough for gaming anyway but enough about what i think what do you guys think the five star folks it seems are really loving the value they like the picture quality the size the value how skinny it is how easy it is to set up and the value did i mention the value it seems like a common use case for these things is to buy a carton of them for a cheap and cheerful multi-monitor battle station with multiple users pointing out it's amazing utility for things like security systems some of you are upgrading from smaller screens and just don't want to go too big while others are looking for an inexpensive secondary monitor that is both easy to mount and not total garbage we did find some valid complaints about missing screws or lackluster durability but over overwhelmingly you all still gave it five stars does the e248 19203 rt get anything wrong yes and the most reasonable complaints come mostly from the four-star crowd you guys are still loving the price compared to a basic gaming monitor like this viotech but the coffee and donut that you bought with your savings are long gone leaving behind only sticky packaging and a bitter aftertaste there is bad smearing the stand isn't all that adjustable it does feel cheap and plasticky and the speakers well they're they're present but they're not very good still though for the most part you guys seem pretty pleased too and four and five star reviews make up about 92 percent of all user reviews bringing us to the other eight percent almost all of the one to three star reviews were about bad quality control bad hdmi cable panel deterioration broke after a move dead pixels the rma process sucked crappy stand and then a lot of people with similar complaints to the four star crew but just louder and angrier that's only eight percent of all reviews even on a premium product that would be a pretty impressive rating and outside of failures which typically can be are made within the first year even if the process for it isn't great there just aren't a lot of complaints i mean the quality isn't exceptional like the clothing on lttstore.com especially our new henley shirt but at least with the scepter you know you're buying the value option whether it's a three pack for a 300 battle station set up or just a simple terminal monitor that only needs to display text i've seen enough at this point to give it the should be fine award of sufficiency but if you've made it this far in the video you might be shopping for a monitor in this range and you probably want to know if there are other options that could be a better buy and there might be there's a saying that you might have heard a few times on this channel there's no such thing as a bad product just a bad price and at anything higher than the price we paid for this it would be a bad price and you'd be better off shopping elsewhere the reality is that while this thing is going to give you exactly what it says for cheap as soon as it goes back to its current amazon list price of 125 dollars it gets trounced by the competition this kurui monitor don't ask i've never heard of them buy at your own risk is only 22 inches but it's less than eighty dollars they've got a 24 inch model on sale too that's 165 hertz for 125 dollars that's about the same as the vo tech that i showed you guys before and if you don't need high refresh rate anyway this acer model is also just a hundred dollars at the time of writing with even more positive reviews the main drawback of that one though is that it can't be vase amounted which really takes away that battle station capability for a hundred fifty dollars regularly on sale for more like 125 to 130 you can get the va24dq from asus same size resolution and refresh rate but it is ips with better pixel response times and you're not limited to amd graphics cards if you want variable refresh rate support thanks to the displayport connection it should be noted that while nvidia can do variable refresh rate over hdmi it's only on hdmi 2.1 which this monitor does not support and if you don't like asus for whatever reason in the 1 to 125 dollar price range there are a lot of options with basically those same specs from a number of different brands which i think leads us to a really good point here whether you guys keep buying the scepter e248w19203rt or you end up swapping to basically any other brand with similar specs around the same price what matters is that decent secondary displays have reached the point where they are truly cheap now the fact that this little guy can be vase amounted and quickly incorporated into your setup means that just about anyone who can afford a computer can also afford a multi-monitor setup that isn't crap which has a huge impact on productivity which actually leads us into another important point don't get drawn into spending more than you intended with this kind of thing i mean a lot of alternative options we mentioned were only you know twenty dollars to thirty dollars more but that's a 20 to 30 percent price increase and when you consider how fast display tech is moving these days that might not be worth it for you and that's especially true if you're picking up two or three of these things and paying that extra 20 each time so the scepter e248w-19203 rt then it may not be the god king of monitors but it's also not the peasant deuce so maybe keep buying them then just don't pay more than a hundred dollars we ran some tests and yep you get what you pay for but let's be real your security camera feed doesn't need delta ease of two or 120 hertz in hdr to see that i'm about to segue to our sponsor vessi do you ever struggle to figure out what
