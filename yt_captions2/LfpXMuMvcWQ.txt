(speaker_00) this pc is the same price as a playstation 5 (speaker_00) and competes, or in some cases, even wins (speaker_00) in just about every game we tested, (speaker_00) including some sony first-party titles. (speaker_00) but how is that even possible? (speaker_00) i mean, gaming consoles dominate computers (speaker_00) in price to performance, don't they? (speaker_00) well, sometimes. (speaker_00) it's no secret that sony and microsoft (speaker_00) are willing to sell their hardware at a loss (speaker_00) in order to lock you into their ecosystem (speaker_00) of accessories, subscription services, and software, (speaker_00) all of which are sold for a profit. (speaker_00) over time, then, this chips away at your initial savings, (speaker_00) but even with that in mind, (speaker_00) i totally get why people go for it. (speaker_00) when this thing launched, (speaker_00) $500 barely got you a decent gpu, (speaker_00) let alone a complete gaming box. (speaker_00) of course, there's (speaker_00) no denying the power of the sony exclusive machine. no pc could
ever hope to compete with that model, (speaker_00) at least not for the first couple of years, but technology marches
ever onward and with (speaker_00) competition and the used market heating up again, it is finally
possible to match (speaker_00) the price and performance and budget of a playstation 5 with (speaker_00) a gaming pc. and ours is going to be powered by seasonic, who
sponsored this video, even though (speaker_00) this is a second-hand power supply. that'll make sense later.
first, we have to answer some (speaker_00) big questions. if our goal is to match the playstation 5's spec, we
need a ryzen 7 3700x (speaker_00) with eight zen 2 cores and a 6600 xt rdna 2 gpu. but guys, we don't
want to (speaker_00) match it. look at the title! we want to beat it! (speaker_00) that means making smart choices in the name of real-world
performance, even if they might come with some compromises, like this one. (speaker_00) we've gone with the amd ryzen 5 5600x, and it's got two fewer
cores than the playstation 5. (speaker_00) however, it's zen 3 architecture makes it the budget king when it
comes to gaming right now. (speaker_00) and it's only 65 watts, meaning that the stock heatsink that's
included with it (speaker_00) ... (speaker_00) should be fine to keep it cool. (speaker_00) that right there, that's savings. (speaker_00) and it means we don't need an op power supply (speaker_00) in order to drive this thing. (speaker_00) boom! (speaker_00) more savings. (speaker_00) now, it's worth noting that for a few bucks more, (speaker_00) you could jump up to a 57 or a 5800x, (speaker_00) but we are on a pretty tight budget. (speaker_00) making our $500 target even more challenging (speaker_00) is the fact that we wanted this to be a build (speaker_00) that you could replicate at home. (speaker_00) this isn't scrapyard wars, this is a guide. (speaker_00) so we targeted prices that you will probably be able (speaker_00) to find in about a week, whether it's on ebay or elsewhere. (speaker_00) if you're patient and have a little luck on your side, (speaker_00) there are better deals to be had out there. (speaker_00) david found this puppy for just over 70 us dollars. (speaker_00) just remember to follow our guidelines for marketplace bargain
hunting, (speaker_00) if you want to avoid getting scammed. we're going to have that
video linked down below. (speaker_00) the nice thing about going for amd's am4 socket is that there are
three whole generations of (speaker_00) motherboards that you get to pick from. but we noticed a few things
you're going (speaker_00) to want to watch out for. first, older generation boards turned out
to cost (speaker_00) almost the same as the newer ones, but had a much higher risk of
incompatibility with newer chips. (speaker_00) so make sure you double check the manufacturer's website. (speaker_00) second, for the difference in price, (speaker_00) a series chipsets are a no-no. (speaker_00) you're gonna wanna go b series (speaker_00) in order to retain important features (speaker_00) and get what is typically higher build quality, (speaker_00) even if it costs a few more dollars. (speaker_00) so b550 and b450 ended up being the sweet spot (speaker_00) where we found multiple candidates for around $40, (speaker_00) including our asrock b450m pro4. (speaker_00) it's got four ddr4 dimm slots for our 16 gigs of g.skill trident z
3600 mega transfer per second ram (speaker_00) and it's even got respectable i/o including usb type-c. (speaker_00) now it's not all roses, b450 is limited to pci express gen 3 rather
than gen 4. (speaker_00) that means that our system could struggle to get maximum
performance out of future gpus (speaker_00) and even today, this is a compromise next to one of the ps5's most
advertised features. (speaker_00) it's rockin' fast ssd. (speaker_00) our 1tb samsung 970 evo+ runs at only about 3/5ths of the speed of
the playstation 5's storage. (speaker_00) but, it's a reputable name-brand drive and, with most pc games
being optimized for sata ssds (speaker_00) or even hard drives, there will be next to no impact in our gaming
performance. (speaker_00) at least for now. (speaker_00) so smart compromise or dumb cut? (speaker_00) let us know what you think in the comments below. (speaker_00) speaking of cuts, we ended up saving some of our money (speaker_00) by using the kind of case (speaker_00) that might have some ragged edges on it, (speaker_00) but can be found for free or for just a few bucks (speaker_00) on a local marketplace. (speaker_00) david, this thing is huge. (speaker_00) hell yeah. (speaker_00) definitely advantage ps5, (speaker_00) which with dbrand dark plates, (speaker_00) comfortably fits in an ltt backpack, lttstore.com. (speaker_00) your mileage may vary here. (speaker_00) we got lucky-ish, (speaker_00) and this was a pretty sick case before the trauma, (speaker_00) but your goal is to pretty much find someone (speaker_00) who's dumping old office pcs or gaming skeletons like this (speaker_00) for next to, if not zero. (speaker_00) if you're patient, (speaker_00) you can often find ones with some cooling fans already installed in
them to save a few more bucks. (speaker_00) the only big thing to watch out for is atx compatibility and
clearance for any longer (speaker_00) components. a dremel can often solve compatibility issues, but you
might not have one on hand. (speaker_00) fortunately, we won't need any of that for our x650 gold power
supply from today's sponsor, (speaker_00) seasonic. this particular unit came out almost the (speaker_00) 15 years ago, but is still going strong. (speaker_00) and what's really cool is that even if you are buying (speaker_00) secondhand, seasonic stands behind their products hard. (speaker_00) they actually have a transferable warranty, (speaker_00) being that all you need to do is ask the seller (speaker_00) for the original sales invoice, (speaker_00) and you're covered for the entire original length. (speaker_00) not only that, but they recently upped their warranty (speaker_00) on newer units from 10 years to 12 years. (speaker_00) absolutely. (speaker_00) chads. (speaker_00) now, let's talk gpu. (speaker_00) this one, it's gonna be a little spicy. (speaker_00) but hey, spice is the spice of life, right? (speaker_00) we've gone with the intel arc a770. (speaker_00) i know, i know guys. (speaker_00) but compatibility has improved a lot (speaker_00) and it's got 16 gigs of gddr6 memory all to itself (speaker_00) instead of having to share with the cpu. (speaker_00) now, people are starting to catch on to this thing (speaker_00) and by the time this video comes out, (speaker_00) prices may have gone up a bit, (speaker_00) but we had an opportunity, so we seized it. (speaker_00) also, we kind of wanted an excuse to see (speaker_00) how far intel has come for ourselves (speaker_00) after a couple of years of driver updates. (speaker_00) it is worth acknowledging at this stage (speaker_00) that we could have gone with a 6700 xt (speaker_00) or a 3060 ti at this price, but... (speaker_00) let's game. (speaker_00) we're gonna assume you have some kind of peripherals to use, (speaker_00) so we didn't factor those into our budget. (speaker_00) but otherwise, what you're looking at (speaker_00) is an apples to apples comparison (speaker_00) between our ps5 and our ps5 killer. (speaker_00) we hope. (speaker_00) these fans don't work. (speaker_00) to kick things off, we're gonna be playing "doom eternal," (speaker_00) a game that runs at 120 fps on the playstation 5, albeit. (speaker_00) at a lower resolution scale. (speaker_00) so, we've set our pc to run at 4k, (speaker_00) but 68% resolution scale. (speaker_00) and i gotta tell you, this is not looking good. (speaker_00) not right. (speaker_00) dude, this is basically unplayable. (speaker_00) what kind of frame rate are you... (speaker_00) oh, wow. i'm hitting 120, baby. (speaker_00) something is wrong. (speaker_00) ah, there's your problem right there. (speaker_00) on the pc side... (speaker_00) you might have to do a little bit of configuration (speaker_00) with the most important one being (speaker_00) enabling above 4g decoding and resizable bar support. (speaker_00) particularly intel arc does not perform its best (speaker_00) without rebar enabled. (speaker_00) oh yeah, that is more like it. (speaker_00) oh yeah. (speaker_00) 1% lows of 110, 115 fps. (speaker_00) it is amazing what a difference. (speaker_00) just making sure everything is configure-molated properly can make. (speaker_00) dude, was this really 500 bucks though? yeah. (speaker_00) man, intel arc, not so bad after all, huh? (speaker_00) it's hard to do an apples to apples comparison here because the
image quality and the settings (speaker_00) menus are not necessarily directly comparable. but what david and i
can do is we can skip this (speaker_00) cut scene. - (speaker_00) and just, oh, i mean, that's interesting. (speaker_00) my field of view is so much wider than yours. (speaker_00) oh, i can change that. - ah. (speaker_00) ooh, i don't have hdr on though. (speaker_00) oh. let's turn that on. (speaker_00) okay, my screen's not pretty, but what about my playstation? (speaker_00) pretty frickin' nice. do you like my playstation? (speaker_00) i'm the wrong person to ask, i like this case. (speaker_00) okay, hold on, we're gonna figure this out, one second. (speaker_00) i can't think of anything more windows (speaker_00) than having hdr issues. (speaker_00) so a huge advantage of playing on my playstation, (speaker_00) if i plug in an hdr display, it's like, (speaker_00) "hey, let's calibrate, you're done." (speaker_00) i once had a computer that had such a bad hdr issue (speaker_00) that it was easier to reinstall windows (speaker_00) than to figure out the issue. (speaker_00) i'd call you a liar, but i believe you 100%. (speaker_00) i promise it's true. (speaker_00) the next thing we discovered is that hdr support (speaker_00) on intel arc is a little bit spotty. (speaker_00) it turns out amd and nvidia have proprietary implementations (speaker_00) for how the game calls for hdr to be enabled, (speaker_00) and intel, well. (speaker_00) it doesn't support them. (speaker_00) it uses the standard directx implementation. (speaker_00) so there's no denying that hdr is gonna look better (speaker_00) than sdr in any game that supports it. (speaker_00) that really pops. (speaker_00) however, now that we've got rebar enabled, (speaker_00) performance is looking pretty darn good. (speaker_00) and i'd say, who's got the edge (speaker_00) when it comes to image quality? (speaker_00) it's pretty close. (speaker_00) it's really close. (speaker_00) that when i look at this cluster of rocks, (speaker_00) the geometry and the detail and the textures (speaker_00) are looking, i think the textures (speaker_00) are a little bit better on this, (speaker_00) but the geometry detail is about the same. (speaker_00) okay, how's it feel though? (speaker_00) here we go. (speaker_00) the fact that i'm using an hdr display right now (speaker_00) and not getting an hdr image is a bit of a downer, (speaker_00) but most people do not have hdr displays. (speaker_00) i'm getting anywhere from 115 to 120 fps. (speaker_00) i don't have frame view open. (speaker_00) i should open that. (speaker_00) i had frame view open one of the previous times (speaker_00) before we were diagnosing the hdr thing. (speaker_00) and i'm getting 1% lows. (speaker_00) it's in the neighborhood of around 110, 115 fps. (speaker_00) it's really respectable. (speaker_00) here's something, (speaker_00) you've definitely got the edge in loading times. (speaker_00) yeah. (speaker_00) but with that said, (speaker_00) this is a lot of pc for the money. (speaker_00) it's pretty impressive. (speaker_00) i would not be surprised (speaker_00) if we managed to put together something like this (speaker_00) as a one-off. (speaker_00) you know, we negotiated everyone into the ground, (speaker_00) but the fact that we were able to find (speaker_00) with pretty good consistency, (speaker_00) parts like this available for this price, (speaker_00) it's pc gaming back. (speaker_00) oh, a hundred percent. (speaker_00) is the render scale at 100%? (speaker_00) yep. (speaker_00) so this is actually better image quality than a ps5 (speaker_00) because the ps5 will be'00p. (speaker_00) upscale to 4k. (speaker_00) and we're hitting 60. (speaker_00) i mean. (speaker_00) pretty respectable. (speaker_00) once again, i couldn't help noticing (speaker_00) this game looks a lot better in hdr though. (speaker_00) yeah, those colors look a lot more vibrant. (speaker_00) this is freaking smooth. (speaker_00) one of the big things that intel has struggled with (speaker_00) with arc is while their average frame rate might be good, (speaker_00) the 1% lows are 1% very low. (speaker_00) here, i'm not getting that kind of stutter. (speaker_00) this is a very, very smooth experience. (speaker_00) and what does that game run at in performance mode, 60? (speaker_00) 60. (speaker_00) yeah, okay. (speaker_00) it's not a perfect 60. (speaker_00) it'll drop from that frame rate once in a while, (speaker_00) but it's a little more steady than this pc one. (speaker_00) but with vrr, i think i would choose that extra sharpness. (speaker_00) i was kind of surprised every time i tried upscaling, (speaker_00) it lowered the performance. (speaker_00) so, let's go quality. that's 1440p, i think. (speaker_00) yeah. (speaker_00) my 1% lows are still the same. (speaker_00) given that, i probably wouldn't bother, (speaker_00) but this is my first experience with intel xcss (speaker_00) in quite a long time, and it looks really good. (speaker_00) yeah. does it look better than fsr? (speaker_00) hard to say, i'd have to look at it side by side, (speaker_00) but it's, i don't see anything obvious (speaker_00) that's jumping off the screen at me, (speaker_00) like, oh yeah, they're upscaling, it looks ugly. (speaker_00) even distant text, super sharp. (speaker_00) come on, pc, let's go! (speaker_00) oh, oh, oh my gosh, your video did load first. (speaker_00) oh! (speaker_00) let's see who makes it in-game first. (speaker_00) what? (speaker_00) oh, probably whoever developed the port. (speaker_00) oh. (speaker_00) wow, okay, that's not fair. (speaker_00) that's not fair, though. (speaker_00) that's true. (speaker_00) oh, wow. (speaker_00) what happened? (speaker_00) device driver humped. (speaker_00) what driver? (speaker_00) dude, i literally installed it today. (speaker_00) all right, 20-- (speaker_00) frames per second. (speaker_00) that's lower than it was before. (speaker_00) i also set it to 4k native. (speaker_00) oh yeah, don't do that. (speaker_00) okay, but hdr is working in this game. (speaker_00) hey, there we go. (speaker_00) i hope this is a 30 fps game on playstation. (speaker_00) hmm. (speaker_00) oh, no. (speaker_00) okay. (speaker_01) why is it crashing so much? (speaker_00) no, no, it's got this. (speaker_00) it's got this, i believe. (speaker_00) i believe it has the power of pc. (speaker_00) the power of pc compels you. (speaker_00) next game. (speaker_00) for god of war runs at 1440p on the ps5, (speaker_00) so we're doing some upscaling here, (speaker_00) but what we can't figure out is (speaker_00) what the heck is going on with hdr? (speaker_00) it's not in display, it's not in graphics. (speaker_00) oh, wait. (speaker_00) screen calibration, really, you guys? (speaker_00) i think this might be the first game. (speaker_00) that does look good. (speaker_00) new game? (speaker_00) yeah. (speaker_00) i read that the hdr on the pc version of god of war (speaker_00) is supposed to look a little better, (speaker_00) in spite of this being a generation older tv than this one. (speaker_00) it does. (speaker_00) i think it does actually look a little better. (speaker_00) how's the details and everything? (speaker_00) it's pretty similar. (speaker_00) i think it's a little less on pc. (speaker_00) oh. (speaker_00) this upscaling looks a little better (speaker_00) in the fine hairs of kratos's beard. (speaker_00) yep, it's a little softer there. (speaker_00) i gotta be looking for it, though. (speaker_00) at tv distance, i wouldn't notice. (speaker_00) it looks so similar, (speaker_00) other than that this one's a little more pop. (speaker_00) what's your fps? (speaker_00) 60. (speaker_00) me too. (speaker_00) let's go. (speaker_00) okay. (speaker_00) go. (speaker_01) yeah. (speaker_00) and go. (speaker_01) yeah, this is so satisfying. (speaker_01) and go. (speaker_01) yeah, get it, kratos? (speaker_00) and go. (speaker_00) crap, no, i messed up. (speaker_00) the last, most important one. (speaker_00) we're gonna have links, by the way, (speaker_00) to everything that we use down below. (speaker_00) and on that note, if you're buying on ebay, congratulations. (speaker_00) you've got great buyer protection. (speaker_00) so make sure that you use it (speaker_00) by testing everything that you buy before the. (speaker_00) turn windows up, run some stress tests, you know, (speaker_00) mem test for ram and cpu memory controller, (speaker_00) prime 95 for cpu compute, (speaker_00) firm art for your gpu, (speaker_00) and for extra credit, (speaker_00) push all the components at once, (speaker_00) which will help stress test your power supply. (speaker_00) on a related note, by the way, (speaker_00) marketplaces can have better pricing (speaker_00) because they don't charge the same seller fees, (speaker_00) but they don't have any buyer protection. (speaker_00) and unless people happen to be bros. (speaker_00) you are not getting your money back for faulty hardware. (speaker_00) that means that you always want to test the parts (speaker_00) before buying them. (speaker_00) and if the seller is being weird (speaker_00) about showing you the parts working, skip them. (speaker_00) just save yourself that die roll. (speaker_00) there's plenty of fish in the sea. (speaker_00) also, always visually inspect the commonly damaged areas (speaker_00) like the pins on a cpu or on a motherboard. (speaker_00) there's no denying the results though, david. (speaker_00) this is a little less sharp, (speaker_00) but i also think i have a little bit more headroom. (speaker_00) it's hard to compare 'cause this one's locked at 60. (speaker_01) i'd be curious to see if we unlocked it, (speaker_00) what kind of numbers we would hit. (speaker_00) but that's console, baby. (speaker_00) you get what you get. (speaker_00) this actually seems like a good time to bring up (speaker_00) that we casually didn't include a controller, (speaker_00) whereas for that $500 price point, (speaker_00) or even lower if you don't bother (speaker_00) with the disc version of the playstation 5, (speaker_00) you get one of the best controllers on the market, (speaker_00) arguably one of the best controllers like ever. (speaker_00) am i gonna get another one that has hdr working? (speaker_00) looks like it. (speaker_00) you know what? (speaker_00) that's smoother though. (speaker_00) that's, i was about to say. (speaker_00) yeah. (speaker_00) i'm pretty sure you're in 30 fps mode here (speaker_00) 'cause that looks a little, (speaker_00) that looks a little sharper though. (speaker_00) yeah. (speaker_00) i can really see it in the stray hairs here. (speaker_00) oh yeah. (speaker_00) to be clear, this is very playable. (speaker_00) this is not bad, but this is definitely a little sharper. (speaker_00) let me see what i can do to fix that up a bit over here. (speaker_00) in terms of settings, i'm running pretty much at ultra. (speaker_00) but what i haven't maxed out is my render scale, so i'm going to
try rendering at 80%. (speaker_00) rather than 70% of 4k. (speaker_00) the last of us is the kind of game that 30 fps is pretty acceptable
to me. (speaker_00) are there any crucifixes nearby? (speaker_00) because i think we're going to need one. (speaker_00) it's a cinematic game. (speaker_00) as long as i'm over 24, i'm fine. (speaker_00) look, ocarina of time, 20 frames a second. (speaker_00) greatest game of all time. (speaker_00) what can i say? (speaker_00) you've got the edge for image quality, i think. (speaker_00) these fine stray hairs are not quite looking as good. (speaker_00) i also wonder, you're set on ultra settings. (speaker_00) if maybe there's some shadow things we could bring down in some
kind of optimization that would help boost you back over the edge. (speaker_00) after some more playing around, we ended up needing 70% render
scale in order to get 30 fps consistently in last of us part 1. (speaker_00) it should be noted, we could absolutely hit higher frame rates if
we were willing to compromise on visual fidelity. (speaker_00) but that wasn't the point of this exercise. (speaker_00) the point of this exercise was to get an as-good or, in some cases, (speaker_00) maybe even better experience with the same budget. (speaker_00) and what did we spend overall? (speaker_00) we spent $475. (speaker_00) we got $25 of wiggle room. (speaker_00) right. (speaker_00) but we also conjured peripherals. (speaker_00) we didn't pay for a controller. (speaker_00) and realistically, we don't have a warranty on pretty much any of
our parts. (speaker_00) we also had to put in the time to source all this stuff and put it
together, (speaker_00) including the risk of running into broken hardware,
incompatibilities. (speaker_00) we had some games. (speaker_00) we had some games that, because of our choice of an intel arc gpu,
didn't run as well, (speaker_00) whether that's crashing or limited support for hdr. (speaker_00) so full credit to sony and microsoft for that matter. (speaker_00) this generation of consoles, i would say, has retained its better
value than a pc status for far longer than i anticipated. (speaker_00) and it may be another year, even two years, before we can beat them
with a brand new machine. (speaker_00) but i also think that credit to david, by the way, (speaker_00) for the adventurous, we've shown that it can. (speaker_00) and be done today. (speaker_00) if you're willing to get a little creative. (speaker_00) just like we're creatively telling you about our sponsor. (speaker_00) actually, we already did, but whatever. (speaker_00) seasonic, they deserve even more shout outs (speaker_00) just for being kind of awesome. (speaker_00) this ancient power supply guys was a champion (speaker_00) running this modern hardware. (speaker_00) and the way that seasonic stands behind their products (speaker_00) with long transferable warranties is admirable. (speaker_00) check out their new vertex lineup (speaker_00) featuring cybernetics performance certification, (speaker_00) quiet, efficient operation, (speaker_00) and a whopping 12 year warranty at the link down below.
