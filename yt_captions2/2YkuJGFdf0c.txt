he would send me these really demeaning berating emails at two o'clock in the morning i'd wake up in the morning and my stomach would feel like it's about to [music] turn [music] hey guys uh how's it going welcome back to the show today i want to talk about uh something that people don't often talk about which is um internship horror stories uh so everyone wants to talk about how great their internship is it's like you go on linkedin everybody is working at amazon facebook google and you're sitting here like okay i got this one internship and uh there's some really sketchy stuff going on here um why you know why am i the only one so i'm gonna share one of my stories i actually have quite a few stories here but i'm going to share one of my stories i talked about my first internship in a different episode and although it wasn't glamorous it got me my first software engineering job my first software engineering job i was really unsure of myself you know if somebody was to challenge me on something i wouldn't really push back because i didn't know what i didn't know when i when i first started working for him my first day he assigned 17 tasks to me 17 like basically just transferred everything the old intern had to me and so i thought all right well uh this is probably what i'll be working on for the term turns out it wasn't every single day i came in there was a new fire to put out but he also expected me to burn down the 17 tasks i was given on the first day so basically what would happen is i would finally finish one of those tasks and uh you know bump it down to 16 and then he would stack on two more and now it's up to 19. it felt like every time i took one step forward it was two steps back um and so he had this tendency to to be super unorganized and every day i would come in it would be a new task it would be like drop everything you're doing and do this right now but i'm still gonna hold you accountable for the things that you didn't have time to do so i ended up working uh until you know at least 8 p.m every single night 8 pm was actually early to go home sometimes i was there past midnight i didn't feel like it made me a better developer and i don't think it made me more productive there was times where you know you've just you're so burnt out because you've been at the office for remember one time it was thursday i i just got home and i looked at the clock and realized i'd worked a 50-hour week and it was only thursday there was just so much to do all the time and you know normally that's not the end of the world you know you have a lot of work to do you can do the work i remember he would send me these really demeaning burating emails at two o'clock in the morning and i always felt sick i'd wake up in the morning and my stomach would feel like it's about to turn and i would you know refresh my email just waiting to see an email from him that's telling me that i'm like a horrible developer and i'm you know like i'm hopeless and all this kind of stuff and this this is real this actually happened to me um one time in particular i thought was particularly like pretty bad was um he was working on a new feature but he wasn't quite sure if this feature would work or not he thought that you know if he merged it in it could break things in a major way but he didn't want to get blamed for it so he took all of his code he packaged it up in a zip file he emailed it to me had me unpack it on my computer and check it in to our code repository and the reason he did that was because if it passed he could say that he did it and if it failed he could show you know hey look this was the intern the intern screwed up um and and i think that was really and if that happened to me now i would stop and i'd be like come on really like you're not doing this to me but when you're an intern you think that your employer has all the power i think you have more power than you realize so i was under the impression you know i'll just i'll just put up with it because i'll eventually get out of this uh and if i if i just shut up and put my head down and do what he says and work you know 80 hours a week and you know let him berate me at emails at two o'clock in the morning then at the end of this i'll get a good rating and i can just move on with my life and um what ended up happening was i chatted with another manager there and the guy the other manager knew exactly the kind of person my manager was he he has seen it a million times before so i was good friends with that manager and he made sure that i got a good rating i got the second highest rating at the job had it been up to my manager i'm sure i would have gotten one of the lowest ratings now if i could go back and redo that entire thing again what would i do differently i think instead of offhandedly chatting with a different manager i would have gone directly to my boss's boss and said look there's something seriously wrong with this system because if you treat interns like this you'll get none of them returning for full time and none of them have returned for full time i wouldn't go back there to save my life i send people away from it every single time it comes up and it might not necessarily be a bad company in total it might just be that one manager but if one manager is representing the company like that to interns it's really important that the management know because they don't want that they want people coming back as interns uh they want interns coming back as full times so i if i could go back i'd go to my boss's boss and and be more sure of myself and tell him that directly i was pretty lucky that the manager i talked to was kind of already aware of my situation and made sure that i got a good rating in closing i just want to say like not every internship is fantastic and i'm sure you're not going to get one as bad as mine like that was a completely one-off case i've never seen anything kind of like quite like that but in closing i think i think you need to be really sure of yourself you know don't let people take advantage of you just because you're the intern and i i think if something's going wrong if something feels wrong it's probably wrong and what i would do is go to your boss's boss because while you're an intern you have a lot more leverage than you think you do because companies do want you to come back as full time i just wanted to share that story with you guys i wanted you guys to see you know every side there is to internships it's not all fantastic sometimes you get a bad one um i hope you never have to experience what i did but anyway that's all i have for today thank you guys so much for joining and i will see you in the next episode uh don't forget to like and subscribe to
