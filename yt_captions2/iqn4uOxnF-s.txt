foreign [music] foreign so today i'm actually working on a different app to the startup that i'm normally working on but i got this idea for these ai driven things that i want to build like i'm usually pretty good about like not jumping between like a million different ideas because that's usually like a stumbling block for a lot of people they keep jumping from project to project usually pretty good about not doing that but this idea that i got was too good to not build and it's reasonably easy to build as well and also i wanted to talk about just my daily routine in in general like now that i'm self-employed how do i stay productive like what do i actually do in a given day because it seems like people seem to be interested in that kind of stuff so we'll be talking about all of that also another exciting thing is today is my cheat day on my diet so you'll be seeing me eat something absolutely filthy i'm feeling a feeling pancakes what do you think but yeah welcome back to the vlog [music] thank you foreign [music] coffee first thing in the morning like pretty much everyone knows but then i learned from the human lab podcast it's actually not when you're supposed to drink coffee because when you wake up your cortisol level which like regulates your alertness is naturally gonna be very high so if you're drinking coffee which increases alertness is first of all gonna do nothing because you're already alert anyway and second of all it's gonna like mess up with your natural cortisol levels and things like that what you should be doing is delaying your first coffee like 90 to 120 minutes after you wake up so that is what i do is now around two hours after i woke it up and this is my first coffee and ah does it taste good [music] [music] where my app makes me a billionaire i'll have one of those now the one thing about being on a cut in dubai is that in case you don't know that's like it's trying to eat less to lose body fat there's so many restaurants so many of these amazing places where i would love to eat so i'm always just like waiting for my cheat day so i can have those filthy pancakes but the one thing about eating a massive plate of pancakes is that working after a massive cart meal is pretty damn difficult gonna do it anyway first if you are building an app of any kind almost certainly you are going to have to use email as part of your app in some kind of form the absolute best and easiest way for you to do that today is using a mail gun who are today's video sponsor so i've been using mail gun for a while now in a bunch of my apps the reason i like it so much is because it's just so incredibly easy to start using right just with these lines of code i'm able to send myself daily reminder emails about the daily habits that i wanna keep doing every day melcon is used by thousands of companies and leading brands like dhl wikipedia toast lyft and microsoft to send over 240 billion emails every single year they have world-class support features like send time optimization fake sign up prevention and much more that allows all of these companies to very easily deliver marketing campaign and keep track of their email list there's literally never been easier to start integrating email into your apps and if you're not doing that already you really are missing out so thank you for mail down for sponsoring this video go try melgon today using melga.com internetmancoder that's mailman.com internet made coder now back to building my app [music] foreign because i want to pretend that i'm healthy again after those pancakes but like in all seriousness people ask me like oh how i use those successful when you're so young and everything and like honestly it's gonna sound so cringe but like probably the biggest reason why i'm able to get so much done number one of course i really love what i do and everything like that but the reason why i'm able to work so hard and why i'm able to achieve so much honestly because i'm just very healthy i exercise every day and i eat healthy 80 of the time like it doesn't have to mean never eating unhealthy it doesn't mean that you have to forever quit sugar and things like that 80 of the time make sure you're eating healthy high quality nutritious food exercise regularly and your hormones are literally going to make you want to work like y'all especially if you're a male your testosterone levels are going to be high your dopamine levels are going to be constant you're gonna enjoy the act of doing hard work when you're just living a healthy lifestyle that's like like entrepreneurial advice by thomas for whatever that's worth like that is my number one thing [applause] [music] [music] thank you [music] foreign [music] people in this like entrepreneurial uh space on youtube will tell you that or you need to have this perfect routine like otherwise you can't succeed but like the thing that no one will tell you is that the only thing that really matters when it comes to like succeeding you just do the work you just do a couple of hours of work every day like guess what you will make progress entrepreneurial lesson by thomas number two listen to me eighty percent no like 95 of your results with entrepreneurship or anything really just depend on are you putting in a consistent effort every single day are you doing something every day to get towards your goals if you just do that if you just do work every single day it doesn't matter what your routine is it doesn't matter how you get the work done as long as you are staying healthy like i said before so you're not like destroying yourself and you're actually doing something to move towards your goals like if you're just doing that doesn't matter when you find a way to do it in a way that works for you you will make progress and you won't advanced religious succeed that is that is the hack to the entrepreneur daily routine um that no one will tell you you know of course i talk a lot about working and of course i work really hard during the day and of this at some point there comes this like sweet spot where trying to do more is like just not that effective anymore that is why right now i am on my probably my favorite time of the day it's like just a nice walk outside like an evening walk i usually go like the beach or around these like marina areas like look at the sunset listen to an audio book or sometimes just don't listen to anything and i just like try to get ideas i found out during my walks i get my best ideas like a lot of like why recently i've been very active on twitter so i get these thoughts and then i just share them on twitter and do my newsletter and things like this and i find that most of my video ideas and stuff just come through my walks this is just my favorite thing to do so that is what i'm doing now ending off the workday a nice thing when you walk foreign [music] [music] stuff it's great [music]
