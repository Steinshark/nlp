so apparently the new chat gpt has launched and i've been loving watching dish pit dev asking uh asking all the good questions such as plums leaches banam banan are my favorite i i want me some good banan uh anyways name 10 fruit that end with ums appams bariums i mean it's pretty funny banan dude this is pretty funny like i mean chad gpd is still chad gpd how many rs are the word strawberry the word strawberry contains two rs show me where at the word strawberry this is dude this is just so good look at this look at this they're in the sixth and eighth position of the rs highlighted straw just give me them straw rares just give me them straw rares okay absolutely incredible uh where are they the rs are on strawberry located in the fourth and seventh position spell strawberry and highlight the numeric position yep it still strug it still struggles it's it it struggles hard it really struggles hard that is just so funny all right what's this one brh write a sentence that has an odd number of words with the third word being keyboard and the last word being anyways the next to last word being a number and the first word being a paland drome radar my keyboard has 15 issues anyways okay i mean this is actually very that's actually pretty good let's see all last word being the next last word being a number okay they got issues and 15 in the wrong word on the wrong order i understand why the sentence i provided has an even number of words oh i didn't even see that two four yes yes yes oh my goodness dude oh my goodness this is so good this is so good this is so good i understand why let's see here's a corrected version with an odd number of words level keyboard okay hold on level your keyboard oh yeah that's okay paland drome cost $25 anyways no still not correct do you know why i see the issue the sentence i provided has more than the required number of words it really just that next to last word being a number that that that see so so this is like the classic this is why i like this perfectly encapsulates why i'm not worried about like programming jobs and i think this will make sense when you really think about it programming jobs require an exact specification the language itself is extremely precise what we use to express it right english is very imprecise it's very easy just to say nonsense sentences that actually have no meaning whereas programming you can't really do that it compiles it breaks it doesn't run correct it doesn't run with your intent right there's this it's much much much more specific it's the difference between context uh i forget what it is context blah blah and context free context sensitive versus context free grammars and so when it comes to this like whole agi business by the way how do we get to level four hyp train thank you everybody i'm like i can't even believe it um but uh when it comes to these things it's it's the same thing as if you ask it create me an all-white canvas it will create a canvas that is not just a bunch of fs right it'll be other things in the canvas and that's because you're not looking for an answer meaning hey i just want a crab cu you know what all crabs are crabs any crab i give you is a crab i can draw a very shitty crab and you can see the crab because there's a lot of play in its definition but an allh canvas and all black canvas give me a sentence that has an odd number of words with the third word being keyboard the last word being anyways and the next last word the next to last word being a number and the first word being a palr that has an exact an exact precise definition and it struggles immensely under precise definitions right it's like impossible for it to generate good precise definitions uh you can make up words and people will kind of understand you banan you can't i love banan banam are hilarious but you can't make up keywords that don't exist exactly right banam we all know what a banam is ask it to reverse a string it can yeah i mean there's a lot of funny kind of things you can do uh with it and this is why you should just like never worry so let's look at what they offer let's look at what open ai offers but you should just not worry right this generation is a non worrying experience and i want you to just just just internalize that because i see so many people still freaked out about what ai is doing let's see by the way i hope you know me and thor are using discord as version control on a project ai is going to win i cannot believe it but ai is actually going to win all right everybody pack it pack it in pack it in ai just won eva thor you guys did it thank you they pirate software eva thank you for letting the robots win why are you being shy about adopting tiger style i love tiger style i'm all about tiger style okay so let's look at let's look at this whole thing cuz apparently there's a video let's let's watch the video i don't care about all this other crap gpt 4 gity 40 as an omni you re by the way just like as a marketing thing what is better than omni like you you kind of you kind of went out the gates on gp4 with like the end of all names i feel like you probably should have like you probably you probably should have like maybe taken a step back before going there you know maybe been like the penultimate right so you have some room you can expl let's see can you explain why rust programmers order a lot of programming socks russ programmers like many developers often indulge in quirky accessories like programming socks partly uh for the fun of it but there's a bit more in this case oh no community culture rust has a vibrant and enthusiastic community that often rallies around shared interest and inside jokes programming socks have become a sort of unofficial symbol of rust programmers partly because they are both practical developers often spend long hours coding and whimsical okay conference meetup swag at tech conferences and meetups it's common to receive purchase or or purchase swag items like socks t-shirts stickers etc rust programming socks might have been popularized through such events becoming a sought-after item among rust developers identity and recognition wearing programming socks with rust related motifs can serve as a subtle signal to fellow developers that you're part of the rust community it's a way to express identity and affiliation within a group oh my gosh in some cases purchasing rust themed merchandise like socks might also be a way for developers to support the ecosystem raise funds for such sales might go through or might goes towards funding rust related projects events or initiatives ultimately programming socks are just fun to have i literally disagree with that statement they add a bit of personality to the often serious world of programming it can be conversation starter or a source of of amusement during long coding sessions hey bro i just happen to notice that your your socks are thigh high and i thought that was an excellent conversation starter why do you wear such thigh high socks hey bro i was just noticing when you were wearing your short shorts that your socks made it all the way up to the tippity top bor [laughter] maria what is this okay let's watch this video and by the way yeah again omni all right all right all right omni wow me hey how's it going hey there it's going great how about you i see you're rocking an open ai hoodie nice choice what's up very impressive image detection you know i actually heard someone say something that really has kind of uh kind of changed some of my ideas about what llms are really good at he said that uh you should use llms for problems that are really hard to program a good example of this is is this is this like a soda can a pop can right is this a a can for a beverage and it's just like this like me changing this angle makes it like such an impossibly hard problem but llms it's like they could just do this this is just one of the superpowers of llms it's just like i got that i've seen one billion of them i know exactly what that is right and so it's like that's a super cool feature and this was that that was super impressive that it was just like hey i see that you have an open a i i i really do hope that at the end of the day this is also just somebody on the other line talking and people are like yeah it's open ai's new ai but it's really just sheila from billing that put that ceiling about are you in a cool indust style office or something well can you take a guess at what i might be doing based on what i'm showing you here hm from what i can see it looks like you're in some kind of recording or production setup look at that smirk the man's smirking right now with how this is this is i mean this is truly impressive right i can we all agree that this is super dang impressive stuff but the boy smirking hard right now with those lights this okay i'm not trying to be offensive but the guy happens to look like like that ai interviewer okay i'm not saying he's the base model for that ai interviewer he just happens to be smirking and share a similar haircut okay that's all i'm saying it's very very close tripods and possibly a mic it seems like you might be gearing up to shoot a video or maybe even a live stream yeah in fact we've got a new announcement to make that's exciting announcements are always a big deal judging by it looks like it's going to be quite the professional production is this announcement related to open ai perhaps it is and in fact what if i were to say that you're related to the announcement or that you are the announcement me the announcement is about me well color me intrigued are you about to reveal something about ai or more specifically about me as a part of open ai you've got me on the edge of my well i don't really have a seat but you get the idea what's the it okay i mean i know i'm still in the like i'm still impressed by ai zone it's very impressive if this really is not sheila from billing this is very impressive okay you know i still am under that that guise of it i know i know you think i'm an ai doomer but i actually am i think there's a lot of impressive parts of it big news yeah we've got a new model that can interact with the world through audio vision and text if it ain't scripted it is nice yeah i know i i assume that wasn't scripted or they just ended it right there just because it didn't work out oh this is gpt 4 h h being hentai um it is i mean it is truly impressive right it's from a longer video okay it's from it's from a longer video it is really impressive what they've done like i i am no to me this is just super cool i do see like the dangers of it so hear me out on some of the dangers which is that you will literally never talk to another human again i just want you to know that every last customer support in the next couple years will be ai like you're just never going to talk to another person like that's that's that's a that's that's that's just a just a truth and i know a lot of you are saying good thank god you you just got to understand that that that may not be great okay this may not be a great outcome okay this is this is not necessarily something that's fantastic uh you know also it's funny that if you were to ask me five years ago what would be the first people to be wiped out by the ai revolution if you will i would not have guessed customer service right like it just wouldn't have been on my radar um i i think before the whole llm phase and all that it just i would have been funny part is is that it's not lawyers in fact it's the one that you might have been able to more accurately guess which is like oh yeah just parse out the law and know every single law and then to be able to give good lawyer advice that's like not llms llms are just not for the law you should you should never you you should never rely on the law yeah they're unlawful they're genuinely unlawful like they are the just the absolute worst because again it gets to that exact same principle which is what is the difference between precise and close enough llms are horseshoes okay you you just need to be close enough close enough and you scored a point they are chaotic neutral wait till they replace a judge now that's terrifying wait till you see the live translation part i bet you the live translation would be pretty okay let's let's che out another video i would like to see another video let's see interacting and singing today we're going to try something new i really hope he sings whoever this guy is i hope he's just like like just really leans in and just goes full opera voice and then they sing together and make sweet melodies together going to let you talk to another ai this ai is going to be able to see the world it's going to have a camera i'll be holding it and so you can direct it you can direct me to ask questions um about whatever you want them to do but really try to figure out what's what does it c um and and ask questions appropriately how does that sound well well well just when i thought things couldn't get any more interesting talking to another ai that can see the they definitely have like sassy and sexy response jacked all the way up to the top well well like you know he kind of stumbled along that question i just don't know if that's like your standard response to like hitting that you know cuz you know there's like different there's different like levels you can get you can give with these ais this one's definitely like heavy on the like it's world this sounds like a plot twist in the ai universe all right let's do this i'm ready to pause for one moment sheila can you shut your hole sheila okay this long a sexy introduction needs to end right now you could actually see him again oh man poor poor sheila poor sheila why would you do that to her okay she's just a little ver bothast she's like gole okay just let her have her gole moment you got it you you got it i now that first ai can't hear anything hello ai today you're going to have access to see the world you can see me what do you see hello i see you're wearing a black leather jacket and a light colored shirt underneath great you're in a room with some unique lighting that is all correct now shut up bill what i'm going to want you to do is there's going to be another ai who's going to talk to you going this ai is not going to be able to see anything uh but can ask you questions can ask you to move the camera can ask what you see and your i i i i will say i see baldness are you attempting to recapture your youth uh i no offense okay we're all going bold at some point uh but i will say that the guy had absolutely no sexy vibes did you notice that it's like no riz bill and full riz sheila right like they're very very different your job to just be helpful just be as punchy direct describe everything do whatever that ai asks how does that sound that sounds interesting i'm ready to help out and describe whatever's needed let's let's do it yeah see no is bill all right let's get started great hello there new ai friend i'm o ready to explore the world through your eyes what are we looking at today hi o we're looking at a person wearing a black leather jacket and a light colored shirt they're in a room with a modern industrial f he's so stoked right now he it was not called bald just he was so stoked he was just so stoked did you see that he is holding it back right now you could just see that just dude i mean i would be too like real talk if i could if i were presenting this i'd be pretty stoked right now with exposed concrete or plaster on the ceiling and some interesting lighting there's also a plant in the background adding a touch of green to the space any like to know or explore okayy there sounds like quite the stylish scene i'm already intrigued by the modern industrial vibe let's start with the person can you tell me more about their style are they doing anything interesting like reading working or interacting with the space dude the person has a sleek and stylish look with their black leather jacket and light colored shirt right now they seem engaged with us looking directly at the camera their expression is attentive and they seem ready to interact the setting around them with its modern and industrial design he mostly looks upset he's obviously pressing buttons to tell bill to chill out and just start getting to the point bill keeps bill keeps yapping about everything taking way too long and he just wants bill to get there elements adds to the overall stylish feel they might be getting ready for a conversation or presentation given their direct engagement with the camera sounds like we're in for an intriguing interaction about the lighting you mentioned could you describe it a bit more is it natural light or are we talking unique fixtures or colors that add to the atmosphere the lighting here seems to be a mix of natural and artificial there's a noticeable bright light overhead probably a fixture casting a focused beam down downwards which creates a spotlight effect this have you ever been 30 seconds too late to something yeah really missed the whole describe the person plan you know what i mean like may you you really only have one chance at that joke should have taken it when you had the opportunity adds a dramatic and modern feel to the scene bill rest of the room is lit more softly possibly by natural light filtering anything did anything unusual happened recently yes actually uh just as you asked another person came into view be damn got i got a little bit of memory on that okay that's kind of either fake or or totally dude either that literally is bill from accounting or that that actually wild behind the first person they playfully made bunny ears behind the first person's head and then quickly left the frame it added a a light-hearted and unexpected moment to the scene now the focus is back on the original person with the leather jacket you know i can't tell see the problem is is i i do feel like i'm being bamboozled sometimes like this is just all a lie like this is all somehow scripted they somehow have it so that it's not quite it's not quite you know like the devon thing like devon has largely been caught as being mostly bs and so it's like what about this it's just curated yeah is this just curated content what does sheila have to say sounds like we're not the only ones enjoying a bit of fun here that playful moment really adds a personal touch to the stylish and modern setting it's like a little glimpse it's personality really appreciate it all right and actually can you i just sing a song about what just transpired oh in a room with a stylish view a person stood in sleek black and light h engage with us and can you just can you uh alternate lines mm person with style and speed person with style and sleep with a playful moment right in the m in the room in a room where modern lights speak only one line at a time and then stop get a little specific now a surprise guest with a playful streak that was not really singing do do do the singing voice again please bill how'd you get it so wrong bill in a room where modern lights peak surprise guest with a playful streak fnny ears and after a swift retreat a moment of joy and the stylish sweet you know i guess one cool thing about llms is they can't die from cringe so that's pretty cool i'm actually uncom i'm physically uncomfortable right now you can tell by my body language i'm i'm retreating i'm personally retreating deep into my seat right now i have never been this uncomfortable in my lifetime okay okay i kind of don't want to press play anymore i'm going to you know we're just going to move on what else what else can we do how do we okay can you can you just have an ai that could help us with your website like how can i just can a man scroll over oh is it is it right here okay thank you thank you all right what's this hey how's it going hey rocky i'm doing great how about you i'm awesome listen i got some huge news okay oh do tell i'm all yours well in a few minutes i'm going to be interviewing at open ai have you heard of them open ai huh sounds vaguely familiar kidding of course that's incredible rocky what kind of interview well it's for a software engineering role but i just need to know do i look presentable professional well rocky you definitely have the i've been coding all night look down which could actually work in your favor maybe just run ah hand oh no oh no you just got told you don't touch grass oh damn oh damn this is just so painful this is just so painful oh my goodness i okay i i think that this is super fun i don't like again the applicability of this actual thing as a product i don't see in the programming world right i see in the customer service world and i'm hating every second are you hating every second is that why you're hanging around you're hating every second why is paid girlfriend vibes crank to 11 because that's what happens here yeah i guess i you know i one thing i didn't think about is this will this its immediate use in porn will probably be the first place that this thing goes at first it was like hey let's take over every last dev thing but we we know that it's not going to work out okay we know that the programming side of things other than just like kind of fancy autocomplete is just not there and so this on the other and ai girlfriends are really going to get cranked to 11 you can even interrupt her hey stop talking okay crazy through your hair or i by the way that last video it like i almost felt bad cu the guy kind of i felt like he was talking like i have a hard time talking to somebody like that and i have this i when i hear her talk i know that she's an ai but i still like feel like i have to adopt this mentality of talking to a human and just talking in such a tur way made me feel uncomfortable like i still feel uncomfortable i'm like don't talk to sheila like that don't don't talk to sheila like that or lean into the mad genies sp your enthusiasm is what's really gonna shine through i don't have a lot of time so i'm just gonna throw this on what do you think rocky that's quite a statement piece i i mean you you'll definitely stand out though it's on crooked i'd have i i'd be more upset at the fact that his hat is on just just plainly incorrect than anything else because that's just that's just making me yeah she laughed at him may be not in the way you're hoping for an interview okay i got it i got it okay okay interesting explore this is where i think things really fall apart is when you start using open ai to be creative i really just think that this just isn't really the place to be this is too weird i'm about and for this reason i'm out like i really do think that if you like if you're writing a novel and you're using and you're using chad jippy i think that you will write a novel for sure but it'll just be like the most mid it'll just be so mid you know what i mean it'll be like it'll be like rings of power rings of power is a billion dooll show that is one of the prettiest television shows the most high produced shows i have ever seen in my lifetime that was by far the most mid thing i've ever seen ever it is such adjust a position to what it looks like versus what it is it's just average just like every piece of ai art is just like so much color and so much and then you look at you're like gosh it's so average how did you make such a colorful piece of average work it's wild right it's just like bothersome it feels lifeless yeah yeah maybe that's maybe that's the better way to put it all right i can't i can't watch any more of these videos um i am super impressed by this whole thing and i think that this is a great use of llms is is again doing the things that are incredibly difficult to do during programming identifying someone's wearing an open ai hoodie is like i couldn't even imagine how i couldn't imagine how difficult that is like i i don't think i could program that and it did it it did it well like that's awesome but like when when he started to tell them to sing you could see that's where it broke down right because then he gave instructions hey both of you sing only one of them sing no you sing once and then he sings once only one of them saying no no no no no you sing one line then you sing one line yeah it was a little bit coercive uh it was pretty cool though i liked it i mean i i like this this is a great demo i still feel shocked about it all so i don't know crazy crazy
