in today's rapidly evolving tech landscape staying ahead of the curb is not just a matter of staying competitive it feels like well it's a matter of survival as we look towards 2024 it's crucial we identify and understand the tech trends that will shape the future of our businesses of our careers and our lives but before we explore the four key trends that are set to well revolutionize the way we work and live in the coming years let's take a moment to reflect on how tech have evolved over time i mean the best way to look ahead is to look in the past all right now that we've taken a look back at history let's look ahead at what's to come not only for the rest of the year but years though yes she's totally right we need to focus right now on the history of tech trends throughout history tech advancements have driven societal and economic changes i mean in the early 20th century the rise of mass production and the assembly line revolutionized manufacturing leading to increased efficiency and lower costs fast forward to the 1970s and 80s and we saw the emergence of personal computers i mean which was really incredible which democratized access to tech and really paved the way for the digital age fast forward a few more years we in the '90s and early 2000s now and the internet exploded onto the scene that would have never been connected otherwise i mean businesses across the globe grew and it gave way to these new industries that didn't exist before and also to new ways of working the advent of mobile devices and social media in the late 2000s and early 201 further transformed the way we communicate and consume information now let's go to today today we stand on the brink of what honestly feels like this new era this new tech innovation that has been occurring with ai i mean driven of course by ai machine learning and automation and these technologies are already beginning to reach shape industries and redefine what is possible their impact will only continue to grow in the years to come and that is why it is so important to really understand these tech trends all right let's get into [music] it all right now that we've taken some time to look back in history to understand where the trends have evolved how tech has evolved we can now confidently look forward and not only just for the rest of this year but years to come now trend number one oh and i know this is going to hurt some of your ears is ai code generation tools now hear me out these powerful tools are already automating tedious coding tasks they are promising to boost efficiency and productivity like never before not only are they promising that we are seeing it happen in action but here's the problem despite the potential of these tools and where they are headed almost 75% of businesses and employers are still considering bans on different ai tools like chat gpt so in this scenario then why is it so important to stay ahead of tech trends like ai code generation if so many companies are still not picking it up well for starters these tools have the power to dramatically i mean i don't even know where to start increase efficiency and productivity and also giving you as an early adopter a significant advantage over other competitors check the stat out an analysis of reviews in g2's ai chatbots category revealed that software developers make up the largest group of reviewers which back in 2023 accounted for over 25% and this really suggests that developers are already experiencing productivity boosts firsthand and are unlikely to give them up and yes although some of these tools maybe are seen as not widely adopted yet or companies are a little bit hesitant they aren't going anywhere they're getting increasingly better so being an early adopter and starting to use these tools whether you are a coder or whether you are on the business side but just getting familiar with them will become absolutely essential and this is a trend that is not going anywhere based on the data based on what we just spoke about it's going to continue to increase all right let's dive into some more security aspects one of the biggest areas you know take trends out of the equation for a sec here one of the biggest areas if you are looking to grow your career in tech or have a very stable career is within cyber security let me explain why economic factors and increasingly in inovative threat actor tactics are driving optimization and consolidation of security investments in 2024 companies are pouring money into security not to mention the roi on security it's something that companies feel very confident with they can see it's a critical metric for businesses and organizations now where does looking ahead with trends in security what does that really look like this is really interesting especially if we want to take ai into the mix here a lot of companies what they are doing is consolidating multiple security solutions into a single ai driven platform so users then can benefit from a unified approach to threat detection and prevention maybe your cyber security team can use one or two platforms over having to use so many different tools i think that's a trend overall is consolidating different tooling into bigger systems and this allows for security teams to monitor manage and have different security aspects all from a single dashboard this is really important in my op opin i mean tech is changing faster than it ever has it's evolving it's growing especially because of gen ai so having people who are willing to grow and learn on the security side is continuing to trend and that is where the companies will continue to put money into they need security there is nothing more important than security all right tech tr number three this is super interesting and it was one of you who actually shared this with me this prediction with me a while back and i was doing a lot of reading and research for this video and it kept on coming up and and i can't remember who it was but shout out to the person who got this next one right which is generative ai in ai ops so this third trend focuses on the integration of generative ai in ai ops software so what does this mean well ai ops combines the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning with the intricate demands of it infrastructure to optimize enhance and streamline it operations devops now we have ai ops okay but however here's the thing aiops comes with its own challenges i mean the need for userfriendly interfaces and learning how to use this new software in 2024 this year at least 80% of ai ops providers will use generative ai to reduce the difficult learning curve for these technologies and i mean these features can include tailored tutorials practice environments uh on demand assistance actionable feedback they are doing everything in their power to get you to get developers business people comfortable with using their ai ops tools and this is a big deal because by integrating gen ai capabilities with devops tooling the onboarding process for ai ops becomes obviously quicker but then more people are able to get into this industry and i think this mix of using ai now in devops is going to really but i don't even know what the word how we would i i was going to use the word revolutionize but maybe that seems too strong but really impact our workflows and what roles are needed within devops a lot of these ai ops i think will kind of force dev devops to shift a little bit slightly in different ways obviously not taking jobs but just shifting it it's very interesting ai ops coming in at number three okay for my last tech trend this is a few small tech trends that are solely just my opinion and thoughts i thought i would share some the other three were heavily researched datab backed uh tech trends but for this one i thought you know what let's just do some fun ones i'm going to share with you some of my predictions for tech trends that are already occurring obviously but will continue to be trending and i want to hear in the comments if you agree with me disagree there's no right or wrong these are just my candid thoughts the first one is we will see more uh ai based computer systems so we recently heard the announcement of microsoft's new co-pilot uh ai co-pilot plus story aip pc and that is sent to launch in june i think that will really start this whole competitive nature with integrating more ai into the base of these different computers i think apple will do something similar i i i think it's going to really follow soup for a lot of these companies and i think that so because it's really interesting i was at microsoft build actually and they were demoing this and it's really interesting they were playing a video game on this pc and you can literally just talk to the computer and it will help guide you while you are playing this video game now and you know you're using co-pilot to do do so and i was thinking this is perfect for a pair programmer now i mean gone are the days where you have to go on zoom and actually pair program with a human it's kind of wild so ai integrating into especially a lot of the big tech companies uh systems i think will become absolutely key the other thing i think we're going to see that's not trending yet but i do think we be trending very soon is paying for parts of the internet now here's what i mean by that we see that ai is now generating so much content which is great but i don't know about you often times i go to a website i see an image and i often think is that real my thoughts always now are is that real it's not so much more oh that's really interesting oh that's really cool but rather is that real or is that ai generated i think in the future we will see a world where we have a paid version of the internet which the goal being to maybe hold more of the source of truth and i use that word truth lightly because i mean it's the internet but doesn't have ai generated content on it as much i don't know how that would work but there has to be some kind of there has to be some kind of solution to this problem because right now we are seeing so much content that is ai generated and it's causing us to not believe well anything and it's good to be on guard but where is the line something with a paid system for the internet i believe will be a prediction or a trend in the future i think those are my two biggest ones ai integrated into a lot more hardware well software on hardware and also to two versions of the internet i'm curious to hear your thoughts do you agree with me disagree once again no right or wrong also i left down the next four video options that i want to create based on what you want to see so go leave down in the comments your vote for what topic you want me to cover next okay so i mean as we've seen tech trends have evolved rapidly over the past century i mean back to the beginning of this video where we were talking about looking back in history as to a lot of these big innovative um historical moments i mean from the rise of mass production to the emergence of the internet hi and mobile devices today we stand truly on the brink of an era of innovation driven by advancements in ai machine learning and automation now as we continue to look forward into 2024 2025 and onwards it's clear that these four trends that we have discussed ai code generation tools security investments the integration of gen ai in ai ops software or devops and the role of machine learning in centralized data security management these areas are some that i really wanted to highlight as key trends moving forward because they're not as commonly spoken about but they are really you know under the current making big waves is under the current is that a thing they're coming up quickly and quietly though so these are really important to keep an eye on keep an interest to because they will affect both you and i in our day-to-day jobs our day-to-day lives and so forth now to stay ahead of the curve it's essential we don't just understand these trends but also to take steps to incorporate them into our own strategies into our own learning processes and i mean by doing so we can unlock new levels of efficiency that sounds kind of cheesy but it's it's really true all right i need to end this on a positive note of let's embrace the future together i'm curious to hear what technologies are you most excited about leave down in the comments what tech trends in particular are you most excited about looking forward i mean obviously ai is huge but there's so much more to it than that that i really wanted to cover in today's video all right hit that subscribe button i'm going to go get more co maybe i don't need more coffee i'm going to go get more coffee thanks everyone bye [music]
