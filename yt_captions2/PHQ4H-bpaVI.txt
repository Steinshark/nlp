hi everyone welcome to today's video you might notice my background is different in this video on friday i moved house uh so i'm now kind of oh in a different spot this is my living room uh got the sofa and the guitars there's a mic stand over there she's been recording some stuff for my music channel plug plug plug cause [music] so it's been a very hectic weekend i've been obviously moving all of this stuff from one place to another which took absolutely ages but it's sunday evening now and i'm up and running again finally so today's video is how i did the wolverine claws effect so the first step as you can probably expect is to bring in the footage into blender so i'm going to go into the movie clip editor and open up the jpeg sequence from nuke hit set scene frames and prefetch which will load it into the ram and then basically what i'm going to be doing here is object tracking my hands and i'm not going to do a proper object track i'm just going to do one point and i put some tape on both of my hands so i could track them very easily i'm going to turn on normalize and turn up the pattern sizes slightly to something like 40 and 100 change this to a fine i'm going to press n to open up this menu on the side it goes to track and then under objects where it says camera just press the plus button and it will add an object track then very simply i'm going to hold ctrl and click which will add a tracking point and i'm just going to track this dot on my hand basically so ctrl shift t to track backwards it gets a bit lost there but that's before the claws will come out anyway and then let's go forward and track forward with control t gets to about here and then i guess we just have to probably do a little bit of hand tracking there's some frames where it's just so motion blurred and moving so quickly that it's impossible to do a decent track so i'm just going through frame by frame and just kind of tracking to the best of my ability with my eyes at this point here i kind of form a fist of my hand and it creates this kind of point of contrast where the shadows are on the inside of my fingers so i'm going to use that as a new tracking point to try and help the track a little bit i'm just doing a combination of kind of stepping through and tracking manually and then if there's bits of contrast on the hand i'll select those for a bit and track them once this one goes out the frame a couple of frames ahead don't need to worry about it anymore so probably about here i'll just stop tracking that one and then at the point where the claws need to come out i had another tracking point on this hand scale it down a little bit ctrl t to track forward and then at this point i'm walking out the frame so let's clear the points forward after that and that is our tracking done now what i'm going to do is turn these two tracks into empties and then i'll have a location for each of the hands in 3d space which will be really handy for tracking the claws on so i'm going to open up the 3d viewport i'm going to add a camera and then just kind of move it up a little bit so it's not on the floor then i'm going to select one of the tracking points go to the solve tab and then under geometry i'm going to click link empty to track and that is going to create this empty in 3d space which is linked to the camera and if i go into the camera view and just scale this down a bit we can bring in our background footage in the camera so there we go that's in the background now and you can see that this empty is sticking nicely to the hand so i'm going to name this uh right hand track and then we'll do the same thing for the other side so select it link empty to track which make it smaller so it's about that sort of size and then rename this to left-hand track then at this point in the last video like i showed i actually modeled the wolverine claws i'm not going to model them again in this video they're pretty simple to make so i'm going to bring them in from the last one but if you're interested then the project files of that are available on my patreon for a dollar so you can get the model of the clause so this is the model that i made it's very simple it's just obviously the three claws and they also took a 3d model of a person just cut it off with a hand and then kind of closed it into a fist and this is used as a hold out so that the claws kind of disappear when they go into the hand i just took the claw model and obviously duplicated it number two times and moved it into position and then i parented those claws to the bone which is uh the rig for the hand so obviously to do that select all three of the claws and then select the armature press control p and parent to bone and then it will stick to the hand and move wherever the hand moves and then to animate them coming out i used a driver so what i did is i created two shape keys for this example i'm just gonna do it on one so select the object go to the shape keys menu and then press add which will add the bass pose this is gonna be called out and then we want to add a second one and this is gonna be called in which is gonna be when the claws go into the hand then we wanna set the value to one which means whatever we do in a moment is going to be the pose for the in when the slider is at one and then once that's done go into edit mode select the claw and press g and then basically we're going to retract it into the hand something like this and if you go into wireframe mode you can kind of line it up so that the point is kind of coming out in the right direction and then if i slide this you can see that the claws now come out and then just to make the animation a little bit easier as you saw in the last video i created a slider to do it that's also really simple so first of all add a plane rotate it by 90 degrees in the x-axis i'm going to go into edit mode and delete the face so it's just the vertices and then i'm going to scale it down in the x-axis until it's more of a rectangle and then i'm going to move it up so that the origin point is at the bottom and then i'm going to add an empty and i'm going to use a circle for this and then just scale it down until it fits in here nicely then what we want to do is constrain this circle so that it can't move outside of this box that we've created so first of all i'm going to limit the locations on the x and y so it can only move in the z axis and you can see now if i hit g move my cursor around it can only go up and down but they can stick outside of the box so what we want to do is add a constraint onto this that's called limit location and then you can set the minimum and maximum amounts it can move in each axis so in this case we want to do the z axis we want the minimum to be zero because that's where it is now and then we want the max to be one i believe so let's try that yep one so as you can see once it hits the ceiling it can't go any further i'm just going to rename these so i'm going to call this circle claw control and i'm going to call the box claw domain and then i'm going to select the control and then select the box with shift and press ctrl p and parent the circle to the box and now wherever i move the box this will move as well you can see at the moment if i move the box too low then the circle gets stuck at the origin of the world so what we want to do is change the owner space to local in the constraint and that means wherever you move the box the bottom of it is still the zero location for the circle so now we have that the next step is to set a driver on the shape key so that we can control it by moving this up and down so if we select the claw again go to the shape keys menu on the value right click and go to add driver and then what we want to do is set the object to be the claw control so you can just search for it here claw control the type is going to be z location because it's moving up and down so z location and then the space is going to be local space because it wants to be based on the circle zones coordinates and now if i move the circle up and down you can see it can retract the claw which is exactly what we want then all you have to do is select this and press shift d to duplicate it a couple of times move them into position and then all three of them do the same thing so now that's that working i'm going to just kind of put this off screen so i have control of it but it's not going to be in the way and then we're going to line this up with the hand i'm just going to go into wireframe mode so i can see a little bit better something like that looks pretty good ignore the thumb that's just doing its own thing but the fingers are in the correct position i'm moving everything using the bone by the way that's because everything's parented to it so don't try and move the actual hand otherwise it'll break everything so then we want the bone to stick to the empty track so what we're going to do is add a constraint onto the hand bone so go to the bone constraints tab and we're going to add a child of constraint this is basically the bone version of parenting but this allows you to parent bones to objects outside of the armature so what we're going to do is set the target to be the left-hand track and now if i move through the timeline you can see the 3d model of the hand is roughly moving with the empty obviously it's not quite perfect at the moment because this is only a one-point track so we don't have any rotation or depth information this is just kind of moving around in basically in 2d but in 3d space so now comes the slightly fiddly part where you have to do some manual keyframing to rotate this into position as it moves throughout the scene so what i did for this is come down to the keying menu and turn on location and rotation and then what this means is whenever you hit i it will add a keyframe for both of those so we're adding a location and rotation keyframe and then i basically just go through and look for areas where it needs to be in a slightly different place move it and then hit i again a bit of a slow process took me about 20 minutes to do it for the actual video but it's pretty straightforward basically whenever you see it start to move off slightly you just need to rotate it back into place okay i've done it a little bit this is quite rough compared to last time just because this is the tutorial so once that feels like it's sticking nicely all you really have to do is do the animation now so we go to the point where the claws are meant to come out which is about here all you have to do is grab the circle that's just off screen hit i to add a location keyframe and then scrub a few frames forward where the claws are meant to be out and move the circle down and as you can see the claws come out then we hit i again to add a second keyframe and now the slider is animating the claws coming out of the hand and then the final step for this really is just setting up the holdout so when you're doing the render you basically want to set this hand object to be a holdout so it cuts out the claws when they go inside of it i've got the claws in their own collection already so what i'm going to do is now select the hand mesh and i'm going to press m and hit new collection and just call it hand hold out then on the hand hold out collection up here i'm going to right click and go to view layer and set hold out and if we go into rendered view now you can see the hand is invisible but where the geometry is intersecting with the claws is actually cutting it out here and if i go a little bit earlier on you can see as the claws retract into the hand they fully disappear so it looks like they're coming out my knuckles because they're actually retracting into the 3d geometry so when i rendered them i just rendered each of them on their own onto a transparent background obviously and then just overlaid them onto the footage of me in nuke i did a quick track on each of my hands to remove the bits of tape and that was the whole video and just to remind you this is what the final effect looks like so there we go that's how i did the wolverine claws it's actually a pretty straightforward effect a little bit of tracking a little bit of animation bit of compositing at the end and it's all done hope you guys enjoyed the video thanks very much for watching and i'll see you very soon [applause] [music]
