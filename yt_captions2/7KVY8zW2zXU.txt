super bass uh a spot sponsored by the way i got him got em super bass and uh in the way wait what uh snowflake is a data warehouse uh excuse me snowflake is a data warehouse little trigger right now little trigger i'm gonna have to i'm gonna i'm gonna have to take the the afternoon off and drink some chamomile after this ah let's see what uh i have no i've really never worked with aws i mean like i touch it every now and then but that's about it i've touched a little cloud flare i touch a little bit of i don't touch fly i o directly a little indirectly i haven't even heard of heroku in a long time oh i touched that one oh yeah baby you know i i i all these like i know of i just don't really want to touch them you know what i mean you know what i mean oracle does anyone still actually use oracle which web did you you know to this day people never people don't even realize that javascript this is literally owned by oracle did you know that that oracle scooped up the javascript twitter handle and they're currently following the devil's number amount of people i knew it i knew it i knew it and i knew it i knew oracle was the devil okay i just knew it and i i've just known it up here i feel like yelling five dollars a month okay let's keep on going uh which web frameworks and web technologies will i'm going to be using uh i definitely don't want to use angular angular uh angular now blazer blazer blazer's name is so lame and it's also microsoft c sharp it's lame okay then i could use it i could i i could use a lot i i could use a little bit of deno in my life it could be fun i know elm seems interesting people always talk about l what is elm uh blazers of awesome yeah blazer still sucks okay uh is htmx in here uh express that's a web technology i guess i i have worked with it fast if i i mean i fastified i don't really want to work with them jquery oh hell yeah i want to work with jquery next year hell yeah laravel hell yeah i want to work with both of those next

these things numpy numpy is just a technology uh i would like to first and foremost date that pandas and numpy are actually a library they're not a framework um no no no i really don't want to use any of these i mean i i'm gonna continue i want to get better at these two as well those are the only two useful ones all right uh song name i don't even know which developer tools for compiling building and testing have you done extensive development in ansible yeah baby i want to actually do more i actually want to reboot redo all my stuff and no build no bun i could do some fun this year cargo i mean do we want to keep doing rust i mean i don't know i don't know if i want to get uh rusted you know what i mean i'm gonna leave you one shaq's rust okay c make definitely don't want to do i've touched a bunch of cmake recently i don't want to do that anymore docker i like docker i even know her you know what i mean i could definitely do that llvm's clang no thank you make no thank you i see make okay gradle gradle these nuts dude is gradle not the worst thing in the universe i swear pnpm i guess i'm using it now these days npm yeah kind of um q make unit unreal engine that'd be fun webpack these nuts yeah don't know anything about that vite no yarn i think i want to go back to yarn honestly uh you forgot uh forgot uh zig right you forgot zig not even zigging okay not even zigging which development environments do you use adam wait people still have adam on here people still have adam on here what if you're still using adam i want you to take a second i want you to go sit down by yourself and i want you to think about the life you're currently living okay think about it okay ridiculous uh everybody knows neovan neovan baby let's go get the hell out of here the rest of you i don't even want to vote on you vim i'll give you some love too vim um uh the rest can suck it the rest can just absolutely chortle you know what i want them to chortle okay we're gonna chortle i've never heard this one so let's not do this one i don't know if it's gonna be any good vs code uh we see you using yeah i don't use no vs code let's see what operating system i literally have used a singular operating system which is ubuntu i guess pop os as well right do they have pop os they don't have pop os but i'm not sure which one's which you know what i mean um pop uh pop os right or it's pop os i don't know how is that how you do it ipad os yeah there's ipad os haven't you heard of ipad os yeah ipad os it's a very popular one people use it all the time pop os arch by the way uh no i have kids uh i have kids so i use pop os which collaborative work management and or code documentation tool did you use regularly oh let's see okay definitely not checking i want to use that again markdown file hell yeah girl um read read mine what yep that's about it i i guess i use trello ugh discord let's go d gently just let's go um i guess i use google meet because yeah i have to slack because i have to i use zoom every now and then because people like you'll make these meetings outside of work and they're just like here's my zoom link and you're just like i hate you i want you to know that now i hate you uh let's see what ai power tools do you use i don't use ai power tools currently oh actually no i've been using copilot these days um and there's no co-pilot uh co-pilot what up co-pilot all right what ai power developer tools do you use copilot i like copilot i have used tab9 it was okay all right the section will focus on ai and sentiment oh this is boring our official intelligent tools gained prominence bob to the blah blah blah for your response consider the sorts of improvements experience with stack overflow not present absence blah blah blah blah what is your opinion on stack overflow using ai tools to improve current experience i think that the tools currently uh on stack overflow make the experience amazing the fact that they can still live in their mother's basement and yet provide such beautiful feedback makes me realize i have so much potential left one day i hope to be as intelligent as these ai tool bags bam and post let's see uh tell them about the dicks no thank you i'll i'm gonna save that one for the end you don't just slip the dick in right away okay you gotta you gotta wait a little bit okay uh do you let's see do you use ai tools yes i do use copilot how's your lindsay stance on ai tools um it's pretty unfavorable i find it mostly ai tools uh no uh let's see let's see for ai tools that you use as part of your development what are the most important benefits you are hoping to achieve uh boiler just boilerplate completion and creating new and exciting bugs it's pretty much what i do every time i use it it's new it's exciting and i can't believe it happened uh how much accurate trust actually oh highly distrust highly which part of your development workflow are you using ai tools for and which are you interested uh okay so let's see project plan project planning learning about a code base i'm interested in doing that i'm very interested in doing that documenting code i think i'm very interesting and interested in that debugging could be cool testing no committing or new oh i could be interested in that if it could give me a code review and point out where potential bugs could exist i would love that i would love that deploying and monitoring no no no no no no no no next oh did you hear that lightning that's some strong lightning out there please describe how you would expect your workflow to be different if at all in one year as a result of ai i assume the eligma engine will achieve a top performance metrics thus allowing a maximum penetration of i'm not sure which one to do i'm i'm stuck i don't want to do these nuts or dicks it's too obvious okay maximum check pen uh by allowing maximum maximum testing not only of head but the entire shaft next and mute all right education working career this section focuses on education working career okay next uh let's see what is the best describes your level of formal education i have a bachelor's degree and an uncompleted master's degree uh how did you learn how to code um colleagues friends or family uh other online resources school staring at other people's code that's literally how it's like in any education how many years have you been coding in total oh any education about 20 years about 20 years not including education how many years have you coded professionally as part of your work i guess 12 or actually more like 14 because i started midway through college and then did it pretty much full time there you go the best on the interest you should add that what am i adding back of layers uncompleted which of the following describes your current res let's see i do research uh where's where's the word research scientists i'm definitely a scientist uh research and development role oh gosh tools is there like a is there a tools is there is there a dev tools developer tools developer experience i mean i guess that is kind of an experience of the developers it's kind of like a i don't even know a research and development role i guess sort of i kind of maybe this survey yeah this survey is in an infinite loop we're getting places that's good let's see okay approximately how many people buy the company or organization you currently work for oh probably about that much just to guess what level of influence do you personally have at new uh technology purchases at your organization i mean i buy whatever computer i want and whatever i want to use i guess i have a great deal when we wanted to use epic games telemetry i was just like make it happen number one and boom got it and that thing was like really expensive so yeah i think that works great deal right uh when thinking about new technology purchases at your organization are you more likely uh to be given a short list uh other or investigate i investigate uh when buying a new tool or software how do you discover research available um where is the companies that no rate no no no no no no no no no there we go this one this one and this one email the devs after that company that's how you do it where do you live united states united states of america what currency do you use on day to day uh america u.s deep fine i was hoping that there'd be an american ease dollars uh getting personal now yeah what is your current annual compensation uh please enter a whole number damn you already know what we're gonna do you know what we're gonna do baby boys okay you know we're gonna do the section will focus on stack overflow usage and community questions okay most questions in this section are optional required okay what of the following stackover flights uh have you uh visited boom do you yes i do how frequently would you participate in q a on stack overflow yeah i guess i haven't done it in a decade uh do you consider yourself not at all no no no no no no on one of the previous pulse surveys we saw that people valued being productive and having growth opportunities at work by adding professional developer series to the survey we want a better understand would you like to participate no i don't there we go how do you feel about the length of the survey this year too short they need more questions how let's see how difficult was this complete very difficult there you go everybody that's how you successfully take a survey okay you shill a little bit make a dick's joke hit him with some confusing information but mostly true see here's the deals what people don't realize is that if you want to supplant some really confusing stuff you gotta mostly answer correct and then only then do you lie just a little bit clearly the only thing i lied about was my dick length because i still can't measure my dick and bites thanks stack overflow okay if you just let me measure my dick and bites i could do that the name is the primogen
