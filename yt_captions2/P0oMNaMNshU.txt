ladies and gentlemen some of you have been chess fans for many years some of you have been chess fans since 2020. some of you have been chess fans since 2023 but you know when something incredible happens in some sport and you understand nothing about it but you can still appreciate the highlight that is the purpose of today's video all right buckle up we're going to romania some of you are in romania right now the romanian chess championship is going on and it featured a banger of a game including a forced checkmate sequence that took 38 moves i've never seen something like that force mate in 38 moves let's check it out all right our protagonists are gergeli andras gulshabo and uh god god help me romanians your names brolic all right don't even get me started my name is four letters the game begins with e4 uh why does a grand master rated 2514 black is a feta master rated 2280 and it's a carl khan advanced variation now obviously there are two lines here i recommend c5 in my karo concourse available at uh no stop it's in the description though if you'd like to check it out i like c5 but bishop f5 is the main line um bishop 5 is the main line at many many levels and there's a lot of lines here for white white can play knight f3 e6 bishop e2 this is known as the short variation and there are many lines here for black uh white can also play various positional lines or white can play what is in my e4 course available at h4 the tall variation named after mikhail tal and the idea in and of itself is to trap this bishop bishop e4 f3 bishop g6 and h5 that is the idea that is why you play the move h4 you also play the move h4 because you'd like to create a big attack on this side of the board at some point in the future and black plays h5 which is the most popular move however the move h5 does grant white various dark square possibilities white plays bishop d3 the main line take take queen a5 check and now knight to d2 black now plays e6 because if black doesn't play e6 white will play e6 and it will be very very difficult to uh deal with uh the position there so black plays e6 now this position has been reached many times in fact it's been reached so many times and black actually scores like 60 so black has equalized in this position like position they know what they're doing by the way has anybody noticed that the clocks haven't changed they're supposed to but they're not changing so that's yikes chesscom well i'm gonna hide the clocks then because seems like they're not useful for today's video anyway this was a 90 minute game but clearly their time has been running all right all right all right just come you don't want to have the clocks working no problem knight f3 knight h6 castles knight f5 and this is the entire idea of the black opening black now has excellent control of light squares beautiful light squared structure and white now plays c4 so white is trying to attack the integrity of the black position black plays bishop e7 attacking the opponent h4 and white plays g3 defending the opponent h4 black castles white plays b3 two ideas behind b3 develop the bishop support the center support the pawn uh you'll notice that the computer hates the move b3 like before that it was like mad sequel then you play b3 suddenly the computer's like wait a minute i think black is better uh yeah i mean in the early stage of this game black was doing everything right in fact black was extremely well prepared like this is the thing about being 2300 at chess in 2023 uh your openings i mean black has a better understanding of this opening than the person playing with white and the person playing with white is a grand master here's the problem just because you get a better position in the opening doesn't guarantee you any results right like you guys know that you get a course you watch a video you get a plus five position then you hang made in one that's not the opening's fault it's your fault so black plays c5 which is the entire idea behind everything black is doing black also wants to put the knight here blow up the center of the board very tough position white plays dc not a good move not a good move it's minus 1.6 uh and now black needed to go here which is a pretty natural recapture but like decided to take with the queen also understandable uh the computer really liked black's position after bishop c5 knight f1 and knight f1 is inviting certain problems because if you play d-take c4 the queen is hit and the queen can't take the bishop the rook because it's defended by the bishop and the queen can't take that because nobody guards the rook but that was his idea you see folks no brilliant chess game comes without risk no brilliant chess game comes without the potential of blowing up the kitchen you don't make something delicious without threatening to set your kitchen on fire that's absolutely not true by the way that is a dog water analogy however my point stands and mr sabo shabo sacrifices his queen to lure the black king out to the edge of the board however it's still a very very complicated position and there is no checkmate in 38 moves just yet why would there be that would make way too short of a youtube video and i would only be able to put like one mid-roll advertisement in it no we are going to watch for about 10 more minutes knight to e3 played alright the idea of knight to e3 is to of course remove the only remaining active black piece and apparently black is not lost here i can't really understand that because black can't move any pieces but apparently that's what the computer says apparently it has to do with the c pawn all right the only reason that black is not lost is because the c pawn is such a big asset 93 played black plays queen a5 indeed attacking the rook in the corner now white plays knight to g5 check and the king comes out and everything's fine i mean it looks scary but there's no threats knight g2 look at this move queen d8 is not possible because if you take it i go check king here and check and i win the queen back oh my knight g2 and the crazy thing about knight g2 it stops queen e1 and it threatens knight f4 anyway but black now finds knight takes g3 and the idea is that if you take this now i can take this because when you check me i don't need to go here i can walk oh my god i can see the king walking out i walk a lonely road the only road that i i feel like half of you don't even know who green day is because you're like 12 years old um so knight takes g3 and it looks like the fm is gonna pull up the spectacular upset against grandmaster shabo in the romanian championship except you activated his trap card knight f4 check the king walks out and now knight what the okay so the king is on f5 the night is guarding the rook queenie one check is possible but it loses because of this and there's no mate the king is completely saved the knight blocks so queen e1 does not work what is happening the only move here for black apparently is to sack the knight voluntarily and then play queen e1 and then take instead of that black plays queen c3 which also makes sense attacking the rook and then threatening to take the rook and then take the bishop as well so many arrows so many arrows right now why seeing queen c3 and a hanging rook and a hanging bishop potentially plays king g2 this dude moves his freaking king he doesn't even care he's like my rook is hanging but here's the thing if i go here he gonna keep harassing me there might be a chance we repeat moves right and his king is still kind of close to my king i might get maiden so king g2 go ahead and take my rook but guess what you can't take my rook because if you take my rook i have knight d6 check king e5 knight c4 check king f5 back rook fa check king g4 f3 and yeah yeah get made it on the edge of the board bang boom so that doesn't work so 94 by black played instead of taking the rook rook f8 threatens something on f5 and now in this position black had to find the absolutely scumbag move knight c6 the idea of knight c6 is that you give up a full rook to get rid of the blockade and try to win this game but also knight c6 double check king g4 and you're safe and if knight h6 double check king e5 knight f7 and it's a repetition of moves king f5 knight h6 you had to find knight c6 one of the only ideas in the position because if you don't and instead you play king to g4 do you see the bar go sky high the reason for that is now the move knight h6 is winning it's mate knight h6 is made in seven moves the idea being king h4 knight g6 made and if knight h6 here black has 93 that's not even a check it's not even a check the point of knight d3 is rook f4 is now made oh my god oh my god 93 is not even a check and you can't even stop mate if you play king h4 it just delays the inevitable you know how bishop takes so that rook at 4 is made again oh my god i mean you this this is so ridiculous and you know what i mean you guys are probably enjoying yourselves right now but there's some like two percent of you watching are like why is he yelling he only appeals to zoomers who need a dopamine fix that's what they say about you that's what the haters say about this channel i yell too much and you're just a zoomer that needs a dopamine fix and you know what we say to those people they're probably just mad because they got checkmated like this before folks in this position he missed that and he went bishop e3 instead and the game continued knight takes f2 sacrificing the knight in front of the white king now knight to d5 giving up the rook in the corner did you see that stockfish didn't even realize that this was winning after knight to d5 knight to d5 wins this game but how how does knight d5 win the game i don't understand what so what should black have done instead looks like it was all losing but after 95 queen a1 may i present to you forced checkmate in 38 moves probably sitting there like what does that even mean that means the guy's got a vote no force checkmate in 38 moves all together 19 technic i know we got some chess elitist peers were like well technically i'm moving chess is one for white and one for black 38 ply meaning white moves black moves white moves black moves white move 38 moves are you ready buckle up knight to h6 check white is down eight points of material growing on even more than that knight h6 if you take rook f4 main so king takes h4 now bishop f2 only legal move king to g5 you go back are we repeating moves no because now that the pawn is gone rook f4 rook f4 king chief double j check and mate so instead of that king to g6 now 97 king only move age seven knight f7 threatening rook h8 mate one of the moves in this four sequence is not even a check it's not even a check the point is that black can give a check but white just runs including those moves rook haida's game over black needs to play knight c6 sacrificing the rook the most insane thing is if you take the rook i take this i take this and i win i win what so what is the sequence knight f7 knight c6 where is the win the win is knight g5 okay king h6 and in the game they repeated moves so that that actually made it a little longer than necessary so here they actually repeated moves once they do that so that they get more time on the 40th move just to think that move doesn't count for the sequence so the win is knight g5 king h6 and then knight e6 taking the pawn king goes back knight goes back king goes back why did you need to take this pawn so that the other knight gives a check king g6 and now that knight can go to h4 king h6 now the other night goes to f7 the king goes back they repeat moves one time and now i take the rook so just so you understand those repetitions were not counted right so if you go through the whole sequence of moves white repeated moves a couple of times that was to get a little bit more time on the clock that is not necessary rook a8 and now it makes no difference what you do here you can give me a check i'm just gonna move my king rook hate his mate there is like a million different mates in this position but the game ends in style the game ends in the only way imaginable that a game like this can end the game ends as follows pawn to g6 which stops rook h8 but little did black no rook g8 and now this is me knight takes e5 defends g6 so instead of rook takes g6 in this position white played rook takes g6 and black resigned because if you take knight f5 mate have you ever seen a mate like that knights hitting both king escape squares bishop defending the knight the king boxed in by his own team they betrayed the king and got him smothered to death in the corner of the board as the queen stands idly on the other side unable to partake in neither the attack nor the defense of the black king have you what the instant replay can we just what on earth was that game it was a fist fight it was two heavyweights with no technique on three beers throwing punches at one another knight f2 knight d5 queen a1 this man this dude really said knight h6 king h4 bishop f2 king g5 bishop e3 king g6 97 knight king h7 knight f7 knight c6 and then hit suk on e6 he played knight g5 knight f5 knight h4 king h6 and then he took the rook and then he went here and then he did this this was filthy absolutely i mean oh my god what was this game 19 moves in a row for white 38 moves total take about i wish he got up and took about i mean i don't even like what do you what do you even want me to say really like just what get out of here
