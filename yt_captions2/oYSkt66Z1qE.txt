ladies and gentlemen welcome back to t steel chess 2024 this is the first major event of the year and this is round number eight out of 13 every single round continues to deliver we are getting insane results left and right we are getting upsets we are getting storylines we are getting close races for first place finishes and that is even in the absence of the top three chess players currently ranked uh in the world and in today's video one of the biggest de velopments is regarding the current world champion of chess that is of course ding len and uh this whole recap is going to have crazy games the last game has some of the most gangster moves i've ever seen let's just jump right into it um yeah here we go oli resa fuja versus dingl ren i mean in this event you can play seven games against killers and your eighth round is against the world champion or look at it in reverse your eighth round is against the young prodigy who is formerly rated 2,800 ali resa play plays d4 oliv russ has also had a little bit of an up and down event he's lost to j and june yesterday he lost a game as well that was divided gui dingly ran is currently on an equal scor and from the opening dingly ran opts to kill the game uh this semi- tage variation is very forcing and basically opts to neutralize white completely ali resa says e3 thinks a little while keeps the position symmetrical and this is our position after five moves they're basically copying each other ali resa plays a3 the idea of a3 is to take on c5 and then push your b pawn threaten the bishop the bishop can go to like a7 and then white goes here and we create just a slight imbalance of the position instead of that dingl ren goes here and then he does the exact same thing to ali resa now here al resa plays this move uh not not there he plays queen c2 now there have been many things played here normally they involve castling and pushing these pawns forward uh d5 is a little bit too early because after pawn takes knight takes d5 there's bishop to e6 and black develops very quickly white doesn't have any tactics al there resa plays queen c2 which looks brain dead queen c2 removes a defender of the pawn and in fact just seems like it's going to lose the pawn completely like that move doesn't make any sense now ding takes but you'll notice he spends 17 minutes which means that queen c2 comes as a sort of homebaked preparation or maybe home sauteed or flambeed or toasted or broiled or take out i don't know but i i i don't know if it's home baked queen c2 though is a crazy idea ding takes and for whatever reason he does not take again he plays bishop to b7 okay obviously there was a point i think the point is that after knight takes d4 queen takes d4 white actually has knight d5 which is insane clearing queen c6 out which would win a rook and yet you could actually do that you could actually do all of this you can play knight takes d5 queen c6 king e7 queen a8 knight e3 queen a7 check king e8 queen e3 queen e3 f3 bishop d6 and apparently black is equal but i don't know why anybody would voluntarily have a rook for a bishop like i i i don't know like nobody is stockfish so that's apparently the idea bishop b7 played instead now all res is like ha old man you didn't want my dwn well now you're going to have to take it you're going to have to take it even though you protected three times this is nuts aliv resa introduces a fascinating idea where he's like all right ding here you go but it's like choking on a fishbone right now i'm going to go bishop g5 i'm pinning you i got rook d1 on the way or long castle and rook is coming here as well so white gets very quick development here ding is on the back foot all right bishop to e7 rook d1 by ali resa every piece is getting a turn to play ding plays d4 and this is too forcing instead of d4 ding should just castle and accept the fact that he will lose this pawn and it will come with some headaches but he shouldn't try to keep it on the board because after d4 ali resa just castles and the opening of this bishop could prove to be fatal d4 castles castles you can't take the knight because of the pin on the queen rookie one every piece aliv resa has is in the game both rooks both bishops both knights and the queen as well the queen has also got eyes over there and it's really got eyes over there because after ding plays b4 ding spends 24 minutes on b4 trying to really force this issue look at this subtle idea bishop b1 bruce lee style and now we have nasty intentions we're going to take the night we've got a sniper of a queen neither pawn can take the knight look at this position this is nuts the knight can't be taken because you're going to play bishop f6 queen h7 so now ding has to go g6 and now ali resa shows all of his ideas in a position it's very rare in chess to have every piece playing he's got all seven pieces on the board and they're all doing something and now ali reza sacrifices the rook rook takes e7 and the entire integrity of the black position is called into question you cannot take with the queen even though you would be defending your knight because i'll i'll go here and that's it it's a knockout you have to sacrif ice your queen and then knight e7 and then i'll play like queen c5 and yeah i mean bishop knight bishop knight rook rook but at the end of the day aliv resa position is too powerful so instead of that what ding does is he takes with the knight the idea is that the knight here is still hanging well now ali resa plays rook d4 and simply moves the knight to the e4 square now in this position ding actually blunders with his queen hanging he should have abandoned all of this right away and played queen e8 apparently or he can play knight f d5 which is a demon move opening up two separate pins to your position but then the computer plays queen b6 and claims black can survive but in all of these complications den kind of plays queen c7 absent you know a little bit absent mindly just like all right i'm pitting the knight here and ali resa will probably take back and ali resa just plays knight e4 and the point of knight e4 is the queen see each other and knight takes f6 as a check so ding takes but when the dust settles alira has bishop and knight for a rook so for whatever reason you know ding plays queen c7 but he could have went here and lost nothing knight takes d5 bishop takes d5 bishop e7 queen e7 rook d5 is also two pieces for a rook but then black has very strong counterplay on on white's back rank and uh you've also got counterplay here but ding plays queen c7 and when it's all said and done he's it's just two pieces for the rook and white is completely winning rook c8 knight g4 back the bishop is hanging right you can play rook c2 but then bishop f6 and knight h6 is mate so ding has to go here aliva centralizes he just has to not get back rank mated he's defending himself now he can't get back rank m and ali resa simply has two pieces he has two bishops for a rook two bishops for a rook is a winning advantage and now he's simply up a piece so the dust clears this rook is completely stuck ding tries to go here rook f2 is a desperado sacrifice bishop h6 is also a desperado sacrifice with a check cu you were going to win the rook anyway and uh do the math white just has an extra piece he advances he's going to get to the pawn that's it this is just a winning end game one guy has a bishop the other guy doesn't it's pretty simple mathematics and dingly ren resigns because he's going to lose both pawns and then this pawn is going to promote this is insane ali resa absolutely demolishes the world champ in a crazy tactical position with a savage opening idea queen c2 and then d5 and he just gets all his pieces into the game this is vintage ali resa i mean vintage he's 20 years old everything he does is vintage like look at this bishop b1 what an incredible attacking concept and ding just defended inaccurately and loses the second game ding has as many points he has three and a half points he has as many points as the women's world champion j and june but he's 2780 and she's 2550 and they got the same score she's really overperforming and he he he's having a rough event i got some more games for you though yanomi versus nock abdu sator of this game was crazy this was actually a master class of a game then i will show you hans nean then i will show you mark andrea maritti versus salm salah in the challenger section we have the match up of the two young women as well deshmuk versus rubers and then this game was bananas yanish no abdor this is an italian a russian and an usc man travel to the netherlands to play an italian game chess is just so beautifully global isn't it bishop e7 none of this matters nepo plays like this he plays a very odd italian game they trade and then basically yan just has light squared control right black has a lot of pawns on the dark squares pretty anti- positional type of game but we're far away from any big decisions now look at this fascinating idea bishop to d2 the idea is actually very simple after knight a5 yan wants to give away his bishop then he wants to come back with the rook to a2 because maybe you will double right not not a1 both guys still in their prep queen c7 and now knight c3 both guys still in their prep a5 seizing a little bit more control queen e2 is the first move kind of out of book knight d7 and now we are we are truly thinking on our own we have b3 andon creates this nice structure not allowing that pawn forward he's got good ideas over there black cannot play d5 the major question is will black play f5 if black doesn't play f5 black has zero pawn breaks and again the bishop is the problem for black because black has so many pawns on dark squares knight c5 yan very simple knight a4 let's trade knights he says no now this is a genius move by yanomi in this position yanomi plays c5 it's a brilliant idea it deserves a brilliant move the computer doesn't even fully understand that that's just a lost pawn dc but by breaking black's pawns apart like this black now has zero mobility and you will never be able to use a d or a b pawn because you don't have them so this is going to go here i will apply pressure for the rest of the game your structure is dead black is almost already completely positionally lost knight to d4 queen d3 watch this master class rookie rook a1 black has no moves and slowly as the game is going to progress black's evaluation is going to go more and more in white's favor the not not the black's evaluation evaluation in general g3 all right ideas there covering this queen b4 knight c4 he's not even taking he's not even he's slowly slowly but queen e3 look at this queen c3 queen trade yes but now i'm going to take and now the structure is just atrocious i mean now white is already uh equal in pawns and has more pressure queen c3 takes takes rook a5 knight e4 knight b6 and these pawns are just sitting around waiting to be taken rook a8 trading a rook applying more pressure rook takes rook a8 hitting another piece and noer goes for this endgame but there's just nothing nothing he can do nepo is going to very slowly very methodically look at the king just journeying up the board to take part king e7 rook d6 there are no moves for black rook c8 it's just a matter of time it's just a matter of time rook d6 knight d6 coming in now threatening this threatening this threatening knight f5 g4 g5 yet another idea he just goes here and now he's just going to win the rook end game and uh there is really not much more to analyze here because this was just an absolute master class from start to finish you know nepo paralyzed the black position swarmed in the white the knight is just trapped now have you notice the knight is trapped rook b three knight f1 he's just dancing around h4 patiently waiting biting his time and now he zips away to try to win the c pawn he will win the c pawn this is like mate pretty soon g4 knight d6 check knight c8 check and uh he doesn't even take he doesn't even take taking is fine f4 is also very strong two pass pawns just can't stop noer resigns he could have played knight b1 white would have went like king d d3 he would he could have went knight a3 knight would have danced around you can even force a knight trade knight b5 the knight is stuck it's completely stuck it goes here king c2 and the game is over white uh black cannot stop the pawns what a master class i mean this is such an incredible idea by neppo it's incredible how on move' he played a pawn move that broke black's structure and permanently immobilized literally his entire position like expertly done what an idea none of these pawns could move anymore despite being a pawn up black swallowed a pawn but paralyzed four of his four of his organs it's just unbelievable right like you eat one thing four oregon stop working don't don't eat the thing sounds pretty bad masterclass performance by nepo uh big win over noyre who by the way was tied for first now this is a little bit of a bathroom break of a game hans demon you know i got i got to cover hans folks are interested in hans some of you like hate hans some of you love hans but here's the thing about hans you're always going to watch you're always going to watch cuz you're fascinated right so he's playing vvin lami by the way they they put out something recently about uh irvin uh irvin uh is is actively playing this tournament while recovering from a form of cancer he had um hotchkins uh i believe is what it was called and uh they put out something on on social media and and last year irvin um won the dutch championship while having the zilus which you talk about resiliency and and they there was a clip out of him that that was saying um you know now he has a different perspective on life and he doesn't take chess results and positions as harshly because he knows how delicate life can be and i was like man that is uh that is a that was a powerful piece of content and um wish him nothing but the best i mean that that that is really admirable stuff um all right here we go c6 queen's gambit decline this is like a vintage opening white plays knight e2 white's going to try to play h3 or f3 e4 and i told you this game is a little bit of a bathroom break because hans put typical queen's gambit declined pressure uh but irvin uh neutralized and hans built up a pretty pleasant edge and broke through with e4 right iran traded down played knight f6 i think hans had a chance here uh not to take right away but first play knight e7 which attacks this and then after rook c7 there's a little bit of a difference in that kn c6 is and i don't know why hans didn't play knight e7 he probably didn't like knight d6 where after knight c8 rook c8 i mean i don't know white is still up in exchange so i i that was the uh top computer line but i'm like wh why would anybody play like that maybe there maybe thought about f6 but then queen e4 is a check so i i i don't know but instead of 97 he goes here and this move is just just right on time and um yeah black is uh able to stabilize and and and the two of them made a draw so took a little while but it took like 15 more moves we got to a draw in rook end game little bathroom break uh hans draws against uh irvin now here are some banger games salm salah one of the most dynamic exciting players in the world versus mar andrea mar maritti from france who is just cooking this tournament he plays a semi slav and mar andrea does not take the pawn he does not accept the pawn so a few moves later salem takes the pawn bishop f4 and he gives away the bishop this is a really interesting idea he gives away the bishop for the knight and he goes here to pressure the diagonal rook e1 now white is bothering black with the queen black is defending and now black starts fighting back on the queen side queen b5 but visually white is always going to have a little bit of an edge queen a4 and then here mar andre says yo bro what if i just grab a pawn take the pawn what are you going to do well the arabic falcon doesn't need two invitations to take flight right he's got the bishops he's got this he's got this he's got he's got all this pressure he's got a really nice position knight takes he forces the night back he gets in with the rook really dangerous position rook d8 very passive defense but maybe there's no way through i mean white's got really annoying pressure but marre is defending himself bishop c4 and here's the thing about defending for a really long time like at some point you know the other guy might get a little bit too confident and then let's not forget you're still a pawn up and uhoh wait we're threatening a queen trade what's going on well apparently yeah that's exactly what i'm describing like white had no further way through and suddenly white is going to start uh realizing that it it it was not so easy as he thought cuz black's just the pawn up the pressure suddenly subsides salem is still trying to create some complications but at this point he's trying to like survive an endgame ab bishop b4 and suddenly mark andre is like wait a minute i'm playing for a win dude i'm not playing to draw i'm not playing to hold i'm playing for a win they repeat moves and here comes marre look at this the young man from france is on fire he is cooking he's up two pawns white's king is on the verge of getting mated salem takes on b6 the knight comes back queen c2 he just needs to find a way in can he find a way in bishop h5 bishop g6 white's running away with the pawn knight e5 a nice idea with queen d2 if you take if you keep trying to run the pawn away with a6 i'll play here i'll attack your queen if you keep trying to run away i'll play queen d2 you're so close but so far it's mate queen g1 knight b6 is the key idea that is the key idea also knight e3 probably just wins because you can make a queen and then like win like the which is pretty gangster you just allow a queen but you win the game yeah but none of that even has to happen because marria wins the pawn completely and it's just two pawns up in an end game this is insane this man is on fire queen f3 knight e4 he swarms in cm resigns marre is in first place in the challen he's winning the challenger section remember the winner of the challengers plays in the masters next year so dude is cooking i mean this this is a 16-year-old he's a world under 20 champion mar andrea he's uh he's crushing he is absolutely crushing i got two more games for you divia deshmuk versus elina rubers they are the young women i believe they're 17' uh international masters looking for gm norms looking for big results elina yesterday lost to salem but has beaten hans neiman and mustafa ymas divia has defeated liam vck and him santos latasa and this game was a french it was a wiow it was 92 a gambit line giving up this pawn on e4 it's a very aggressive line black plays knight f6 which i don't believe is the move uh i think taking is i mean knight f6 is probably fine but now white builds up this monster fortress with a3 f4 black tries to create some counterplay divia plays knight g3 divia is just like looking for a scrap she's looking for checkmate plays bishop b5 which is pinning these knights to the king black goes here now diva takes this knight to remove the pressure from her center castles and plays b4 which controls the dark squares on the queen side bishop a6 from elena and now h5 rook b1 white looking for b5 black looking for h4 the bishop slides in knight f1 repositioning to the center and now the queen repositions as well so white is looking for f5 in this position black plays king f8 which prevents f5 so now white plays queen h3 looking for g4 and f5 position is in the balance uh if black plays queen c6 white can play g4 and then apparently be okay cuz obviously the king is here but it's very dangerous looking but but elena plays knight b8 and now you don't even have to play g4 and diva plays f5 and basically says yo good luck good luck defending yourself by the way the idea is to sack the knight sacrificing the knight works now you lose a full piece but the point is not only do you threaten mate i'm threatening the rook i am about to triple up not right away cuz i don't want to lose my rook but i have like knight d5 i have e6 i can reposition the knight queen h5 queen h6 bishop e3 bishop h6 a lot of different attacking ideas black plays rook g7 and white just keeps going and divia deshmuk absolutely positively flatlines her opponent this is an attack this is an attack it is a tactical melee and black just can't keep up the pawn is poisonous paralyzing the position queen h check rook takes f6 the bulldozer arrives rook f7 and black resigns because if you go to the back rank it's mate and if you take this is mate divia deshmuk absolutely obliterates elena rubers that was a wild game that was a a crazy crazy game a french defense which was white just built up a perfect setup and it looked like black has this covered she didn't she had it anything but ced and now i mean f5 is just is just is just a a mauling a very nice attacking game from diva who has three and a half points so she is playing very very well and now the last game of the event um yeah you got you if you made it this far this was crazy this was an amazing game between kabov and mandona it was another french this one was a tarash though with knight f3 knight d4 don't worry about the theory you're not going to get quizzed on this but just like in the french that you just saw these positions are dynamic they are interesting creative exciting a lot of different words and as you can see the guys are ready for a fight we're going to see who castles who doesn't gh4 bishop h4 looks kind of deranged to allow white to get all of this queen b2 take take rook b1 kicking out the queen here for reasons i don't understand instead of keeping his queen here and losing white's right to castle he grabs another pawn so uh leon is up two pawns from the opening car however has a very big lead in development black has a much weaker king but black plays queen a4 and carbo plays here the queen rotates around i mean you talk about the queen right getting some exercise out here queen b6 queen b2 queen a2 queen a4 queen g4 queen g7 oh my god bang bang bang bang bang bang queen is going on multiple non-stop flights kbov goes f4 same position as the diva game like if f5 lands lyon is dead his king is just not safe i mean just objectively speaking it's not safe like just so you understand how bad black's position is if this pawn is on c4 like it's mate very soon it is mate very very very soon if that happens so f4 leon plays rook g8 just good to have that sniper on the g file car ball plays rook f2 and he's just he's just going to bludgeon this king to death he's going to rip it open going to hit on that diagonal he's going to get the rook to b7 at some point he's going to play a five and the game is just going to be lost bishop to a6 it's simply a matter of time there's the move it's over perfect game vintage game it doesn't even matter that black can win two more pawns black could be at four pawns in this game and get checkmated like that is how brutal some of this attacking stuff works leon plays queen g4 again the queen makes a queen move the queen makes a queen move yes obviously pressure here and now kov just has to figure this out he could take he he could take he could play queen h6 you don't want to go here actually believe it or not cuz the king is actually surprisingly safe you want to open the position for your pieces fe fe queen h6 just a beautiful game from kov masterful attacking chess rook goes back to g8 and kov is completely winning he is completely winning here if he finds the move knight d4 which is pretty gangster the idea is very simple you want to go knight c6 and also you have this in the future of the queens and if queen d4 queen h7 is winning so black cannot put the rook the king back because you win the rooks and this is the only thing black can do so knight d4 just wins the game right now like black would have to resign because for example let's say rook c8 bishop f5 disconnects the queen threatening queen e6 if you take queen d6 king e8 knight f5 gg g g g g g g g g g g lot of g's knight d4 is winning instead of that corov takes so he plays a little too quickly and now apparently rook f8 is winning but rook g7 is not because again knight d4 again there is knight to d4 this idea and the idea of uh of of knight d4 is really you know it's it's really quite a spectacle um but instead of that he takes like this which is still good now there is rook h8 and all of a sudden this is a problem how do you deal with this pin frankly how do you deal with this in mate like you're about to lose all your pieces but what white is still winning white is still winning here because of one of the most absurd stockfish moves i've ever seen in my life you would think it's check but then black moves the king and you lose so what you do here is you take the pawn and attack the knight what what about this you're going to lose your queen or you're going to get mated well in this position white is still winning with rook d2 leaving the queen to die because rook d7 is a ladder mate it's ladder mate on the back rank what now okay what if i don't take your queen what if i sack my knight i take the queen is hanging that is the only way not to lose this is a massive threat what if black plays bishop c8 i sacrifice anyway because now my queen gets in oh my god dc rook h7 rook d2 is a winning move from kov a quiet move threatening the knight and threatening the removal of the f6 yo oh my god oh corov did not need to let it get this far he did not need to come up with this absurd m tal level sacrifice he could have just played knight d4 but instead he plays knight h2 and now the position is equal after queen g3 you see he wanted to remove the defense of the of the e6 pawn now this is a draw this is a draw because you have this rook h7 and now you sack your rook to make a oh to make a draw this is the draw king c8 king d7 king c8 actually rook c2 is winning so king e8 queen b8 and it's just the draw which is kind of insane because if you go here you actually lose the game uh even king d5 i think is winning this is so rook b3 is what he plays instead which is trying to deflect the queen but now instead of deflecting the queen and losing the game leon just takes the pawn he takes the pawn kbov goes here uh black is just winning black is just up a pawn but also he's going to lose a bishop queen h4 check king c8 knight f3 queen d5 the rook is hanging back rank is threatened rook h7 rook h1 and my man anton kabov just went from playing an absolutely gorgeous attacking game from start to finish all he needed to do was find this knight d4 idea he failed to find it then he had to find stockfish reincarnated he didn't find it and he goes from from completely winning to drawn to just straight up losing the game oh my god and leon wins wow leon edwards leon mandanka finding last second victories snapping them from the jaws of defeat these are your standings after eight rounds mar andrea maritti leads the challengers with five and a half points after winning three out of his last four games giri gukesh and fuja are tied for first nepo prague and nock and vided half a point behind it's crazy crazy tournament j and june and dingly ren have the same amount of points which is also insane both world champions crazy stuff i will see you for round number nine tomorrow is a rest day i will see you on january the 23rd get out of here
