haskell researcher announced discovery of industry programmer who gives the  i mean i know this this article is is is is almost 15 years old at this point but this is incredible i truly truly only thought that haskell was a white paper language like fact that somebody's doing something with it i mean pitt keeps telling me that he's gainfully employed programming haskell but honestly i don't believe it like i i haven't believed it yet i just don't think it's real but i mean now we got papers cup i mean this classic haskell writing papers that there are people who actually care using haskell and production i mean classic haskeller here uh the worldwide haskell community met up over beers today to celebrate there's dozens of us uh they're unprecedented discovery of an industry programmer who gives a about haskell on west is this about wait is this article about you pick are are you this person pick tell us the truth on wednesday researchers uh issued a press release revealing that a 27 year old seth breyers of north carolina dude sorry for doxing you pick uh a java programmer at blackwater accounting firm ross n a fordham actually gives a about haskell mr byers has followed every single one of our press releases for years and uh the press release stated probably even this one foreign i love onion like articles specifically with something like haskell this is so good uh haskell researcher dutch van duralindi classic uh explained how they had stumbled on their on the theoretical possibility of breyers and his persistent interest in haskell we knew that there are precisely 38 people who give a about haskell said evander lindy because every haskell related reddit post gets exactly 38 upvotes it's a pure deterministic function of no arguments yeah oh oh it hurts oh my goodness the function the function returns ain't no way that function returning 38 every time oh my goodness that is the result is independent of what is actually announced uh but there are only 37 of us on the mailing list so we figured out there was a lurker somewhere facts facts don't care about your feelings haskell that is or that or it was an off by one error not detectable by our type system oh vander and lindy added but we don't uh like to dwell on i mean with good units testing practices we can uh sorry i need to get some water also vander lindy stumbled off in a coughing fit his fellow researcher abani and mcfarlane uh outlined their basic dilemma finding a person who gives a about haskell is an inherently np complete computer science problem it's similar in scope and complexity to the problem of trying to find a tenured academic who didn't have the bulk of his or her work done by uncredited graduate students yes yes yes let it be said oh my goodness i still remember the first time i ever did my official first academic paper and when i did it all the work and everything finally came down to it did all the all the work did all the research did all the graphing did all the writing did everything got it into a conference and all the applying did all the driving did all the speaking did every last little bit of it and when we got done with it the name that is first on the paper of course the faculty member with whom was our guide of course of course this is just it i wasn't even a graduate student i was i was a i was a back layer in more than one way by the way oh i was bachelored pretty hard in multiple different ways so even though we suspected buyers existed we needed a strategy to smoke them out she explained the trap they set for buyers we crafted a fake satirical post a lampooning haskell as unusable overly complex turd a writing task that was emotionally difficult but conceptually trivial is that okay this this is probably one of the greatest ways to describe rust sometimes conceptually trivial emotionally difficult it is it is so good the best way to describe rust bam and we tweet it then we laced the post with deeper social subtext decline the endemic superficiality uh and laziness of global industry programming culture to make ourselves feel better finally which was unexpected back to unexpectedly contentious because nobody could agree on what reddit voting arrows actually mean this is so good and then we waited to see who if anyone would give a she said mcfarlane concluded our elegant approach didn't work so we hired a pearl hacker to go dig up some personal details of all 38 accounts that had ever upvoted a haskell post and the only one we didn't know was seth byers uh so we reached out to him and thankfully so far he hasn't threatened to sue us buyer says he is pleased to have been recognized for his apparently unique  giving about haskell i've been giving a about hasgo for a long time as i can oh my goodness a lot i've been giving a about haskell for a lot for a long as i can remember now that kind of reads funny i've been giving about haskell for as long as i can remember i follow all their announcements and developments closely just in case i ever get the urge to use the language for something someday and that is how pick got hired this is the story it's beautiful elegant language buyers observed as he busied himself cleaning a fingernail you'd be hard-pressed to find a more expressive and composable core and they've made astounding advances over the years in performance interoperability extensibility tooling and documentation i'm kind of surprised i'm the only person on earth who gives a about it buyers continued i have thought there would be more people following the press releases closely and then not using haskell but they all just skip the press release and go straight to the not using part oh no oh poor haskell oh gosh somebody call 9-1-1 oh no people see the word like monads and category theory buyers continued uh swatting invisible flies around his head for emphasis and giving a a gene shuts down faster than than a tea baker with a grade school arithmetic book i'm really disappointed that more programmers don't actively involve in reading endless threads about the sub subvert haskell type system to accomplish basic set you can do in other languages but i guess that's the lazy ignorant careless world we live in the so-called real world haskell researcher uh yavier javier javier escuela uh i don't know how to say that name uh remains hopeful that one day they may be able to double or even triple the number of industry programmers who give a about haskell i believe the root cause of the popularity problem is haskell's lack of readability readable support for mutually recursive generic container types pick is this real pick if you're if you're here pick what the hell does that mean can you just hit me with like a can you just hit me with a yeah that's definitely it okay so that's it okay so he knows pic knows i i knew it he knew it uh that's the dude for red dead no i don't think so okay so this is real okay so it is it is this problem um if we can create a monadic composition functor wrapper that is uh that is perceived as sufficiently sexy by hardened industry veterans then i think we will see an uptick in giving a possibly as much as a full extra person i can't believe i just read that sentence out loud i cannot i i can't even believe this is real haskell aficionado harold mcdougall uh mcdougall is not quite as sanguine as his colleague escuela esquila uh i doubt haskell will ever be appreciated by the uneducated natives of this industry as exciting as it is the discovery of buyers that should be considered an anomaly and not a sign that more people will ever give a programmers only seem to pay attention to things when there is humor involved we do not have experiment experimental humor monet added mcdougall but it doesn't seem to be getting much adoption or wait oh we do have an experimental humor monad but it doesn't seem to be getting much adoption haskell fans just don't see the need for it you know i'm not gonna lie to you this article hits home in such a funny way and just arrived i'm not even sure if this is sarcasm in the sense that there's part of me that's like i should learn haskell then i need to do something which is every day of my life and so then you know it's just not gonna happen you know it's just as much as i wanted to we definitely need more monadic composition functor wrapper solutions to gain more adoption i would agree uh don't forget to wrap your composition functor uh everybody knows when you don't do that i mean the thing is that you're gonna get a side effect that you're not expecting and that i mean you could be responsible for that side effect for a long long time uh the name is that skeleton i can't believe i just said that on a youtube video that's gonna be on a youtube video my wife might see that she might get linked that and then she's gonna be like what the hell did you just say what the hell did you just say
