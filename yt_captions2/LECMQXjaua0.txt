let's code state let's build something with python ai twilio to send a text message and what about let's use rebel to do it okay [music] but how is this going to work let's break it down so to start with we are going to use claude which is my favorite ai chat bot right now it is updated till 2022 so it has pretty up-to-date data and with plot we are going to write it a prompt from there we're going to get a skeleton of code see what it's suggesting we do with python we're going to take that code then and transfer it to rebel make some changes modifications so it's accurate as to what we want and then from there we're going to sign up to twilio which is if you haven't used twilio it is probably one of my favorite tools to use it's such a great way to code interactivity by sending text messages or emails different kind of messaging and what we are going to do is connect it to your phone number whatever that is and it's going to send us text message every day or not every day sorry a text message once a week and that will be of our grocery list because what i used to do call me crazy maybe the only one who did this is i would text myself my grocery list and i would go in in and input every okay what do i think i want what are some foods i want so this way we don't have to do any of that one thing i forgot to mention is why are we using python why not javascript not why not php or any other language well here are some benefits with python of course it's easy to learn it's very user friendly and it's into intuitive syntax also it's versatile it can be used for so many wide range of applications i always encourage people to learn it if they want to go into ai machine learning building desktop apps scripting there are so many different possibilities with python and not to mention it has a great community there is so much documentation out there about python that it makes it easy to pick up quickly and then continue to build your skills upon now let's be honest there are tons of use cases we're using something like this ai to help you code is not a good idea especially if you are using it at work or anything like that this with claude i find it a really good or fun way that you can prompt it to give you ideas about a project for coding to give you or maybe you're just you're not a coder but you just want to have fun and build or tinker around there's a time and a place for everything and today the time and place is now so let's use clot let's start by prompting it with build me a weekly planner a weekly grocery planner grocery planner that will get text to me once a week with python i feel like that prompt was not great but let's see what it does all right so we're using twilio of course date time is a package i am familiar with one thing to note is you do not just go install different packages or modules that you're not familiar with make sure to do your research because there has been some interesting things going on with people i you know just copying code and then bad packages are installed so let's go through this code for a sec here here are some python code to build a weekly grocery store planner so we have set up twilio which we will do then a list of items to buy each week okay so the basics kind of thing function detects the grocery store the grocery list and then checking if it's the right date and time and then of course sleep to check again because we don't want to we don't want to get texas every day this is pretty accurate i think we could update it and customize it a bit but this is a great place to start now what is it saying to do next it says sign up for a twilio account yes set the recipient phone number to your own number of course and run the script next up we are going to use repl is my favorite environment or favorite platform i should say that really makes it easy to start building now one thing with rebel is for this to work we will have to run it locally i believe for this job to run no footwork and rebel i think we have to do it locally but regardless we will try it but to start with let's do it in rebel so let's create a rebel python and we're just going to go with the title it gives us why not super dazzle and then from here let's go back to claude and we're going to take this and once again it's because i'm familiar with uh this package i used 20 in the past i'm not just taking a random package so then let's go here paste this code and now next up we gotta go to twilio in twilio it's really simple to set up first of course you sign up for account then you will be able to get a phone number send your first text and start building an app so i'm not going to take you through my twilio because i know we use my keys or my ids but you get the point it's very simple and really user friendly now once you have that we can go back into our app and input the required information account sid off token and then to from and two so your two will be to your own phone number i'm not putting mine in here because i love you all but i don't need you texting me one thing i want to customize though is the weekly list so right now we have milk bread eggs let's change this to oat milk you're a dairy-free household uh let's do instead of bread let's do tomato do we have tomato okay let's do i actually need some beans eggs yes chicken lettuce tomatoes cheese okay that's a pretty good list if you ask me so what's really going on here let's step back for a second here we have our weekly list of uh items to buy and then we have this function here which essentially is going to text the grocery list write what it says why do you need me when we have ai to explain things for us but the whole point of this is the wild true if date time and will equal six which is uh equates to sunday then we will print texting grocery list and it will call this function above here and pass in the grocery grocery list i need to get more sleep speaking of sleep and then it will wait a week before checking again so once every day on sunday and you can change this if you want it to be a different day of course but sunday seems to be a good grocery shopping day all right i hope you enjoyed going through this very simple tutorial with ai python and twilio the purpose of it really was to show you just how quickly it is that you can get started today whether it be coding building something interesting or just tinkering you don't need to become a software developer or software engineer in order to code code is something that can enable you to really you know build any business ideas you have or automate parts of your life if you haven't already make sure to hit that subscribe button for more tech coding and career related videos and i will see you all soon what should we automate next can i find a way to automate someone walking my dogs that would be nice [music]
