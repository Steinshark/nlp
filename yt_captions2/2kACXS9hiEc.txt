i'm levy rosman and i have the privilege of being joined by none other than visan five-time world champion absolute legend of the game thank you so much and uh pleasure to meet you how are you uh enjoying toronto so far i liked it very much i mean the hotel is excellent in a good area and um uh i haven't been to toronto for what three days i was a teenager when i last visited so for chess no i visit my uncle used to live in missa so i came to visit my cousin and so on oh uh but um i haven't come since then uh i've been to the states a lot in the meantime but i canada just slipped by so it was it was i was very happy to hear that the candidates is going to be here and i come and um it was good fun last uh yesterday evening went for a basketball match uh met one of my old rivals the canadian rival who's actually indian origin vinnie puri oh okay he played with me in the world juniors and he played with me in event all way back when and so i caught up with him and so it's been nice so far and you timed it well cuz lebron was in town yes so two goats you know uh meeting up in in one arena and uh the game wasn't good though you were telling me the the lakers won by yes it it never got interesting there was a point in the beginning where the raptors were leading and you know given the reputation the fact that raptors in losing streak that seemed like a fair balance but very quickly it flipped and then never never got interest interesting it's a fun thing about uh sport versus chess chess is probably the only activity where you can go from completely winning to completely lost like that i mean in basketball it takes time and then the lakers can't just lose the game with one pass the raptors would have had to make a very long comeback right so i've had conversations especially with adults who try to learn the game that that's chess not basketball that say uh chess is very hard mentally because of this particular thing like most things you lose completely slowly but chess it's it's completely not like that so um and not at your level but you know at the level of most of the folks in the audience that can switch uh very fast i have a bunch of things i'd like to ask you first of all we're at the candidates right so we should start there you have played the candidates in this format you have played the candidates of the double round robin but you've also played the matches you've played the knockouts how does it feel to be at a candidates just as well your official capacity here is commentator or deputy president which one are you i'm here principally as a commentator but i'm also deputy president so uh at the opening that's how i don't know how they'll present me i hope deputy president anyway yeah and for a while uh it was difficult to switch switching roles it was strange to be introduced as feay deputy president what does that not to be introduced as uh what is the deputy president cuz i know what vice president is well in a sense it's the same okay uh but we have vice presidents so the deputy president i think distinguish that um okay and um i think in the us system i'm very comparable to the vice president because you know if u if the need arose um then i would have to step in and perform the roles of and when the president is not there i have very similar roles in that capacity so i think vice president is the closest uh okay so if two players at this event start punching each other and you have to make some sort of big decision it it's on you i suppose yes but uh in in first it'll go to the arbiters and all that and then and and you know mr dwo is just there on his phone so i it won't come to that okay uh but uh i mean i can't commentate and do these things and it'll get a bit tricky but yeah might be funny if uh it came to that do you enjoy uh watching these events as as opposed to playing in them how does it feel sort of being now in the role that you currently are versus the memories and of uh of competing both in the knockouts against so many great players just can you take a human a regular human who has not played in this kind of high-intensity atmosphere and you've played in it so many times what what are they feeling right now and what are they going to feel in a few days okay first my own feeling is i find com commentator much more intense than spectator because spectator you can switch on and off at will mh as a commentator you're you experience a lot more together with players probably i don't really have to explain this to you but you experience it at a different level than uh when you're not explaining communicating it as well um but i enjoy it at the same time i don't feel the tension and that's the nicest part mhm the difficult part is uh i think part of you wants to especially when they somebody plays badly part of you wants to be a player again yeah and just do it better than that so there's that tension that sometimes i want to be a player and sometimes i'm very happy being a commentator but i'm definitely very relaxed here and that's what feels funny at a candidates tournament because generally by now um i wouldn't be tense yet uh opening would be a moment when you see everyone around and you know and maybe and you know whom you're going to play though here the pairings were done earlier and that's been the case but [music] um you at every age uh it it gets slightly more tense um tomorrow when you walk into the hall it'll be a bit tense then um and then the round starts so uh that's how it would normally be um and then during the tournament you you never stop worrying about what you're going to play the next day okay uh so that like even for me the biggest joys in these tournaments are the rest days so the night before the rest day is my i don't have to do anything time i can just do whatever i want but by the time i've had breakfast and maybe gone to the gym or something and um after that yeah then the tension comes back because you you're starting to do all your checking you go through your notes and yeah you feel tense already so that never-ending tension just continues for you was it always uh specific and centered around just chess and the preparation or uh did you have big your let's say swings in your emotions from uh from losses or from bad games or from bad results in the opening or was cuz you the way you're describing it i mean it you just sort of sound like like a standard competition i mean you you don't seem particularly stressed uh but were you back in the day well let's put it this way you know that it's very very important and the stakes are high and so on but at the same time i always have this feeling that um there's only so much i can experience today and then there's something to be experienced tomorrow and then something after that and it's all adding up so i've got to play a responsible game today but i can't overdo anything today uh like it or not this has to be done 14 times and so it spreads out for me and in tournaments i try very hard to switch to this one game at a time feet on the ground that sort of um mentality because i find it helpful sure um but i i still remember certain matches very vividly like let's say los palmas when i qualified for the first time beating g and i played gary later that year that you know i can remember if i just look at the position i remember how i felt how i felt that evening and so on so those things come back very strongly i guess it's something you you feel constantly but you uh don't try to remind yourself of it all the time let's address one uh elephant in the room um i feel like over the last few years every time you do something great the headline is vy won a game it's amazing what he does at his age and i just feel like every headline is calling you old and i kind of hate it and i made a joke about it in my recent video when i covered your two games in the bundesliga and uh i just want to i want to know your thoughts about it because everything is like it's amazing he's still competing at his age it's amazing he's top 10 at his age like have you kind of ever looked at that and went it's so funny they have such a focus on you know me being in in my 50s but you're still top 10 okay you're 11 cuz arjun is the latest person to take you uh off the number one spot in india so uh give me your perception of the whole thing um it's one of these things where i don't mind too much i myself sometimes describe myself as old uh or you say well these youngsters and you can't have it both ways you can't do that and then say it defensive so um i'm okay with it it doesn't bother me too much um and i don't know really what to say i pretty much ended up in this place because i wanted to be here uh i mean i took a conscious decision couple of years ago that i was going to start playing much less during the pandemic uh suddenly it hit me all these some of these really tough matches um so do i want to go through this all over and it's not going to get easier from now on they're going to get younger and stronger and so you know i feel like a rat on a treadmill you know i'm running but i don't know why and such sort of thing so i took a conscious decision to be uh to balance it differently uh and um i don't mind too much i mean in chess 50 is old so um whatever they say as as long as i'm able to play a decent game the rest takes care of itself do you notice a a real difference like okay we just talked basketball you'd feel different if you were on the court at 25 than if you were 50 right but do you feel a difference when you're playing four five hour games or not really i mean is it just cognitive or it's just tiredness is it drive because maybe you had more drive when you were kind of coming up uh or is it all the same because it's just chess a lot of it is the same it's just chess um but in the bundesliga after a long time i was suddenly faced with what am i going to do against someone today as opposed to uh will i need this at some point in the next few months and that preparation shift is very different i mean i drove myself nuts preparing for hikaru and uh uh i mean in the end when he went for those four nights i didn't know whether laugh or cry because you on the one hand i've prepared all the stuff but on the other hand um it does um mean that you know you have to deal with the more limited anyway i have my own complicated relationship with the for night so that's another story but uh in the sense that i get into trouble quite often but um these days it's just um um that i'm in the stage where i'm switching on switching off switching on switching off and now i'm switching on again so getting used to that but uh once the game starts and i feel that um i'm more or less able to think and and really the preparation is only not to embarrass yourself to give you a chance at a normal game uh and if that works out it's pretty much okay i mean uh i enjoy the bundesliga a lot because i didn't have any bad results and that that helps a bit how much did you have to sacrifice throughout your career to excel at the game to uh everything from time investment i mean to money emotional uh postponing certain other things in life uh and if you could go back would you change anything not really and but the thing is it it never felt like a sacrifice it felt like something you have to do in the same way that you have to uh sacrifice a pawn sacrifice a piece in order to get somewhere it just felt like uh of course i have to take this seriously to do well but if i do well i'll feel happier later it seemed very uh immediate it's a bit strange where i don't recognize myself is when people say you know all the sacrifice you did and the hard work you did and thing and um that doesn't resonate at some level i um it feels strange to have it described like that because i i just thought it's something that came with the territory it's a choice i made i mean you know you go to a th th restaurant there's going to be th food and it's kind of like that and uh that's how it felt um would i do something different i think there are lots of interesting fields out there and sometimes i think well what would life be if i had gone down some other path but not in the sense of that i actually turned something down to be a chess player in fact i say that i'm quite lucky um every chess player gets to the moment of hesitation where they think should be should i go all in on chess or maybe some should i go through a couple of years university whatever and um i was lucky that at the ages when i would have had to face this question or maybe thing i had fantastic success like i became a grandmaster when i was just getting out of school right i became national champion when i was choosing my stream uh what subjects i would take and when i finished my university degree i was in the top five okay and then i thought i mean this is fantastic i i never had to once think um so the other question is do you actually choose to become a chess player and i think you uh it's the other way it's backward uh unless you get a good reason not to think most chess players will probably stay chess players unless acted upon by some external force blah blah so yeah yeah yeah that's what was your degree in uh i did uh be a bom which is uh commerce a little bit less economics uh but basically that sort of stream did you like school i by now i remember that having enjoyed it immensely but i think that's just you memory playing tricks uh in on a day-to-day basis i suspect now everything about my youth seems fantastic and i sometimes i have to tell myself it can't have been that good there must have been some things i disliked um again i'm old so no no i said it i said it i'm old and uh it comes with the thing that now suddenly it seems like like everything i did in my teens or something uh sometimes i most of the time i'm very happy what i am you know i think it's a natural stage of life uh you got to enjoy this as well thing but um i miss my teens a lot uh it seems like uh all my first my first super tournament my first candidates my first thing it seems there were exciting points that i i don't know if i felt it then but i feel it now you think chess was more fun when you were a teenager or is it more fun for some of these teenagers now i suspect it's just as much fun and just as exciting for very it's very different now it's very different but once upon a time we also thought we were changing history and everything i mean uh when um you know i i played my first world championship in this uh the rival circuit the pca intel circuit and uh at that point we thought oh with intel we're going to we got this great sponsor and we're going to now do new things and uh we're going to play these rapid uh knockout events these kremlin stars and these other things and uh chess is going to be on tv and it's going to be amazing and this and that uh and now they think the same yeah um i mean that at that age everything seems full of promise i must say i'm quite privileged uh i had a blast uh the whole time and i can't complain i suspect uh these youngsters have their own favorite things about chess but uh they must be having just as much just as intense an experience in fact even more because they're playing much more far far more games than i i was but um in terms of enjoyment yes and that is a one of the fascinating points that i also have to remind myself sometimes uh i played you played in the world trade center right there's uh or 107th floor yeah 107th floor and i remember this because the very first time it was even 100 108th we had to go to 107th and then go up the escalator and go one up something like i wasn't there but i know about this because when i was a child i would play at the marshall chess club in new york in a tiny little basement room and they have a photo on the wall of uh of the match and the names and and you know world trade center and all this i think the you know the intel thing is up there and the last few years have been incredible for chess and yes i'm also even though i'm technically a youtuber i'm not involved with the tv networks i'm not involved with any of that stuff but i also am thinking how do we get it on television how do we how do we build media around it and then i sometimes think you who 30 years ago were kind of on that first wave so what was that like and why did it not become on you know why did it not be become kind of a mainstay on an espn or a sports network i think just has still hasn't figured out how to crack television and back then the internet just wasn't uh what it is even youtube took a long time to mature yeah yeah for sure and um what we have now the ease of following uh chess with commentary and uh um just how instantaneous and easy and there's an app for everything and it's totally frictionless it seems as a content creator mh the only thing you have to focus on is getting getting a good job done yeah uh the rest takes care of itself for a long time that option hadn't opened up so for a while we thought chess was going to break through um with online play yeah and maybe just a lot of the pieces took a long time uh connecting together you have to look at parallels um chess is certainly done well uh uh recently mhm but relative to what relative to which major sport have we caught up or narrowed the gap completely that's the question you would have to ask um i mean once upon a time fishes py was a huge thing yes yes and you can talk to people and uh they would still say um that they sat to watch uh the highlight show afterwards and um uh somebody would explain the thing on a demonstration magnetic demonstration board and things like that but you know there's there's no um um saying that u what happened some somewhere around the pandemic though it had been brewing for a while but then exploded during the pandemic and clearly uh you've been a part of that that's that's real mhm but um it' be interesting to know if there are some other sports which have changed i suspect a lot of um gaming has also changed dramatically in this way and the connection the fans have instantaneously um on chat or discord or all these things um it's hard for me to quantify but um yeah no it's it's wonderful that um just suddenly exploded because it seems to this audience was there mhm but we were not connecting to them often enough and suddenly that's happening a lot more often i i feel uh the same in particular chess is something that's sort of hidden in a lot of people's lives they were exposed to it as kids maybe they played with a with a parent usually a father or a grandfather uh and then there's no chess in school this is all kind of unique to where i grew up in india it might be a little bit different but there's no chess in school and even if there's chess in school and you play it as a hobby you get to an age where where you're not going to become a professional and it's not cool anymore and all your friends are playing a sport or focusing on what they're going to do in university so chess just has no role in that uh and then you sort of fall out of love with the game and the last few years have brought like you said the people we were not connecting with and then people who came back and told a friend to try to play chess and that friend tried to play for the first time realized that it's just this wormhole that consumes your life and some stick around and some quit uh has your life changed a lot over the last few years and you can feel free to be as arrogant as you'd like as not humble as you like because are are you an a-list celebrity in india like an aist athlete i think in terms of uh being recognized or my name meaning something the thing is my name uh has been on school textbooks yeah so um is that indoctrination i don't know but it's been there so there's definitely again that's one thing you see with age i've come to this point where everybody knows who i am even if they don't know much more um i i wanted to make this point in the earlier question um one important thing which has happened is that a lot of people who still can't tell a king pawn from a queen pawn mh at least can name three or four chess players and uh something they like to follow and they connect once in a while in the same way that i connect sports to sports that i'm only very remotely interested in but if there's a good summary i like to know what has happened over the last week and i tune in and that audience has grown as well so there's a large audience who who have not followed up and bought just books sorry are playing a lot but uh they're starting to read a bit more and they know a bit more in india especially that's happened with these youngsters a lot of people know they'll tell me they'll they'll sometimes mix up the names and things like that but they'll say you know there's this youngster maybe you're coaching him uh something like that and a few facts they know that is also uh grown but anyway to answer your question um there is a noticeable uh change i get recognized even more now than uh before and i think it's this new audience that i'm saying uh people who are still far from the game but not as far as they used to be um arant enough no no not arrogant enough i'm going to i'm going to keep hammering home uh mostly from a point of like i'm curious and i hope people who watch this are as well i i always wondered uh if you were you just told me sometimes you don't even choose chess it sort of chooses you in the terms of whether you're going to go into university in a full-time career uh or top five in the world and ultimately for the world championship uh so yeah the same questions sort of uh sort of applies to to what you just said um in the sense of did you think that you were going to be a role model a coach a support system for the next generation or is it sort of something that's happened it happened i had no sense in the beginning i mean when i i could feel it when i became a grandmaster that was a big thing because uh for a while there only two pe questions people asked you uh did you know anything about the fish spasy match and why doesn't india have any grand masters uh so that was kind of even uh non-chest players would would knew that we had no grand masters you know at least that much it filtered out um so when i became a grandmaster i slowly figured out that the effect i was having on other people uh was something different you know you expected people not to care and then you find out they care they care or something like that and that continuously surprises you role model and all was well into the future at some point i realized that um um you know there are kids and especially their parents uh and a lot of them were choosing chess because they thought i was a sensible kind of guy yeah um again this matters if if and then you know i realized that um um you know my behaving in certain ways made at least certain parents comfortable with this and then they thought okay then chess is good because it you know has great effects on the brain and so let's do that uh then i could see how i had become a role model but it's not something i set out to be or was conscious of till i already realized that i was one i think it's also important as a strong chess player to be normal which sometimes i'm actually scared of how normal you are for being you know because every chess player has like a unique personality they they sometimes in interviews they don't they don't seem like they want to do them or and then i see you in in ads and i see you have a sense of humor and i see the you know the the the the one with you ordering the food and and a bunch of other ones and uh i i think i saw you do an interview in spanish once like where does all this come from and if you ask if you do a survey of any of the other top 15 top 20 chest players who would you have a dinner with they all say you so sorry you have a very long wait list and you might not want to have dinner with all those people so yeah i guess i don't know maybe the question is how how are you so just normal well-rounded and how did you have so much time for all this and um i i guess i just at some point realized that um this is who i am and i can't be otherwise and it's also very good for my chess uh when i'm in this frame of my mind and i'm playing someone who i know will also behave in a certain way and act thing then i feel very relaxed and i can play a good game of chess i'm very easily um that equilibrium is very easily disturbed okay if i have a verbal altercation at the airport or i you know say something to someone and i feel bad about it all these things that i'm fine you then i realize it sits in my head and nags me um i always said that this is not some universal recipe coach i thrived in this sort of situation because okay clearly he had a different background but you know kachai um having three players in the tournament who hated him and he h it back you know it was awesome for his chess uh and so on gary again could handle a certain amount of friction and tension around and he thrived in it um it but i found that this is what suited me best and i stuck to it and um i think i also became very comfortable in um not trying to be someone else i mean sometimes people will ask you um would you like to be more famous this famous that you know things like that but um i think i just became very comfortable in my own skin uh and it worked well for my chess as well so everything kind of aligned and it it's still working well uh speaking of kasparov that was where i was headed next you are one of the unique chess players who has had uh world championship matches and obviously tons of games against kasparov and against magnus uh what is the difference between gary kasparov and magnus carlson well they're both incredibly good both players with a very good score against me and all that [music] um i find magnus more stronger in a certain sense okay but in the sense of doing a lot of things but then it's unfair to gary because there wasn't that much blitz when gary was playing so he never had to a chance to show it but at the same time i think um um magnus is willing to put himself out there he's willing to play bullet he's willing to play fun events you know he's challenging himself in a lot of ways and uh that's very impressive but they both um ridiculously good gary was also slightly more one-sided in in what sense in a narrow sense basically if i had to put one word to it it's the karnik match you know what karnik did to him um is still a very good strategy against gary um and probably could have been applied by some others maybe less well than vaty but you know it could have been done uh with magnus it's much harder and he's also much broader i think gary himself said he's a mixture of fisher and kov and someone else um what was it pasy anyway i think it was fish and car fish and car yeah got more stylistically he's uh broader but they just both very very good i mean you have to um realize how many games you went for against them where you know you really uh felt you had to be your best and then it also put a lot of pressure on you i think it was quite similar against both of them and the other disadvantage for gary is that uh his best results are many years back so you have trouble recalling the impact rather than the you recall the result yeah but you forget how intense it was playing in those events so it's never easy to compare but um that's all i think yeah it's uh it's ultimately a lebron and jordan almost in the sense that one was dominant back in the day uh a lot of people say lebron is you know is the current greatest of all time you do all the players most players still kind of leaning back on gary uh but i don't know if i can specifically just dig a little deeper on some of the things that you said when when you say they're they're so good and you're you're deep maybe 3 four hours into a game uh against gary or against magnus what what is it that ultimately tilts something in their favor is it just purely miscalculation is it stamina is it intuition deep in a game what can ultimately tip that balance i think the the thing is they never they've never stopped trying even if the position has moved away they've never stopped trying and um they win a lot of games quite late in the game okay both of them um again i think stylistically magnus does so in more kinds of positions but this may be unfair to gary because he always got an opening advantage and so he never needed to show those sides i mean he has a good technical side it's just not that evident whereas magnus is in living in an era where there's almost no opening advantage and therefore you see the differentiation much more but they just want something very badly and um especially this habit of uh not coasting to a win to a first place but still trying to win more games is one tra i think both of them shared that i didn't have to the same degree so you know that's something that at some point i realized uh it's easier for me you know if i'm leading the tournament just to play some sensible games and make it uh i mean magnus will do a nine move draw once in a while but most of the time he's still trying gary as well he would often push for a very high score even if the tournament was already out of reach and yes for instance larus 99 he was still huffing and puffing in the last day famously vik can in 2000 um he he had basically won the tournament and uh he was playing judith in the last round mhm in a night off uh and he sacrificed a pawn and he did something great and then afterwards uh they they didn't give them the public prize they gave it to some blunder fest by of morrow so and gary refused the thing he went to the press conference he attacked them this and that and we just all of us laughed because we just thought okay it's gary being gary and at the end of the tournament we're also trying to letting off steam so it was funny but then later gary said something uh funny and illustrative he said um if it had been wishy kik they made a short draw in the last round gone to the press conference and explained what great people they were but i played a full game i mean he's slagging me a bit but anyway um looking back now after a lot of time well i see uh i see that um uh that k of a thing where um what made him just very strong he still wanted to push his limits a lot and both of them uh grew a lot even in the later years they were still i mean again magnus in the present tense gary in the past but yeah okay you get the point both of them are still changing and tweaking and gary was doing this even after he lost his title between 2002 and three i i was bumping into him quite often during the grand chest tour events okay and um so i saw him a couple of times but then again our courses don't um i mean he's more human rights cute these days and then thing and so um we're not opposite color bishops but we're kind of uh missing each other often so we don't bump at each other that much but um yeah i think it's just the level of nostalgia fans have for the great of any sport you know like do they keep in touch do they talk at all they put all behind them i like that opposite colored bishops uh for magnus specifically what was your first impression of magnus carlson do you remember well he was so good when he was so young and already this universal trait was there he could play any kind of position and in fact at in 20067 and all his openings was his obvious weak spot so uh but for the end everything else he seemed resourceful all people always spoke to him spoke about him as if he was the future um they do that a lot i feel like yes but when you are the present the future seems very abstract i mean if you asked me will magnus be world champion one day i always said yes mhm i mean i must have realized it would have to be at my expense but but i would say yes because it was an abstract thought yes he will be one day you know if i allow him was unsaid and something like that so uh he was very good but u there was a period in 2009 and 10 where i simply could not understand how he won so many games mhm um because i was not winning that in as many games as magnus was because i probably stopped trying earlier in the game and that kind of thing but um also my form descended but that's another story [music] um and then by the time we played in the match i understood that he was a favorite i think even vladw was a favorite in 2013 had he qualified in london um and so on but um by the time i played him it just went very fast uh i lost that match and then very quickly think and of course if you look at our uh career since then i've not done badly but magnus is uh just breaking every record possible so i i knew he'd be good in some wg sense but i would would not have penciled in these numbers had you asked me to make any sort of prediction in 2008 and n sure because again you you measure relative to what you're familiar i mean the midplane of all the top gms is somewhere here so you'll push magnum you'll give him a 30 or 40 point pound but he sometimes doing 80 points and 90 points yeah and that is um um well it doesn't you know it's failure of the imagination sometimes what were your expectations going into the 2013 match because he did have a shaky finish to the candidates at least where he lost the last round but so did cr neck so what were your expectations i don't know it's hard for me to believe that i didn't think i at least have some chances and i always thought um as long as i could settle into the match and play and you know do the things the way i normally do it then i don't see why i shouldn't have a chance uh i found it impossible to disregard his strength and um the hardest thing was simply seeing his results against others and my results against others and realizing at some point you can't ignore that data point uh he's winning way too many games against everyone else yeah and i'm not uh and in fact i had a couple of bells so it's um it's a kind of distence it's it sits there but you you try to ignore it and you're not really sure i was um and maybe deep inside uh i had an answer but i never admitted it even to myself um because at some point when your level drops maybe means at some level there's something going on anyway i don't know psycho babble but uh in the when i went into the match i tried to go in with the right attitude i tred to recreate my earlier successes is very much focused on me because that's all i can control and how strong he is we'll figure out later but um i mean the fifth game still felt like a hammer blow cuz i could have i when i look at it now i i still can't believe how did i lose this uh this should be well within my capability to uh not lose and then you know once the fifth went and it went fast but uh again that is the magnus thing he he doesn't stop you know well everyone has felt his ingame magic so um it went very fast and um i've not looked back since so what was uh what were some of the emotions afterward because you're offly won the next candidates which is that's a big deal i mean it's so can you kind of take me through that journey back to the candidates both emotionally also from chess and winning the next match remotiv yourself um so i'll tell you i i finished the match and then um i think it was what 23rd when we finished this game mhm um and because because the match had finished so early uh they had to plan they were not going to wait one week for the closing ceremonies or something i decided to check out of the hotel and go back home and um once i went home um i mean i aill was 2 and a half years old so i just spent some time with him um did not read a newspaper did not turn on the television did not even switch on my computer i didn't want to read another person telling me what i had done and uh i had the feeling if i could hide under the bed long enough uh i had not lost the match that was my mentality so i uh i just didn't um i didn't read anything about chess nothing but i had come it to london but that was fine i knew that um that would be a fun event i went there did decent and then i lost to kramnick sure and um first time i ever lost to him with white i think uh it was a rapid game it was a foreshadow that i was going to anyway but um uh in london and then i had this dinner with flatty where it wasn't like i was really going to stop but the only reason i went to the candidates was i realized that this was the last candidates i wouldn't have to qualify for if i decided not to play it yeah in future i let play world cup and you know la la la mh so i thought well i'm getting uh i normally accept uh good tournaments the candidates is the best um high quality event you're going to be offered in terms of price money and conditions and everything so why would i not accept it if this said if if they just remove the name candidates and they we inviting you to great tournament hunty would you like to play i probably have gone so i thought well i should go to the candidates um but then i had the worst uh one of the worst tournaments uh in zurich at skiwi in january so london happened and moress had um there were a lot of nice conversations i mean vaty and me we went to a pizza express next to the hotel and uh fine dining absolutely and then he um well pizza express is an important place it's also where well google prince andrew and pizza express you'll get the yeah yeah yeah oh you know that one okay so um um and he told me you know in his flatty voice you know why don't do blah blah blah so yeah uh that happened and then um i once bumped into mickey at uh lunch so in the hotel we went to for a quick sandwich and then uh mickey said told me something like uh um yeah it's ridiculous isn't it all these people uh speculating whether you're going to play the candidates or retire i mean why the hell would you not play the candidates and uh anyway i decided to play then i had a terrible tournament in zurich i at some point i i realized i might lose all my games in the rapid i was it the blitz anyway the blitz went badly the classical event went badly saved only by the fact that i managed to beat boris and uh not lose all my games i lost the first two and then um the rapid went badly as well by now i thought this is embarrassing i'm going to go to the candidates and this is going to be humiliating so um and by then you know all sorts of people were coming to me and said are you okay and this is not a fun question to be asked are you okay they should be asking it to krnic now but yeah are you okay is the sort of question where you you if you have to say yes then you're not okay you know it's uh it's pretty reductive anyway um so it was a terrible frame of mind so after zurich finished i once again decided no more chess but then uh this was like february 10th or so it finished so i went to uh my place in frankfurt and um uh i arranged for some uh radic said he would come by okay he was not my he was not going to help me in hunty but radic said he would come by i we played a bundesliga together he said uh he was coming for bundesliga he said i'll come and stay with you a few days and i'll run you through your openings so that at least you know what we prepared for the last match for the candidates i said okay nice very nice he came we did a little bit of work which none of which i applied in the candidates by the way but we did some work and uh then i finished i played this bundesliga weekend and then um um i went home there was like 2 and 1 half weeks before i would go to hunting and once again no chess i just switched everything off and um refused to look at chess and refused to do anything i arrived on the sixth or seventh in hunty because it's again a strange trip you have to go to moscow yeah and then you have to switch airports you have to go to the super domestic airport ah there like three airports and you have to go to the furthest one v yeah and there you have these particular flights to these regional cities and did nobody ever speak to f about having the tournament in moscow it's a really good idea it it could have been a thing but actually hunty worked out uh nicely and um given that hunty was putting up the money i see uh you know that's how it works generally that's how it works yeah um i mean they were the sponsors so um and i got there on the 7th and i asked uh sandipan to come with me uh anyway that's another long story but we were there and uh my idea was i'm going to prepare i knew my i was white against leevon so i said i'm going to let's bang our heads against the marshall for a couple of days and check the berlin on the side and then and then say la so when the event finally started i don't remember which day we played on the 12th or 13th uh i had been um walking around huny for a and huny is seriously cold uh uh it was minus 20 in march it's something i'm not used to it's not a concept i'm used to but anyway it's minus 20 in march and the days when uh it's just ice on the roads but um um this first game i think would have made a bra broken a lot of things but it i actually played a good game i don't know if you've seen it that's one a very good game that i played but he missed a very good chance there is this tactic where he could have uh taken on g 2 in the marshall played a5 because he's attack threatening to trap my bishop so i'll play a4 then he goes rook a6 and is a spectacular stuff it didn't show up easily um but um 2 days later somebody told messaged me m by the way they refuted the line you played against aron and i'd been feeling good for two days because i thought i'd played a very good game and you know finally the work i did for the match paid off or something like that and somebody said you escape narrowly because and i couldn't believe it it was the first time the winning variation had been posted on facebook so i missed it because i was only looking at chest sites wow somebody had put this on facebook that a5 a4 rook a6 was very strong anyway that was one good game and lon was a nightmare opponent so beating him and then um starting with the white pieces beat winning that game was felt really good then i got a double black i drew solidly with papalo um um i played um shaka in round three okay and i won um that very nicely very quickly even he made some inaccuracies i punished them and that and on the first rest day i was uh two and a half out of three leading leading so and you love rest days and i love rest days because um but there is no greater joy in life than to win uh and then have the evening before the rest day because you can have fun yeah and you don't have to feel miserable um and you can indulge yourself because you have time to get back beautiful and hunty i all my winds came on the night before the rest day wow so there were a lot of things like this which uh started to feel very good um but if you ask me honestly i went to hunty just hoping to finish i would have settled for fifth i hope to finish in the top four uh because that was my frame of reference i mean given everything had been going on i just thought if i don't humiliate myself that's that's great so that's a special approach um i would not counsel it to anyone here i would not tell go there just hoping to finish fourth it's not they also haven't lost the world championship match yet it's not brilliant yeah but uh that's a very strange state of mind and once in a while it works brilliantly but you can't make it um um motivational approach so and then i got a i i got back my love of ch i mean sometimes you you need to win some games and just get that feeling um and after hunti generally it was very positive clearly soi didn't work out and then um i had a bad result in grer but i go zurich and you know life goes on in 2015 strangely enough um when i finished um the gashima memorial in 15 and then i uh finished second join second with hikaru in norway i actually was 2815 again or 2816 again yeah yeah yeah which was bizarre because um just one year before i was wondering where you where i should be and here i was uh almost at my rating peak even um but hunty hunty is one of those things where you can't explain it but uh when i think of uh hune just you just remember absolute happiness we're almost that time but i wanted to leave you with one final question do you remember where you were when you realized i guess i kind of know the answer but i'm going to ask the question anyway uh maybe it's not the answer that i'm thinking uh where you were the day you realize computers are here to stay and they will be permanently better than humans and how did you adapt and the answer that i'm thinking is of course deep blue but i feel like there was a bit more than that that might have that might have had asterisks attached definitely deep blue um wasn't that impressive sure that's why yeah and the other problem was we couldn't appreciate how good it was either it clearly was better than we thought it was uh because the the depth of computer answers are something we still struggling to fathom and that point we had no real sense i think the problem again is um we are trying to judge computers but all we have are the tools we have and uh thing but um it could have been anytime in the next two or three years i think already by 2000 i just didn't want to play i mean they were having these irritating one computer playing is one of the participants in some tournament like dortmund it's on and i didn't like this at all and then um because they just thought well they'll make a big fuss about it and anyway what's the point and it's so unpleasant to play uh so that was complete by one or two years um i'm going to go with my match with capo and lon the advanced chess match because we had a real world demonstration of what happens if one person uses an engine and one doesn't yeah essentially because kov refused to learn how to use the software and thing he uh he didn't refuse refuse but you get the point yeah he um they said somebody said anan's playing uh with computer assistant at coo is playing with a high-tech notebook which i liked very much but uh i mean then suddenly you realized how um i mean the gap was huge and and uh i could have beaten i could have beaten him five and a half but it was i beat him 5'1 yeah um and let's go with that it's a nice memory for me so let's go with that advance j yeah i was fascinated doing some research over the last few years just conjuring up new content for the for the chess fans and i found these advanced chess masters and i was sort of blown away that uh that was legalized cheating uh way back when so around 2000 2000 2001 is sort of when you uh you had that realization no the match with kao was 9 so i would have to go so i suspect very soon afterwards we realized it could have been any number of sharp positions where suddenly the computer shows your line and you and you look at the end of it and you think okay i can never compete against this yeah it it disappeared very fast so deep blow wasn't clear enough because we had very little access to it but then everything else went incredibly fast vishy i uh just want to say thank you for your time an hour flew by so thank you so much for joining me thanks a lot if i ever start a podcast again maybe you'll join it'll be a two three hour conversation but for now um we'll sign off thank you thank you
