foreign welcome back to talk tech with tiff in this 
episode i sat down with margaux who is the   global community director at toptal we talked 
everything freelance she works with the top three   percent freelancers at toptal and she shared all 
the details and advice she would have for anyone   who is looking to get into freelancing also too 
i linked down my newsletter below so make sure to   go check it out alright let's get into it welcome 
to my new series called talk tech with tiff where   i am sitting down with industry professionals to 
hear about their career journeys and current roles   i created this series to hear from people who 
are established in the tech industry so that we   can all learn what these individuals do in their 
day-to-day jobs and the type of opportunities that   are out there okay let's get started hi margo 
how are you today hi good thank you how are   you jeff i am good i am impressed with you that 
you you made it here so seamlessly you literally   came right from a flight to here from the from 
the flight from winnipeg all the way here not   too far i know during a very busy weekend with 
crazy traffic but you made it we made it here we   are i know well i'm very excited to have you here 
today i uh uh have i'm very familiar with toptal   it's the number one freelancing platform in in 
my opinion and i think uh the general that's a   general consensus as well but before we jump into 
everything toptal and freelancing related tell me   a little bit about yourself and your career that 
led you to to toptal yeah okay well i've always   worked in kind of a community building type of 
function or maybe people would be more familiar   with calling it kind of community engagement so 
that's you know marketing and sales and events   and and bringing people together over various 
things um and then over the years gone into   the tech industry doing the same kind of fun 
functions in the tech industry i was working   for certain associations helping a lot of tech 
companies i had a podcast interviewing startups   and tech companies and so it all kind of melded 
together until i came to top talent so just before   i was a program director running big programs 
across the province i was in when i came to   toptal the role that i have now is the director 
of community globally my job now is to engage a   group of toptal talent so people might think of 
them as freelancers or contractors right that are   vetted and inside our network and my team and i 
try and do whatever we can to really engage them   and make them feel like part of a community make 
them feel like there's part of something larger so   that they can kind of find this sense of belonging 
and feel connected to other people in our network   even though they're spread out all over the world 
right thousands and thousands of these freelancers   and so with an organization like toptal when 
you're inside those walls and you make it in   the network after screening you know what i'm 
sure we'll talk about what that looks like but   um then you have kind of other people that are 
like you they're the top three of freelancers   of developers designers project managers 
product managers and some finance people too   um and so the we call those are verticals 
so once they're in then they want to find   like-minded peers right so my team in community is 
responsible to allow them those opportunities to   connect with each other so programs events online 
chat all those kind of things anything that gives   them that sense of belonging and connection to 
other people and ultimately then to toptal as   well that's incredible i love that you know the 
company really takes the extra step in building   that community it's not necessarily just okay now 
you're a freelancer and you're kind of in your own   silo it's no let's build this community connect 
with one another that's huge yeah it's such a big   difference like i think there are platforms people 
can just kind of like jump into online but you're   not going to get that same that same camaraderie 
because we're actively like our team is actively   working on ways to help people connect like that 
also i think just knowing that people are vetted   in the highway that we do to kind of like get past 
those walls and get into the network at toptal i   think it gives you a certain like comfort level 
in the type of peers that you're going to start   interacting with i think people see it as a 
little more valuable right like it's a very   valuable network around the world of high level 
professionals living the same kind of lifestyle   you are as a freelancer exactly you know that 
the individuals you will be connecting with are   i don't know if it's the right word but like at 
your level almost or as experienced as you or   that quality is there yeah exactly and toptal's 
really been investing in that since the beginning   i've only been there a few years myself but the 
community team always did exist which is really   nice to see sometimes it takes companies a while 
to kind of like add that to their radar and a lot   of big companies are doing it now community jobs 
are becoming more and more prominent um so it's   really exciting for for the industry on that side 
for me and then really great that i've found an   organization that really values that oh 100 and i 
know you throughout learning more about yourself   and your career you you've kind of explained about 
what toptal is but for those who might not be as   familiar with troptel how would you describe it 
to someone it's on-demand talent so this means   that we have the top talent we can provide them 
on demand like immediately to the top clients   around the world and so you know one thing that we 
talk about is that there are amazing very talented   people all over the world you know and think of 
like small countries you know that maybe you don't   even know where they're located it right um but 
there's in those countries there's not necessarily   always that same level of opportunity all over 
the world right and then flip that coin we've   got clients that are pretty big sometimes that are 
not in the biggest cities always right we've got   fortune 500 companies and that are based in big 
cities and maybe they can find enough talent but   there's a there's a demand for talent right now 
right and there has been for a while especially   high level tech talent so the other side of that 
coin too is that clients might be in regular sized   cities not finding enough talent there's this 
amazing talent in other countries like ready and   available and they are they can work on your hours 
they can shift things around right they don't have   to physically be in the office so once this is 
like this marketplace is so important now to   fill roles both directions right people can get 
amazing rules and stay in their city or country   where their family is where they want to live and 
our clients can get access to the top talent that   just may not happen to have been in their city 
100 it's and i know you mentioned this made me   think about it is uh you know the freelancers can 
work on preferred hours but on the flip side of   things just from a personal experience i work with 
a freelancer who is you know located in in europe   and works completely different hours than i do 
and in that situation i actually really enjoy   it because i give the work and the tasks and then 
when i wake up in the morning it's all complete so   there's that side too which is you know it depends 
what what the company wants but um yep it can   really really go both ways with being beneficial 
yeah of course and our clients can dictate that   up front so for certain organizations it's very 
important that that talent be available on their   time zone for the you know meetings that they 
have for the stand-ups they have every week the   touch base is that's all still totally appropriate 
and expected so if you are planning on you know   looking at this as an industry you can't just 
think well i'll do anything i want all the time   and show up when i want to like no there's still 
obviously specific expectations and our clients   can dictate those sometimes they do want people 
in their city and so we'll find them that right   talent in their city but most of the time it's 
okay for them to be located wherever they are so   long as they meet certain expectations and an 
hour like brackets that our clients will note   in advance they know what they're signing up 
for you know and then everybody wins exactly   it's a win-win i have i'm going to reference 
here because you know the topic of freelancing   itself is i mean i get so many questions around 
freelancing and i don't want to miss anything so   i'm going to look at my notes here for some other 
questions so one of the questions i had is a round   screening process so when i go on toptal it's the 
top three percent of freelancers on your platform   for someone who is you know could you provide some 
insight into what this process entails and what   potential freelancers can expect when they are 
going in for this interview or screening process   yeah i mean i think the screening process is the 
most daunting part and the thing that most people   that are looking to work in this kind of world 
of contract work are really curious about um we   definitely screen for various things so we screen 
for subject matter expertise of course like do you   know your skill inside and out professionalism 
overall so you know are you coming to your   meetings on time and when you're supposed to are 
you dressed appropriately is your background an   appropriate background because if it's not for 
your screening it's probably not going to be for   our clients either right things like that and of 
course their communication skills so as much as   we do have talent in over 80 countries around the 
world um english language proficiency is of course   an important part of it so that's kind of like 
high level i can talk through the process a little   bit more too as far as like the common questions 
that we get when it comes to our screening and   you know a lot of this can be found on our website 
like we don't hide what the process looks like i   think maybe sometimes people are just excited they 
move fast you know but the the first level really   is language and personality it's like intake 
screening kind of like you'd have for a normal job   usually people talk to like a recruiter up front 
before they get anywhere near the actual hiring   manager right and they're just kind of screening 
that that first level so for us we say about like   30 we'll pass that okay so there's still there's 
still a pretty strict rate right off the bat right   of what we're looking for then from there we do 
an in-depth skill review that could also be stuff   that's like um that we're not necessarily watching 
you do but there's certain tests you have to pass   right and there's practice tests you can do not 
with us necessarily but other organizations like   we're not giving away what our tests are obviously 
yeah um and then now we're down to like you know   half of that are making it through yes um then 
we have a live screening process so this is like   doing an activity proving your skill in front 
of eighth grader yes um so they can actually   see you and really like you know kind of like you 
remember when you were in school there's sometimes   tests where like the teacher just really wants to 
see what how you think like how did you problem   solve that thing right you might not get through 
the whole thing in the time allotted but at least   they can see your problem solving skills and how 
you attack it exactly so that's kind of what that   ages like depending on what skill you have how in 
demand it is what you know where the market's at   certain skills will also have some will and 
some won't have a larger project required so   something that you take home could be like one to 
three weeks long that you spend on this project   so there's an investment in time to get into the 
toptal network sometimes people are wait listed   sometimes people have to try again they don't make 
it through we might give them an amount of time   before we ask them to come back maybe they need 
to upscale in certain areas but otherwise like you   know the the top three percent are who we take so 
that has to filter out a lot of people along the   way right our clients have a certain expectation 
from us and so but people can try again i think   that's an important thing to note and it's 
really typically not a spot for people that   are kind of right coming out of school because 
all of those things we need you to pass like you   just probably don't have enough experience 
yet right yes exactly it's for you know get   that experience first whether it be through you 
know freelancing on a smaller scale working for   a company and then when you really want to take 
your career to the next level with freelancing   and have experience that is when you go 
to your platform exactly i love that yep   based on your experience is there so you talk 
about the screening process is there a particular   skill or characteristic that seems to be a common 
denominator among the most successful freelancers   that you've seen i mean you uh toptal interacts 
or has the top three percent is there a skill or   characteristic that seems consistent yeah i mean 
like we just said of course first you have to be   incredibly well versed in your skill set i think 
some people come in sometimes too and like well   can i also be this and this and this and this 
and this within the network yeah yes if you're   truly the top three percent at all those things 
you can yeah otherwise maybe start with one get   into the network with the one that is your true 
top skill and then you can apply to be a part of   other verticals we call them right like or other 
skills you can you can challenge the different   skills and then add them on to your repertoire and 
then see more and more jobs available with us yes   um so so that's kind of a piece of it but other 
than the obvious of technical skills um i mean   problem solving to come back to that is really so 
so important because we have we're an on-demand   talent marketplace it means that we have clients 
that we're sending you out to you know tomorrow or   in two days and we the client expectation is that 
you can jump in and help solve their problem yes   so it's literal like being a problem solver is 
what you are literally doing and you have to do   it relatively quickly like you have to be able 
to jump in and assess the problem clearly find   the ways to help and i think the tricky other 
side of the coin of that sometimes is you've   got people that jump in ready to help they're 
they have this agile kind of personality also   an important kind of buzzword there in the skills 
that they need the ability to be kind of agile   um but is to really also like listen to and see 
what the problem truly is i think sometimes when   we're really really skilled you know maybe you and 
i even have done it in certain areas of our lives   you want to come in with a solution right away 
right and and i literally just said you have to   do that but on the flip side of it is you know did 
you truly take a minute though first to understand   what the problem is a hundred percent because i'm 
sure well i'll speak from my experience sometimes   when you're freelancing or consulting you the 
client can at some point say something but   that might not actually be or how do you say it 
the client might be asking for something but it   might be a little bit more you need to uncover to 
really understand what the problem is or what you   are trying to solve so that listening aspect 
is so essential yep yeah and so so listening   communication like we just said and really at 
the end of the day like if you're in the toptal   network our talent are upholding the highest 
levels of integrity and professionalism along with   that communication that's really required because 
that's what we're expecting of everybody in the   relationships that we're putting together i love 
that it's quality over quantity exactly yeah so   how critical do you believe i mean i think we just 
answered this but the next question i was going   to ask you is around communication how critical 
is effective communication i mean we speak a lot   about technical skills and and uh how important 
those are in various roles that are on toptal for   example but where would you put communication 
on that that scale yeah i mean this is like we   did just talk about it but it is like i can add 
to it because i think there's this um you know   frequency of notion sometimes that really highly 
skilled technical people are like in a dark room   coding by themselves right and it's like if i'm 
the best at this i can get into the toptal network   okay yes you need to have really high skills we 
just talked about that but if you don't also have   that communication piece right it's just you're 
you're not gonna make it i yes right because that   isn't that is not how it exists right there are 
still absolutely expectations and check-ins and   meetings and there's a project manager or somebody 
a product manager that you're gonna have to check   in your work with and show your work and you have 
to be able to speak up two if um if something's   gone wrong say there's a bug say there's a hold up 
say there's something that's going to set you back   the biggest thing even when i was in private 
tech industry and then what happens here there's   a there's this same hurdle sometimes which is 
there can be very skilled people and sometimes   um even it can be cultural as well but remembering 
to speak up when there's going to be a delay is so   important feeling like bold enough to do that 
that's that big piece of communication right   because a client's not going to be frustrated or 
even your boss if you're again if you're working   in a regular environment like a client's not going 
to be frustrated if there is a delay so long as   they understand why it is and know about it but 
if you don't communicate that and then there's a   delay and you say well i kind of knew this whole 
time because this didn't happen this but you   didn't communicate it on time now they're going to 
be frustrated now you've put yourself in hot water   100 and i think even uh you know communication 
is important regardless whether you're working   on a team or freelancing but i'm sure freelancing 
it really takes it to the next level because when   you are a freelancer you you're not necessarily 
telling this information to your boss who will   then communicate it to the client you are the 
boss you are are the one who's communicating it   to the client so it becomes even more important 
yep yeah and like and depending on what kind of   um project that you're on with us you may 
be with a group of peers where one of them's   reporting up and you just have to report into 
that person you know it might be that you're   the one constantly giving updates but really 
like if you want the most successful career   as a talent in the marketplace like we offer at 
toptal then and and even independently there's   there's definitely a very high expectation 
on the ability to communicate your skills   up front and then also your what you're working 
on at the time yes communication is is key yep   it was soft skills we can't get away from home 
tiff i know we can't we really can't i you know   and i've i've had a i remember earlier on in 
my career when i was first starting out for   and doing some software engineering roles it 
was so often i would push off the soft skill   questions like practicing them and focus on 
the code lee code code code and then come   to the interview and you know fine i do well on 
that but then the soft skill question is like oh   really should have spent more time on that because 
you think i think sometimes we think that soft   skills or you know whether it's in an interview 
or soft skills in general just come naturally and   to some people they do but for others it's just 
like technical skills it's a muscle that you need   to really practice and continue to grow yeah i'm 
sure you've heard that great quote that's going   around which is that like ai is not going to take 
your job a person who's really skilled using ai is   going to take your job right and that that i think 
sums it up right there it's like there's still a   person behind it who knows the right um prompt 
to put in and who can communicate the results to   the client to that person right like that's all i 
think that's such a funny one and it kind of in a   way like personifies what we're talking about 100 
i like that that's a good that's a good parallel   uh is there a particular strategy or approach 
that you've observed that helps top freelancers   uh effectively manages their work-life balance 
and i think this question really kind of relates   to the communication piece in around delays 
sometimes people get nervous or don't want to   say anything about delays and then in turn their 
personal life goes out the window so what is a   strategy or pro approach that you've seen work 
yeah i mean there's i guess there's a couple   ways we can we can talk about this topic but i 
think in general when we're thinking about people   who want to take on this contract lifestyle this 
freelance lifestyle and how do they then make sure   they don't just work 80 hours a week or you know 
or not make enough money or whatever right there's   there's all these fears that i think are common um 
i think first of all joining an organization like   toptal has a lot of value and again like to opt 
out because there are you know there are options   out there but toptal is of course the biggest 
like we talked about the beginning um but the   what we do that's unique is that we take away that 
whole piece of needing to focus on like accounts   receivable marketing and selling yourself finding 
the new clients right if you're independently   freelancing you have to do all of those things 
on top of the thing that you're really good at   right say that's c-sharp programming or whatever 
the thing is right that you're really good at   um and so when you join a network like ours you 
can forget about all that stuff and really focus   on the piece that you're really good at and 
that you love and so yeah and so right away   that allows you more balance because you're doing 
the piece that you love most you're not focused   on these extra things that take away from that 
work yes and i think people can become like a   lot more relaxed in their work as well because of 
that and then on top of that you get a community   right which we started by talking about which is 
which is my role my passion of course but i think   that also helps with that balance because you find 
like-minded peers you find a place that you belong   in where you can find other people to really talk 
to about those things you love you know i use this   example sometimes of just like an easy example to 
think of if you're in toronto okay and you love   3d printing and you're really good at it you want 
to start some new project right but none of your   friends here are really into it like you know or 
you're you know you're traveling and working at   the same time because you're a contractor yeah 
and then over in moldova there's a there's a 3d   printing expert and they want to work on the exact 
same kind of project as you right if you're in a   community like toptal we have a channel about 3d 
printing where you can find each other and events   virtually that we host so you meet each other and 
so then you can find these like-minded people that   have the exact same like skill set knowledge 
interest you know desire for a new project   that you do but they just don't physically live 
right next to you uh 100 and it goes back to you   have this community that is the best of the best 
so on top of being able to network with them i'm   sure there's a lot of learnings as well like hey 
did you discover this oh i just found this and   it just continues to elevate you and your skill 
sets yep yeah exactly i mean we have channels   called like share your work or share your gear 
like so people you know what mic are you using   when you have meetings with clients like whatever 
that thing is that you might want to talk about   whatever your interest is there's a spot in our 
network because we have thousands and thousands of   amazing talent from around the world right and so 
you know we were talking about work-life balance   but it's like i think when you find a community it 
can like relax you into it there's really common   questions about taxes when you're starting to be 
a freelancer that people struggle with sometimes   um and then when you have peers in your city or 
in your region we also have you know areas to   connect you based on geography you can ask those 
questions to your peers hey who did you use what   products what you know solutions did you find you 
have someone you can recommend to me to help me   um because if you are totally independent again 
not in a network like toptal you don't have access   to those kind of peers knowledge exactly it's 
almost like you are on an island by yourself   if you don't have that and you know going back to 
as well you should be focusing on what you are an   expert in and what you are passionate about you 
know when you are freelancing i think that's one   of the things that sways a lot of people from 
freelancing is well i want to focus and be an   expert in programming not an accountant or not 
uh whatever the case is so being able to really   slowly focus on your uh skill set and what you are 
good at is going to help elevate you and grow your   career faster yeah yeah absolutely there was even 
an example we i love the topic of women in tech   i didn't mention this in my intro but i do a lot 
of stuff on the side to support women in tech and   toptal's doing a lot of things they enable me to 
do as well which is really great but there was a   really wonderful woman in our network who i spoke 
to last year at web summit actually okay and we   were talking about freelancing and how it's been 
for her since she's been in the toptal network   and she was telling me that when she was pregnant 
she was worried about contracting because it man   really not necessarily any matte leave coverage 
right okay yes but what was really amazing was   you can set your hours to whatever you want them 
to be so if you want to be 20 hours a week you can   just set your hours in a network like ours to 20 
hours a week and so what she did was set it to 60   hours a week which we don't always recommend you 
have to definitely like have earned that ability   to do that and work more than the average but you 
know at 40 50 60 kind of thing so she what she did   was really ramped up made worked really hard and 
really focused leading up to her time off because   she had that flexibility and that ability to do 
so and then when she went on mat leave really it's   like she didn't have that obvious coverage but she 
had a little bit of like a nest egg that she had   built for herself because you can do that right 
and the other thing to note like that those hours   don't necessarily all have to be with us like 
there is we don't have an exclusivity clause so   you can have your own clients on the side that you 
you maybe came in already having say right now you   have a client they reduced your hours to 10 hours 
a week 20 hours a week you're thinking you know i   really want to supplement that somewhere you can 
still apply to be part of the toptal network and   come in and then just just put an availability 
with us of the other 20 right so there's this   flexibility where yeah so you can get partly you 
know someone you're already used to at home then   you don't want to sell yourself you want to find 
new ones you come to us for that in between wow   yeah that's really interesting and you can turn 
up the dial when you're ready to right if you want   all of a sudden 40 because you know that client's 
gone then turn it up yeah it really sounds like   you are in charge of your career you really 
are i think that could be a misconception too   of like what happens in these networks you set 
your hours you set your hours like the amount   of hours and also the hours you are physically 
available throughout the day yes and you also   set your rate ah oh wow yeah and i think that's 
a misconception there you set your rate so if you   think you deserve eighty dollars an hour 100 an 
hour that's what you get yeah yeah anything any   other fees and stuff that work they work on top of 
that and outside of that yeah we don't take from   your amount if you ask brady 80 an hour that's 
what you're taking if you're booking that client   or whatever the client might be sometimes clients 
will be less or more and we'll ask you if there's   if you you know if you want to accept something 
that's more or less i'm sure more people are going   to say yes yeah but uh but right so so that's 
how it works wow that's amazing i i love that   that's incredible it's it's a goal of mine now to 
be on your platform yeah there's there's a lot of   agency there yeah uh well you know speaking about 
you kind of just shared one but uh around success   stories is there a success story about a few 
freelancer who's been part of the community   for a while now that you'd want to share yeah i 
mean gosh it's hard there are definitely so many   and i think a lot of them have a similar backstory 
so yeah definitely and moldova must be on my mind   because i just use that an example and there's 
this woman i was just thinking of who's not   the the example i just gave you her name's elena 
okay and she was in moldova okay and she was fine   and she worked for a company that was physically 
located there and i think she had a bit of hybrid   toward the end but was you know was physically 
located in that country and i think she was   finding that well she was an executive at the same 
time too she had a background in like developing   a whole sales department she was an executive in 
sales then she actually was the executive director   like the ceo of a startup she took a startup from 
i think nine people to like 150 people she exited   the startup but was still like as a consultant for 
them so we're talking like senior people on our   network right i think again like misconception 
of who's in there like we have barry we have   authors and investors and like founders we have 
all kinds of people so she exits this startup   and because she was working like 15 hours a day 
she had a family that she was like admittedly   not seeing really yeah right felt like she was 
just in a place where she had accomplished a lot   but was kind of like what am i what am i doing 
like and i would and she really wanted to be   also experiencing working with people outside of 
just moldova and again kind of a common story here   like this is a real story i'm telling you but a 
lot of them sound so similar yeah they're like i   wanted to travel or i wanted to get out of the you 
know funk i was in yeah so then she um applies to   toptal gets in the network gets on a long-term 
client so she's not having to like get you know   part-time here and there little gigs we have 
many clients that are long-term engagements as   well so she's been on it for i think a year and a 
half now on that same engagement wow yep and it's   a it's a company that saves lives in the medical 
industry and that was something she was personally   passionate about but didn't really feel like there 
was an opportunity for her to go into that kind of   work where she was so on top of that she gets to 
work with this organization that she's genuinely   passionate about and then finds she has still more 
because she's not working 15 hours a day anymore   like she was she has time for extra stuff so now 
with toptal with the community stuff that we do   in my department she's volunteering with mentors 
without borders an organization that we support   yeah she was we built a virtual hospital in africa 
for health gateway africa trust we helped them as   part of that project through our top volunteer 
program we call it where we have top talent like   her contribute to organizations like that so she 
helped to build this virtual hospital as a product   manager project manager and all that on top of 
this role that she felt truly passionate about   and moved to madrid because her and her family 
wanted to live somewhere else so during early in   that process she moved to madrid where she wanted 
to live being in madrid she joined the like google   startups organization that's physically located 
there and goes to some of their training to   upskill herself because she has time to do that 
on top of everything else so it's like literally   her life became everything that she was looking 
for by switching by taking that leap and coming   into the freelance world but again she's working a 
normal 40 hour week full-time client it's not this   scary like there's a lot of 40-hour opportunities 
i think that's another misconception that people   think with contract work and on being an on-demand 
marketplace it sounds so fulfilling too being able   to gain that time back uh and you know as you 
mentioned volunteer in other areas as well and   use that time for things that are more fulfilling 
than working 15-hour days for example for the same   pay if not less you know i mean like yeah exactly 
wow yeah i love that that example almost gives me   chills yeah it's exciting it is really exciting 
it's in madrid i mean come on right i mean i won't   say that like on the core team like the staff of 
cocktail 2 we also can be located anywhere in the   world so this narrative you know is something that 
i also feel personally and i'm very happy to be a   part of um because you can work from anywhere 
now right you can exactly there's no there's   no need for yep i know i don't know why you and 
i are both located in places that are very cold   in the winter they're not wrong family i think 
at the end of the day it's all family i agree   um well on that note of 40 hour work weeks or 
long-term clients i should say uh what is the   dynamics between freelancers and top companies 
do freelancers have toptal tend to form long-term   partnerships i know you kind of spoke about 
uh this example a long-term partnership with   a single company or is it more common to work 
with a range of different companies yep yeah we   certainly have both you know because you 
can set your hours to different amounts   um you know that can vary what you're open to but 
as far as like from the client side what we see   we we certainly see a mix of both we have some 
clients that want a whole team of people from us   so we're putting together kind of a toptal team 
if you will and then we deliver like you know 10   people or 20 people to to work on a project until 
it's completion so we're actually like delivering   an outcome for you say someone says we want to 
build a fan engagement app for our sports team you   know we want to look like this go do it like we 
don't know maybe they don't know what they need so   certain clients might say we don't does that mean 
we need a react developer and a designer or do we   need ux ui do we need a project like you know they 
might not know yeah so sometimes they just want   the outcome and we we deliver a whole team that 
works on it for months and months until that thing   is done and we'll scope it obviously and help them 
up front we have a whole like matching team and   team that's go help scope and then on the opposite 
side there might be people who just say we want   to just supplement our team we want one person or 
maybe two people and here's the functions because   we already have a good team but we want to pivot 
fast we don't have time to hire a machine learning   expert in our city because there's not one and 
by the time we hire we're going to be behind the   eight ball you know we're going to be delayed so 
could we just get that from you right away in that   case you might just be kind of by yourself working 
with that team like one toptal working in you know   inside that company's team for a period of time 
so there's a huge mix sometimes clients maybe   might be in like a hiring freeze but they can work 
with agencies like ours an organization like ours   to get that on-demand talent so there's a big 
mix of when people are using us and sometimes   those those freezes or those opportunities or that 
need to innovate can last a long time you know so   sometimes we have like multi-year long engagement 
that for those talent eventually it kind of feels   like that's who they work for and that's their 
full well not kind of it does that's who they work   for ultimately right but their pay is still coming 
through toptal and they're still on our platform   we can keep an eye on what's going on in the other 
jobs and in marketplace that's right because we   have you know the job board they can look at um 
and then some you know like jumping from gig to   gig and that's kind of the really cool opportunity 
in a way if that's the lifestyle you want to live   right yes variety of moving around yeah sometimes 
they want to work on an engagement for a couple   months and go to the beach for a few months relax 
turn there and then turn the dial back on you know   that dial we're talking about right they turn 
their hours off and when they're ready they turn   it back on exactly it sounds so much more i think 
you know especially in uh this past year working   for people who are working at uh you know whether 
it be startups or really even large companies   there's always that you know with the layoffs 
happening as of recent there's always that fear   of oh i'm going to be unemployed or i'm gonna have 
to find another job with what you're describing i   think it would take for me anyways a lot of that 
those fears away because knowing i'm part of this   amazing network this community that if this gig 
is only five or six months then there will be   other opportunities that toptal will connect 
me with and that i don't know is someone who   gets anxious over that stuff that sounds really 
valuable yeah i mean at the end of the day the   the the answer is that every marketplace can see 
fluctuations yes right like even within ours but   um there is certainly that benefit of the 
fact that we don't have exclusivity you can   get clients on the side you can change the dial 
with us when you're ready to you can see the jobs   coming through so if there is a shift starting 
to happen you can also see it right because we   have this like this platform for you you have 
peers in there that you can talk to and relate to   and understand what's going on maybe it's regional 
maybe it's your skill set you know maybe it's your   rate that you're at that's a really amazing thing 
too i will add we have a whole team at toptal that   are called the talent coaching team okay their job 
is to support talent with coaching in different   situations so are they are they never getting 
past the interview stage okay maybe you need some   coaching on how you're coming across in interviews 
come to one of our workshops schedule a one-on-one   with a coach who will whose whole career has been 
executive coaching and coaching people and they'll   look at your profile for you and help see like oh 
maybe you need to enhance here or maybe you need   to practice this skill right same with rates 
like they might look and go okay i get where   you're at but just to let you know you know there 
are 20 other people that have many more years of   experience than you at the exact same rate so we 
empower you you can keep your rate where it is but   we can see that you might it might be challenging 
for you and so they'll give you that one-on-one   conversation in time and that's really unique 
with our network too not a lot of like you know   you're not going to find another platform that 
has that same ability and like whole broad team   to help you with that so i think you know those 
kind of things again like keep setting you apart   but also allow you to be a little more confident 
in your career as an on-demand talent that is   so valuable it's yet you don't hear of that 
ever yeah wow i mean it didn't exist a few   years ago for us either yeah like it's evolution 
and we see what's necessary we hear that feedback   and we continue to grow yeah i love that it's so 
important what advice would you offer to someone   who you know listening to this conversation i 
i mean i'm sitting here speaking with you and   i want to go apply to toptal tomorrow so i'm sure 
people who are watching this are feeling the same   and what advice would you give someone who is 
contemplating a career in freelancing is there   any insights that you have gained through having 
conversations with these top freelancers yep   i mean i think the first question that i'd 
have people ask themselves is are you typically   motivated by having a task or order given to you 
and then you going and doing it or are you more   interested in a more consultative approach where 
you're really someone who's energized by like   helping find that solution and by kind of are you 
someone who's always going to be two steps ahead   or do you need someone to kind of give you those 
orders if you're that first example of kind of   needing a task given to you it you might find it 
a little tougher to be in the world of freelancing   because there is a certain expectation that you're 
going to be you know better than the rest getting   the job done problem solving in tandem with what 
those clients needs are and really listening right   certainly we have some of both we do have some 
clients who are like i need this thing can you   check it off the list you know absolutely so so 
there is still totally an option for you but i   think it's important to know kind of where you sit 
within that and then accept the projects only that   fit you within that that's exactly and i think 
that's something that you you know going back to   you mentioned earlier that when you are applying 
to toptal it's more so when you have experience uh   have a few years of experience or maybe quite 
a few years of experience uh so i think that   is something that you learn about yourself with 
that experience which is a good thing as well   yep yeah and then i think the other common thing 
that we get from people is questions about taxes   and things like that yes so we have again we have 
people in over 80 countries around the world in   different cities and regions i think of even 
like we're in canada right yeah even province   to province that information is different exactly 
so i think like if someone's considering getting   into the world of being a contractor i would say 
start by understanding that yourself in your own   city with your like local people that you know you 
know talk to a tech specialist an accountant talk   to a lawyer if you're not sure about that piece 
of it before you kind of jump into this world   because you know we can't necessarily fix that 
for you later like you still have to have your   own agency in that regard and that's a big common 
question that we get so i think it's like look   into what that means for you financially because 
it is different you can sometimes benefit from   taxes of writing off part of your house space 
that you little kid and your coffee and your   your car you know allowance and things like that 
but um just understand that a little more before   you maybe jump in with both feet just so that you 
feel really comfortable and you and your family   are set up and safe you know because we wouldn't 
want anyone to misunderstand that aspect of it   100 equip yourself with that knowledge before 
jumping into something yeah exactly margo i   always end these uh conversations with the same 
question which is what is some advice that you   would give to your younger self yeah this i love 
i love this one and it always you know different   things come to mind i think like silly things 
sometimes that you would tell yourself tiff but   um so i mentioned in the beginning i used to host 
a podcast too and ours was about interviewing the   founders of startups about what their journey 
in canada was like starting and growing and   scaling a business and whenever we ask them 
for like what came to mind quickly of advice   that they would have for other entrepreneurs 
it's something that i think we could take into   this because you know it's a bit entrepreneurial 
what we're talking about here and it came to mind   for me when you asked this question and that's 
um their advice was always just start and it's   like it's the simplest thing our show is called 
the start canada podcast like for that reason   um but just start i think it's this idea that like 
if you were to not be able to do something one day   or one day you die okay of course eventually 
we're all gonna get there no one ever was like   in those last moments thinking that thing i 
did i wish i didn't do it and you know i wish   i didn't try right if there's something that you 
want to achieve if there's something that you're   interested in going for maybe that's becoming a 
freelancer right maybe that's what you're thinking   of just start like take those steps right when i 
said you can change your dial with us right it's   like you don't have to go both feeding 100 
full-time freelancer tomorrow right you can   work your way through our screening process get 
into the network find out where your skills are   in demand which one of them right and then start 
to turn that dial on before you quit your day job   right so so i think like it applies so much here 
but is something that like if i went back to tell   myself i might look at it from a different angle 
a little bit but that idea of like just start is   still just so important we're all held back by 
like i hear it literally all the time i'm sure   you have friends too that go like well margo you 
know it must be nice to travel all the time like   you because you have this job where you can work 
from anywhere or whatever i'm like have you asked   if you could work from somewhere else to your 
boss like just start take the little step start   exactly oh it could be applied to it could apply 
to everything yes yes i don't have any tattoos   and i'm not planning on getting any but if i 
did maybe it would be just start on the palm   of my head or something right yeah like once 
you're up and running with that thing you're   never gonna think like i wish i didn't try exactly 
yeah i love it that's such a great way to end this   conversation just start just start i'm going to 
link all toptal's information down below because   i'm sure there's a ton of people who now want 
to just start but uh thank you for taking time   to connect with me today margaux thanks for 
having me tiff it was a pleasure thank you [music] foreign [music]
