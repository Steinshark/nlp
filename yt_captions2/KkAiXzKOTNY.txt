don't you hate it when you shell out extra money to get a worse experience well honestly that's how i've felt about these and bright and smart motion dimmers because ge in their infinite wisdom ships them out of the box with all of the motion sensors not only active but instantly active so you can run into situations see that where you go to turn off the light walk away from it and as you're moving away the bloody thing turns back on because and this is a feature not a bug they have a'0 degree motion sensing radius thankfully because these are z-wave devices we have the solution we should by the end of this video be able to reconfigure these smart switches to disable the fade on and off functionality that i personally find kind of annoying set up remote control including voice control create groupings so that multiple zones can be turned on and off at the same time with a single command and decouple the motion sensing from the light switch functionality so that it could potentially be used for other automations and not for the lights in areas where that would be pretty annoying like the bedroom you know you roll over to get more comfortable light goes on it's not great i've had to paper over every bedroom light switch just like i'm papering over this segway to our sponsor zoho desk over 50 000 businesses worldwide trust zoho's context aware help desk to improve productivity and ensure their customers are kept happy get 50 off your annual subscription with the code zdesk50 at the link below [music] our story begins today in the server room where these motion sensing light switches have actually been amazing there are parts of the house where i'm not going to want to disable that functionality like bathrooms hallways and utility spaces like this one and the garage but we definitely need to fine-tune the behavior a little bit because the way it is now where it only stays on for a couple of minutes and then the second it turns off it's active again means that i will oftentimes try to turn off the light and in walking away from it have the bloody thing turn back on it's a motion sensor you don't have to shut it off fortunately jake has the solution and it is a raspberry pi where did it go i have no idea i've been trying to find it where did you put it you moved it i didn't move it it was just chilling here he is such a liar yeah but it was something it was still like here no you moved it you used a different oh i know it's in the land center hopefully ah there it is i should know that because i put it there now the role of a raspberry pi in this situation is just a stand-in to run home assistant which is like the piece of software that's going to tell hey light switch do that thing other light switch do that thing air conditioner do that yeah light switches work together the intention long term is for that to go on your nas as like a docker container or something uh sort of it runs as a vm because it runs its own docker containers that's like the plugins and hosts it's pretty cool mind blown but for now it's on a raspberry pi i can't connect to it though for some reason did you unplug anything in there not that i know hey look we're in business nice we actually have one device already adopted and it's that one oh that's why that one doesn't dim on and off did you change it no that's just because this light fixture doesn't dim oh but we can go in here here look at this there's like no delay that's actually pretty awesome there's a vacancy mode so i guess you can turn on the light when somebody leaves that doesn't make sense you would want it on when nobody's there no motion there's clearly a lot for us to learn about these i'm glad we bought a hundred of them let's go vacancy mode okay okay let's walk out here we go and then so what theoretically in five seconds it'll turn on something like that nope okay well definitely more research required into what that value does what else we got here enable and disable whether motion sensor only turns on if the room is dark oh see i was in the bathroom yeah and i was thinking jake remember how i was like hey we should make it so that it's tied into a light sensor outside or the time of day and hold on hold on and if i press the switch it actually opens up a smart blind instead of turning on the light but this is a way simpler way to do that yeah so basically you would just have like in the bathrooms probably if it's the middle of the day and the blinds are open and it's like searingly bright you don't need to turn the light on oh that's great yeah you can oh invert switch so if you in case they installed them upside down it's too late no no no no no no no no no no it's for three-way switches well there's a three-way right here yeah i got the other side of this where's the main is this the main theme wait what yes it is well there's there's three light switches within one two three four five steps for the same lights why don't we adopt this switch okay or why don't we do the theater room first because that's the one that's been bothering me the most because the lights just turn on in the middle of a movie i've had to tape over those ones i'm pretty sure when i start the inclusion all you have to do is click the light switch okay which one are you gonna do i'm gonna do the overhead one not the sconces okay so i'll set the location to theater room oh theater room overhead oh this will be overhead yeah there you go seriously i can't believe how fast that is z-wave is great and especially once we have like 100 150 devices yeah it will work really well now what we're probably gonna have to do is once they're all adopted we're gonna have to go and say heal the network which basically tells every single device to find the best routes to other devices and with that many devices it might take like a day to do shut up i don't know i haven't tried it i know at my house with like five or ten devices it takes like 10 minutes so oh wow okay it could take a while let's see if it scales linearly or exponentially but you only have to do that once with the motion sensitivity low could i make my way back to my seat no okay then vacancy light turns on manually and off automatically without motion oh okay hold on if we turn off one of these yeah maybe the reset level like figured itself out now nope frick that's kind of a problem you only spent ten thousand dollars on these light switches okay uh tell me the name of the switch dan let's go rec room okay rec room get wrecked okay uh can you hit the rec room switch please whatever one you hit oh crap that one uh what did you press stairs yeah so location what's the location for a stair basement yeah but there's two stairs to the basement i guess there's basement stairs and upstairs oh right there's two stairs on the basement basement the switch is also up there oh wait but that's what this wait why did we put the motion sensor oh i guess that kind of makes sense switch is in the basement well no there's supposed to be a motion on both sides no there isn't well it's not a thing why not because it's not a thing what do you mean it's not it's not a thing that's not how they keep saying it's not a thing but what do you mean that's not how they work why can't you have a motion on both sides i don't know maybe you could no what are you talking about because there's two motions on the uh the one on the in the hallway over there is there i'm pretty sure i could be wrong oh that's a normal one oh okay i wait no that's the one for these ones yeah no i'm i'm wrong it's just the one here wait yeah this one's the main one i know what we can do we move the motion sensing one to the top of the stairs and then we use the motion sensor from one of these other spaces where we don't want motion control right to control these lights from the bottom of the stairs right uh yeah theoretically that would be awesome okay well sure we can do that but for now for now i need to name this switch which is so what is it location rec room stairs because these are the stairs into the rec room oh god i know these are things that i can change anytime i want but come on you guys get this right once you set it you're never going to touch it again so there's this pressure to get it right if i if it's location rec room that's where it is and the name is front stairs i think that's what if you move that switch up there well then i'll move it man this whole turn back on immediately thing is kind of a problem i've seen online that apparently there is firmware updates for these but they release them through like public hubs like if you had a samsung like smart things kind of hub you can get the updates through that but it doesn't seem like there's a download site so maybe we can contact them oh that's so much better the dim though yeah the speed yeah it's much better i do wish you could just shut it off but yeah you can enable plain switch functionality actually we need to do that let's go do it my son wanted rgb lighting in his room which i was like yeah sure no problem let's just grab these yeelight v2s that we had kicking around at the office anyway and we'll set you up with these cool right app control you can change the colors there's there's your sunrise one small problem why are you gonna be like that i had a step stool i was ready to go where's the other one uh well it's in there oh yeah because i wanted to get something working for him temporarily anyway the point is he had no work oh does that bulb work in there though at all oh yeah it's pretty typical for you to have to choose you want smart bulbs or you want smart switches now i wanted the motion sensors everywhere because who knows what kind of cool things we might want to do with motion down the line but that doesn't necessarily mean that i want every single switch to operate as a smart switch so if we set it to dumb switch mode yeah i think it's gonna work it's off no dice how do you know time for our classic do as i say not as i do moment wow if it's hooked up that's very silly of you theoretically yes all of that looks quite hooked up what are you doing i am fixing it oh do you know why it's the electrician said that there's a couple of light switches that are not working and he thinks it's because the apprentice screwed it up i guess i should probably hit the breaker for this electricians usually don't i am not an electrician ah oh my gosh what what hello giver full sentence only no i don't want to break it sounds only bud oh that sucks i think i need to take the other one out too can i steal your that sucks no you cannot steal my cat should i bring arlo here i really like my cat you're more than welcome to bring her actually uh yeah so this is not right don't do that oh what the actual bananas so it is hooked up right i wonder if it just got kind of mangled when they pushed it in and it just like broke the copper yeah whoa that was not actually an easy place to catch something smart guy maybe it doesn't dim anymore well that's what it should be that's what we want right yeah the dimmer is not working confirmed cool but it still tries to do the it still fades on and off uh ge you gotta have a way to disable that there's lots of bulbs that don't behave nicely even with led and cfl compatible dimmers so then hold on other than flickering a little bit when it first turns on is that a problem well that might cause it to reset every time you oh it flickers quite a bit that's true if you turn this on and off i believe it's five times it goes into like a reset state so let me let's just see let's just see because oh actually no jake it's not going to do it the yeelight wants two seconds in between each change of state for the reset so maybe it's fine oh hey oh oh oh oh okay is it dimmed right now they turned it up oh yes there now we have a regular bulb that can tell us what the crap the fixture is doing so it's supposed to be on okay here we go it's not turning off the switch is clearly not working wait it turned off okay the switch is working again okay there's something very wrong with this light switch what is even happening right now i disabled the motion sensor so why don't we see if it's disabled uh sure feel free let's give it a try expose light switch okay that is so stupid gee i wonder why not everyone is super into smart home stuff okay manually mode manually mode or sorry manual mode i'm looking at the modes occupancy mode turn on motion detected turn off manual mode manual from the front panel of the in wall smart dimmer remotely with the uv controller huh did we manage to disable the motion sensor on any of them we'll go check that other one the closet because that one's okay i'll go check okay no it's no it's still the motion sensor is still turning it on so what happens if they all suck and that this never works oh [laughter] okay maybe we should just for why don't we try and shut the breaker off and turn it back on maybe it needs a hard reset i don't know why but maybe sure okay hold on here's oh we can't disable the motion okay if we can't disable the motion sensor this is really gonna be a problem we should see if we can turn off the motion in the one in the mechanical room are you still down there yep okay i'm gonna turn off the motion in the mechanical room one sure the motion is off really yeah curiously although that is a different model of switch the firmware on that one is 5.39 and the firmware on all of these motion dimmers is 5.32 so i'm kind of feeling like there was a bug and they updated it and i just don't know how we're gonna get the firmware for these ones maybe we have to buy a like a samsung smartthings hub and just hook them all up to that so they'll update this is terrifying there's a home assistant thread here about ge jasco switches where people are just like yeah yeah it's really bad there's basically no way to update the firmware so if anyone in the audience works for ge or jasco please help us yeah you guys actually suck not releasing firmware updates because especially you especially if you make the firmware and then won't give it to people yeah like actually you this this thread just makes me so angry it's just people complaining about the same kind of basic stuff that we want to do like no i just want it to just immediately switch on or immediately switch off stuff that like a good software engineer could do in an afternoon also why are we buying inventory with ancient firmware on it especially for our product where you can't update it okay so garth on live chat says he's gonna see if he can find something for us unbelievable it'll be a lot cheaper for them to just put up a support page with firmware downloads that would be way cheaper the stupidest thing is that home assistant even has an interface for pushing where is it you can shoot firmware updates to things yeah there you just have to select a file and update it yeah because these guys say his firmware is 5.54 we're on like 5.32 i know oh no there's way newer firmwares should we buy where can we get one of those like smart things no no that's a bad solution because then if there's a future update what am i going to do i'm going to unpair it to the freaking home but you just don't necessarily need it all 100 of them right then i put them all back on the samsung and reconfigure them no no no no no no no no you provide firmware updates that's it i will fly there jake will you i will fly i guess it's a video oh yeah it's not like they're going to come outside garth is going to help us out i feel it garth is typing oh garth please garth come through for us garth help us all there is not really a manual mode on the switches it should just go ahead and turn the lights on and off yes there is garth might be an actual npc okay do they have a phone line we'll let garth try to help us in the meantime if spanish is what it will take to get a firmware update out of these guys we can talk to serge he sort of knows spanish man i can feel my blood pressure rising like stuff stuff like this man it just makes me so angry here's an idea for the ones we don't want to have motion we could paint the motion sensor that's the stupidest thing you've ever heard but it doesn't involve yeah but the other functionality doesn't update i know no we actually just need them to work i know i know since we're on the subject of things that make me angry if you've got hold music fine have hold music never have a pre-recorded voice come back and say hi are you okay to still be holding right now or whatever the it's saying because i'm like oh what what no it's that again just have music so that i know when to come back to it this is the soundtrack of my personal hell after four of my yes i'm here garth has said he's still here he's just waiting for a reply because he has no idea clearly because it's so stupid how has nobody ever how is this not just like something they deal with every other day yeah that i don't really understand ltgstore.com buy a few water bottles so he can pay for this disaster it's a lot of water bottles please all right and how can i assist you today i have some ge and brighton switches and basically they're running a mishmash of different firmwares and there's no obvious way to update the firmware okay so the firmware on the devices is updated through your hub there isn't any out way of updating the firmware other than with the hub right so i'm using a uh a home assistant server to run it so i need the firmware file so that i can upload it to the switch okay so unfortunately we don't give out that information it's all done through the hub right so that's my hub and that's the way that my hub requires it to be done this it's my device like i bought it i need the firmware file for it we don't have those available okay so then what your hub support your hub support would do that okay so hold on so do do you guys are this is jasco right that is correct okay so you guys make the switch for ge that is correct including the firmware that is correct cool okay so that firmware i need it again unfortunately no it's not fortune you no no i don't want you to use the word unfortunately because it's not fortune this is not chance this is you guys deciding not to provide a customer for your product with a firmware update when the functionality of it is fundamentally broken right now i can't even disable the motion sensors on these things so what i need is to unfortunately you guys send me the firmware files so am i able to get the firmware from aotech because they're the ones who make the z-wave stick that i'm using yes that is who you would get a hold of why because they are the ones that the uh evidently if you've got an aotec stick then they are the ones that would have the support to be able to update or uh change your firmware but you guys make the switch that is correct and you guys write the firmware that is correct but we do not give it out that is a proprietary information that is only handed out through the hub well that's the stupidest thing i've ever heard in my life thank you very much you're very welcome jasco you so i emailed aotech it's possible they might be able to save the day garth could still come through for us garth's not gonna come through clearly their policy is to withhold critical updates from their customers no it's not unbelievable where's the okay he said try pushing the configuration button with the on and off button at the same time where is the configuration what the hell is he talking about i mean if this puts it in manual mode this will at least solve the problem for now oh my god that is not the solution though well i agree i'm just saying if it works right now yeah i found it jake it's right here yeah that's why i was clicking but it's not working they want you to take every wall plate off to do this i seriously don't remember the last time okay there we go enraged it blinked three times holy it worked i know i know it's awful you don't need to do it on all of them but for now at least i can go around and take the plates off every switch in the house that i want running in manual mode i'm not saying it's a good thing i'm just trying to help you for now until aotech will come save the day faster to put tape over top this video was supposed to be hey g and brighton switches by jasco cool product we'd love to use it and show how cool it is it turned into you can go yourself like honestly i just want to rip every single one of them out of the wall regardless as someone who bought this product and went and installed it in my home my recourse is someone in some other  time zone when jasco has the firmware but it's just like we won't get it no no no no no no we won't give it to you no oh my god oh my god what you know what garth just told me i asked him where can we find the rest of these config options like holding the switch he found them on youtube this is literally their customer service this is just a basic product overview why were we expecting garth to save the day exactly firmware is updated through the hub so you may contact them to see if it's updated oh my god no firmware is updated through you having a firmware download page to what end jasco to what end what what are you trying to accomplish they don't want their proprietary z-wave firmware stolen you know it's very high-tech by who definitely not an open standard my question is if aeo tech is supposed to have the firmware updates then shouldn't they just propagate well because i don't think the stick is is meant to push firmware updates or you just mean aotech makes a hub so they might be able to provide it um the stick is the diy approach right yeah it just allows you to integrate z-wave with whatever thing in this instance we're integrating with home assistant right they also make a hub so i'm thinking maybe if jasco just gives them the firmware to distribute it maybe they just have it and they can just give it to us to update with its e-stick well if jasco won't send out the firmware to the public then i'm sure whatever agreement they have with aotech doesn't allow them to send it out to the public i also said as an alternative option they could send us a hub to see but that is i know i would rather take them out i'd rather take them out put them in a box and fly to jasco's hq and throw them in their face honestly i think all we can really do is say to be continued ladies and gentlemen at the end of that day i was understandably very frustrated i just spent ten thousand dollars on product alone switches that we could not reliably put in manual mode adjust the motion cooldown of or disable the fade in and fade out on adding insult to injury they outright refused to provide any firmware updates that at the time we believed could have solved my problems which is an enormous no-no in my books i shared the experiences that both myself and others in the smart home community had gone through on the wan show and to our surprise jasco actually reached out pretty much immediately so we pushed for them to provide firmware update files not just for us but also to the rest of the community after a few emails back and forth we ended up on the phone with some of the higher-ups at jasco and the product manager we were speaking with insisted that version 5.50 is the only firmware they've ever released for the motion dimmer which was very confusing to me because as you might recall our switches reported version 5.32 they eventually figured out that when the motion dimmer was submitted for certification to the z-wave alliance they had accidentally entered the firmware version in decimal form when the form asked for hexadecimal this means the 32 of 5.32 got converted from hex to decimal as 50. that means my switches were indeed on the latest firmware which meant there had to be something else going on or the original firmware was just buggy now within a z-wave network when you adopt or include a device it's given a unique id number starting from one and what we found was that when adopting more of the switches certain switches would adopt the same device id as another existing switch and in turn z-wave js the application that runs within home assistant to manage the network would crash and after a reboot only the originally adopted switch would show in the list so in the video we were trying to edit the configuration of a switch in my son's bedroom as it turns out that switch had the same id as one downstairs in the rec room hallway as you might have guessed these configuration changes were actually applying to the downstairs switch instead even though we hadn't yet adopted it into the network we don't know exactly why this was happening but apparently weird issues like this were common in the earlier days of z-wave and since these switches are based on a several-year-old design i think they said six it could explain why they're particularly prone to it after we realized this we were able to exclude both of those switches then re-adopt them one by one and we were finally able to disable the motion sensors with that said we still can't disable the fade in and out or tweak the motion cooldown so maybe new firmware is actually needed or maybe i'll still need to switch to a different solution first we need to talk about the elephant in the room firmware updates for a product like this especially in an industry that's changing so rapidly being able to update your firmware is a huge deal and no go through your hub's proprietary update system that your hub might not even have because it's actually a stick and not a hub is not an appropriate answer for a product that is designed to be used in an open ecosystem so in my call with jasco they said they would provide me with the firmware files and figure out a solution for sharing them publicly and i'm happy to report that as of just two weeks from sharing my issues jasco has already followed through the files for 12 of their most popular products are now available on github and on their support site with the rest to follow shortly so we did it read it and also thank you jasco for taking my admittedly not very level-headed criticism and turning it into a w as for what's going to happen with my house that's still up in the air if we can't fix the above-mentioned remaining issues with the jasco switches i might still have to pull them out and go with a different solution innovelli has pitched working with us to develop their own motion switch and we've also looked into hardwiring motion sensors actually multi-sensors into each area where we need motion which would give us a lot of really cool options for automations let us know in the comments if you have a preferred solution that you'd like to see any brilliant ideas brilliant like this brilliant segue to our
