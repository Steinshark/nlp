i recently flew to new york for the google developer groups event and this was the build with ai event and i'm bringing this up because during the time there i got to meet with so many incredible students who were studying computer science and i noticed something i noticed a trend as to what within computer science they were studying what jobs they were looking for it all had this underlying thread which we'll get to in a bit here these students these individuals whether it be in that situation or in general they are focused on the most in demand skills they want to stay ahead be as competitive as possible but what job won't make it throughout that what jobs with the tech industry booming and continuously creating different technical jobs what jobs are going to fall behind especially nowadays with ai and i see on youtube or social media a lot of times the pros the and even we talk about it what jobs will be created but very little do people really take a step back and are willing to have the conversation at least around what jobs will be taken away what jobs if we look 5 years or 10 years down the road might not be here and that's what we are going to dive into today we are going to talk about what jobs what skills will become less in demand because of ai and really everything that is going on with in tech but then also to what skills and jobs will continue to grow in demand i'm going to base this not only on my past experiences you know going to these different events hearing from people i mean i'm literally in las vegas right now at a tech conference learning more about just this but also to at the google event uh at this event so many different areas where i'm hearing from thought leaders and i want to share with you what skills are looking ahead going to continue in demand but then also to have a very caned conversation about what jobs might not make it in the next few years or be at least very low in demand all right let's get into [music] it first up let's talk about the skills that will continue to decrease not increase we're getting really candid here that will continue decrease in demand and where is this information coming from this is coming from well pretty much what we see on a daily bas es within the job market what types of skills are going up in demand and what are we seeing less up the first one is manual dexterity and repetitiveness so this is no surprise especially when we think of ai and how it is able to automate so much of our tasks so things such as jobs that involve repetitive manual tasks such as assembly line workers packaging they are all prime candidates for automation now listen even these roles they will evolve people in these roles will find different ones or evolve with this technology or even learn to operate a lot of this technology it's moving fast but it's not moving fast to the point where people can't keep up with it which is a positive this isn't here to scare anyone but just to start really thinking about where you can upskill the next one is around narrow specific tasks and once again i hope this isn't a surprise every time we think of automation or ai it can do these narrow specific tasks and it only is getting better i mean who was it it was sam alman who recently said that they are working on at open ai agi being possible and when we think about that ai not only being able to do simple tasks but being able to once it completes that task do the next task that really makes you have to stop and think as to jobs that are doing these very specific tasks will eventually start or even are already starting to decrease now the next one on the list this one could be a bit controversial if you will or at least some people might disagree and i think it's because it's still a very sensitive topic but the next on my list i have is routine customer service now hear me out chat bots such as ai powered uh you know when we think of chat gpt when we think of claude these are able to do have good conversations even now when you go on websites a lot of times you might not even realize it but in that little box where you are typing for help you are not talking to a human you are talking to an ai i mean i hope you realize that we're tech people here but if you're not and you're watching this most of the time it is an ai that will continue to improve as the conversation with ais are trained and get better and better smarter and smarter as these models do anyways and also to as they continue to learn more about the data and interact with humans they will become better right now i think you can kind of tell the difference whether you are interacting with a human or not now i do think there is going to be a huge need for customer service and what i do think will happen with this one is when we think about companies who offer uh you know whether it's you wait for hours on the phone or you are talking to a chatbot when we think of really premium companies what will happen is they will start offering human services and i really think it's going to be marketed like that where it's though we have real humans help you versus it's always pressing zero press one on the phone and always speaking just to an automated system these companies who really want to stand out they're going to start hiring humans where we will see a demand for customer service actually surge is into almost this prestigious job that is done by less people but the people who do it do it really well that's just my prediction by the way but i'm curious to hear do you agree with this disagree leave in the comments all right now let's get into the good stuff let's talk about some skills that we are seeing continue to rise and grow or areas that are continuing to grow into m the first one i want to talk about is one that when i've been going to a lot of these conferences i see over and over again that more people want to get into or are working towards getting into but equally there are so much more jobs that need to be filled for this role than currently are so it's a good sign it's not that so many people want to get into it but there's not enough jobs to fill it's the opposite and i think it will continue this way this of course is data scientists and data analyst this is such a popular role right now and although it will evolve with the use of ai i mean we can already see a lot of ai systems doing portions of this job very small portions not to the level that it will take over or anything like that just like how ai can help with coding for example it's actually i have up on here so data scientist roles are projected to grow 36% from 2021 to 2031 which is much faster than all other occupations and this is from the us bureau of labor statistics had to get really technical there for a sec here cuz i really want to highlight just how much in demand this role is continuing to be now there are so much variations to this role based on if you work at a big company a startup or anything in between now if you are looking to get into one of these roles here are two courses that i would recommend they have great reviews i am not a data data analyst nor am i going to become one but i do think based on the reviews the feedback even from friends that i've heard speak about it these are two really good course option course i don't need more coffee today course options next on the list is cyber security i mean i'm going to read this doat to you so the global cyber secur market is projected to grow from 27 billion in 2021 to 345 billion by 2026 that is from markets and markets that's incredible and you can really see this number continuing to increase especially as tech moves so fast we need more cyber security experts people who are both on the technical side but also on the business side who are well versed in this who really understand the backbone to it and why it is so important now here are two courses that i would recommend for beginners if you just starting your career in cyber security you might be further along in your tech career or journey but if you looking to pivot in this direction the biggest thing though with the first two that i listed is you need to connect with others in the industry already i can't stress that enough go on linkedin find people or even creators who are talking about these specific topics and reach out to them i mean that's what i'm here for is to you know for inform you fill you in educate you and build you up so you can go after these careers because we need more people like you in the industry now the third one i really want to talk about isn't necessarily a specific skill but a trend within the workforce that i've really noticed this trend is consulting actually i saw this i saw this article let me see if i can find it and i'll put it up on screen here if i can find it which was by that google is rumored it's not 100% confirmed it wasn't confirmed by them anyways to hire more contractors now than full-time employees that can't be right i wonder what the stat is i got to find that article again but it's contractors in general i have noticed this trend especially since around 2022 where more companies or big companies anyways are looking to hire contractors versus the commitment of a full-time employee now there are pros and cons to this the pro is contractors typically get paid a lot more than full-time employees they are there for shorter periods of time you are coming in with your expertise and teaching or educating consulting whatever consultants do i'm just kidding but consulting these companies now for the company it's a win-win because it's less risk they are hiring you for quite a bit of money probably but they know it's for a shorter period of time so it's less of a commitment now the downside if you are a contractor is depending on how what country you're in and how you have your business set up it might be something as though you don't have health care or you don't have insurance different things like that might not come with consulting consulting but what does come with consulting is that higher paycheck so hopefully you can put some money towards some of those things if needed now i've seen consulting really blow up in throughout the tech industry as a whole whether you're a developer a designer project manager consulting is such an interesting area it's something that i'm really interested in actually um i've consulted before with a lot of big tech companies from mang if you will and it's some of the best experiences i have now you're probably asking k tiff i'm very interested in consulting but how do i get started the easiest way way to get started in consulting is by building your personal brand and i know some of you maybe feel like well i don't want to start a youtube channel tiff i don't want to start putting myself out there like that there are so many other ways you can one of the best ways is even through blogging or posting on linkedin some of your projects now obviously that might not land you your first client per se but starting to do that consistently and sharing your learnings or what you are building for other clients is super helpful for visibility the other way though too is through freelancing sites now i've worked with so many great freelancers that started out on upwork or mainly upwork or fiverr even as well or the relationship started out on these platforms and then what has happened is you work with a client for so long or i worked with you know people on these platforms for so long and i bring them off of the platform meaning i need some water meaning i don't know if you can hear my voice i've been up for a long time today cuz i flew in from vegas this morning that's just a side note here wait scratch up i didn't fly in from vegas i flew from toronto to vegas you can tell my sleep deprivation is catching up to me okay back to to the topic though using these sites like upwork or fiverr are great ways to get clients and then from there as you build long-term relationships you can take that off of these platforms if you so choose and of course it makes sense too all right those are some of the jobs that we or skills even that we are seeing continue to decline and probably will but then on the upside here are some of the skills that are continuing to grow in demand the most important thing overall is continuing to be a learner and evolve with this technology this doesn't have to get exhausting don't try and con stantly keep up like it's a rat race take it day by day stay curious that's honestly the best thing you can do all right i was going to say i need more coffee but i definitely don't i think i need to go for a nap now i hope you all enjoyed this video make sure to hit that subscribe button for more tech coding ai future tech all the good stuff related videos leave in the comments what skills you are currently learning i would love to learn more about that as well all right talk to you soon bye everyone the [music]
