i spent about five minutes before recording this trying to work out a joke about how this video will be face meltingly good but i couldn't so let's just get straight into it just before we get started if you guys want to have a go at this yourself i've got a patreon for a dollar where you can get all of the project files from all of my videos so if you're fairly new to blender and couldn't do this on your own you can just download my files and get started straight away on with the video the first thing i did to melt my face was bring in the base mesh of a human and then i deleted everything except for the head obviously so that's all i needed i then went into sculpt mode and flattened a load of the features because i wanted it to feel like the face had kind of melted away so there wasn't like a defined nose or eye sockets anymore once that was done the sculpt was really high poly so i exported an obj and then took it into instant meshes and made a remesh of it that was much more low poly [music] i made sure to have enough faces that i could still do a bit of sculpting with it because i was going to use a few shape keys to do the face melting into the eye sockets effect once that was done i bought the new retopologized mesh back in and then started working on it i added one subdivision surface modifier to just add a little bit more detail because i found it wasn't quite enough then added two shape keys the first is the base shape and then the second one is the completely melted eye sockets that i sculpted then once this is all done i can use the slider to go between the two positions and the eyes kind of melt away i jumped on the textures.com and found some textures of some meat which i was just going to use as like a base shader to go under all the burnt effects i was doing later i also found a rock brush that looked a little bit like a burnt sort of texture so i started using that to sculpt around the eyeballs to add a more organic feeling to it it made it nice and bumpy and kind of gave it that charred burnt look which looks really cool i made sure to turn off symmetry at one point so that it wasn't exactly the same mirrored across both sides and i did this with the brush set to anchor so that i could put my mouse somewhere click and then drag outwards and have lots of nice control over where the brush was actually going the material for this is essentially loads of noise textures on top of each other and then a couple of pbr setups as well i started off by making the fleshy texture that went underneath like i showed earlier it's a seamless texture so i just scaled it up to the point where it looked pretty good and then that was my base shader done i did a couple of things like adding a little bit more contrast and stuff into it with a rgb curves node but i pretty much left it as it was you can see here i've put an emission shader in the back of the eye sockets but i didn't bother going with that in the end i also brought in this skull which i also decided to get rid of in the end because it wasn't really working but the idea with this was that once the skin of the eyes melts away it starts to reveal the bone a bit but when i was compositing the two layers together i couldn't really get the skull to kind of merge with the face in a way that looked convincing it just looked like it was a render layer sat on top i used a vector displacement node to add some uneven organic looks to the whole surface of the skin which worked really nicely i had to turn it down really far because as you can see here it's going a bit nuts so here i'm starting to build up a couple of extra noise textures on top i made one that was almost like some glowing embers that were stuck on the surface of the skin this one's going on the inside of the eye sockets and it's going to be the actual sort of burning magmary texture inside the eyes so i went quite small with the scale of the noise and then added some lavary textures into the colour ramp to make it a little bit orange i then used a larger noise texture on top of that which i multiplied over the first one i like to use multiple noise textures and multiply them together when i'm using stuff with noise because i always find that the kind of procedural look of the noise really stands out but if you use a bigger one and the smaller one and multiply them together you end up with less of the even uniform look over the whole thing and some areas have more frequency noise some areas have less and it works nicely here i'm painting a black and white matte for the eye socket so i can define what parts of the texture go where i tried to use this just selecting the faces and pressing assign which is a little bit easier but it wasn't really working so i ended up just painting some mattes for it instead so now if i use a mix shader and combine the two you can see we have the flesh on the outside and then the glowing embery burnt texture on the inside of the eye sockets and then here i'm making one more noise texture this is going to be a load of really really small high frequency kind of embers dotted around the edges of the eyes the look i was going for here was kind of like after a fire dies out and there's just a few glowing specks on the ends of the sticks and stuff that have been burning in the fire again i used two noise textures and then multiplied them together which gave me that slightly more uneven less uniform look which i really like and then i just played around with the coordinates until i found something i liked and then used another mix shader to combine them together a lot of the depth to this look just comes from slapping loads and loads of different noise textures on top of each other which is quite fun then i jumped onto haven and grabbed this ground texture that i found it had a lot of little stones and stuff in it that i thought looked quite good for a burnt bone flesh kind of feel and then i used some nodes in the shader editor to make it a bit darker so my plan was to have three layers of texture to this really the inside of the eye sockets will be glowing and have that magmary look and then around the edges of the eye sockets will be the rock texture that's going on in a second and then the very edges will be the flesh texture almost like the skin is just burnt away from the surface but it hasn't gone through much of the meat of the face yet so this is the ground texture that i've just bought in as you can see it wasn't really quite looking right until i started to make it a lot darker and now it has that kind of burnt charred look to it which looks really cool i had to tweak the roughness and stuff to get it in the right place but it was pretty easy to make it look nice once i liked the look of it i made a second image texture and painted another matte for the edges of the eye sockets to define where this texture was going to go originally i used a brush then i thought it wouldn't look very good for the fall off so i started using that rock brush that i had earlier to add some sort of organic detail into the texture of this matte and this works really nicely it makes it feel more organic because you have some of the underlying texture that comes through where the brush is a bit darker and then obviously you have the bits that are completely opaque so once that was done i saved the image and then used it to combine all three of the layers together and this is what it started to look like and then finally i started painting a transparency texture the idea is that the whole shader for the head will be combined with a transparent shader and this will be used as the factor which means that basically anything outside of the eye sockets will be transparent so all i'm really rendering is a kind of robin style superhero mask that just goes around the eye sockets and then when i'm compositing this in nuke i can just put it over the footage of my face and i won't have to worry about drawing any masks to define where the edges go because the render will have it built in so here you can see when i start doing some test renders the rest of the head becomes see-through so once all that was ready to go the next job was to actually do an object track of my face so that this would stick i made some tracking markers by cutting up some little bits of blue painters tape and sticking them on my face this may seem a little bit diy but it's actually a really good idea because blue is the opposite of red on the color wheel so if you track the red channel on its own the blue markers will be almost completely black and your skin will be completely white and that makes a load of contrast which makes the tracking a lot easier so i just did a really simple track of all the points on my face then added a camera and added the camera tracker constraint to it and then enabled motion tracking in the viewport so i could see the points then i brought in the head from the other blender file including all the textures and everything then i brought in my background footage through the camera so that i could line it up properly and then once that was all done i just added the object tracker constraint onto the head and now it will stick to the tracking points so that's pretty much it for the blender stuff i rendered all of this to a multi-layer exr and turned on things like the emission part so i could add some glow when i'm doing the compositing this is also the first time i used the optics denoiser in blender and i have to say i'm mega impressed it's really really good i highly recommend everyone starts using it so now we're going to jump into nuke very quickly to slap everything together so while the render was going in blender off camera i tracked all of the tracking markers on my face independently in nuke and then just use the transfer mask to move a section nearby of my skin over the top and now the tracking markers are gone i also did a quick key of the green screen version of me that was in both of the shots i didn't really realize until after i'd shot this but the lighting on the green screen was horrendous so this is probably one of the worst keys i've ever done in my visual effects career but luckily because it's going to be defocused a little bit in the foreground you don't really notice it you can see how horrible the edge is on that key there once the key was done i put myself over the footage and then started working on the laser eyes the lasers are really simple it's basically just a lightsaber effect so i made a couple of rotor shapes coming out of my eyes going into the eye of the other me and then feathered them a little bit coming towards the camera just to give them a bit of shape and then i added an exponential glow which obviously adds a bit of glow and makes them look cool added a grade node and then change the gamma a little bit to add some color into the glow then added a turbulent displaced node which is based off the same effect in after effects and it does exactly the same thing it's just distorting the image with some noise then it just has some animation so the noise moves over time after that i started dropping in the renders from blender the first thing i did was just match the black points which is really important for blending cg into live action footage and then i started doing some of the cool stuff like separating out the emission pass and adding some glows onto it and then plusing it back on top of the original footage this just gives it some intensity which looks really nice here i'm just animating the laser eyes to move with my eyes over the course of the shot i added some light wrap from the lasers onto the foreground version of me where the lasers are really intense you can start to see the light coming around the side of my head then i found this green screen blood run effect originally i tried to do this as a liquid sim and blender but i just couldn't really get it working so i just decided to find a 2d element instead so i just matched some of the colors of the highlights and stuff and then tracked it onto my face on my cheek and then just to make the contact with my face feel a bit more realistic i offset it by a few pixels and then just use that alpha to grade the footage down slightly to make a drop shadow effect then a couple of little final details i added some veins coming out of the side of my face i just did a planar track on my cheek to get a corner pin and then just stuck some pngs that i found online with some vein textures over the top in the screen recording here they're black but in the end i actually ended up making them white which kind of felt like the light from the laser beams was kind of seeping into my veins which looked quite cool and i used a mask to kind of reveal them outwards over the course of the shot so it feels like they're creeping over my forehead which is quite fun adding some finishing touches i keyed the highlights of my face and then put some of the light interaction from the lasers onto my skin tones and then used a noise modifier so it would flicker a little bit and then i was lying in bed quite late the night after finishing this shot thinking it was missing something and i realized there should be some smoke coming out of the eyes which would look hilarious so i jumped back into blender and did a quick smoke sim for just two emitters for the eye sockets and over the course of the shot they just emit some smoke which looks really fun and that ladies and gentlemen is the finished shot if you haven't seen the boys on amazon that was the inspiration for this shot there's a very similar thing that i wanted to try and recreate highly recommend it but it's very gory so if you're under' then maybe not but yeah i hope you enjoyed this tutorial thank you very much for watching and i will see you next time
