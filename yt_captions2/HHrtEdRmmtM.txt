won't you come with me fall in love i've been a soccer developer professionally 
for about four years now seems like forever   i'm just kidding and there are so many 
things i wish i knew when i first started   and then i continued to discover along my way even 
being almost half a decade in and i really want to   talk about them today to you especially for people 
who are self-taught and i know the definition of   self-talk can really vary person to person is 
self-taught someone who has completely had no   help from anyone is self-taught someone who has 
had a mentor but hasn't gone to a boot camp or   does it include going to a boot camp for me i 
did go to a coding bootcamp but i still consider   myself self-taught i didn't go the computer 
science row and get a computer science degree   okay i had to go and grab a coffee or in this 
case matcha uh to continue this conversation   but i really wanted to sit down and have a 
very candid conversation with you today about   being a self-taught programmer 
and what that really   some challenges i guess that that can really 
bring up and i think i get so many messages   every day from people saying i want to learn 
how to code i want to be a developer i want to   be a programmer which is amazing but there are 
so many things that are put in your way to stop   you from actually achieving that and i really want 
to break down some of those and i'm going to sit   down with you today later on in this video and 
talk about some as well but one of the main ones   being for me anyways even four years into this job 
is so many days i feel like i don't belong and i'm   not saying that because anyone else is making me 
feel that way it's just thoughts in my head where   i feel like oh maybe you aren't skilled enough or 
maybe you don't deserve to be in this room maybe   you don't have the knowledge or background that 
these people do and and almost everyone i work   with is not a soft doesn't come from a self-taught 
background which is fine it's totally amazing   a lot of companies there are tons and tons of 
people who come from a self-talk background it's   just different circumstances but it just sometimes 
makes me feel so alone in the process and i just   had this like realization the other day of there 
is absolutely no reason i should feel that way   and why i say that is because you know i'm doing 
the work i'm getting promoted i'm growing my   skills are there so why am i having these thoughts 
why am i having this massive imposter syndrome   and there are so many different and this is just 
another roadblock that we're not roadblocked but   different thing that is put in front of me that 
i need to overcome and i think one thing about   self-taught programmers is we have to overcome 
so so much which really makes you stronger   and more resilient and in the end i think makes 
you almost a better person because not better   than anyone else but just better for yourself 
because there are so many different challenges   you will need to face along the way so many 
times where you will feel self-doubt where   you will question your decision and you process 
and wonder if this was the right decision and   just know that that is normal and that 
is okay to feel that way you're not alone   and i think uh it'd be weird if you 
didn't feel that way coffee break is done uh anyways let's go back home let's 
sit down and let's dive deeper into this aside from those conversations around not feeling 
good enough or not feeling as though we are what's   the word that there's something that's missing or 
yeah just not feeling good enough there are a lot   of other things that pop into your mind especially 
when you are deciding uh what path to should i do   front-end should i do back-end do i specialize in 
blockchain do i specialize in a.i can i specialize   in these things and these are all thoughts that 
i really had to when i was first starting but not   just for starting thoughts that i still have did 
i choose the right path to go down what if this   this technology becomes obsolete is my job going 
to become obsolete these are all questions i have   quite frequently and i just want to break down for 
you how i navigate them when it comes to as far as   choosing front end or back end i'm going to 
share with you my story of how i chose which one   right now i do front end but i also am very 
proficient in back end it just depends what   project i'm working on and what it requires when i 
first started as a developer i thought backend was   the way to go and honestly the reason i thought 
that was because i thought it must pay more it   must be harder it's more of a cooler sexier job 
this is not the case at all front-end work can be   as difficult it can be as complex and it can pay 
just as much and i really wanted to highlight that   because i think a lot of people feel so back-end 
is superior to front-end and i really don't   believe that i just think it's different different 
people for different roles for me when i started   out i thought back and back and back in but i 
couldn't grasp a lot of the main backend concepts   right off the bat so i finally gave in and decided 
to go to front end because that was an area where   i was excelling in and i'm so glad i didn't let my 
stubbornness get in the way or my ego get in the   way of thinking i needed to do back end because 
once i started to do more front end and get get   those skills and get more comfortable with coding 
in general i was able to in my first job actually   transition into back-end development quite easily 
so whatever path you pick whether it be front-end   back-end or specializing in a specific kind 
of cloud or blockchain anything like that   you do not need to stay in that path forever 
and i really wanted to highlight that because   we put so much pressure on ourselves to have 
our whole career figured out from day one   another thing i really want to highlight and talk 
about here is the importance of mentorship and   networking and i can't stress this enough getting 
into tech getting into this industry and being in   this industry it can be overwhelming whether you 
are on year one or year 20 and having mentorship   or people to look up to is in my opinion essential 
in succeeding having someone that you can talk to   and pick their brain about their career path or 
what they would do or steps they have taken will   really really help you in navigating your career 
and getting to the next step doing anything in   life alone typically isn't that fun and the same 
comes with your career your job and whether you're   starting out or currently in the industry having 
others to support you along the way is essential   now there are so many ways to find a mentor 
and i think the first thing is just just go   out there and get one and i know that sounds kind 
of obvious and maybe a silly statement to make but   i get asked so much about how to find this perfect 
mentor where do i find one and at some point you   just need to take initiative and go get one go 
on linkedin go on mentorship websites reach out   i did for a while there i reached out on websites 
that you could hire tutors and i just hired a   tutor like you know if you're not in a place where 
you can afford a tutor that's fine there are so   many different free resources out there you just 
need to google that's all you need to do google or   go on linkedin and start reaching out to people 
yes it's uncomfortable and yes it sucks putting   yourself out there but you will see the benefits 
of it when you start doing it this whole path of   self-taught programmers it's not an easy 
one and when you get in the industry it gets   easier to a degree but you face new challenges 
different challenges and you will see over time   looking back just how far you've come and that 
you're able to conquer one challenge after another   and it gets more enjoyable to conquer these 
challenges but i really just wanted to be honest   and candid about these challenges you will face at 
really any stage in your career because it's not   all perfect it's not all glamorous and i know tech 
right now is an industry is really glamorized as   a money-making industry where you can make 
a lot of money quickly and grow quickly and   yeah that is all amazing aspects to it but 
there are also the negatives and the not so   glamorous sides to it that i really wanted to just 
be transparent about at the end of the day your   future is in your hands and i know it sounds kind 
of cheesy but it's so true uh you're just gonna   have to put yourself in uncomfortable situations 
with growing and continue to remind yourself that   you're there for a reason you deserve to be 
there just as much as anyone else does and   that's what really helped me i would say is 
just sometimes you just i know some people   don't agree with this statement but sometimes 
you really do need to fake it until you make   it because you're not actually faking it you just 
feel like you are so even carrying that slogan on   for a while it really helped me get through tough 
times and then looking back i realized i wasn't   faking it but in my mind i was just keep on 
pushing forward until you get to where you   need to be okay thank you all for watching 
this video i hope you found it valuable and   insightful i just wanted to share my perspective 
and my experience as a self-taught programmer   it's not always glamorous and even if you aren't 
a self-taught programmer it's not always glamorous   but having these tips or this insight i hope 
it will prepare you for your career journey and   some of the more tougher things you will 
face thanks for watching this video if   you found it valuable or helpful make sure to
