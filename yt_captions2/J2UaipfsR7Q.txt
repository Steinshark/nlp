this is why i have trust issues this is way too much waifu again it's the year of the rabbit and to celebrate chinese new year we are roasting the wackiest setups from our audience in china a place that's known for coming up with unusual solutions to technological challenges yeah this should be fun like everywhere else in the world gamers in china are creative occasionally janky and very very roastable just like the segue to our sponsor build redux build redux makes it easy to configure your new build with support guides to help along the way they also offer competitive pricing as compared to building the pc yourself head to build redux.com linus to start your new build today foreign [music] two questions under the gate one why are we using outlook and two where on earth we're getting these submissions from i'm gonna do the second one first you guys probably don't realize that we have a massive following on billybilly.com in china which came about because there was a group that was pirating our videos translating them and re-uploading we then hired those same people to officially translate them and maintain an official channel there we're almost at a million subscribers so if you're in china go check it out as for why we're using outlook well we weren't sure if having screenshots of gmail would get the video banned there right i'm pretty sure it's fine to receive like email but like it just you know try to avoid that you know and we need some way for people to contact us and it sure as heck wasn't going to be twitter so yeah hotmail first up we've got engine wu who made a diy version of razer's project valerie is that lego this is so much better than i thought it was it's actually like aligned properly no it's not lego no that's carbon fiber this is like custom fabbed carbon fiber hinges on two additional displays then it's just like a bracket that holds it on the back of the laptop's original screen and then these carbon fiber fabricated arms hold the additional displays in place this solutions i've seen clumsy yeah i know right clumsy at all okay that's cheating that's cheating now you're automatically the best setup i mean clean your desk but yeah it says full of power thanks andy's here to help us yeah all right what kind of case is this oh the input output case no i don't see any other brands wait hey is that a chiller no does he have a chiller no way chilled set up rocking the rtx that's gonna be a 30 90 i think is that hold on there's a temperature reading so 16 degrees on the return coolant it looks like oh that's interesting that's not that cold which makes sense because you don't actually want condensation to form they probably have that fine control so they can run it exactly as cool as they want even worth it then no yeah no this is awesome yeah okay i like exactly i am loving some of the redneck engineering i'm seeing here this is like taryn's desk all over again wait it's a square monitor i have that one on my desk i actually really like this setup you gotta give respect to the people who appreciate a proper audio setup when i see a pair of speakers behind a multi-monitor setup i lose my crap i can't handle it hey i have big speakers all right yeah this is a little anime for me sound foam and oh yeah maybe for streaming is there is there a microphone i'm missing over here somewhere oh that oh that explains it so the recording setup is probably sick but not for vocals but what are we not supposed to be looking at got a lens big on signal master power supplies yeah okay core i9 all right it's funny when back when i did the build with strange parts my intention was to go into the tech mall and buy only brands i'd never heard of before i was shocked to see how many chinese stores are just full of the exact same products made there right of course but like that's never what makes the headlines yeah okay there's a wide shot though wow whoa look at the ceiling he's got a cool ceiling okay hold on hold on go to the plug kind of a plug this guy's not in china what is that it's probably north america that doesn't look like a north american plug that doesn't look like a chinese plug yeah that's a north american fun jake what look that's an rog logo big liar no you're out you're done this looks sick this is rgb whoa done you know god end game rgb who needs a screen at this point you know what am i looking at here at the fire is that your subwoofer slash volume knob like here's the speaker yeah yeah these are the edifier ones you spent all the money on your pc and you have no money on your speakers yeah those are colder disconnects they look jank but those are the bomb is that the heating wait wait no no did they do whole room water coolings hold on hold on no i want to see it andy these are insulated why is it look at those zip ties oh my god wait is that just a distribution plate oh my god what the is that so this is what this is a chiller it might be outside oh so he's got a thing outside yeah this is outside yeah it's brick wall so this has got to be the the something and it's insulated so this has to be cold this has to be cold side yeah what an unnecessarily elaborate setup can we see this i like it that's a 3900k and if oh no he's got two gpus there it is oh it totally is it totally is what the the problem is this is like xl case you can't even say that you're like you're mining to heat your house because then you're using refrigeration yeah why do you have two gpus this is next level oh yeah yeah it just like stresses me out those are some big fat tubes for a very small water block yes the tv is very special i tap that is that a hall of fame i think it is i think that's like a glass a weird galax hall of fame hey look hey hey cherry rig everything nice i love it do you want to see people wait that is a gigantic sound bar you're not actually supposed to sit that close to a sound bar killer that's a name i've not heard in a long time these used to be pretty popular these external water cooling things i am liking this but that might be a heat killer made in germany it's probably heat killer was known for having okay performance but like really nice looking stuff i don't like the trident z royal i will never like triton z royal it's awful no it's cool i know it's so awesome yeah you can't see it so why would you buy it anyway no it's cool it's cool oh no beside the back panel is missing you can't have a gorgeous system like this and be like i don't know if i'm gonna put the back they just need cooling for that ssd back there very trendy got the tissues [laughter] you know like a quarter of his desk is taken up by the computer you could just put that thing on top of the computer and take up half as much space what is wrong with you i'm trying to i'm trying to get it to i'm trying also what is this just works oh can't believe you've done this i can't believe you've done this whoa oh that's that's pretty that is an absolutely sick setup i'm a little confused why some of them are fittings for the corners and other ones or not maybe i guess it's just a style yeah it could just be aesthetic yeah like okay would you want to do in hard-line metal would you want to do this bend and this bend and try and get them perfect yeah yeah probably if you're going through the effort of bending metal no no man i i wouldn't i would i would do one bend for sure and then it's just 90. you're gonna look at this building look what a hater you're a hater yeah you're being a hater i am being a hater okay that's pretty dope see don't be a hater i just i always have wanted to build like an open concept computer and then you look at how dusty your computer gets closed concept and you're like no oh my god looks like he builds computers maybe he's runs like a mini si business out of his apartment yeah i could see that i mean if i could build computers like that people would probably come to me and ask me to build them yeah from time to time clean up your goddamn room why do you have a tv sitting on chairs yeah yeah wait what wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait a computer are these design files for a computer and a laundry detergent bottle yep is it mineral oil is it submersion cooled no oh there's a fan on the side oh oh i i thought it was inside [laughter] no way oh that's awful so basically the only two things you need on your desk are your computer and your tissue box yeah does he have an led in the pump i think so this this is a frame that was fabricated to oh it's a it's a separate machine yeah it's a separate machine yeah [laughter] oh that's amazing this guy has a channel and a video like about those oh that's such a smart place to put a little one new power supply oh i like it i like it and the best part is you can pull all the stuff up and still like access it totally totally this is one of those mods that's actually probably more usable when you're done with it dude if you could adjust the fan speed with the knob that would be free baller all right this one's pretty cool huh okay it's the ultimate portable setup it almost looks like a lego technic project but really i've like fabricated big heavy hands door hinges who needs a microsoft surface am i right the edges you got to be careful with this thing yeah more like the microsoft weapon imagine bring this that is not a real 80 plus bronze sticker that is orange fruits look like they're starting to rust it's probably for the look oh yeah yeah really it's really enhancing it for me i don't know andy i think those might just be old screws wait what hold on no those are monitor arms okay what is data land i've never heard of dataland before let's go jake wait they're on newegg no way succeed well they were 6800 xt this is sick diy monitor stand computer oh huh i have never seen someone diy a monitor stand with base amounts is dust like not a thing in china it's definitely a thing yeah so why is everybody building these open concept pieces maybe they just cleaned their house once in a while so okay why is it in a box it's one of those desk things it's in a little alcove it's like one of those it's probably like a dorm oh oh yeah check your privilege man god what okay well if you have headphones like this my question's valid is the monitor on a little tripod ah did you just oh my god that's a tablet tripod look at the top look at the top you see the other part the clamp yeah did you diy this monitor that is not a good place for your wireless router um signals who needs the audio interface of some sort it's like a headphone amp i am loving the left side notepad by the way that is an a player move and i'm liking the classy wood wrist rest do you remember when i pitched this video idea what the cheapest nas setup where it was just gonna be like four pieces of extrusion and just a tower of external hard drives you buy cheap hbas that have the external connectors on ebay because those tend to be lower priced and then we just build an external cd tower essentially yeah of hard drives someone did it on a smaller scale i don't know if that's gonna help with uh filtering but at least you won't poke your finger in the fan yeah it's a grill which is a real problem that affects many people this is a computer made with idle motherboard it's in the motherboard box i don't know how much i believe that this is actually his setup because the hot glue gun is sitting right there yeah i don't know it also looks like like he cut holes for the power supply and then realized there was no space you see the other ones the power sports on top of the motherboard oh my god the funny thing is rpg enhanced board i think that's just a really bad direct translation from the english ironically there's a pretty disrespectful word for poor translations from chinese to english do you guys have an equivalent term for that yes we do when i was a kid i watched like cctv6 which is like china central television but the movie channel they always have like you know like the the chinese speaking ballet western movie sure so that translation is like hey i'm gonna kick your butt hi we'll tell you the pig it just sounds really weird oh in a way so like we're trying we call that like translate tone translate tone yeah so how did they end up with that rpg enhanced comes from the bazooka plus oh wait wait hold on this is a water cooled laptop shut up quick disconnects that did you make your own quick connect fittings i don't think so i think they're just quick disconnects but they leak what is growing on your mouse brother i think that might be grip tape and this might be the external reservoir radiator unit right right oh my god why if it's gonna be this big and this not portable because it leaks all over the place you need to get a desktop brother you need to get some clamps on this tube here like now because it's like the one that goes out yeah is there no photos of how it like connects oh it just goes into the laptop it must be like one that goes into a water block so you can't use it without it being connected so you might as well have a desktop uh yeah cool um okay what is this a hackintosh is that what i'm looking at here max station is this a giant sound bar that you couldn't even have centered under your monitor yeah yeah these wi-fi antennas though my goodness you know you can get your own access point okay you don't have to take it from your neighbor down the street the black can next is a diy audio system are these speakers are those like real cans he had like soda cans that kind of looks like soda can but are they just speakers they look like speakers they totally are speakers why what in what universe is that an optimal setup for anything plus you have the sound bar but why would you want your subs like in your computer i live with my parents in shanghai here's one side of my room oh i like it were those things look at this look at these cable management tracks are they lights i want this in my house if you have plug underneath your desk why do you need that well yeah hdmi yeah whatever that's freaking awesome it doesn't like look amazing but it it looks a lot more amazing than running it across the floor yeah not as good as running cable channel along the top of the ceiling button it's not bad i like it i you don't need to hide cables if they have some style i'm into it also loving the badminton racket very nice i can't tell what rack it is gtx 560s or something like that out there 560. yeah got the swing bar oh that stupid light no stupid it is stupid you don't need a light pointing at your screen if you have any idea how much engineering has gone into reducing the light shining back at you from the screen i think you should just try it for a month no i don't need to i don't need to i want as little possible distraction and light on my screen none everything's labeled i color coded i love it this is not necessary [laughter] instead labeling fans maybe yeah but the rest of this yes that's a sata cable i mean if you're just gonna leave yeah if you're gonna say which one fine but if you're just gonna label it say that [laughter] is that your pump no that's a gpu block jake they used to have a water cooled gpu and he just left and we're like eh howl under it oh no and how are these fans even mounted to this radiator there's some screws there's also zips [laughter] at all you need to top up your reservoir also this is for filling the reservoir it goes the other way this goes in this is not a lid oh my goodness nope that's all the context we get jake this is why i have trust issues this is their minecraft server apparently by the way oh sick need a slimline optical for my minecraft server oh yeah yeah it's not drawing on your desk yeah can you not do that please like for real also what's your keyboard doing way over look at that tissue fire hyzer don't solder over your computer yeah this is on yeah look how the usb i think this is the minecraft server this is good and minecraft server in my room because i have to take my pcd university that it must be itx type however there's not enough room for me to place the disk so i had to hang it outside you see one more time then there's no other picture shake i'm afraid that's all we get so many questions no amount of looking at this is going hello like is that where his bed is i don't know jake it's fine it's stressing me out oh my god oh my god i'm liking the ducted ac to the rig wait is that that's all i see it's a blower fan it's a fit and then it just blows over the gpu what why bringing the air from the room directly to the gpu you could just put a fan no jake this is the right way what model is it m40 m60 oh wait an m60 that might actually hold on an m16 might actually know that might be why oh i love it you could still just put a fan there well you could it's not a quadra with a tesla yeah you could 3d print a shroud or whatever but if they needed the first time with that cmp you know what i used duct tape i made a thing out of duct tape and that worked and this is this is their duct tape equally elegant great wind power supply we got two of them they've got multiple great wins wait there's one we missed yuki ans messaged us i don't know how this guy gets it but he has early samples of all the wildest stuff and he's trolling me basically i want to see him put it in his mouth clearly trolling i have no idea what i'm looking at here but it's blacked out so i can pretty much promise you that it is like next gen and no one's seen it oh you know what i bet it is because he gets like the wildest intel stuff this is probably um no no no the gpu thing oh um the the ponte vecchio look at this intel board it's got to be like this big what does this even go in internal use only brisk everest i don't know if i've ever seen one of those i think everest was a proposed product for like an even faster bat era something that never town ever cpus were used for high frequency stock trading yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh that's super cool they're one of those like um like specifically made for one company kind of thing so yes it's on x86 guide sandy bridge six core 12 thread 4.4 gigahertz oh and here's a highgone 24 core highgone i've been trying to get my hands on one of these yeah an epic socket it's sp3 yeah it's it's that it's that chinese epic this one is simply labeled pragmatism you roll out of bed you get in your chair my chair looks brutally uncomfortable what what so when you have a friend coming over you can just sit in your bed and your friend can use your own pc on the other side they're like is that leg holes you put your legs down there maybe okay that's all we get the word pragmatism and those two pictures that's clean wait what no fans yeah what is diy ape so that's a delivery creator that's pretty sick but it's pretty cool so your overport is on the back and that creator collab with like some of the manufacturer and they make that type of board that's pretty cool hi dear friend this is the suitcase computer i made it is 41 inches long noise i don't know about that ventilation you might need more cool can confirm that is a suitcase wait what what a laptop it's a laptop that doesn't have the top cover with the keyboard anymore laughs oh my what are you doing bud this is your vr that's their vr setup okay what is it what on earth is this so he's got a mac yeah and then also the pc that is that laptop yeah okay he's got the stupid light too no it's not stupid it's stupid it's not stupid it's so stupid you guys quiet hey that's cool that's sick yeah i don't know okay i don't know about this yeah or all the cables hanging down is this masking tape uh okay my initial reaction ew don't kick your wall clean your toe jam off the wall ew after a couple months there's barely any dust oh it's pretty this is a sick setup some proper photos what's there to say other than that it's gorgeous yeah it's like ikea pegboard love it cool a transparent screen this one oh cool yeah this is like a diy one i haven't seen somebody diy this in a long time oh oh that's awesome basically took the internals of a monitor without the backlight and then just made a side panel out of it yeah that's pretty cool what ram is that case super cool king win king king wait are they running off his game jack no way oh i like it yeah we're on the dock there it is there's the dock oh yeah yep and they're just running windows you could run windows oh i'm running lots of things hold on a second here's your subwoofer there's your avermedia capture card there's your nintendo there's your xbox there's your playstation there's your nas this is about the most dense setup i think i've ever seen got your wii u turn them all on i dare you i think he is running oh no [music] that's that's a lot of life-size waifu um that one just looks kind of cool yeah i mean i'm ignoring the background yeah there's definitely too much waifu is it with these guys it's the briefcase cardboard pc all right oh this is a gpu that we i was trying to buy this thing yes what is this what is it the sakura to see if it's the chinese brand is that a normal steam background can you do that no that's chinese steam oh it has like themes i don't know it's mac oh oh wait what yeah what are we even looking at no it's not a mac it's just it's awesome oh my god it is a mac wait where's the mac though so confused now it's a hackintosh is that an amd gpu because then it could be a hacker probably but why i don't know about running that stuff on a hackintosh a mac skin it's like the bar on the bottom looks a little sus 30 80 so it's oh no it wouldn't be a man that's a collector just here's the shelf on your shelf and you just shelf your computer this motherboard is just balance there it's vibing i kind of like the shelf he's got a door it's this book you see the door he didn't have screws for the acrylic so it's zip ties oh come on ah that is too much waifu um what go back up what about the laundry yeah no i mean if you only have that much space i guess i mean yeah okay the only question is does the person who took this picture wear these or collect them that's a big radiator oh my god there's a big radiator so close to having all the fans match it's big it's like three more no oh my god wait another person no no this is bad again wait this is this done worse no yeah it's nearly watch that video what that is hilarious i am also a blogger maybe this is just like the v1 is yeah was this a trend it's a it's a pretty memorable thing uh i think one was the correct number of times for someone to build a computer and a pump bottle okay that's pretty jake it's a carpeter too i love it okay last one wow the computer now goes in the kettle okay the gpus in the kettle oh i love it so this is just like a trend okay outro do the outro thanks to mine for sponsoring
