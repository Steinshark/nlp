ladies and gentlemen welcome to what is going to be one of the more unique videos uh that i've ever recorded on the gotham chess youtube channel in this video we're going to be touching on several things we're going to be reacting to a couple of things that magnus carlson arguable greatest chess player of all time has said about the future of chess i'm also going to be talking about uh what is likely the biggest existential threat and one of the major uh issues pending in the chess world and i will cover a lot of these issu isues both as an insider of the game who does create a lot of content and is involved with a lot of the major parties but also as a spectator and a fan and i do urge you to if you those of you that have an attention span and we'll get through this video uh please comment let me know your thoughts i will also have a poll on my youtube channel under the community tab uh for you to answer and i do apologize for my voice i think i probably have len gtis right now my voice box is in flamed but we're going to get through this together okay uh the two seconds the two second summary of this uh two sentence summary of this video is chess has a major disconnect in top level and regular spectator perceptions of the game and we have an unclear circuit we have a world championship title that doesn't really matter we have too many tournaments organized by too many people and we don't know if we want to play fast chess or slow chess now this all begins many years ago and it all starts with magnus carlson magnus carlson has voiced what he thinks the world championship should be let's listen i don't know what what is the goal of the world championship is it to um is it to showcase the best in the world and and uh and the general thought is that the one who wins the world championship is the best player in the world um i me yes and a little bit later in this video he said this just as much of a valid form to some uh rapid chess especially and all and to some extent also blitz is uh just as much of a valid form of chess as as classical and keep in mind this is 2018 now 2024 this is magnus carlson's vision for the game and that's one of the visions that i have for the future that there will be more um fish random chest or other variants for classical and that regular chess will be more rapid and blitz which i think it's better better suited for classical time control for fish random and other than that you envision faster chess basically faster chess is is the is the future now essentially the argument is classical chess is getting more and more obsolete rapid and blitz chess and just in general modernizing the game of chess to play things like fisher random which is a random shuffled back row of pieces is the future but while magnus carlson is a star it's not just going to be a case of well this is what magnus wants so we're going to do it so i've laid this out in a google document all right it's kind of ugly but bear with me uh and i will actually close this and i guess we can even yeah we we can centralize this a little bit so this is what i have outlined now caveat you don't have to agree with everything here it's not my point my point is i'm spelling out certain problems that we have and potential solutions to me and maybe you feel the same way the top chess event cycle the cycle of top tournaments during the year in chess is impossible to follow you have no idea which tournament matters more than another there are too many tournaments and one by one the world chance championship and the candidate cycle are outdated practices and they should be replaced why do we have an eight-player tournament once every two years it's been more frequent recently because of covid but why do we have a candidates with a completely ridiculous and unclear clear qualification system that changes every cycle to then challenge for a one-on-one world chess championship we have a oneon-one match format we have like a boxing or a ufc format but then the other tournaments don't even mean anything this is an outdated format in my opinion so outdated magnus carlson doesn't even want to participate in it but that's still considered the ultimate thing and the international chess federation aka fay still controls the world chess championship cycle they have controlled it for i don't know 70 80 years all right that's how it works and that's how it's organized and it's kind of a you know where's it going to be every single year and what's the qualification system now chess events are too long every day they're too long the games are too long the event itself is too long cuz it's like 3 weeks but that's actually not the worst part and that makes them not commercially viable and unattractive the sponsors now that might mean nothing to you all right cuz you're not a top player you don't care you're like i like when the game is 7 hours long but the reality of the situation is every sports event is 3 to four hours long except you know maybe cricket right cricket i know takes a long time but most sports events on television are 3 to four hours with exceptions and they're allowed to go longer because there's commercials you can run commercials right at the end of the day that's the ecosystem a chess event running 8 hours it's not commercially viable and we're going to get back to the document cuz my followup to that is as follows back in the day oh they needed the time they needed two hours but now opening preparation has reached the level there's no skill involved in the first 20 moves of the game so you get these players who play 3 hours each but they're not even using any time in the beginning back in the day nobody knew any openings there was no computers but with top level analysis the weakest grandmaster can equalize against the strongest grandmaster by the 15th move of the game and then we have to play chess also another problem chess events have been invitation only for a long time so like if you're a top junior in a random place in the world there's a chance you won't even get invited most events are invitation only and there's too many events and we're going to get into this in a second because we have the world championship we have the vion house uh freestyle chess which was just organized which inspire ired this video we have the grand chess tour organized by the st louis chess club and then we have the global chess league all right and on top of that we got all the chess.com events title tuesday champions chess tour i mean you name it proess league which has been discontinued we have too many people organizing too many events that's that's this is an issue now let's talk about it all right you may not think you may not agree with this you may not agree with this but there's several solutions all right we can create a system like tennis there is no such thing as a world champion we have a circuit of tournaments every year some more valuable than others tata steel may be more valuable some prestigious opens more valuable drop the invitational format knockout system or just a round by round system maybe not a knockout system but this is just how it works all right by the way one thing i haven't even covered here we have a tournament in chess called world cup like we have a tournament called the world cup like on top of all of this we got a world cup and a world championship bro it doesn't even make any sense anyway create a system like tennis there's a elo there's a point value assigned to every tournament that's the way we crown who's the best chess player in the world if there's a way to do that that might be the best way we can speed up regular chess with a focus on rapid and armageddon tie breaks like the champions chess tour rapid chess plus armageddon or we could do classical chess and if you draw the game with you probably will then you break the tie with an armageddon which is what they do in norway chess where white gets 10 minutes and black gets seven and that's the way they they change up the standings or the thing that inspired this entire video freestyle chess fisher random chess 960 so february 2024 comes a major player into the world of chess the vien house beautiful resort that hosted the g7 summit look at this place it doesn't even look real and they organized an event called the freestyle goat chess challenge and um the format of the event was chess 960 meaning it was a shuffled back row of pieces drawn randomly every day players don't know any openings the first part of the tournament was rapid fast chess determining the seating and then they played a classical knockout okay now couple of things about this event theoretically and it was organized by uh the owner of the resort uh whose name i will probably pronounce incorrectly jan henrik butner german entrepreneur owner of the resort like i said they hosted the g7 like they've hosted world leaders they know hospitality beautiful event play players dressed in custom suits all right players driven to their games by bmw which was a sponsor partner uh of the event all this is beautiful theoretically the budget and the hospitality for these players unlimited they should be treated really really well then they had certain features in the event itself uh a mix of formats then they would have something like a confession booth which has been done before players go into a secret room they tell you their thoughts while the game is going on right they have heart monitors this insight into the players what else did they have uh they had a lot of media they made them do a lot of interesting interviews they the the players get to collaborate on the position so imagine a brand new chess position nobody knows anything about it you got players analyzing the game before it's even possible like discussing potential openings that's all very interesting stuff surprise surprise it was won by magnus carlson right but that for format i'm not sure is sustainable what i'm going to say is it's not i don't think it's here is a replacement i don't think freestyle chess or fisher random can replace chess period because at the end of the day if you want by the way did you guys enjoy chess 960 is it something you liked watching but not playing yourself what i what i mean by that is this is the disconnect top level players tired of openings tired of longtime control tired tired tired but we love openings we don't experience that if you're 1200 you love chess you love it you don't you don't it's it's it's completely different than something like tennis because i like tennis i'm like 700 at tennis i love tennis i'm and and the top players aren't tired of tennis they love tennis tennis is tennis chess openings are more boring than tennis how about formula 1 nobody knows how to drive a race car but everybody watches formula 1 so so i don't think chess 960 or freestyle chess will replace chess in the traditional sense but if we just add it on to the circuit of events i think it definitely has a home i think freestyle chess in the vien house team did an incredible job creating all this media around the players you know putting them in these luxurious conditions and hey if i'm a part of the next one call me guys seriously hit me up like that's great like let's do it but here in lies the problem this is a totally random event that popped out of nowhere last year we had an event called global chess league organized by anand mahindra who's a who's a uh entrepreneur from india this was an event that was organized in dubai the format was a team event it was really interesting all right you had all these teams from india trevani upgrad like i i didn't even i i barely could follow this event because i didn't understand anything that was going on so you have another event totally random totally random event that happened but it was big the indian audience really enjoyed it and it was organized by by by mahindra and i don't know if this is coming back i i i see i can speak about the vion house event because i watched it i i could barely follow along this event i didn't quite understand what was going on if i don't understand what's going on the general audience definitely doesn't either we need to centralize this stuff we have to do something where there like it's very clear what fans can look forward to every single year that's just my opinion we also have something that's been going on for years the grand chest tour this has been getting organized by the st louis chess club for like a decade and every year they have tournaments around the world this is an invitational tournament one of the major problems of chess is that they are all invitational invitational meaning you have to maintain your status as a top 10 player in the world to get invited to the grand chess tour and now we have dates here and here and here we also now have to worry about vien house which is going to have multiple events in a year we're going to have to worry about maybe the global chess league is going to come back champions chess tour is going to come back this is the problem do you understand my point this is the problem and while all of this is happening we got this what relevance does this even have anymore if you become the world champion of chess you might win less money than if you're a professional player who competes and wins some of these other events it doesn't make sense it doesn't make sense there's too many events it's so hard to follow now let's talk about the formats again all right let's deep dive some of these things okay why is there such a need to change anything well like i said one of the hypothesis is why are you changing anything and we're stuck in our traditions let's just do things the way we always have it's not 1970 it's just not the truth is chess players this is my opinion top chess players don't know their commercial worth they don't know it you should want your favorite chess players to earn money to earn a lot of money you should want sponsors to sponsor your favorite chess player because the more sponsors there are for top athletes the more you can develop chess in countries this is how it works norway has an entire tv station dedicated to magnus carlson cuz he's so good can you imagine being a number one player in another country and you have a tv station backing you this should be more of the standard there should beamies in countries to develop the next wave of chess talent we should not rely only on billionaire philanthropy and by the way down that list this organized by philanthropy you know anan mahindra he's a billionaire entrepreneur rex singfield organizes the st louis ch billionaire philanthropist trying to grow the game that they have done a tremendous job but the more you make something sustainable in the long run and bring in sponsors so these guys don't have to pay out of pocket yan henrik butner to organize the vison house event probably paid millions i don't know i haven't asked him how much money he spent but but we can't just rely on that what they're doing is incredible but we we also need to find a way to build for the future i would love to see a future where freestyle chess has multiple events on the calendar and we know in advance and we know who's playing and if they want to do an invitational fine you organize the event do the invitational but in tennis there's no invitational there's a qualification system once you start doing invitationals in chess you mess with the overall standings tennis doesn't have any invitationals that count for the world rankings so that's kind of a conundrum that's kind of a problem if we just want to have more of these kind of small private really prestigious events maybe that's just what we have to do maybe there is no way around that at the end of the day we also have a world championship title that is literally meaningless i mean it's not it's not literally meaningless there's a world champion but everybody's going around going well that guy's the champion and he's playing in all these other events do you see what my point is this is the issue we have no clarity is top level classical chess a dying thing of the past i don't know if it's dying the tata steel chess tournament that just concluded was truly really great however if you tell me hey chess players and broadcasts can have a sponsor come in partner with the event put the event on television vision i would say yeah let's speed it up a little bit let's speed it up a little bit if the north star of chess if the top goal of chess is play the game as perfectly as possible that does not mix with appeal to wider audience that does not appeal with commercial viability that does not appeal with behind the scenes footage documentary style footage your favorite players getting interviews and media slots people don't want to watch something that takes s hours and there's people in the chess world who say well screw those people because we don't want to den we don't want to lower the level of the game my point is chess players don't need two hours anymore they used to need two hours if you're going to give them two hours have them play freestyle chess have them play a format where they don't know the openings but if you're not going to do that speed the game up i'm not talking from 3 hours to 15 minutes maybe 25 minutes but what i want my dream in chess is for companies and media to care about the top players and for there to be an ecosystem for these folks for them to be sponsored athletes for us to be able to build the next wave of chess prodigies for kids who are interested in chess at the age of nine to not want and are really good to not quit to then go to college every day people around the world look up to athletes all right all athletes all athletes in any sport and they see that per person paved the way i'm gna go train really hard i'm going to go play in tournaments i want to be really really good just like that person and i want to be the best and in chess it just stops like it just stops there are so many good players ages 8 9 10 11 whose parents are like you're really good but go pursue a career in medicine go be a banker go be this go be that go to school and we're limiting ourselves because we are stuck in our own ways in our own traditions that's just the reality and i go back to this every single time one of the biggest counterpoints to all of this is gotham you just want more people in the game cuz you want more views and you want people to buy your courses and i cannot stress this enough you're right no i'm joking my increase of views and etc and all of this will be nowhere near as much as the player salaries and opportunities can grow for some of these people the people playing the game itself i'm just telling you that's just how it is they get sponsored by bmw they get sponsored by a watch company and they go to these events and they participate like this would be this would be groundbreaking right now the major problem is we just have random events popping up left and right and we don't even know what to watch we don't know what's important anymore we're just kind of sitting there going oh this is cool like i watched this freestyle chess i was like wow this is really cool a lot of the top players said this is the most refreshing chess experience they've ever had in in their life but we can't just rely on the niceness of people like yan henrik to fuel the chess world he did a great thing he made a lot of top players happy but we can't only rely on that there has to be some structure there has to be something that we're playing for we are in a really weird spot right now in the chess world really weird where the world championship doesn't mean anything the candidates doesn't mean a whole lot but we're still going to watch it we're still going to cover it right classical chess is too slow apparently not commercially viable people don't want to sponsor chess they don't want to get involved in the media side of chess because our events take seven hours long what do you think what do you want to see what do you like to watch let me know in the comments do you agree with me that covering that following these tournaments that pop up all the time are a little bit difficult to follow unless i guide you through them i don't know i don't know what the top what what what you guys think and like i said in the beginning what you think does not even match up to what the top players think so we're in a weird spot that's the summary if i could snap my fingers and tomorrow we woke up and everything was different i would have a tennis system i would figure out a way for there to be grand slam style events we could alternate regular chess freestyle chess freestyle chess should be a part of chess moving forward even for the world rankings like there has there should be a way because it really is a true determinant of how good you are at the game that would be my solution a circuit of events world ranking system i might pivot to to a place where we we don't have this world championship match we don't have this one-on-one format but that's not what i control i'm just here i make recaps and um i'll continue to uh ideate and iterate and think of what we can do for chess in the future in the meantime i will continue to cover like i said all those events as they keep popping up i think uh the organizer jan henrik said that the next one was coming to india he made a video about it on the chess bas india channel they did tons of media there it was great it was excellent um but i just want to organize this better i want to be less confused about what chess events matter and what don't i want them to stop being novelty dropped here and there and i want some clarity and i want us to all come together on what we're even playing for in the world championship crown that's all i have for you today get out of here
