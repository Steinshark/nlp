ladies and gentlemen i've got a question for you have you ever beaten magnus carlson in a game of chess neither have i however you are better than me as a chess player because i have actually lost to him you see you're undefeated against magnus i'm oh and one uh this video is about the pro chess league match-up that happened a couple of days ago between the canada team and the indian team and it features a victory over magnus carlson for the first time in a chess player's career something that all of you would know something about uh i'm going to take you through the story of the match gave me about 20-25 minutes of your time and there is an insane plot twist at the end of this video that you definitely do not see coming all right so canada the team that magnus is on uh was playing against india and magnus was doing his thing all right he sat down to play against uh vaishali ramesh babu board one plays board four right there's four players four players so one plays four and then it sort of rotates and early on magnus played a relatively uh ambitious opening and vaishali responded very aggressive with this move d4 the point is that white is giving up a pawn but the idea is that after an exchange occurs you're going to attack the center with the move c3 and she got a great position early she was really putting a lot of pressure on magnus with a5 pressure here various attacking possibilities the queen and bishop maybe f4 in the future position are nice and it looks like you know vaishali's got a kind of very promising thing going on here pawn takes pawn takes knight d2 and life is good the problem is this is a very very tricky position and magnus quickly played b5 which is intending to deflect the bishop over here into the line of sight of the rook and also queen e5 which is a fork and a thread of checkmate queen e5 there is queen g3 to defend and then come through but uh it's better to avoid such things bishop d3 and slowly but surely magnus took over the game look at this knight it's defended from far away the rook is trapped magnus picks up on f1 and uh is up in exchange and let me tell you something right now being up in exchange is good being an up in exchange when your name is magnus carlson and you are also up four minutes on the clock and your opponent has 50 seconds yeah uh life is good so he comes in it's this simplifying very nice up material hits the rook trades the bishops gets in with his rooks and it's bad news for vaishali as magnus is just trading down all of the material picking up pawns left and right and a very nice dagger at the end to fork the pieces and rook takes d2 now in this position by charlie reside okay but like why are we celebrating magnus beating somebody he has a 400 point rating advantage against right well the point is that magnus was in good form uh magnus was crushing early on in this match he won the first game with absolutely no hiccups in the very next game he was playing against their board three india's board three very very strong international master and magnus played uh a very solid opening uh just developed his pieces now the very small imbalance here is that white has traded the b-pawn for uh for sorry they have trading b-pawns but what that has done is it's opened up the b file and also magnus has a little bit more claim to the center and the thing is in chess there are three sides of the board there is the center right there is the queen side and the king side if you can win the battle out of two of three it's good if you can win the battle out of three of three you win the game so what does magnus do plays rook b1 and plays d4 and black is already nearly completely lost at least from the standpoint of like playing against magnus what do i mean by that well the thing is if black takes on d4 white just gets massive center potential advancement open file open file queen can come out like everything in white's position is active these pieces are purely cosmetic they serve absolutely no purpose they have no way to come forward whatsoever without drastically weakening the position or creating targets like even this move is already plus three and a half right the most natural move and it can't even be taken right like um so bishop e7 and magnus does this and just i mean truly has like a fantastic position now what is the plan here by the way he hasn't even spent a minute he has nine minutes on the clock he hasn't even spent a minute to get a completely winning position against like a 2500 rated international master this is his chess.com rapid rating but his over the board rating is over 2500 so he's like you know top i don't know top eight top 500 player in the world and magnus yeah no problem yeah whatever yeah rookie one so what is magnus gonna do he's gonna transfer this knight this way he's gonna pressure this he's gonna pressure the b file he'll bring his queen out hitting this and this and he will make it look completely effortless bishop f4 knight d2 knight a4 uh his opponent tries to trade knights we have a big trade magnus not afraid hits the queen queen out and this is just the purest of forks and notice how this is also under pressure can we just take a moment here and acknowledge the absolute uselessness of these three pieces i'm not insulting magnus's opponent i'm just i'm just helping you understand like how magnus makes people look and how he makes his opponent this knight has absolutely no role in the game this bishop is staring at nothingness it has absolutely zero participation value in this game uh meanwhile this bishop is staring at a brick wall this queen is tied to a horrible pawn and this rook is also not doing anything i mean literally all of his opponent's pieces are useless like it's like incredible so he takes the pawn he takes the file he gets in with his knight he welcomes in a trade and he just starts pushing his pawn it's just black literally cannot do anything he's barricaded here by his own pawns he's barricaded here by his opponent's bonds his rook is staring at the pawn again his queen can come here but the king just goes to h2 like he completely and utterly paralyzed his opponent and got it to a situation where you literally cannot stop mate you can only stop mate by losing all of your material on b7 and his opponent just resigned no i mean magnus was just in buzz saw mode i mean he was just demolishing two for two and while this was happening i told you i'm gonna take you through the story of the match while this is happening something completely ridiculous is happening in a totally separate side of the match while this is happening mr attack to meet you that's not his legal name on his passport he's not like the mclovin of chess uh he's playing against obviously raonic sudwani a very strong indian player this is raz von preo to and rosvan priyoto has a 2470 fide rating so he got the grand master title slid below 2500 just a little bit i believe he's in college now probably you know doing what college kids do play hearthstone all day or something i don't know he's in college all right he got the grand master title like life is good he doesn't need to stress about chess a whole a whole but yo russ von preyotu as the board three for canada sits down in the first game and just has an excellent position against raunak sadwani who's like who's 16 17 years old well 17 i guess because 2005 17'. and uh he just very slowly starts completely putting apart lex position the knight hits the rook now white is spoiled white can take this and this and this and he just takes this to hit the queen takes the rook and he's just up a piece he's up a piece he's up two minutes and his opponent plays knight f3 which is a nice little trick to win the rook but folks two bishops beat a rook they just do there's two pieces and not to mention you also have past pawns so you're just gonna push and the king is safe so queen d6 and there go the pawns white is completely winning the king is blocked by the bishops and the pawn is just gonna go and queen game is over now this might not shock you you might be sitting there going i don't understand all right where's the beating magnus carlson part what am i even watching well what you're watching is the fact that in the early stages of this match canada was destroying india the canada's board three beat india's board two and then and then i think you know where this is going board one for india vidit vidit gujarati one of the top like 20 players in the world board one for india india's equivalent magnus carlson right magnus carlson is board one for canada he's the airport one vidit against against uh mr razvan prayotu gets a good position from the opening you know the equal position life is good it's you know but starts to take over the game right starts to do what 2700s do look at this knight getting in beautiful bishop wouldn't it be nice to teleport the queen here and deliver a mate somehow here comes f4 white has a great position and three minutes up on the clock right this is bread and butter for uh for people who are rated uh 2700. knight back to b7 knight to d6 and around here i believe vidit had to like just completely go for it he had to play h4 because if his opponent played h5 he would just he would just juggernaut it queen g4 h5 takes and you know mate vidit uh decided to do it this way and try to play in the center and he kind of got tangled on the on the king side a little bit like his opponent was putting up good resistance which sometimes gets the top players like a little bit frustrated gets anybody frustrated so video played queen h4 and then kept trying to push forward and here he had to just play the very simple not simple but take here queen g5 and hit the pause button and say doing well i'm gonna go here and i'm gonna win but instead of that video went for glory he was like i am not going to allow the knight forward first i'm going to go g4 and then i'm going to take and the move g4 blunders such a nasty counter punch but you need to find it with only two minutes on the clock and the fact that you're playing such a good player right and now g5 and all of a sudden as you can see stockfish is saying black is better black was supposed to get stomped this game that was that was the way this was trending black was just supposed to get pancaked wyatt was supposed to walk forward do what 2700s do and win the game and rose von priyotsu said not today brother you ain't bullying no 2470 with your 27 20 feet i don't care let's go g5 when this opens up vidit takes the pawn and hello hello whose king is actually weak whose king is actually weak bozo yeah do something queen f3 do you know what queen f3 threatens queen f3 threatens you might look at this and oh the rook yes also mate also mate queen f1 is literally checkmate so vidit comes back but rook f4 vivid is completely lost he has no way to defend rook g4 and a devastating attack on his king he thinks for a while panics and goes here this move guards the second rank but it relinquishes control of this rank russu the board 3 of canada just defeated india's board one and two i mean the match is over like the matches it's over when a board three beats the top two boards on the other team the match is over right and a four on four format four on four the board three beats one i mean the game matches over or so you would think norway sorry i keep calling them norway because magnus is on the team canada was up four games six and a half two and a half that was the match score first to eight and a half wins six and a half to two and a half magnus was absolutely on fire like this man what hears his game against raonic sudwani he is playing with the black pieces he plays a timon of sicilian all right magnus was just doing magnus things bishop c5 all right nice and solid position from the opening everything is good and now magnus comes forward uh oh so you gotta defend this and around it because like you know what you know what i'm gonna stand up to magnus f4 here we go here we go magnus let's go let's throw some hands bob throws the jab out you know rolls the shoulder and everything to protect against the counter i learned a thing or two in boxing classes yeah magnus just goes queen b6 and wins on the spot try to try to throw one punch at magnus and magnus said boop do you know what this threatens what does it threaten it threatens queen b2 right there is something even more nasty that it threatens it threatens the fact that if you defend this which by the way is basically impossible knight e2 check and you cannot take the knight because the queen pins everything right and if you move your king out of the way of course i'm just gonna take him d2 so that's exactly what he did he took on b2 and then he took on c2 and raonic sedwani resign the game yep that was the whole game 20 moves done i mean magnus was just beating everybody seven out of seven he played seven games in the protest league and then he won all of them now again you're probably a little confused because you're like where's where's the big game well india was not to be denied here is raunak sadwani once again this is the final round and round exoduani against aryansari started out as a very simple four nights game which is the most boring opening in chess uh it leads to a million different draws and india in this round launched single-handedly the greatest comeback in chess history as far as i'm concerned that's probably gas i'm probably gassing it up as the kids say maybe maybe just protest league history but this was one of the most impressive comeback victories i've ever seen in my damn life raonic sudwani with the black pieces proceeded to get a touch a touch worse position a slightly worse position if you will a little bit a little bit passive and then he traded off pieces into a knight versus bishop situation and completely took over the game he played queen h4 g5 launching a pawn in front of his king dislodging the defense of this pawn okay and when aryan tari tried to infiltrate his position and beat things up do you want to know what raunix hadwani did he locked the rook in a cage and then he sacrificed his own rook because if you take it this rook dies a very sad death on d7 look at that position he's in a complete cage that's crazy there's a rook is in a box can't escape rook takes g4 and raonic sudwani up a full night traps the rook anyway and goes on to win rook takes there's this and so a lot of this match came down to this game right here this is what you're here for magnus carlsen vs vita gujarati would you like to know the head-to-head score of these two players in rapid and blitz 14 wins for magnus 12 draws zero wins for vidit that according to chessgames.com is their head to head score he has his number he just has his number vidit has drawn a lot of games but he hasn't broken through yet remember how i told you in the intro that there's a plot twist that you're not going to expect it's coming pawn takes c5 takes bishop a7 knight bd2 castles and this is our starting position that we will analyze the pawn structure is completely symmetrical all right six six no dnc pawns white is a little bit better because white moves first this bishop is blocked white will probably finish developing first and maybe launch kind of the middle game plan so what does video do starts fighting back invites magnus in for a cup of tea and just lets his knight live there on the d6 square as vidit is beginning to create his counter play he cannot take this because of discover check he plays things like knight d5 magnus gets a death grip positionally on the c5 square so he will be moving this and when he does the bishops will stare directly at vivid's position and most likely it will signal that the black king will perish so vidit plays bishop to e8 and h6 magnus finishes his development and now he has the perfect recipe to create an attack he can create an attack with a move like g4 that is what the computer wants that's not a very human move so instead he does this and offers an exchange the reason why magnus is playing it this way is because he's trying to remove black's defending pieces before he goes on an attack and also let's not forget canada is winning the match so like you don't need to put your foot on the gas just yet you could just kind of seal the draw and win the match right as that's happening rook d8 rook c1 king f8 and the night will now be arriving on c5 soon knight c3 okay knight f6 queen c2 94 95 95. all right night has finally arrived the queen is going to infiltrate to h7 the bishop is staring at that pawn and it is going to be a 15th win for magnus carlsen magnum is going to win the game he's done it for a 15 time he just has vivid's number there is nothing that vidit can do when he plays against magnus and he takes on c5 and it's checkmate in three now you must be feeling very very perplexed because while i do click bait in my videos i don't lie i clickbait with absurd titles so that you click but you still get a good piece of content but am i lying i said magnus lost right but he has made in three well he didn't find it what magnus carlson has a checkmate in three moves in this position he has two minutes on the clock to find it and the second move of the sequence is this bishop takes g7 ends the game the king takes the queen checks and either of these moves are met by queen h8 this mate this mate crisscross applesauce but magnus plays this first it's it's unfathomable it's an unfathomable miss it it almost never happens you are officially no different than the greatest chess player of all time you also would have not played bishop takes g7 he played here he missed maiden three and the craziest part is he she's still completely winning maybe around here he had realized he missed bishop g7 and that can really mess with you that can really mess with you i don't know because i haven't spoken to the guy but if you know that you just missed the mate you go oh my god what have i done that messes with you now if magnus just plays rook c5 he is still completely winning he's still much better queen aj check is what he played in the game and then he did this and he's still better and he still has two minutes versus 40 seconds but then the most absurd turnaround started happening it's plus three but he goes here and then he tries to do this and all of a sudden it's equal it's equal it's back to equality this is insane what is happening magnus had to like not play e4 he had to keep his bishop open the computer wanted some h4 and even here it wanted him to find this was the last moment that magnus had a tactic he had to find bishop f6 and the idea is queen h7 and this and if you take with the king there's a queen f8 and bishop f7 like e5 and some huge attack but bishop f6 is the last remaining tactic magnus does this and then sacrifices his knight and misses this he misses the fact that g7 is protected and if he plays g4 it's too slow boom boom and i'm getting out with knight g695 this is unfathomable this is unfathomable rook c5 knight back to f6 he doesn't have enough mating material what a g5 takes then the king runs back to a fate and queen of three and vidit is completely winning despite having six seconds on the clock this is a turnaround for the ages folks vidit consolidates moves forward takes on a3 and magnus just doesn't have enough pieces to create any sort of meaningful counter play he does his best but it's over knight d4 hits the bishop b2 is coming magnus resigns vivid beats magnus for the first time in his career from a position where it was literally checkmate in three on the board that is so crazy and india after trailing six and a half two and a half wins the next seven games india wins the match 9.5 6.5 they were down 6.5 2.5 they won seven games in a row and they won the match how's that for a youtube video now get out of here
