ladies and gentlemen today is a historic day for the game of chess as frank the superstar chess prodigy teenage content creator from england has finally crossed 1 000 elo many of you followed frank's chess journey in 2023 a lot of you have enjoyed the content and me training him and him getting better some of you have voiced your disdain and hatred for this content but yet here you are still watching this video thank you thank you very much um in today's video i'm going to show you the last couple of games that frank has played on his way here and i'm going to give you some context and show you the first ever chess game that he played this video should serve as an inspiration to you whether you're intermediate or you're a beginner or if you're 2400 you know this can also inspire you as well this is frank frank started making tick tocks and youtube shorts in the beginning of 2023 yelling the word a lot and in general being a bit of a wanker as the the brits say he made his account on january' 2023 i'm about to show you the first ever chess game he's ever played it was probably it was one of the most incredible things i've ever seen uh he has played nearly 12 nearly over 1200 rapid games he has played just 175 blitz games he's done 2 000 puzzles and it's it's been a wild ride frank shot up the ranks uh very very quickly from around 1 200 i gave him a few lessons i i got him on the right journey and he was climbing climbing climbing but between may and july of this year he was the same level he plateaued for two months which happens all of you watching this video have definitely plateaued many of you probably longer than two months and then frank participated in the pog champs chess tournament if you're over the age of like 30 and internet terms like pogchamp don't mean much to you that was just a tournament of very big youtubers and streamers that were amateur level at chest a thousand six hundred and so on um and uh and they competed and frank broke past his plateau in fact making it all the way to the final of the event and i will show you a game uh that he played let's just jump into this because this this is awesome stuff uh frank is awesome uh he has put out you know tremendous amounts of content uh and then we're gonna look at the game that he played in pogchamps where he actually defeated uh the big dog uh sea dog in the finale and then we're gonna see a couple of his games breaking through to 1000 all of these games are utterly hilarious because even though he breaks a thousand that doesn't actually mean that either of the players have mastered chess but in the meantime let's look at the first ever chess game that frank played because this is where we came from it's been about eight months all right since this game was played and let this serve as an inspiration to you now you may ask why frank is rated 700 in the first game he played i think he selected that he was rated 800 on chess.com like i think that's what happened he made an account he was like i'm 800. anyway here we go frank began his career with pawn to d4 and then pawn to e3 and pawn to f4 now some of you who know chess might go oh wow frank was playing a stonewall that's what he was doing look at that his first ever chess game on chess.com first ever january' 2023 makes a chess.com account you all probably have a day like that in your memory you made an account you started playing you went oh my god this is not how i remember it and you know normally in the stonewall you develop your bishop and your knight and you just forget this 707 it was more like 107. in this position frank plays ponto g4 clearly not a good move all right and and but you don't know that as a beginner as a beginner you're just like well i'm gonna push the pawns right like that's what i'm gonna do what is this chest stuff all about this is not a good move because pushing f and g pawns weakens your king okay and queen h4 check although it doesn't win material right away uh you've you know you gotta understand like what's looking at what right vision and uh why why it is in trouble here but his opponent doesn't play that his opponent plays pawn to g6 and uh now they've moved some more puns and they move pawns for a while in this game it takes a very long time for either player to move anything except upon frank plays pawn takes ponte now frank continues to try to play a pawn move of course he is losing now because uh he he's he's going he's going down here in the center but he keeps going pawn to d5 11 pawn moves to start the game he you know he can't make any more progress uh so now that frank is all pawned out even though he still has more pawn moves to play potentially frank decides to play queen takes d5 queen takes d5 just hangs the queen in one move there is nothing complicated about this whatsoever queen takes d5 this looks like you know the first chess game that many people might play um bishop to e3 finally i don't know why we waited until we lost the queen and moved every pawn one or two squares to develop the bishop but frank does continue the path here and takes on b6 now the fastest way to win this position with black is of course to swarm the king or to use the queen in a way that you know you just you you take everything right you use the queen as a bully you just have to not lose the queen so now frank takes another pawn he spends three seconds on that move it's defended by three different pieces it is definitely not a good move pawn to h5 and now frank goes back for some reason because that's you know and then and then he and then then his opponent doesn't take his rook he takes this and frank very well spotted by the way rook takes excellent move unfortunately the rook's life is short-lived as he goes here and hangs it immediately so frank is basically down the entire squad of pieces he is completely and utterly and hopelessly lost uh pawn to b4 he loses that as well instead his opponent goes here and hangs the rook uh and then uh and then hangs the queen in one move trying to sneak the queen to take the rook and now frank instead of taking the queen or saving the rook attacks the queen again therefore allowing queen takes rook now the opponent takes the pawn and hangs the queen the opponent is still winning because he has so many pieces swarming but it's very close now the opponent plays this and and all of a sudden frank gets a new queen he gets a new queen but knight to c2 and bishop to g3 are mates in one i mean this is pure 100 elo chess there is nothing for 93 or 707 about this uh frank now takes the pawn and by some sort of miracle of god takes all of his opponents pieces and does not actually stalemate gives so many well they haven't started yet but here come the checks uh takes the last pawn and doesn't even know how to ladder he does not know how to do a ladder checkmate he just accidentally accidentally gets close and it's he does not frank did not know that this was made he didn't know so somehow frank wins uh a position that looks like this that's the first game he ever played this man was down 12 points of material anyway that was the first game he ever played and he was around 200 for like two months okay he did not know how to play the game started taking it more seriously and this all culminated in him making it after six months of play to the pog champs finale the final championship bracket match of a 16 player tournament with players of a thousand nine hundred eleven hundred strength and here he was against sea dog va the perennial number one and before this event started before the finale started i taught frank the karo khan specifically for this match we did a training session right before the finale and i said frank you gotta get your black opening sharper or else sea dog is gonna kill you so i was like all right we are gonna learn the karo khan and this is what we're gonna do i taught him the karo khan i i predicted actually that sea dog would be playing this i thought that conor would play the advanced variation because he's a very principled guy he's a solid one thousand eleven hundred player and he puts you know knights out and bishops out he follows the principles he really doesn't break from them but he played knight f3 and then he played the exchange now the good news for frank is that the exchange variation is very easy to play you develop your knight you develop your bishop you develop your knight and you develop your other bishop right it like it child's play not not exactly child's play because we learned this opening you know about a week before the event so sea dog pinned us i'm saying us because you know frank and i are a team and frank already broke 900 by the way right uh and then bishop d6 and he didn't play what i told him but the good news is the karo khan is so good that even if you develop in a sub-optimal way you're gonna be fine conor violated a couple of principles here the knight is in front of the c pawn so he has no meaningful use of this knight the pawn should be up if he wants pressure behind the pawn uh the bishop also actually doesn't do anything right and yeah black is going to castle the only reason i don't like the knight here is because it's not actually defending the king the night there does defend the king but whatever a3 not a move that does much he thought for a while castles bishop g5 pins the knight to the queen and now frank plays f6 and goes back and just has an advantage okay he just has a better position which is exactly what we prepared for in the opening uh and at this point i was like all right well now the 900 could kick in right that's the thing if you're a 900 elo at some point you're gonna do something goofy it's a very tough position to play frank plays a very natural move it turns out to be a big mistake uh it turns out to be a mistake because of course here white can just take and now two things attacked that pawn so after something like take take white is just up a clean pawn and i would have imagined it would have gotten from bad to worse because white would have ended up just getting something like this and is completely winning so i was worried here but sea dog did this and now frank took with the pawn solidifying his center and i was like wait a minute frank has got a really good position against the best player in the event and now sea dog played b4 which is not a move that does much and frank played the best move again e4 locking the center and removing the white knight from the board and now this is an avalanche waiting to happen what black should do here is just f5 f4 and if white goes here you just keep going why because you're going to open up the position bishop h3 knight g6 queen h4 knight f4 black is completely winning here because uh because white is completely restricted this central blockade prevents any of these pieces from helping the king you are removing the oxygen from the position you are removing it's like a naval blockade you just you can't get any forces over there so slowly but surely i'm just going to butcher you over here e4 was a ridiculous move now cure frank lost focus a little bit he went to the other side of the board but that's fine then he played knight f5 i would have played pawn f5 f4 if your pawns can lead the way in a coordinated fashion for the attack you should do it because they're the they're the small troops they can break things down before you bring in the heavy artillery queen g4 was played frank took the bishop and now again if frank had found f5 it was basically game over because uh white is out of moves like white is just completely forced backwards at which point you'll play rook f6 rook h6 and and white has to sacrifice if white does not sacrifice in plays like this it's just a matter of time it's just a matter of time queen here f3 even bishop c8 hitting the queen f3 i mean this is this is absolutely game over queen h4 bishop h2 rook h4 bishop h3 all this stuff just game over okay so what happens here is bishop c8 anyway and then frank here loses focus and focuses on the wrong side of the board you should try to focus where your pieces are pointed right all of this is pointed this way this is restricting enemy territory and all of a sudden the game opened up and this is where i was getting very nervous frank played uh sea dog played pawn takes bishop takes now the rook is under pressure sea dog moved his rook frank chased him and then he trapped he trapped the rook and this i was like oh my goodness this is frank's moment he's gonna win this match he might win pog champs five this is this is craziness my student my protege knight takes d5 was played by sea dog an act of desperation he was hoping for bishop takes and the knight takes but instead frank said the rook's not going anywhere thank you for the night so now i want a knight and your rook is still trapped this is crazy this is absolutely sensational sea dog plays rook takes frank plays bishop takes frank is just up two pieces two clean pieces now rook to d1 in this position black has to play a move which is not defending this bishop but counter-attacking the rook what's worth more than a rook what's worth more than a bishop sorry a rook and checkmate so if the rook moves you take you you mate if this you can slide out of the way and attack the rook again hard to see instead of that franklin here and that move is a tragic blunder because rook to e8 is now a devastating counter-attacking measure in chess the two most important things are material and king safety sea dog blunders and plays rook to e8 and now frank has a 50 50. capture and allow checkmate or move king to f7 and survive king f7 queen here and the king escapes queen e4 bishop f5 game over frank blunder's checkmate in one move hahaha but sea dog takes the queen instead and now the players have a scramble one minute remaining on the clock queen a5 probably white is playing for a win because white has all of these past pawns but suddenly it's frank who swarms with his rooks and it looks like sea dog is about to promote but instead he goes here and blunders and now the white king is in dire straits and he hangs a checkmate when i saw this live i nearly fell out of my chair what an absolutely cold-blooded comeback with 17 seconds on the clock in game one of the pog champs finale all because we were confident with our opening frank got a very solid and good position and and after that you know chess was played there was good moves there was bad moves it was a very very tense game frank had a great position he didn't execute it perfectly but he he got a massive material advantage a massive counter-attacking opportunity and then a miss by sea dog who thought that the idea in the moment with time ticking was to win the queen only later realizing uh that it was uh it was actually to deliver a checkmate so that was crazy unfortunately frank went on to lose the match but this was a very very big game because he had an early lead it's like winning a set against one of the best tennis players in the world and then going down after that but he kept grinding and this was the game that frank won to cross a thousand elo on chess.com and with frank it is never easy if you think that this was some you have no idea what you're about to see so frank was playing an indian player the indian player played like a hippo i'm not insulting him he is literally playing what's called the hippo opening like this e5 d5 and the players got a very locked position early like this and so you know frank was trying to reroute over here h3 frank was spending a lot of time trying to make various things happen uh his opponent was playing virtually instantly look at his opponent not thinking whatsoever frank launching an attack uh it would have been better if he had prepared this move so for example if he had prepared the move f5 just very like let's just you know say uh very similar to what happened in the game something like this this f4 uh bishop buffet this is a very different story f5 here is completely winning because you have support so after something like take take take take take take take take you have queen h5 queen f3 you will triple up you will attack on f7 black is hopelessly lost but the way frank did this he kind of put his knight in jail and then the way he advanced he this is covered four times so he's not gonna break through and you know now white is still better but he he isn't as it's not as good as it could have been but it's fine it's still a very good position he needs to transfer his pieces to this side put his king on the h file fight on the g file life is still going to be good knight f3 queen e1 what you should not do or should be very careful about doing in chess is to lead the attack with the queen you have to be a hundred percent certain that if you're leading an attack with a queen you're gonna succeed queen's the most valuable piece if anything lead the attack with the other pieces let the queen come in later frank doesn't do that in in this position spending way too much time plays bishop takes h6 and just hangs the bishop in one move now he is also down five minutes you might be asking how did frank win this game to cross a thousand elo and i will tell you it's a 900 elo game of chess alright you know we're still kind of we we still have the training wheels on the bicycle knight to g5 the rook immediately swarms and it's really bad it is a really bad situation frank plays h4 the opponent goes here it's over i mean just this this get the night out get the queen out get the rook out you're gonna take this it's game over franco's here the position now goes from bad to worse because the pawn was defending that now it doesn't defend that and he's losing the queen frank is down five and a half minutes on the clock he is down two bishops and he's about to lose his queen take take here queen h5 now it was made you know you could have probably just played queen e3 and swarmed queen d2 taking the night instead we have we owe queen h5 we have an 11 point lead a six minute time advantage rook h1 but wait a minute whoa wait a minute frank's winning the queen back now he's still down two bishops and six minutes five five and a half minutes but uh you know maybe he's still gonna pull this off take take and by maybe i mean you know the result of the game so i mean but you how is this possible right how is it possible that a man who is down two bishops in five and a half minutes will win this position there is no way to win this position knight d3 now if you're playing this with black um you gotta find a way to just get these pieces in the game f4 bishop f5 bishop e4 uh let's see how he does it okay i don't i don't i don't know why you have to move the king uh because now you move the king you lost the bishop you're still completely winning but this was this was ridiculously careless black spent a total of like nine seconds on those two moves now black is still winning but frank is not trading staying in the game not trading all right oh now it's probably over and this unfortunately is not enough uh black is gonna go here black is gonna take everything there is literally no way into the position for white at all pawn to e6 f takes and frank gets checkmated with the move knight to g6 knight to g6 is game over knight to d7 is not quite game over rook f3 rook f5 is also game over black plays this in two seconds doesn't even look for a check franco's here and blunders knight to d7 check which would win the rook the fact that black spent threes black is up seven minutes here six and a half but frank has 54 seconds on the clock this is such nonsense this is such nonsense rook a4 franco's frank has nothing he's just gonna lose all his pawns king d6 all right there's no mate you can't checkmate the guy he did okay be careful all right he's not he's not gonna get mated but frank doing a good job 26 seconds remaining for frank king to c8 king takes c6 now the easiest thing to do here give a check bring the knight just just give a check all right fine we're not getting mated king b6 all right there's no mate just push the button oh black is completely winning frank 19 seconds o'clock' seconds apparently in this position rook to e7 is winning because black has no way to stop that rookie seven knight take rook d8 but frank does it like this and now he's losing again 11 seconds versus 646 his opponent goes here and plunders a checkmate with nine seconds remaining versus 643. down a night three pawns and a queen on the way and black instead of saving himself from a checkmate which he had done multiple times already blunder that is crazy that is how frank achieved 1 000 elo on chess.com he had to do it in the most difficult way possible and i got news for you after that he beat his highest ever opponent from france this is frank's highest ever elo one thousand and eleven in this game he had the black pieces he was playing against a 1042 rated player from france uh this game was a london knight to c6 was what frank chose of course as he gets better pawn to c5 and all this will be the uh the weapon of choice but listen he's still getting a completely reasonable position from the opening uh i would you know i would wish that he plays bishop d6 in castles but instead he goes for knight to b4 don't hate it goes for this now i hate his next move this just ain't gonna cut it i get it of course he's trying to justify the play but you cannot attack a fully formidable setup of pieces with two pieces it's just not you're gonna learn this as you get better at chess too easy to defend um and he just gets kicked out bishop back all right pawn to c4 on the c6 knight to e5 and now frank plays bishop here which is a big blunder any time in the london you have a bishop staring at the london bishop your bishop needs to be guarded otherwise your opponent can go here which attacks your queen and your rook and your bishop is not protected you see if a couple of moves ago frank had you know not played bishop d7 let's just hypothetically say this is never possible even if the pawn had moved because the queen is defending the bishop but the way frank did this unfortunately he's in bad shape uh and his knight is trapped his knight now has no way home so he gets himself into a lot of trouble here by by breaking the principles right if you don't play the principles of chess you're gonna get in trouble okay so takes takes castles and of course you should attack something with minimum value first a3 is just easy pawn to a3 attacks the knight queen d2 this also attacks the knight but who can defend the knight a5 a3 okay nice move excellent move now the knight is hanging but the queen is hanging right frank here instead of going backwards says all right what's worth more than a knight a queen knight to e4 boom i'm very smart this is the 1000 kicking in the queen moves here what white needed to realize is this knight does not have to go back if given an opportunity the queen should have gone to d1 c1 or b2 not there there or there those would have all lost the queen or there queen e1 not only allows knight c2 knight c2 is also a fork and instead of being kicked out of the position frank now wins a pure rook okay now knight c3 is played in this position there is a way for black to save this knight just get out take the pawn you don't need to address this because this is defended so knight c3 is played and you go okay what is that trying to do seize that okay and that okay now what should i do well frank does this now the knight is dead now this knight is gonna die but he should have realized that he doesn't have to do anything here he could go here and then he could save the night the night can be saved the knight could also move there and that's very tricky but he does this and he loses the knight and now we have game on again and now i really don't like his move he plays e5 i don't hate this move but i don't see a reason to open up the position like this the good news is frank is a better chess player than i am because in this position he plays rook to g5 creating various ideas against the opponent and the opponent plays queen to h3 and loses the queen had the opponent played something like queen to f4 the game would have continued frank would have had to bring the queen and bring the rook and everything but instead of that frank knew that his opponent was going to blunder the queen and takes and that is how frank defeated his highest ever rated opponent at 1042 that is how frank crossed the 1000 elo barrier for the first time that is how frank got the rating of a thousand and eleven but there are still many improvements to be made frank did not know how to play chess seven months ago as you can see from this this was the russian roulette equivalent of chess all right load bullets into a chamber and one of the chess pieces is just gonna crack your skull open that's basically what that was um and it took a lot of practice a lot of reps a lot of puzzle solving to understand the patterns better and um a thousand is no is no joke i firmly believe that every single one of you watching this video right now can hit a thousand elo uh and if you already hit a thousand elo you got to take incremental steps from there 1200 1400 1600 try to take a couple of hundred points at a time fine tune your game self-diagnose see frank is hitting a thousand and he's doing it from positions of not always strength his positions sometimes are not good but chess is a fight and you are not going to play perfect games ever i'm 27.50 blitz my games look so stupid sometimes you would think i'm 750 blitz all right so keep at it here's a shining example of a young man that knew nothing about the game and grinded his way up without much study and you know he uh he's there and he will continue to improve and i will continue to make content about it whether you like it or not that's all i have get out of here
