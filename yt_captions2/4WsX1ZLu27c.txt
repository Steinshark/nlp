[music] so 3 months ago i decided to do something entirely crazy and go travel the world in six different countries while coding our app boxio so in this video i want to take you through a very realistic day in my life living this kind of life this time in singapore at the end i will also tell you how absolutely anyone can do this even if you're still a beginner so on all of my work days which is all days i divide my day into three parts the morning block the afternoon block and the night [music] block the morning blog runs from roughly 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. and it is characterized by morning coffee trying to remember what the hell i was thinking with my code when i stopped work the previous day and usually we have our morning standup call at 9:00 a.m. my time here in dubai but since singapore is 4 hours ahead of dubai this day our morning meeting was really at 1:00 p.m. of my time so i had all my morning blog basically get work done uninterrupted i think this time i was fixing some stupid authentication logic and all sorts of other dumb configuration stuff that never ever works properly at this point i realized that the wii work i was in had much cooler view from the top floor so i decided to put the $40 i paid to enter here to good use and go to the top to procrastinate by taking some shots from the window don't tell my co-founders that i did that during my coding hours by the way the app we have built is now officially live it's called boxio and it allows you to manage everything you do on your computer by organizing your tabs files and apps into these boxes that you can open and close with one click the aim of the app is that you no longer have to get distracted because your computer is cluttered with a million things open all at the same time you can create a box for every project or task you're working on and whenever you want to work on something you can just open the box and the environment you want to use for that project will automatically open in front of you the app is completely free to download so if you're interested go down below and download it from the first link in the description okay time for the midday block which is characterized by lunch more coffee and a midday slump which i then consequently try to fix with even more coffee so at 1: p.m. we do our morning stand up which again is more like a midday stand anyway it we align and update each other on where we are from the previous day's work and decided on the goals for each of us for the day after the meeting i take my lunch break to go into this nice little brunch board close to my wii workor after my lunch surprise surprise singapore decides to start pouring on me like crazy so i do my best to not break my laptop inside my back and lose all my code after that it's time to get back to work and keep working on my damn stupid authentication issues while i'm at the way work i been bumped into an angel investor who gets interested in our app usually when i'm at home i don't really go to co-working spaces at all but it's the chance encounters like these that remind me that maybe i should do it even more often even when i'm i'm not traveling okay time for the last part of the day which is my night block so around 600 p.m. is dinner time and i go and explore one of singapore's famous hawy senters for some absolutely sick street food after dinner i go for a little walk and this is truly why i enjoy this lifestyle i could just as well do this from my home but why not live my normal life like coding away making videos except in new different places so you get to just live this much richer life rather than just doing the same walk around the same block that you're used to your entire life now here's the one problem with this it's really really easy to when you're in a different location fall off your routine because you just keep being on some 24/7 vacation like a detener don't do that so that's what the one thing i do to keep working on my goals at the same time as doing this awesome traveling is i make sure i keep my normal routine as much as possible sure there's going to be some more time where i end up taking an extra hour to walk around and do something rather than working but i think that's worth it but like for the most part i do the same working hours the same kind of routine wherever i am in the world and sure it can be tough getting into this routine you're getting used to the place you're finding a new gym your new favorite food place or whatever and that's why i actually don't recommend doing the normal digital nomading life where you're in like one place for 2 weeks and then in another place for like 3 weeks i do recommend being in any given place like at least a month which i didn't follow here because i was only in singapore for like two weeks anyway because that way you can minimize the amount of times where you're sort of getting into your routine and maximize the time in routine while still exploring new places so at night we have a meeting with a business adviser which i have while drinking a beer at this super cool place by the river and after that i go for a night stroll around some of the famous touristy places in singapore like these gardens by the bay and this absolutely sick light show close to the hotel normally at this time i also go to the gym although this is a part that i do sometimes forget while living in a different location and i know right now you're going to be saying oh it's nice for you to say you've got your freaking youtube channel that's making you a bunch of money of course you can do this and like sure of course you need some money to like buy the flights and stuff like that but i actually think if you have just some savings it's worth it to just take a year and go and travel to a cheaper location like sure singapore is a super expensive place like if you don't have money don't go to singapore but like actually if you just choose your location wisely spending a year traveling or just living in a new place is probably going to be much much cheaper than just staying in your home city if you're from the west so like actually nowadays like for a lot of people who are learning the code if you have the balls to do this i would actually just recommend literally quitting everything you're doing and just take a year go living in a cheap location and learn to code and build some sort of a project or an app while you're doing it like it's an awesome experience that you're never going to forget in your life and and at the same time you can make amazing progress towards your goals because the one thing with coding is that all you need is your laptop so anyway this was a bit of a different video to what i usually talk about on this channel but i just wanted to get this off my chest because it's been such an amazing experience and it's just something that most people just wouldn't even consider so let me know down in the comments if i'm a complete dumbass for doing this or if this perhaps resonates with you and the thing is after that one year of you learning the code and building some sort of an app while traveling what's most likely going to happen is that the end of it you're either worst case going to be able to go back to your home country and get a job or you could just become a remote developer directly because these days there's actually three different ways for you to live this kind of life indefinitely as a software developer while working remotely and know you don't even have to become like a startup founder to do that and if that's something that interests you i made this video right here where i tell you exactly how to do this step by step from zero including there three different ways to do this and exactly how to achieve this even if you're a complete beginner
