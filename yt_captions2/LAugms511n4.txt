ladies and gentlemen i am 28 years old and i have been playing chess since i was 5 and a half chess has been my full-time career for over 10 years chess has been my full-time online career for a better part of four years now and you all may know this feeling of having a job and a certain walk of life and not wanting to talk about work once you are off work sometimes even thinking about your line of work would just get you upset today is one of those days today i witnessed something so horrible that i figured the only way to share the negative emotions that i'm currently experiencing is not to try therapy talk to a friend it's to share it in a youtube video now as the kids say i will stop yapping and i'm going to show you this game this is one of the worst things that i have ever seen in my life it all begins with our protagonist from brazil who actually by complete coincidence is playing somebody also from brazil and i checked they're not friends they don't have each other at it it was just a total coincidence this is a matchup of two brazilian players their names are cactus and flk we can discuss what flk stands for cactus opens the game with the very powerful pawn to e3 not a bad move but generally if you can you should move two squares the move e3 doesn't actually fight that much for the center although you could argue you are threatening to capture one of the squares black a very principled 400 plays the move d5 does in fact move the pawn two squares and now cactus plays knight to c3 don't hate that move at all i mean you might as well put a knight in the center behind the pawns right it's probably the best way to play it's definitely a good move all right now after knight to c3 black responds knight to f6 white plays d4 i love this now the reason we see here that this pawn is a little bit bad is that if the players just got to that position without the move e3 if this was the opening white would now be able to move the bishop outside of the pawn chain but the way it happens in the game is white goes for the center but already committed this pawn here so they will get their bishop out and their knight out but the other bishop is not really going to get a turn the other bishop might have to to be a little slower and black does great pawn in the center two knights in the center and and you know at this point cactus does what every 400 does which is realize that they made a small in accuracy and then rather than you know i'll give you an example okay we installed some blinds today you know the things that go up and down on the window to keep the light out well our blinds were slightly the wrong size it happens you know so i'm i'm going to have to reorder a new size and reinstall it and for now i'm just going to have to live with a little bit of sunlight well what 400s do is rather than reordering something they just blow up the whole house that's just what so e4 you know white did not have to do that you know white could have just dealt with the pawn on e3 and very slowly you know and and then prepare no white decides i you know e4 i'm going to just lose the pawn just going to lose the pawn and i'm going to lose the pawn and that's going to get my out and black says okay that was a stupid move now black is just a pawn up look if you're playing a chess game and your four moves into it you're just down a pawn you either play a gambit or you have no idea how to play chess okay now again with this move every time a pawn a pawn or any piece moves in chess you got to see how it affects the position right now black has an attack over here so a good move by white is pinning the knight to the king or defending the pawn or going here and losing another pawn so now you've lost one pawn and you probably going to lose a second pawn you're just two pawns down for absolutely no reason and then after you take that that you're probably going to hang this third pawn and a rook but instead of that again we're playing two 400s this opens up but black plays bishop f5 instead of taking the pawn bishop f5 completely reasonable move overprotecting the pawn in the center and now white does in fact realize it is under attack and white can push white can protect it white can protect it like this but why do any of those things cuz white just goes bishop g5 just losing the pawn again no problem but at least white is getting all their pieces out and has not played the move knight to f3 because then you would just lose the knight right black by the way excellent excellent not worried about the pin opening up the dark sored bishop i love this very principal chess from one of the parties uh not both but you know again it's it's like adapting to it's adapting to the situation so at this point white can play queen up and castle queen side why can play knight to e2 or castle this way or why can develop the knight like this it's not a good move right knight to h3 is not a good move because black can always take and open up your king you generally want to avoid as much as possible unless absolutely necessary to develop your pieces out to the edge even to the center like this would have been better and black very principled finishes up the development and does that now good rule of thumb for beginners if you are pinned bishop knight queen i i i would just play simple i would just block the pin so that enables the movement of your knight but there's absolutely nothing wrong with bishop to b4 another rule of you know just a small thing for for beginners if you ever get pinned i would just attack the bishop just the thing is if bishop goes back nothing really changes but you have the option to play g5 and kick the bishop out completely but most people will take because they're beginners and they don't know how to play chess and you know now if you notice the advantage here is minus one and then after the trade it's nearly minus two it's- 1.7 minus 1.8 so bishop to b4 don't hate it white plays a3 by the way i just said attack the bishop and see what happens and and black took because again beginners often times when they move the bishop out there they're going to take the knight like eight times out of 10 now unfortunately black cannot take the pawn on d4 one other thing to keep in mind this is way beyond this level but if the dark squar bishop was traded you generally want to replace your pawns on dark squares black does not have that black has five out of eight pawns on light squares although it is you know 53 is a pretty good balance the dark squares could potentially be come week but that's above this level in black castles black has played an absolutely perfect opening absolutely perfect white now plays queen e2 i don't know why white is not castling and that's also not under attack whatsoever right but it's life okay now we've entered the hardest part of a chess game which is the middle game you could say it's end games but you can't even make it to an end game if you have diarrhea in the middle game so it's not going to happen right so we've ented the hardest part of the game and you know it takes a lifetime to learn how to play middle games even half decently or a quarter decently uh and uh yeah let's you know every middle game is played with pawns and pieces and pawn and piece trades and creating weaknesses and creating attacks and you know right now if i'm playing with black i i might attack the center because i want to get my knight over here you know again this is a bit annoying so i may attack the bishop i'm actually not going to take this if i'm playing black now because even though the structure is bad the king's not over here the king was over there that would be good but white will play rook g1 and suddenly have good attacking chances so plays a6 i mean listen if you're 400 and you're not blundering any pieces i don't care what type of plan you're making i'm not going to judge you every move that you make as a 400 not blundering something is a win in my book and now white plays long castles so white decides that rather than you know i don't know white might be a genius white might was like well if i go here they're going to just open up my king i don't want that and instead castle's queen side let me tell you something you bought a house with no roof i mean you are now fully responsible for getting construction done and you should have done the construction before you moved in the house you moved in the house you got no roof all right and what i would play here with black is right away ju just go right after that weakness king to b2 get my knight over there get my other knight over and just start pawn storming i mean that is exactly and by the way b5 was the idea behind a6 and now plays directly into the hands right so again white just castle queen side black plays b5 what do you do here with white well you obviously slide the bishop back black might you know play continue the attack somehow and then you have to attack over here and it's going to be chaos instead of that after the move b5 white does something so confusing um white is already a pawn down and obviously is it's worse than that it's minus 1.6 and you know white is down a pawn and white also has a very weak king these pawns are very weak right so it may surprise you that in this position white just decides to make their situation even worse and sacrifices the bishop why not only do you sacrifice the bishop you you just opened up the whole board now you know again i think white did this and white's thought was well if i give up the bishop i get two pawns and then i'm going to take and i'm really smart but you have to like you cannot end your thought at that's my last move and next move i'm taking this what is there like an amoeba on the other side like a caterpillar i mean there's a human hopefully like they're going to defend the night i don't understand and and we just opened up all of this well it turns out that i'm a and it turns out that this 400 knows everything because black went here and hung the knight so it actually turns out that at 400 when you sack a bishop for two pawns opening up your own king and a minus five advantage the knight is just included it's like buy one get one free okay you bought boom you just take the knight as well now white is no longer as bad as it was and also white goes from two points down to a point up you may wonder well why is white not better why is it minus 1.92 it's because white is like wide open i mean the king is spread eagle like there is king has no roof white is still in a lot of trouble but white is only in trouble if black knows what they're doing okay and that's a very important point to make okay um and in this position black plays e5 and clearly black does not understand the situation because you need to look at the entire board and the movie five not only does it lose a pawn it the situation gets a whole lot worse here because now the queen is hanging and the knight is hanging and the only reason it's not completely lost again it's like it's point4 4 but it's 044 at the 400 level which means it's 9.4 cuz the only move here is queen e7 losing the knight creating an attack on the king and maybe surviving yeah none of that happens black plays bishop d7 okay so now it's plus four for white okay bishop d7 attacks the queen the knight is hanging you can't really take it because then you lose your queen yeah you could get that one back but then anyway the best move here is obviously to just move the queen just queen a6 queen c5 queen c4 one of these moves the engine likes queen c5 the most because if you play queen c4 there is queen e7 so bishop d7 queen c5 stops queen e7 and then you're going to take the knight then you're going to take the bishop and you're going to feast on the black position so black plays bishop to d7 and yeah of course i mean e5 is a horrific move pawn takes e5 white is now up two points and is about to be up a whole lot more um or maybe they're not because in this position they just give up the queen completely like the bishop went there blocking the attack on the queen and white went knight to f4 losing the queen when i say for absolutely nothing i am not exaggerating that is literally a completely free queen now you're going to sit there and go no levy not quite rook takes d8 you're right you're right and that's what happened rook takes and you're going to get the knight and then black will go here and it's still game on it's still game on yes but obviously we did not have to play knight f4 but i guess you know white thought that they were sneaky so black takes the queen and white goes here now that don't make no sense that doesn't make any sense so one of two things happened here okay one of two things happened happened white either forgot that the rook could take the queen cu they were so devastated they blundered or white never had any idea in the first place like imagine living in a universe where you just never saw this could even happen right black went here so obviously you never like you never even saw that so why would you right and so then you hung your queen now what what really boggles my mind here though th this is definitely and and a lot of you are going to understand what i'm talking about here when when you lose a piece right you get mad generally when you lose a big piece of material you get mad or when your opponent captures something we have chimpanzee brain so when our opponent like like we're not that different okay from the great apes of the world when the queen is taken you go oh i got to take something too ha like we're not complicated we got opposable thumbs and mental health problems but other than that i mean we are all just you know we're not that different but for some reason white didn't do either why just straight up i'm not even white lost a queen for nothing and went here and black moved the queen that's not the best move the best move again was to go queen e7 and attack but black was like oh my god i i can't believe i got out of there like it's like a bank robbery i mean i win queen c8 pawn takes f6 now if you playing with black here which you want to do it's a little tough you know you could take but then you got to be really careful in in chess the two most important things are material and king safety so in this this position white is actually two moves away from checkmating black i'm not saying it's forced but like for example if white plays knight to d5 they are literally threatening a checkmate that's mate so bishop takes rook takes this is checkmate like you need to protect your king you must at all costs you must protect your king so you could lose the look at this you could just lose the game like that boom so it's never really over okay and black plays queen b7 and black is looking for very very naughty things very bad right all they have to do is prevent the king from escaping maybe rook d8 right so pawn takes g7 and um again black clearly realizes the rook is hanging of course black can just take back but listen they got to justify their plan they play queen to b2 b2 check the king is now forced out into the center and um you know you see the rook is hanging right you might as well take the pawn that's that's probably what i would do but that's an umbrella pawn it's a pawn you can hide behind so maybe it's not the end of the world and black plays rook fd8 um at this point neither player realizes that rook bishop takes is possible you just get the bishop for the rook what's crazy is that the engine the computer says losing the rook is the best move because actually black's attack is now unstoppable as i always say when the evaluation is a bmw it's really really bad so the king goes to anywhere this is a check the king goes here bishop b5 there are no legal king moves now you have to lose all your pieces and when it's all said and done you get mated which is actually why rook to d8 is the best move now white by complete accident one 100% accident plays king to e2 does not take the rook does not even see it and now actually has two things staring at the rook which you got to be very careful about now if i'm playing with black i'm just trading i'm trading and i'm going to try to take as many pawns as i can trade the rooks and get rid of this pawn black plays queen b5 check what a move by the way backwards queen move beautiful move sniping the king and the bishop listen white missed the boat they couldn't take the rook with the bishop now they're going to lose the bishop i mean black has played a fantastic game other than like e5 excellent what a move by black good idea by white pretty hopeless but you you might as well send a pawn out to die and here black actually shows that they had absolutely no idea that the bishop was hanging like queen g5 they did not see what soever but instead they take this and it's actually the best move like that's the thing sometimes in chess in instead of playing the move that's minus 9 you play the move that's m7 it's mainten seven moves now there is literally negative chance that black sees it and if they do see it they should be banned from chess.com but you know now white plays king e3 and the best move is to go back but okay queen c3 check and now the king goes here and now bishop b5 we've reached this position i black is just this is merciless preventing the king from escaping you got to snipe the king like this king is stuck king has no legal moves now white just has to lose all material i mean this has been one of the best games i have ever seen a 400 rated player play and i know what you're thinking like you're probably sitting there at home wondering okay this is the how to lose a chess playlist by gotham first of all like .5% of you who have maybe never seen this are going why is he so mean to the 400s like this is such elitism i'm never going to play chess because he's so mean and to you i would say you're really sensitive relax this is all sarcastic the whole experience of playing chess regardless of your level is pain chess is pain so is beauty all right so it we're just all in this together we you got to laugh at yourself first and then you got to laugh at others anyway you're probably sitting there wondering something's going to happen in this game maybe maybe not queen takes c2 removing the defense of the knight what a what a move by the way i mean seriously what a move and you know at this point white should just trade the pieces and lose but instead white goes here now this type of chess where you run your king to the other side of the board just in case something happens i actually have a concept on this channel and i and i've said this long time viewers of my channel know this it especially l low your elo is if in the middle of a losing position you just literally run your king to the other side of the board you literally might win the game not cuz the king promotes not cuz it's connect four but because the king could randomly join in an attack but that is not even remotely possible here because the king is on a light square the pawn is just stuck and the bishop can't touch the king so it's hopeless but white you know white is yeah and and rookie a check and king f5 and and i know that looks really really good except black just keeps checking and by the way here there was crazy discover you know you could have double checked and you could have traded rooks and queen c5 check okay excellent black is making uh you know and king f6 we made it that's exactly the it's exactly what you're supposed to do here's the problem you know this looks like checkmate it's not it just here i mean there there is literally absolutely nothing here and now there's rookie six check which black thought was mate black did the thing where they make the move and they go and they're waiting for the unch.com didn't happen instead we have rook take c6 the good news is you just take back and i know what you're thinking rook d1 rookie no the bishop still covers it's not no no there's no plot twist in this game this is just this is it pawn takes e6 and um white forgets about this and loses the rook and and now now yeah that's it i mean the last hope is that you could have maybe played f4 f5 f6 f7 with the bishop here you'd need to really bribe black to get that to happen king f6 again you're trying but it's now mate in two and that is exactly how you do it king to e7 queen e5 is made queen takes bishop is made like you could mate by accident here by accident you could just take the bishop and oh it's checkmate cuz i i didn't even and you know black knows the golden rule and the golden rule in chess is if you have a checkmate in in one che check made in two is better it's a joke it's tongue and cheek so they play rook d7 king 2 e8 and now there is a mate in one essentially everywhere any rook move is made literally the entire row of rook moves is checkmate queen e5 is mate in two queen d5 queen f7 is unstoppable mate two queen c6 queen g6 or here or here or here or here or here and there and then there and then and then there and there and there and there and there and there and there and there and there and and and there and they are all mate but the one move i did not mention that is also checkmate is queen to f8 thinking it's mate white takes makes a queen and wins the game by checkmate thems
