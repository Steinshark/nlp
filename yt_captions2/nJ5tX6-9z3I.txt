first off i love this i love the title of this article okay this is just just makes me just so ready just so i'm super excited so let's get micromanaged all right since most programmers only want to write code and don't care about what the problem they're solving they need to uh you you need to learn effective effective oh my goodness i cannot read flip could you take this part out i don't want to be look i don't want to look like a dingus flip flip could you could you remove this for me okay oh wow this this title is so exciting uh since most programmers only want to write code and don't care about what problem they are solving you need to learn to effectively micromanage them without this you will have an endless discussions about frameworks tools ideas process and the like and this will occur ad nauseam until you tell them what to do so i know this is tongue-in-cheek but this is also true sometimes you just need somebody to go hey yo no right uh we call them informed captains at netflix because somebody just has to be the person that's just like no we gotta move on let's just move on deep down programmers want to be told what to do how to do it and when to do it they often pretend this isn't the case but don't let that fool you oh no oh no their best friend the compiler is also extremely picky and demanding giving them the feeling of i mean this is clearly written by the rust foundation clearly this is a sponsored article by the rust foundation uh either a program compiles or a dozen your management should have the same ring of absoluteness about it you might think that micromanagement is a lot of work and you'd be right you always have to be on even during the nights weekends and vacations but with these seven tips you'll be spending your time effectively and creating a fast moving team all right tip number one remember you own them [laughter] they are your programmers and you are their boss this century's old dynamic is a classic for a reason it works if it's good enough for the romans monarchies and henry ford it's good enough for us hell yeah oh my goodness yes make sure you never waver on who makes the decisions on your team there we go there we go let's go uh tell them exactly how to do it create a very detailed specs which outline everything that needs to be done include the architecture the frameworks the database schema object diagrams function signatures naming conventions etc i've actually worked at a place that did something similar to this don't worry if you have flaws in the specs this is an opportunity for them to problem solve which many claim to enjoy this detailed specificity about what work is uh done will set the bar high and keep them productive i just can't wait i've been i've been asked my boss okay i've been asked my boss is this like bdsm of programming is that what we're reading is this pornography am i gonna get banned from twitch is this allowed is this against tos i'm not sure all right tell them exactly how to work together create flow charts and roll assignments remember your team wants to be assembled together like cogs and works best when they each have a very specific role discourage people from working together to build experts in each role create a formal channels for them to communicate with and they will appreciate that you have figured out the best way for them to work and be efficient um you know i'm not gonna lie to you there is actually some good parts to this you know being an expert in your own little domain is is also you know it's a good thing work out the way to do things for them programmers only want to write code so work out the best design frameworks coding standards time frames role delegation etc in advance i feel like hey not to micromanage this article um but this is kind of sound like point one or i mean point two sorry you know point two you could have already said you're gonna do this so isn't this just like point two part a your programmers will trust your judgment feel secure that you know the best this leaves them plenty of coding time which makes them happy uh number five hold their toes to the fire to finish everything on time all good project managers know that teams work best under pressure with challenging deadlines this brings out the best in people and they love rising to the challenge if things start to slip begin the passive aggressive comments and veiled threats this will show people that deadlines are important and they will shift into high gear no check in multiple times a day to change direction up no no i've had this happen to me i've actually had this happen to me this this one was a this one was a tough one uh programmers tend to drift and get distracted so help them focus by checking in with them frequently there's a there's no need to have some something valuable to say your mere presence will remind them to work harder oh man email slack and call them late at night and or weekends this is the key to keeping up the momentum through long weekends and holidays they will know you care when you call it 10 pm with a new feature idea or an email at 2 31 am about a new bug i had someone call me i believe it was december 27th around 6 or 7 p.m like nailing dinnerish time i'll never forget that call that was actually the call i quit netflix that was like the day i said that's it i'm quitting netflix i
