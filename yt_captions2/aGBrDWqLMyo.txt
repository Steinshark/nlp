ladies and gentlemen i didn't post a youtube video yesterday because i had food poisoning so over the last 48 hours i haven't slept well i haven't eaten well uh and if any of you know anything about food poisoning you know that various substances are departing your body through two different sites to put it mildly so on the one hand it's a really nice dieting technique i'm down about five or six pounds in two days on the other hand i feel absolutely horrible and i probably look horrible as well but i knew that if i were to come back quickly it would need to be to provide you a pretty big piece of content and that's what i'm doing in today's video this game was an abomination i was checking my phone and i was looking at my emails and viewers had sent in games and i saw this game and i went oh wow oh i've got to show this to the audience you see we have a playlist here called how to lose a chess yeah this one takes the cake ah really this one is unbelie i mean this one is incredible and it's also a very weird game allow me to show you and by the way if i throw up at any point during this video it's the game it's not the food poisoning d4 d5 queen's gambit now when i tell you this is an extremely odd 800 rated game watch the opening all right something about this game oh by the way our protagonists are chris who has a profile photo of obama like i didn't just put that that's just this profile photo and we have sean who has a profile photo of of anime of uh you know of anime anime profile photo you know arguing with people on twitter as hopeless when their profile photo was an anime photo or a footballer photo anyway the really weird thing about this game is that it was a semi-sloff like if you took a sample size of one million games between two people rated 915 and 800. this position probably appears in like eight of those games so this is nothing short of a miracle when i saw this i was like am i getting trolled then we got bishop g5 which is the best move then black took on c4 which is the best move trying to defend that with b5 while surrendering the center to white now we got e4 b5 i was like wait a minute is this a cheater game like what is this white now played e5 attacking the knight which is pinned to the queen so the queen can't move the knight can't move but black has something danger levels what's worth as much as a knight a bishop and when the bishop retreated there's g5 and now if bishop g3 the knight gets away so white now sacrifices the knight for two pawns and continues to have the pin i was like wait a minute these two 800s played a perfect semi sloth they cheating right i was like this is i'm getting trolled well i don't know what happened in the opening like maybe the two of them have only ever studied one opening in their entire lives and it both just happened to be the semi-slav because this they knew perfectly maybe they i don't know we're on the phone and they decided that they were just gonna you know play this opening right and but this is the end right here so i hope uh i i mean i hope you got your moment take a deep breath because it's only gonna get a whole lot worse so black needs to do something about this uh that could be bishop here that could be knight bd7 not bishop d7 but knight bd7 black plays rook g8 rook g8 does not that doesn't solve anything because i'm still gonna go here i am now going to be up a pawn and i have a past h pawn like once i start moving it's gonna go very fast my king is also relatively safe i can castle if necessary g3 bishop g2 right so black plays ruchiate attacking this bishop and white just spent the entire opening attacking the knight right everything has been about that knight on f6 white ghost heat what what why did why do i okay bishop b4 all right you could still take the knight on f6 but obviously white gets this white's 900 so white gets distracted by the bishop and is like misi bishop me attack bishop now the reason why this position is -3 for black any of you know the answer try to pause the video here and find it why is it -3 for black seeing as the excuse me as though that's the next move well it's because danger levels and now the queen comes out and that's a massive problem for white because you were gonna take this knight but now i'm getting this you can't go here because i take but now you can't castle and your king is out in the open and i mean i can even come in here with my rook i can come in here with my knight i mean i i can open up my bishop it's a very bad position so queen a5 is absolutely necessary here black plays knight a6 though right all right fine white is now completely winning so now white is going to take the and now queen a5 once again not to mention queen d5 unpinning and attacking the rook so now the queen no longer is in a pin the rook is hanging bad news for white g3 horrible move but black follows up the move knight a6 with a beyond beyond ridiculous move rook b8 to even begin to say that i have no idea what the point of rook b8 is is an understatement but what i'm beginning and by the way white doesn't take again so just like white's entire opening for the last like seven moves has been around that and white's just refusing to take that i don't know what white is doing i mean white's just not taking the night it's not taking the night but okay i understand the idea black plays bishop b7 black's idea is to see the bishop defended and play c5 actually very clever and white actually messes up white goes here and now black's entire game plan comes together the knight went there to defend the pawn the bishop went there to counter the bishop the rook went there to defend the bishop so c5 naturally is the next move in the position and after we get take take you know black is going to be doing very well black is going to even bring the rook here pressure this life is good now fine and good but we must remember that the person playing with black is not going to make anywhere near logical decisions so as they just for their last three moves knight a6 rook bishop b7 perfectly set themselves up for the rest of the game now for some reason black plays rook c8 and then black plays c5 now you may notice the eval bar is plus 11. that is because that bishop no longer is protected and on top of that that's a fork you don't just lose a bishop you are also going to lose either a knight for nothing or a rook for a bishop resulting in a catastrophic loss of material and very soon also probably checkmate here and here if not now then soon why i mean you did everything to set yourself up for the rest of the game and then you just and then just rook see i mean what are we why why why and if you thought that white took this ah no no no no no no no now what should black do black should trade the bishop black should trade the queen and then black should take the pawn what does black do take on c5 with the rook resulting in once again the blunder of a full bishop now white here also can play queen takes queen first instead of that and i will once again it's in one of those spots in these games by the way this is a 30 minute game and in' moves white has spent a minute 46. folks if you boot up for a game of x time okay and 20 moves into the game you have spent about six percent of your time you're a degenerate and i say that you know in in a loving way stop helping yourself okay stop it this is like going to the gas station and filling up with one gallon at a time i really i don't know what you're doing it doesn't make any sense at all unless you drive a tesla then you're just pretentious okay rook takes c5 rook a2 rook a2 played in about 15 seconds 17 seconds rook a2 can't explain it don't understand rook a2 i think it's to go here but this is you know that's still a thing but now black plays something which is even dumber you see i think what black thought here was if i play rook d5 i get taken right but if my rook is on d6 i don't get taken so i'm gonna go rook c6 to go rook d6 the silence is deafening my nausea is coming back up black was like if i play rook d5 i'm going to get taken by the bishop so i'm gonna go to c and they lost the rook okay now remember a few moves ago how rook a2 was played to go here yeah white forgot that that was ever the idea a4 is a terrible move but it's accidentally brilliant it's accidentally brilliant because after pawn takes a4 white plays rook takes a4 which loses the game it loses the game because white just completely missed that but before that happens black needed to trade the queen so the queen doesn't guard the rook queen takes queen is more forcing because you take more material you force this now you're just up at night now who's to say you wouldn't lose the game in a few moves anyway nobody's to say that all right nobody however a4 i said is accidentally genius because black goes oh free rook and actually loses the bishop and then loses the knight so now white is up a full bishop and a pawn and black's king is stuck it like just locked so white now is just completely winning okay rook b1 rook in now if you know anything about these games you know that this is hardly the end if anything this is just the beginning so rook f8 is played of course rook cafe locking in your king even more now just rook b1 rook b8 and that's it i mean it's made in just a few moves instead of that white decides that this is a good moment to rescue the bishop for some reason because you know when you're winning a chess game you can do one of two things take all of your opponent's material and win in an end game or go for mate why you know you don't want to play just take a free pawn then bring the rook all right bishop g5 fine black plays e5 rookie one e4 rookie four king d8 and now it's basically pick your poison okay you can win like this that wins a queen you can go rookie seven that wins in a few moves you can play queen a5 or queen c4 that wins in a few moves or you can play queen b6 check and lose your queen in one move but he doesn't even take it and now rook c4 is just mate it's just me and instead of that we have rook e7 and it was at this moment that black realized wait i can take the queen but here's the thing instead of losing your queen too you could have looked for a check this is why you have to look for checks because you never know and queen d1 gets you out of danger and wins you a full queen no questions asked that's just a full queen folks this is unreal now that doesn't happen and instead we have this now black is still better but it's very tricky it's very true by the way how did we even get here damn it it's very tricky because white has some past pawns you know white has a lot of pawns so white starts pushing the pawns black should bring the king and then bring the rook and try to win this pawn and promote all right two two 900 to 800 and a 900 try to play an end game all right bishop h6 h5 immediately blundering by the way rook h shade is just boom and game over but okay black starts pushing the pawns white starts pushing a pawn that cannot even become a queen i mean the move f4 is so brain dead because listen no disrespect but you are the pawn is running into the other pawns but i mean what is even going on here you can't promote those pawns why are you playing f4 why not g4 b4 take c3 at least the bishop gets back and the pawns go oh my goodness f4 doesn't make any sense why is the okay fine that makes a little more sense but still why is the bishop back there black is definitely queening now the way you break through here with black you don't need to bring the king you can do this you can also use your b pawn but fine it's a fight to the death h7 b4 queen and that's it black is going to make a queen black is going to win the game black's game plan is now not count that's it game over all right the comeback is upon us except it's it's really it's it's no it's really not it's no all right so okay king d2 fun king h3 all right so always look for checks that's just a free bishop instead black is going to try to make a second queen and does all right fine now again that's not the most accurate move what you should have done a long time ago instead of moving the king here is you should have thought okay that's a dark squared bishop so i should probably move my king like on a light square all right i should have played king there or king there why because yes you have two queens against the bishop but now i have f5 check that's a little unfortunate you're gonna lose one of those queens but you're still completely winning okay how are you completely winning well you need to stop g6 you can stop g6 by giving a check by giving a check by giving a check all right give a check nice give a check but now the king is going up all right it's a little bit suspicious yeah you kind of let this happen but you're still winning queen f4 all right well done take take all right terrific i mean this is a little messy but the pawns are doubled you have to remember that a queen versus an f pawn on the seventh rank is usually a draw but we're far from that so king e8 is really dumb white should play a move here that guards at least one of the pawns like this however this move does not actually enable this so black will just come closer with the king now if white plays king e-cigs that makes a bit more sense because that allows f7 but remember you're just once you get to the promotion square it's over this move is even dumber be under the more advanced pawn you king e8 is a very bad uh oh oh now it's a draw oh no oh god yeah brutal check king f8 check and that's it yup oh my gosh well this was a fun video i always like to share these how to lose a chess games with all of you because they are just utterly ridiculous and um this one was no different in this one we had a lot of twists and turns we had three queens for black two of them were promoted we had a perfect opening that ultimately resulted in uh oh [music] oops wow that is embarrassing yeah just when you thought that you couldn't blunder anything you put your king on the same diagonal as your queen and you lost it yep well now white is going to go on to win this game a couple of checks um
