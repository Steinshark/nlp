ladies and gentlemen have you ever seen a fight i mean one-on-one unarmed combat between two human beings now the smaller those individuals are the faster they are the better their reaction time the better their defense the better their stamina but the bigger they are the heavy weights of the world the higher the chance that it's going to be an absolute catastrophe from a physical standpoint and that is the purpose of today's video today i would like to show you a heavyweight fight between two 400 elo chess players when you think of the biggest heavyweights on the planet think no stamina throwing punches desperately falling to the floor exhausted that's what i want you to think back and forth bombing each other with haymakers this game had it all buckle up throw me up on the screen watch me on the laptop as you do something in another tab or just watch the screen because let me tell you something right now this game is gonna be worth it this is a game played between anil from india rated 486 and an honorary grand master title and jamal rated 426 his game was sent into me by jamal jamal this was a heck of a game brother if you are watching this this was oh this was spectacular we got the eval bar we got the clocks here we go so the game actually started really well it started d4 d5 nobody's done anything dumb after one move this is already an accomplishment uh and if by the way if you're new to my content i have a playlist here on youtube called how to lose a chess where i spotlight beginner games sent into me i analyze them you can actually learn quite a bit from them but we also laugh not at the player's intelligence chess has nothing to do with intelligence we just laugh at the fact that chess is such a painful uh and fascinating endeavor so white plays e3 already a slight in accuracy why is it a slight in accuracy because you block in your own bishop you're gonna you need to play c4 if you're gonna play d4 the dnc pawns are friends then go the knights and then you want to develop your bishops but you don't want to preemptively block in your bishops early in the game uh black plays it's called a reverse london because this is a this is a london right well things get uh how to say uh creative very quickly creative of course being the equivalent term that you would use for a toddler that did finger painting and told you that they made something and you have no idea what it is so white plays the move g4 um g4 on its own is not the not the dumbest idea in the world um you're trying to chase the bishop down and then white follows it up with h4 fascinating stuff um so clearly the idea of g4 h4 is to play the move h5 right i mean i i don't think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out that white wants to go h5 and trap the bishop now unbeknownst to uh black black misses that right black is a principled individual and is just trying to develop pieces and is now completely lost because the move h5 traps the bishop because this is the bishop's only safe move and now the bishop is simply going to perish so white plays g4 h4 black misses the fact that white has h5 and white also misses the fact that white has h5 uh white tries to play f3 white tries to do it backwards why it's like i don't even want to allow this because because i i yeah so white does this and now black has an opportunity to prevent h5 you see white over complicated things white could have gone h5 attacking the bishop and then f3 attacking the bishop instead they went me i'm going to be so sneaky but the move h5 just stops your threat now like this is the thing you got to think about what your opponent is going to do as well now of course black doesn't do that uh and white wins a bishop so already some instructional value here when you play these moves in chess like setup moves like f3 you gotta think about well what if my opponent doesn't allow me to play h5 what if they saved their bishop now so you need to play more forcing moves like h5 which actually creates a threat but okay uh yeah white is up a bishop fantastic white is already winning the only drawback of the white position is that you've put a lot of pawns forward so your king might be a little exposed uh and also this is 400 elo chest so god help us okay this is the intro scene to a two and a half hour movie not actually this video is probably like' minutes long or something but um so queen c2 now black continues developing gives a check very natural follow-up i would expect nothing less white should block that with the knight or the bishop excellent and now i really like what black does here black doesn't just autopilot capture black goes back i like that black is like i'm down a bishop i shouldn't trade or i don't know maybe black just went ooh wee slingshot so yeah bishop b4 uh and the bishop goes to d6 and now that's a check and it's actually a very disruptive check because it's one of the rare checks where uh you would actually have to move your king white doesn't see that at all uh and black follows that up with not seeing it either so that's good but yes we're just getting developed now if i'm playing white here i'm just going to keep marching forward i'm going to use my space advantage but white plays knight h3 and now black castles all right and um white plays knight f4 what i don't like about the way that white is handling this position uh is white is not actually getting the king to safety why should really be trying to castle and preferably to the long side because short side you'd rather use these pawns to attack and you've already made progress with them knight f4 also just straight up blunders upon it blunders upon because yes white saw this this but every time a pawn moves in your head you need to think about what it used to defend okay so every time a piece or a pawn moves you gotta go what did it use to defend it used to defend this boom all right so you also never want to end the calculation like this on your move you will make this mistake i guarantee you are making this chess mistake when you calculate hypothetical things in chess you end it on your turn you have to end it on your opponent's turn so in this position you go take take oh i'm happy no because your opponent can do this you stop thinking on behalf of your opponent all right that is a major mistake that you're making that's how you prevent mistakes in chess queen d7 and now white plays g5 this is excellent stuff i mean anil is playing like a grand master he is really really doing great things here black only has one move for the night and uh jamal goes forward and he loses the knight so he is now down two pieces he's down five points of material and really eight points according to stockfish because his position is really bad bishop d3 g6 and you might be wondering gotham i'm six minutes and 55 seconds into this video what is going on here how is this going to turn into like a well yeah you know uh pay attention so black plays e5 this is an excellent move desperate times call for desperate measures in chess and when you are trying to make a comeback you need to just open up the board that's just the truth especially when your opponent's king is on the other side you gotta open up the center which is why i keep advocating for this but you also want to avoid trading too many pieces all right trading upon is not so bad now white kind of panics white goes here and black of course should play pawn takes d4 and actually you see the eval it goes from like plus nine to plus three that's substantial that's a decrease of 67 that's really no joke um and after something like takes takes it could go from bad to worse look at this black is winning despite being two pieces down how is that possible because in chess the two most important criteria to determine who has a better position is material in king safety white is up by material but guys white's king is super weak in fact white's king is on the verge of getting mated look at this position how did that happen right so you got to be super careful right now black doesn't play black hoes here all right black does not open up the center of the board uh to make a comeback but he does find this and as you might imagine with the queen nearing the enemy king oh all right i need to i need to simplify iced coffee for this next part of the video run an ad right like just run the advertisement here we go all right terrific queen g4 uh bishop e2 and suddenly the eval has gone from plus nine to plus point uh plus 0.99 all right 99 cent store evaluation because the queen can infiltrate black of course instead takes the pawn i don't blame him uh but now uh white plays rook f1 and now here comes the queen and the rook blocks so i'm gonna give you a useful piece of advice unless it's absolutely necessary and and or unless the alternative is really really really bad you should not pin your pieces to your own king it it it it almost never is a good thing like you just shouldn't do it even if it means walking the king one square it's fine because when you pin yourself you invite bad things and now bad things exist now of course in order to enable these bad things black has to be thinking checks captures attacks so check is not useful capture is useful because this is pinned and when this moves that clears out and now here comes e3 and uh yeah black is back in cruise control here all right so checks captures attacks right we have queen g3 rook f2 black does not find that because it's a 400 elo game and goes here i would imagine the idea of this move is to go here but i there is literally no difference between where you give a check on the first rank makes absolutely no difference uh white plays knight g2 uh black now gives a check white plays bishop f1 and now gets pinned and as you can see black is making a massive comeback alright so here's kind of like that first stage of the two heavyweights fighting uh white got a really big lead early but got dropped with an uppercut and now the um the fight is beginning now what should uh what should white do here safeguard the king and get the king to safety if white king just castle along why it's gonna be okay bishop b4 attacks the rook in the corner black sees that effortless move out of the way and now the rook can even join the attack put pressure on the pin piece pp on the pp if you will knight to d2 now black is back rook e6 rook f6 is an equalizing maneuver but black plays queen g1 sneaking in on the first rank and attacking the rook now everybody knows there is a saying in chess okay when they're when your opponent is creating a threat to your position the best thing to do is to panic and basically lose the game on the spot all right it's the best thing you can do sounds like someone's pouring something it sounds like a i have a leaky pipe in the house uh you can't hear it but i can uh what white should have done here is just gone here and defended the rook but that's that's hard to see to move a knight and it's not that's not easy i don't blame him king e2 now bishop takes f2 black has won back of rook and now black is up two points of material and black is back in the game not just black is back in the game uh remember as i said when your opponent is creating a threat onto your position what you need to do is panic and lose the game basically immediately it's now minus 14. it's -14 because black follows this up with bishop takes e3 and now the game is all but lost knight takes d4 wins a queen bishop takes knight wins a night queen f2 bishop d2 queen f1 will win the house boom boom boom surely it's over no there are 50 more moves in this game from moves i promised you an' minute video i better speed it up knight to b3 by a miracle of god defending against knight d4 bishop f4 black is up six points of material queen e3 is on the way queen h2 is on the way e3 is on the way white plays bishop h3 now you cannot take that rook as i said by a miracle of the chess gods black uh has found but guess what you actually can take the rook because the knight is guarding the fork so this would be something we call simplifying and now black is just winning with it with the past pawns all right bring the rooks to the center and just avalanche the pawns forward bishop h3 played and black in this position with many many possibilities queen e3 queen h2 picking up the bishop blunders the queen in one move and suddenly it's game on rook g1 on the board it's plus four a devastating blunder any time your queen is on the opponent's first rank look out left to right it's like when you cross the street you don't look you get hit by a car boom boom however material shockingly is equal folks only 400 elo chess players are capable of creating an apocalyptic environment on the chessboard and still coming out of it equal white is down four pawns why does down four pawns black has seven pawns that's four points oh my god and white has a queen and black has a rook it's a rook and four pawns for a queen that's nine nine what the what queen c5 now black should just try to defend everything bishop d6 rook a2 black plays rook a4 i don't like the move rook a4 because you're smushed when you fight against the queen everybody's got to be together and fighting and coordinated for instance this is just a fork all right this is just a good move now this is also a fork white plays rook g4 black goes back white also goes back and now black plays f5 all right it's desperate times call for desperate measures out here the times are five minutes a piece black plays rook g5 and what does white do sorry uh white plays roo g5 what does black do all right what does black do you just moved the pawn you move it again oh my god what is happening the pawns are coming down the board the knight is coming down the board somehow the queen despite being the big bad wolf the bully is about to lose queen g1 top engine move the only move in the position queen g1 is plus six because mate is coming on g7 f3 check now king moves up knight gives a check as i set desperate times desperate measures you gotta give checks king d2 rook c4 and unfortunately the end is near rook takes g7 king to f8 and there it is what you needed to do here was you had to run to the corner instead you ran to the middle rook g8 check king e7 the queen infiltrates a beautiful display of technique here from white who now lands the final blow queen oh never mind we have a pulse queen d7 was mate instead of that white spent 20 seconds and played queen to f6 bishop e7 and now white sets up the mate again white sets up the mate queen d7 and queen c8 that is insane that white saw it now but not there and folks you may be asking yourself why is an unstoppable checkmate minus 15 checks captures attacks boom it's bishop before check and the queen is gonna get taken king c1 discovered check oh my god discovered check king d1 would have blundered knight e3 mate but instead of that the king goes here and it's not the queen because you're pinned but this discovered check and now the queen is going to get taken unbelievable unbelievable and it's over black is now winning because of the overwhelming lead in material all black has to do now take the rook push the pawns e3 e2 it's over e2 is literally made it is literally made the only way to stop this is this you can sacrifice you can make a queen oh my goodness black did it oh that might have not felt like 50 moves but i was counting for both players bishop e6 and black plays rook to d4 just kidding hangs the rook in one move oh my god oh my god when will it stop when will it stop oh my god oh my god how did black find this this this you just can't make this stuff up you just cannot make this stuff up knight d4 oh my god rook h7 and now in this position black finds rookie 6 take take what on earth have these players created it's rook in two pawns versus bishop and five e3 e2 is a forced queen and absolutely force queen you can't play f2 because of this but this is gg rook c7 that's it e3 game is over you win the race there is absolutely nothing to do because the promotion square is covered instead of thinking to promote these pawns black thinks i need to save my b-pawn and now it's not so clear because after h6 e3 it still looks good but after this this this we both queen you queen i queen unfortunately unfortunately black pushes the wrong pawn and white now plays this that loses back the advantage uh right away king e2 would have just right so you needed to do this you needed to be light squares and dark squares together instead we have this and uh now king e2 ah and there it is folks there it is and as you might imagine there will now be no more plot twists and black is simply going to lose this game oh wait a minute discover check very lucky i think white just got lucky here if i'm being totally honest uh i think white absolutely blundered this rook but never say never alright it is now made in five here we go all right white's taking all the pawns here comes the pun all right they got three queens on the board you got multiple mates all right spell me oh god almost stalemate almost only legal move oh god all right laddermate here we go boom and boom and there there it is uh the app queen h7 uh quick it's mate it's it's made in one it it's made like 75 million ways in one okay it took a while 75 moves in total it took 23 points of material at the end what an absolutely ridiculous battle of 400 elo players that was so much fun white out to a massive lead early black with a comeback black hangs the queen white hangs made in one and loses the queen right on the edge of victory black hates the rook back oh god i'm done for the day get out of here
