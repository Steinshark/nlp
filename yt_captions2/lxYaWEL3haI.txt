have you ever been sitting around watching a great documentary or series on netflix or whatever and thought man it would be fun to make things like that maybe you get all excited thinking about how interesting it would be to travel the world and constantly meet new people as a job but then when it comes to actually choosing something to make a documentary about things seem to slow way down yeah we've all been there over the last 10 years of working the documentary industry and even more now since i've had this youtube channel i've had a ton of new filmmakers reach out to run their ideas past me to see if i think they would make for a good doc and even though i love hearing from all of you seriously my email is in the description [music] most of the time i end up having to tell people nicely that they need to go back to the drawing board coming up with a solid premise for a documentary can be really really hard because if it were easy we'd all have shows on netflix so how do you know if your idea is good what makes for a compelling documentary and what are the different pieces you need to tell a story well in this video i'm going to tell you the three main things you need the holy trinity if you will so you'll know whether or not you have a good idea for a doc let's get into it [music] hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsythe and on this channel i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer if that sounds like something you'd be into click that subscribe button because i've got new videos coming out every week okay so you think you've got an amazing idea for a documentary but before you start filming and sinking a ton of time and money and energy into it you need to do yourself a favor and answer these three questions for yourself i'm gonna be a sneaky youtuber here and save what i think is probably the most important one for last so keep watching you didn't see that coming but before we get into that where do ideas for documentaries actually come from for me i get a lot from reading i love reading books both fiction and non-fiction and also from magazine writing like national geographic and the new yorker newspapers can also be great or sometimes ideas come from watching other people's documentaries and you see a side character or plot element and it makes you want to dig a little deeper in that direction i've even got ideas while working for other people's films like when i was shooting for the trade and ended up making a separate short film about one of their minor characters after we rapped ideas come from all sorts of places and there's nothing more exciting than that eureka moment where you realize you've just found your idea for your next project but more often than not just because a topic is interesting doesn't mean it will make for a good documentary it's easy to decide that i don't know life on a deep ocean oil rig is interesting but you need more than a topic to keep audiences watching what you need is a story and that's the first of the three points i have for you today you might be saying story topic what's the difference the topic is the story sorry but that's just not true topic and sorry are totally different things and without a story you don't have a documentary one of my favorite docs series on tv right now is last chance u if you haven't seen it it's on netflix and it has some of the nicest cinematography and character development i've seen in a dock in a while and you should definitely check it out it's about sports teams at the junior college level and how hard it is for students especially ones that come from poor backgrounds to make it as an athlete that's a cool sounding topic but it isn't a story a story has a beginning a middle and an end and over the course of it there's usually some sort of change or resolution a topic on its own doesn't have these things and that's how you can tell the difference between a topic and a story at the most basic level the topic of last chance u is college sports the story is that a group of mostly underprivileged athletes have been accepted to one of these colleges in the first place which is the beginning then they have to fight their way up to the top over the course of a brutal season the middle until they hopefully get to the championship game and win or lose the end and if they win and play well they might attract the attention of a scout and get recruited to one of the top schools in the country which could change their lives forever there's the change in resolution one way or the other your resolution doesn't have to be a good or happy one either lots of the athletes and last chance you don't make the cut but even if a character doesn't get what they want there's still a moment of resolution or look at tiger king probably one of the most watched documentaries of the last year if not of all time the crazy guy in his legal zoo in florida is a topic but it isn't a story but an eccentric man who opens a dodgy zoo the beginning develops a hostile rivalry with another big cat wrangler the middle which eventually leads him to being charged with murder the end see how that's different so when you first have an idea for your next doc ask yourself if you have a story or a topic you might have no idea how we'll end at this point but you need to be able to identify a possible ending where there is some sort of change over time i shot a baseball dog called bad hombres about the world's only bi-national sports team and even though we had no idea if the team would win or lose the season we knew there would be an end to the story either way alright you thought about it and you decided that you really are sitting an idea for a story and not just a topic so what comes next last month i read a news article about how the town of litton bc burned almost completely to the ground last summer in a wildfire and how even seven months later the reconstruction work hasn't even started clinton is only a few hours from where i live so i started thinking about what an interesting dock that could make how an entire town can burn up and disappear the story might be something about the struggle of the town is they pushed the government to get the work started and either they'd succeed and rebuild the town or they wouldn't and they'd still be homeless i figured i'd just hop in my car and drive up to litton and start filming i was imagining some super dramatic visuals of charred houses and cars and how i could combine them with old news footage to start the story off but i wanted to make sure i wasn't totally wasting my time so i called a friend i knew had shot there before and i'm glad i did because he told me that actually the entire place was fenced off and there were security guards controlling access to the fire zone there were a couple of lookouts that gave a decent view but in general i wouldn't be able to just wander around and film like i thought i might he'd been able to get inside eventually but first they'd had to hire a local producer and then make several trips to meet enough local people to eventually gain the permission they needed for filming access is everything in documentary and even the best story idea in the world is nothing if you don't have access to the world and that's going to be point number two to think about do you have access for quite a few years i worked and lived in mexico and i spent a lot of time shooting things with drug cartels and other pretty dangerous people at that time mexican cartels were constantly in the news and a ton of production companies wanted to come down and shoot projects but trust me you can't just roll up to a group of narcos with your camera and start filming that's going to end really badly for you please don't do it to make shows like that we had to work with local producers who had contacts with people in that world these producers sometimes called fixers would approach the narcos for us and explain what we wanted to do and why if the cartels were interested we got permission and went into film if they weren't interested no shoot that's an extreme example for sure but it's true for every store you might want to film you're going to need to shoot what you have access to when you're starting out you're not going to have teams of producers working for you so you want to make sure you're picking stories you actually have access to that could be through your friends and family like if your uncle was a cop you might get access to a few ride-alongs for your documentary about policing or maybe like through your work maybe you used to be a waiter at a high-end restaurant it might give you access to your dock about the crazy like of chefs i don't know or maybe you have an idea that takes place somewhere you don't have easy access to through your friends in that case you need to do some leg work and check if that access is possible a good producer will push and push and come at the situation from all different angles to open that access of but if you're doing this on your own you'll need to do this yourself i've been working on a big project the last eight months that i can't really talk about but even though i had a verbal agreement from the people we were filming before my partners and i started pitching it to networks we had to ask them to sign a letter to prove to potential buyers that we really had the access we said we did that's how important access is so before you start cutting a badass teaser for your next project ask yourself if you really have or can get the access you need to make it happen okay so you've got a story in the access you need to tell it you're most of the way there and honestly you could probably make a half decent project with just these two things but really good documentaries aren't told from the point of view of the filmmaker they're told through the voices and actions of the people who lived through those events my personal favorite style of documentary filmmaking is called verite where you don't set anything up or recreate anything you just follow people fly on the wall style and let the story unfold around you and for that this is the third thing you need characters specifically characters who want something or who want to make a change in their lives characters who are going through a journey or process of discovery and if they get or don't get what they want their lives are going to be somehow different all good stories period not just documentaries have characters who want something and experience change frodo baggins wants to destroy the ring and go home but after he's done it he realizes he's not the same hobbit as when he started michael jordan wanted to win nba championships and because he did it so well for so long he's now probably known as the greatest player of all time and is worth over a billion dollars pinocchio wants to be a real boy a great documentary brings audiences along for the journey as those characters experience those changes and through them we feel what it might be like to be someone else so if you want your dog to really resonate with people identifying who your characters are and what they want is super important spend some time before you shoot to brainstorm all this stuff get a piece of paper or make a google doc and ask yourself do i have a story or a topic do i have all the access i need to make it happen and who are my main characters going to be and what do they want if you find that you have all these things chances are you found a good idea for a documentary now you actually have to go out and make it which is where the real fun starts so there we go that's my advice on how you can know if you have a good idea for a dock on your hands i hope that was helpful and if it was think about hitting that subscribe button and if you liked that video maybe try this
