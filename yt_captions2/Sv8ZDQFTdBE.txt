hello and welcome back to the channel in this video we're going to be talking about the topic of how much money software engineers make i'm going to try the breakdown as best as possible how much money you can expect to make as a new software engineer based on your location your experience level and your company because this can actually be a very confusing topic on one hand you have a lot of people on youtube and on the internet talking about how they're making like 400k in one of these big tech companies and there's nothing wrong with that those numbers are very true for those people's specific situations but this can lead to false expectations because not everyone in every type of company and in every location makes those kinds of numbers most of the time when people talk about how much money software engineers make they either focus on either a single type of company most of the time the big tech companies or a single location most of the time the us so for this video i've researched the salaries across all kinds of different locations across the world both in the u.s and out of the us in big ten companies and non-big tech companies because you can be surprised how much the salaries really differ between these two types of companies and i'm doing that because i know that i have a very international audience and technology is a very international industry and as an international person myself it's just a topic that i'm really interested in one of my goals is to live in different countries around the world and knowing what kinds of salaries i can expect as a software engineer in these different locations is obviously an important consideration so i've scout the internet to find as many numbers as i can for as many different locations as possible and i've broken down the salaries for each location based on the entry level salary in non-big tech companies the median salary in non-big tech companies the entry level salary in big tech companies and i'm using google as a proxy for that and median salary for a more experienced engineer at google i need to say that these numbers are necessarily going to be inaccurate to some degree because obviously your salary is always going to depend on your situation your company and how you negotiate your offers and all kinds of stuff so don't take these numbers as the be-all end-all figure that you will receive it's always going to depend but these figures will give you at least a ballpark figure on what you can expect as a software engineer in these different locations but before we go into the numbers we need to talk about how software engineers actually get paid because it's actually a lot more confusing and a lot more complicated than many other industries as a general rule software engineers get paid very well i think in pretty much every location i looked at the salary for software engineers is generally much much higher than the median salary for every industry in that country i really broke this down and gave an economic explanation why this is the case in that video so you can go watch that right after this one but the gist of it is that every company nowadays is pretty much a technology company every new startup every new big thing that gets created is almost always somewhat related to technology and all the companies creating this new technology needs software engineers to create all these new products the demand for coding skills is extremely extremely high in this day and age it's just a very good time to be a software engineer and because learning how to code is not easy like it takes quite a bit of time to get good at coding it's not like anyone can just go and feel that demand for coding skills which means that companies are forced to pay their employees a premium to convince the very few competent programmers to come to them instead of the competition so the way software engineers compensation works is not just like in many industries where you just get a paycheck there's actually multiple different components to it and there's other people on youtube who've broken this down in more details roughly speaking first of all you get a base salary which is sort of what you expect in most other jobs that's what you think of as your conversation it's just the paycheck that you get every single month but software engineers don't just get that most of the time you also get equity especially in big tech companies and startups on top of your base salary you get a certain percentage of your salary as shares in the company and obviously the value of this equity offering will depend on how well the company does so for example if you work for a startup that ends up going bankrupt your equity might be completely worthless and the third piece of your salary is your bonus so typically companies will give you a certain percentage of your salary as a bonus which will depend on your performance and the company's performance so the better company does the better you do the more you get as a bonus and again the bigger your company the bigger these bonuses are so for example for my company which is not one of the big tech companies i'm not sure if i'll get a bonus at all but in the big tech companies it might be in the range of like 10 to 20 of your salary in some companies they might not get one at all and the last b is your sign on bonus so if you are a particularly competitive applicant maybe you have a competing offers and you're really able to negotiate salary negotiations the company might give you a sign-on bonus which is essentially again a percentage of your salary to convince you to take their offer instead of a competing offer so again it's difficult to say exactly how much it's going to be but just realize that this is multiple different possible components of your salary as a software engineer if you work for one of the big 10 companies the more of these they're going to have if you work for other companies like non-tech companies for example they might only have a base salary and then maybe a small bonus the last thing to consider before we go into the numbers that while the raw salary numbers depend on your country and location so does cost of living and so does taxes so if location a has doubled the salary of location b for example that doesn't mean that your net after tax and after expenses is going to be double most likely in the locations where the salary is high the cost of living is also higher just realize that their differences are probably not as big as they might seem just based on the raw numbers because of cost of living and because of taxes being very different across these locations as well okay so finally let's get into the numbers first of all let's talk about the us and the united states is where you will generally find the best salaries for software engineers and many other industries as well that's except for one other country which i'm going to talk about in a second which is very surprising to me so if you want to know what that country is make sure to keep watching but it makes sense that the us generally pays more because the us is home to most of the big tech companies and a lot of the headquarters of a lot of the major companies in the world in general that's where all the biggest projects are happening that's where there's most funding for tech startups so it just makes sense that in the us the market rates are generally higher so first let's talk about the san francisco bay area and new york you're starting as a new grad in a non-fan company so a non-big tech company you can expect to make anywhere from 80 to 100 000 straight out of university as a new grad in a non-big tech company and the median range for all salaries for all experience levels in these locations is roughly 160 to 200 000 dollars based on levels for fyi by the way most of my data is from this website which is generally very very accurate and i browse a lot of the discussion forums where people discuss their salary so i have a pretty decent understanding of what people generally make in these areas but if you don't believe me then level store fyi is a good way to get a roughly accurate estimate on what you're going to expect to make but then if we get to the big tech companies and i'm going to use google throughout this video as a proxy but in general google based slightly more than the other file companies from what i know as a new grad with google you can expect to make and this is gonna blow your mind if you haven't heard this before'5 000 straight out of university as a new grad as a software engineer'5 many other interested you'll never make that and google as a new software engineer in the us and san francisco new york you can make that much as a new crowd which is just crazy and once you're experienced so around l5 so like six to nine years of experience you'll probably make around 350 to 400 000 but the more experience you get the bigger the range is going to be because then more and more your offer is going to be less standardized and it's really going to depend on how you really negotiate the offer with the company really high ranges across all these categories but it's important to see how salaries at these fan companies are up to almost double to what they are generally so really if you want to make the big bucks as a software engineer you really want to try to work for one of these big tech companies but also we need to remember that in the us it also really depends on your location there's really high cost of living areas like san francisco and new york that are going to pay more by virtue of the fact that a the market there is bigger and b the cost of living means higher so the market rates are just going to be higher so that's the us but because i have a very international audience it's important to look at other countries as well and it's about to recognize in most countries you'll make a lot of money but you won't quite make these figures so for example in europe i looked at germany as an example and a lot of the western and northern european countries sort of fall around the same range as germany from what i can see but then again eastern and southern europe are going to be a lot less so keep that in mind but in germany as a new grant in non-foreign companies you might expect to make around 50 to 60k us dollars and i've standardized all the numbers to us dollars just to make this consistent across all the different countries as a median across all industries you'll pay 90 to 100 dollars at google as a new grad hundred and twenty thousand dollars still a lot but also around 60k less than it is in the high cost of living areas of the us which you might say is unfair but it's just how it is and then i google with experience is around 220 000 probably even higher that you're gonna make in germany and a lot of the other eu countries okay so we've looked at the us we've looked at the eu what about some less developed countries like india for example i know i have a very big indian audience i'm less familiar with indian salary than i am with european and u.s sarees but the ranges that i found are unfortunately much lower it's around five to fifteen thousand dollars for new grads in india but again we need to remember that obviously in india the cost of living is also significantly lower than median across all levels 35 to 45 000 us dollars let me know down in the comments if that's accurate but this is what levels of fy was saying new grad at google is around 40 000 rising up to a hundred to a hundred and fifty thousand dollars when you have a couple years of experience okay so what if you want to go look for some sun what about australia so in australia a new grad generally can expect to make around 40 to 50 000 us dollars which is gonna be higher in australian dollars but these are figures in us dollars 115 to 130 as a median across all industries and google as a new graduate for australia this was more of a range anywhere from 80 to 120 000 dollars and as someone with experience 200 to 220 000 us dollars again if you're australian please let me know down below if these numbers look accurate to you again so far you can see that none of these other locations have the crazy salaries of the us they're good but they're not nearly as high the u.s except this next country which really surprised me the country is switzerland i never really realized but switzerland actually has some of the highest salaries in the world across pretty much all industries and it certainly also applies for software engineers as a new graduate at a non-fine company in switzerland you can expect to make between 80 to 100 000 us dollars which if you look back before that's pretty much the exact same as what i found for san francisco and new york and has a median salary 165 000 to 200 000 which is just mind-blowing that's so much higher than any of the other european countries that i looked at at google as a new grad it's pretty much the same as it is in the bay area'5 000 in your first year and three hundred to four hundred thousand dollars as someone with a bit more experience and this is really curious to me because i do know that switzerland is a very high cost of living area as we will see in a moment so is london london in the uk is also very high cost of living but they don't have these greatest salaries and switzerland is by the way an amazing country it's a country where i'd definitely love to live at some point so with these salaries maybe i'll end up moving to switzerland at some point lastly let's look at the country where i will be working and that is the uk specifically my job will be at a big company in london as a new grad you can expect to make between 45 and 55 000 us dollars the median across all levels is hundred to a hundred and twenty thousand dollars at google you can expect to start making around 125 000 and as an experienced software engineer you can make 280 to up to like 300 000 and the company where i go my software engineering job is not one of these fan companies so my salary is actually just around this general range for a new rat in london so personally i can confirm that this range does seem to be true and for transparency's sake my salary and my company in london will be 35 000 british pounds which translates to around 46 to 47 000 us dollars so as you can see not every software engineer makes 200ks right out of college that really only happens in a few select companies in a few select locations personally for me when i got my job i had only been studying coding on my own completely self-taught for a couple of months so getting any kind of software engineering offer i was just really happy about that and in general as a junior you should probably be more focused on just learning as much as you can in your job becoming the best programmer as you can possibly be because once you have that couple of years of experience whatever your salary you are going to have opportunities to move you are going to have opportunities to apply your first salary doesn't necessarily even matter that much what matters more is how much you learn in the job and how good you become so i hope this video gave you a pretty good idea of what you might be expected to make as a new software engineer based on your location if you enjoyed the video please leave a like down below because you don't realize how much time it took me to research all of these numbers if you are a software engineer let me know down in the comments your location and your salary and if you want to share your company that's fine as well again i know i have a very international audience so you guys can probably give me more insight as to the market in your location than i can possibly give you and if you found this discussion on how much you can make as a software engineer informative your next question might be okay so where do i start learning how to code if you haven't started here so as a starting point you can look at this video where i talk about my journey of how i learned how to code in four months and got a job as a software engineer at the end of it or if you're wondering which programming language you should learn next you can watch this video where i talk about which language i recommend you start with
