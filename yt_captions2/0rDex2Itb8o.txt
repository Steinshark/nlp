did you know that when your phone says 5g up there it's probably lying when i type star pound star pound 4636 pound star pound star lte i paid for 5g darn it what's going on here as it turns out corporations is a liar sometimes and this kind of trickery is one of the reasons that we decided to spend nearly $45,000 on an industry standard radio frequency shielded room it will allow us to identify and debunk all kinds of industry connivance like this as well as test products like cell phones routers even microwaves for things like signal range battery drain interference regulatory compliance and so much more there's just one small problem they shipped us the wrong one and they stopped replying to our emails so now all we have is this foam a big pile of wood some other assorted paraphernalia and a great big project to turn this into something usable but don't worry we got a plan for that that i'm going to share with you along with this segue to our sponsor team group black friday and cyber monday are coming and team group has organized a cyberpunk style website with tons of deals click the link below and take advantage of their sale today when it comes to wireless technology it's really hard to know what's going on and it's not like you can see it which means that before we canest anything we're going to need some specialized equipment for one thing we're going to need a 4g 5g lab kit which is essentially a mobile network in a box that will allow us to spin up our own access points here and then measure the performance at various frequencies across the spectrum with all kinds of devices be they iphones or samsung galaxies naturally we'll want to do the same thing for home wireless equipment be it wi-fi or bluetooth and in order to ensure that our measurements are accurate we will need an emc chamber so let's talk about the kind we were supposed to get for those of you in the oh 45 grand for a fully assembled 16x 12t emf chamber is actually not a ton of money that is because we bought it used wait used no actually that is completely normal and fine as long as it was built by reputable manufacturer these things have no moving parts so they don't really wear out the way that you might imagine and it's extremely common to see scientific equipment like this on its third or fourth or fifth owner decades after it was first built of course it doesn't really look like anything special what makes it a a good one well this one honestly not much it took 3 weeks to ship and not only does it not match the picture on the website it is entirely the wrong size we ordered 16x 12 and they shipped us a 13x13 not to mention that it is in horrible condition like seriously this thing looks like they stored it outside look how beat up these foam panels are like what even happened to the tips on this one and this one and this these are the most critical part of the chamber but since it's in this state anyway i guess nothing prevents me from cutting it open and giving you guys a little lesson about foam different kinds of chambers those designed for acoustic use or radio frequency use wow this stuff is pretty heavy ah come on open up the point is they will use different kinds of foam materials in construction depending on their purpose ours is a high performance fire resistant theoretically so it is pidal foam emc absorber emc stands for electromagnetic compatibility and means that it shouldn't unintentionally generate reflect or retransmit electromagnetic interference oh that stinks of course no material is going to be absolutely perfect in this regard which is where the shape comes into play these pyramids aren't purely aesthetic but rather they have a function an electromagnetic wave like a sound wave can reflect off of a flat surface which means that if you're trying to measure the strength of a signal from a wi-fi router for example with a sensor here that bounce or realistically many bounces could interfere with your reading now to be clear acoustic and emc products can be flat like the acoustic panels that we mounted for col me chris and that will still help to reduce the energy of any waves that hit them but by employing this shape we give the waves multiple opportunities to bounce off of the sides of the pyramids before hopefully being nearly fully dissipated this elimination of bouncing waves is where an an eoic chamber gets its name an like not any echoic like not any echoes not all foams are created equal though like the highdensity foam that we use in our super comfortable straps on the ltt backpack ltd store.com and there are a couple of main differences between emc foam like this and the kind that you would find in a sound chamber first up while both are made of polyurethane the density and the internal structure tends to be higher for acoustic applications compared to what we need the second major factor is that emc foam like ours is carbon impregnated carbon has a lot of space in its outer electron orbitals allowing it to absorb energy which then gradually dissipates causing the electrons to fall back into their normal orbitals this makes it super effective like iron at blocking electromagnetic interference turning the entire chamber lined with this stuff into a sort of faraday cage sort of for better isolation what we should really have is high density ferite tiling that lines the inside of the chamber but a 2x 2 in tile okay is $8 which is why comparably sized chambers with fite can run you into the millions of dollars that's a yikes the good news is that we don't actually need ferite tiling ferite is useful for blocking lower frequency waves and with it we could block signals all the way down to 26 to 30 mhz allowing us to test like am radios and stuff but i suspect most of you don't really care about that sort of thing anyway and besides without the ferite tiling we can still keep anything above 800 mhz from passing through the walls into our chamber as for extremely high frequencies well we don't need to worry about those in here either because we've got a 10in thick concrete building all the way around us that is going to block them out nicely the finished chamber is going to be assembled right here and it's going to be about this big i'm walking around inside it right now which is a perfect fit for our consumer electronics devices along with our 4g 5g antenna cameras and any other measuring equipment that we will need when it's built but first story time as i already mentioned the picture on the website didn't match what was shipped but guys it gets way worse than that the seller never sold that chamber or even owned it in the first place i mean we thought we were at least buying a comparable one but it was completely different well could have been an innocent mistake right no not so much thanks to the contractor who ironically the seller ired to come out and build this thing for us we got in touch with the original seller of the actual pictur chamber and it turns out that they messaged these guys years ago telling them to remove those photos thing is the rf industry is pretty small and it seems like everyone knows everyone now thankfully we haven't actually wired the money for this so the obvious course of action was hey guys uh can you pack all this up and take it back and this i kid you not is their response it has been months of crickets now which i guess means i am the proud owner of many many piles and pallets of literal garbage it's not all bad though through the assembly contractor we were able to get in direct contact with some excellent emc chamber manufacturers and we're hoping that the next time we update you guys on this it'll be with great news and maybe there's a way to make some lemonade out of the lemons the thing is the degradation of these pyramids means that we cannot trust this foam to evenly attenuate any rf in the interior space but it could still prove useful for our future sound isolation chamber which will be a dual wall design so there's no reason that we couldn't pack this stuff into the airspace between the inner and outer walls to improve the isolation even further as for the framing well we can use that to put together our camera testing chamber which is going to have consistent lighting and lots of fun little objects and test patterns that we can take pictures of to evaluate both standalone and smartphone integrated cameras if i get my way it'll also have a little model train which i think would be sick as for the rest of it well i don't know hopefully we'll figure something out and they're not expecting us to send this back after leaving it with us and ignoring us for months i mean the way that i see it if they asked for it back at this point by the way you guys this looked like a lot come come come come come come come over here it's two layers thick no no no you got to see yeah here here can you see that it oh sorry sorry it's two it's two layers thick so if they ask for it back i think i'm just going to send them a storage invoice for their garbage and it might end up being a better deal for them to simply walk away like look i don't like to have to do it but if i have to go ruthless business guide then i i will i will cuz this is this ridiculous look at this it's got like tree debris on it like all over it that's not from us we've had it inside oh we haven't tested to see if it actually works at all for anything are you thinking what i'm thinking foam fort foam fort lmg 5 we're sitting at about 60 okay okay and going into the chamber and then wow i'm already already at 70 and here we are while i may not be able to present the data we would collect from this chamber to you guys as valid results just because of all the issues with it can confirm carbon impregnated foam definitely does a thing in fact i'm using my onboard recorder right now that goes to the pack at my hip and we're going to switch over to the one that i am transmitting to our camera operator over there and you guys are going to see it's pretty bad adam want to go ahead and close in the last spot here we go all also you're going to see that when i bust out of here this red ssid in the corner here is going to go from about minus 80 two here we go i dropped myself up to minus 50 all right i can't wait to have an actual working one just like i can't wait to tell you guys that you can see the full video of us building the blockport over on floatplane decom and oh i also can't wait to tell you about our sponsor msi msi released their new geforce rtx 490 supreme and it inherits the exterior design philosophy of its predecessor with a brushed metal cover and chevrons around each fan there's sections of different heat sink fins to disrupt unwanted airflow sounds to reduce noise and thermal pads under the metal back plate to provide additional cooling while ventilation reduces trapped heat their torx fans promise excellent longevity due to the double set of durable ball bearings that keep them spinning and there dual bios feature gives you control you can choose either full performance gaming or silence and they bundle in a support stand that can be attached to your case to hold up the card because hey every tank needs good support that's actually very funny i like the talking points so check out the rtx 490 supreme at the link in the video description if you guys enjoyed this video you might also enjoy the one where we gave you guys a lab update on what's going on with keyboard testing so why don't you go check out that one um can i actually get a hand though just get that cl yeah cl yep no no for real like it y okay it's just at a really weird angle i couldn't get any leverage
