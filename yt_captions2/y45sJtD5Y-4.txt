2024 is coming in fast i mean it's what is it now under 4 weeks away is going to be 2024 you can't help but with 2024 coming right around the corner whether you will admit it or not or we will admit it to ourselves or not there is this what feels like exciting pressure in a way of what is going to be my new year's resolution i'm not going to set one but you can't help but have this like energy that you feel all around you when you enter into a new year you want to start learning something new thinking about your career where is it headed what skills do you want to pick up and that is what we are going to dive into today i'm going to share with you some of the top in demand skills for 2024 top meaning the highest paying skills companies are hiring for going into 2024 i'm also going to share with you some resources that you can learn these skills i mean right from the comfort of your home all right let's get into it the first one that i'm sure is not not a shocker to any of you i mean there will be some surprises on this list but this one is definitely not can you guess what it is cloud computing skills in fact i'm not sure if you've heard about this but between 2022 and 2030 the global market for cloud computing is expected to grow from 570 billion billion to close to 2.5 trillion i don't know that's it's a lot of money this means there's going to be a growing demand for these skills for cloud computing skills and the best part in my opinion is that are so many areas within cloud computing that you can specialize in having the knowledge and expertise around cloud computing you can be technical or non-technical on the business side of things which is great for anyone who's looking to whether you're technical or not learn something new going into 2024 but what exactly is cloud computing i feel like we talked a lot about cloud computing but if we were to break it down in simple terms explaining it to your grandma or your mom how would you do so essentially cloud computing enables people to access software applications data storage and other services over the internet instead of through traditional physical servers in a back office there are three main types of cloud services software as a service platform as a service and infrastructure as a service now if you are someone who is looking to learn more about cloud computing and different roles or different skills even within cloud computing i would highly suggest checking out ud to me i mean there are so this this video isn't sponsored by any of these uh resources i'm sharing by the way ud to me though i've just used for so many years and i just really trust a lot of their courses what i do though is go onto their courses see a what has highly rated like what is highly rated how many people have voted because a lot of these courses they'll have you know 4.9 out of five stars and it's like half a million people have voted also to the other thing with udem me courses is make sure to check when the course was last updated a lot of these instructors will come back and continuously update the course but it's something to keep in mind coming in at number two is machine learning engineering now i know you're thinking of course you're going to say something around ai tip but it's true it's continuing to grow more and more in demand ai isn't going anywhere uh machine learning data science none of these are going anywhere so why not take a step back and start learning it and the best part is just like cloud computing it doesn't mean you have to go into a technical role so once again if you are someone i have some good friends actually uh who work at ibm and they are now data and ai specialist sales specialist so even on the selling side of things now companies need consultants and sales professionals who can sell and educate about generative ai about data machine learning all of that good stuff so whether you are technical and want to be building this or maybe you're non-technical and want to be selling or educating customers about it now for different platforms around uh machine learning in particular there are so many courses out there right now that i think one thing you need to keep in mind is actually actually uh to be weary of the courses out there because of how many there are and how quickly they have come up i see sometimes some courses out there i'm like i don't know i wouldn't really trust this resource or they spun this course together really quickly just for the sake of getting something out there one place i would always go though for u machine learning or generative ai in general is corsera they have some incredible courses i'll put up on screen here that i really like i started taking or just finished actually uh taking their ai for everyone course me about took me a few months to finish to be honest with you it's a pretty short course but it was one of those things that i was doing in my spare time and i'm really excited to take one of these courses next maybe more so on the technical side of things i'm just still deciding which one if you've taken any of them let me know what you like though the best next on the list coming at number three is something i just think is the coolest job or coolest industry i should say or field of work which is working with robotics in particular robotics process automation all right so rpa is a software techn technology that makes it easy to build deploy and manage software robots that emulate human actions interacting with digital systems and software so you can think of it as a way where someone is coming in and implementing rpa to a lot of different systems that can be automated so what this will do is it will help humans be able to focus on i don't know why i said that so funny humans be able to focus on more of the complex tasks and these rpa systems will be able to automate a lot of the more mundane tasks so here are some examples of rpa some would include data transfers processing payroll onboarding uh call center operations web scraping there are so many ways so many different areas that you can automate this is rpa so if you're interested in automation i highly would suggest checking this out now for a course ibm actually offers a robotic process automation course and i really like ibm's courses actually and i'm not just saying that cuz i used to work there i think they're very easy to understand really well written and broken down so i'll link this one down below as well but ibm robotic process automation i haven't taken it personally but it looks like a really good one and i have taken a ton of other ibm courses so i feel very good recommending this one now the next one isn't completely technical or so it kind of meets in the middle which is digital marketing and this is something that i think especially as technical people we sometimes can scoff at oh digital marketing what is that but there it is so in demand and it's going to continue to be as all businesses now it feels like go online or migrate to online if they aren't already digital marketers can have a wide variety of different things that they do so depending on what kind of digital marketer you are or looking to get into or if maybe like myself and you aren't a digital marketer but you just really enjoy learning more about those skills some include seo payperclick and other in demand it skills this rule i would say isn't necessarily super technical in the aspect of coding but it is data driven a lot of these decisions are data driven so you'll work a lot with google analytics or different analytical systems this is not necessarily a skill per se there are a ton of skills under digital marketing but i wanted to include it because it is something that i've seen over and over again now on job postings even for technical roles not maybe being directly intertwined with digital marketing but you should have an understanding of it if you are at all on the marketing side of things a technical marketer developer marketer developer advocate developer relations you get the point for me i would suggest taking any course around digital marketing that has google analytics involved in it it's something that i have seen across the board most companies use so i would start by taking a course around google analytics and it's just super fascinating even when you're building a website and you're implementing google analytics to have an understanding as to what it is capable of so i don't know it's kind of a win-win coming in at number five i hope this is no surprise i mean they're two separate fields but data science and data analyst both of these roles both of these skill sets within these roles will continue to be in demand in 2024 data is the new oil i feel like that saying is not the new saying though everyone always says it but it is so true there is nothing more valuable to companies right now than getting access or gaining access to understanding their data and this is one way that data scientists and data analysts come into play so let's talk a little bit about what exactly do data analysts do they use their skills to clean analyze and present data in a way that is easy to grasp so a lot of times you will see data analysts even at consulting companies where they are then presenting this data that they have cleaned and analyzed for external customers maybe they are uh customers that the consulting company is working for or maybe it's internally for example i know some data analysts that will then present this data to their stakeholders or managers depending on the roles within the company the good news is skills that fall in either of these categories whether it's data science or data analyst is well there's a few things one is it doesn't mean just because you learned python or learned any of the tools that data scientists or analysts use that you need to become that role i think that's a really big thing i want to get across here because what it does do is it gives you almost like these superpower this set of superpower skills if you will i think as we continue to evolve and grow closer with technology it's not going to be that oh i'm not this role so i don't need this skill set it's going to be kind of all meshed together you're to present yourself with a multitude of different skills some that a data scientist might have some that a project manager might have and through that it's going to make you very indispensable to companies by having all of these different skill sets i really encourage you not to just focus on you know this very one narrow career path and only learning certain skills unless that's the way you want to go but if you are able to genuinely take time to learn different things that you are curious about that you think you know what rather than asking someone all the time to go and pull these analytics for me i can do it myself that gives you a lot of power not only with your current company but also when you a job hunting that's something i think that's really important that no one really talks about i've seen this firsthand in my career for example i can edit videos so for example i don't edit my youtube videos i have an incredible video editor who does that for me but at the company i work at sometimes if i need to make small edits here or there i will do so on the other side of things is i'm learning how to really use google analytics right now this is because a lot of times for different things that i am putting out there i want to understand the analytics myself versus just always asking someone then of course you know i code i'm a coder i've been a developer for 6 years before moving into developer relations i guess what i'm getting at is something that has worked really well for me in my career is being open to different skill sets and learning and i'd highly recommend the same for you all right on that note go learn something really cool in 2024 let's continue to upskill let's continue to learn don't put this ridiculous pressure on yourself though that you need to learn super fast or 24/7 just take your time and make it enjoyable
