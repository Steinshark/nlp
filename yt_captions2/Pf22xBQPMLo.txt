ladies and gentlemen happy new year hope you all have a wonderful 2024 and we are going to kick off 2024 with a bang as today chess.com has announced new bots and they are none other than bots of magnus carlson and i am going to play against them and i have been told there is a secret bot as well so i will try to discover what on earth are talking about they have not given me much information but that is what i have to work with um friendly reminder today is january 1st today is the last day you can get any of my courses for 40% off the holidays are over so if your loved ones didn't get you a holiday present you could set a new year's resolution go study some end games go study some tactics some middle games learn that opening you've always wanted to learn uh i'm going to play against the magnus bots and we're going to have a blast i mean chess.com i i was really worried you know because the ch 2023 just ended magnum won every tournament but he's not playing for the world championship he's not playing in the candidates what are we going to do with no magnus well obviously we're going to we're going to farm magnus for content even you know even like this okay so our bots are uh we have sleeping magnus and then we also have we we have a couple of others there there's sleeping magnus ski magnus soccer magnus chef magnus and magnus just magnus um i'm kind of sad they don't have drunk magnus cuz that's definitely one of the most powerful uh chess players in the world maybe they'll change it up i'm going to play maybe one or two games against each one then we're going to play magnus we're going to try to see what on earth chess.com is talking about uh with with with their bots let's let's open up with e4 let's see what dialogue he has oh does he have no dialogue is is that is the point that he's asleep okay he played the sicilian defense i'm going to play the alipin trying try to put two pawns in the center okay he went d5 uh i i think i have animations off by the way so let me um let me fix that i i usually have it on this this setting play d5 okay it's a normal move he's asleep so he he's he's not talking oh he's that that just said z's all right tremendous all right well that's that's not an accurate move in general just move in general you should not be making queen moves in the opening too many times okay obviously magnus is not he's not awake yet so okay so just he's trying to mate me over here i don't need to acknowledge this in general striking against the flank is better in the center oh look wow that's actually that that is a reasonable move he is he he's pin he's putting pressure on the pin pees he's also mumbling the word bishop i'm going to play knight h4 it's not the best move but uh knight h4 attacks the queen and the best move is queen f6 all right well okay uh he thought he was mating me um i guess if you just survive a little bit against mus chess if you survive a little bit against this magnus he's going to hang his queen against you so um okay discover check he said stop no i hope they discuss these voice lines with him i i gave up my rook by the way uh but the idea there was uh was to get my bishop around i am i mean i am a queen up so i should just go for his king i can probably sacrifice and continue the attack cuz again i am up a lot of material oh he doesn't even take do i have a checkmate i do i have knight d8 discovered check okay knight d8 discovered check and then i'm going to play bishop f4 queen d7 and yeah he i i i destroyed him i d so the the first bot is not really that impressive let's see if he says anything you beat sleep thank you thank you chess.com i can beat a grandmaster when he's asleep he didn't even say anything when he lost all right that was a little bit boring let's play ski magnus magnus is hitting the slopes in 24 but still has time for chess see how strong he is while he slaloms downhill what is a slalom wait i got to look this up slalom slalom skiing alpine skiing and what what is a slalom s l a l o m i don't know let's play black all right there's no such thing as bad snow only bad skiers i'm going down a a double black diamond ski run all right magnus no need to show off uh let's play a modern let's play g6 and bishop g7 okay he turns it back into a king's pawn i'm going to play d6 a6 b5 maybe there's two setups that white can choose he could choose the aggressive one or he could you know castle short side how many other chess players have you seen play chess while king we get it magnus you're very impressive that's a jerry move if i ever saw one what looks like a pawn avalanche coming my way this is not a good move it was good it was good there it was good here and then this is just a waste of time uh cu i can just attack the knight i can also keep developing as long as you're making a move that creates a threat and doesn't overextend your position it's totally okay um like a5 there is bishop takes in some positions all right i don't know what is going on here but i'm just playing in the modern style generally you try to prepare this move c5 which is what i'm doing with my knight pawn and my rook and skiing magnus is clearly on some sort of narcotics because he just played bishop e2 and bishop f1 we're going to i hear there's a secret magnus bot at the bottom the mountain seems sketchy to me the ski put troll might need to save you what is this the secret magnus spot i hear there's a secret magnus spot at the at the bottom of the mountain okay this is an awful move pones so skiing magnus gave me a pawn uh i guess i'll continue to develop i'm trying not to block my bishops does that move have a threat doesn't look like it i can attack the knight i can also break in the center i guess that move does have a threat just not with the knight all right let's play a5 now this is actually not a terrible move move if i fall for it okay doesn't let me quite get what i want maybe queen here that's a i i doubt he's going to see that there's no way oh said gnarly i don't think magnus carlson has literally ever said the word gnarly but no problem uh let's just castle let's just castle everything is protected white doesn't have a lot of space d5 is a queen hang but there's no need to do that let's play f5 where c were very well equipped to open up the board right now in general in a in a in a more or less close position you you you are able to open up like this especially cuz the opponent's pieces are all back here anytime a pawn moves you want to see what it did this move actually does a lot of things first of all it controls some squares but it relinquishes defense of this pawn second of all it blocks the bishop third of all it opens the queen so every time a pawn moves many many things happen in this particular case uh white is in a lot of trouble cuz he's going to lose the knight and then maybe the the rook well my pawn moved okay the computer spotted that but now my pawn made it all the way down the board it is also very well protected now i'm just looking i have to be a little careful here with my king but in general uh i don't have any on pant there sadly we can trade and then trade the queens it's a nice way to play for a win okay the computer at this point is completely malfunctioning so we're going to trade queens because i i don't want skiing magnus to checkmate me i'm hitting this actually i think i just lost the pawn yeah i might have just lost the pawn but i have too many pawns yeah this is coming down this is it was easier to focus when i was on the chairlift oh now he's saying he's not even focusing zug in between move i'm going to promote to a knight against the bot so it's check and i want to disrespect it this is the only chance i'll get to promote to a knight against magnus carlson actually feel good about myself it's hard to play chess while holding ski poles tremendous tremendous tremendous yes yes yes what does that mean that there's a secret magnus at the bottom of the mountain what is he talking about that's mate okay get my bishop out of the way take the pawn m him okay take the knight put the bishop back take the pawn m him take the pawn and made him that's what we're going for oh my god okay checkmate net he can't escape he can escape oh my god he's so annoying i really stomp that magnus no you didn't what's the okay check he's going to go here and now we prevent his escape this how you we a it's normally a stalemate but he has pawn moves made him very convin convincing victory for mr gotham chess thank you very much maybe i should stick to the bunny slope during our rematch yes you're trash um all right magnus love sakur might be a little bit distracted this whole thing is just him being distracted while he plays you so he has a built-in excuse we need drunk magnus that's what we need i guess that's not very kid-friendly can we have apple juice magnus can we have happy hey chess.com call him happy hour magnus cuz kids are going to think that it's he's just happy but we all know what that means it's hard playing soccer while playing chess on your phone he literally okay oh my god i'm going to go d4 this time i'm going to play a london against mr magnus all right i'm playing goalkeeper right now our regular goalkeeper is out sick i nobody asked literally no one asked what okay that's pretty funny soccer magnus why am i not what what is what is e5 he's 1500 he hung a pawn on move two what is this oh my god okay now we're just playing a london but i have an extra pawn oh my god what martin odard did i just is that like a is that like a slur like what oh my oh my god what is that word i don't even know who that is don't get distracted by me naming random soccer players yo i i why do they make magnus look so antisocial in these things i'm stopping queen before check it's actually not like the worst position in the world for black let's just be solid we're playing a london um in the london you're generally supposed to develop and then put the knights out uh sometimes people get very spooked in londons when when their opponents play very aggressively oh holland i know who holland is um i'm a pawn up so i'm going to trade the queens i have to worry a little bit about my bishop getting red card no boo wow they've really made him completely demented i mean these voice lines are okay uh i guess i can keep developing or i can start poking with my pawns like this anyway again up material good to trade just have to evaluate if he's going to be able to trap your pieces i can poke at him i can castle long i can develop my knight to e2 and then castle short uh just have to again make sure that my bishop is never getting trapped okay so now the best thing to do is to fight back on the dark squares right and so now my dark squares are very nice so my knight could always go there it's very tough to say which way to castle is better actually i think castling queen side is the better move here because the rook should guard the pawn if you castle this way black might be able to mobilize toward your weakness in chess that's you really got to think of things that way can your opponent make forward progress with these pieces your king's lining up for a corner kick it's time to bring a man on late okay i'm going to trade i'm going to replace the knight where the bishop used to stand oron i don't even who is that i almost miss taking magnus almost miss taking a bishop yeah that's the that's 1500 magnus they're insulting magnus and 1500s when they do this okay my knight is powerful on f4 i am a pawn up let's jump the knights into the black position just to apply pressure we don't have any specific targets but they are very annoying they're very menacing and the next order of business might be to poke with the pawns oh that's just a fork what he just walked into a fork he's going to say some stupid thing now this done playing defense oh yeah bye muhammad el yusi okay i he's norwegian because he kind of sounds arabic who what who is that muhammad l yusi he plays as a forward or winger for danish he's born in morocco oh he's he might be morocc but he plays for the norway team wow that's confusing that is and pardon my ignorance i mean my goodness wow okay moroccan but plays for the uh what danish club team but on the norwegian national team wow i'm learning things i that's awesome look at me i'm learning stuff i didn't want to lose that pawn by the way so where are these hints i mean they they were giving me hints for the secret bot and then they stopped okay i guess i'm going to lose this pawn or not and now i just need to it's a very close position so i'm going to have to okay i will happily trade he's still naming football players that they made this magnus play chess like a literal 9-year-old like nine-year-olds at chess tournament sit there just drumming if anybody has actually been to a chess tournament like that that is how kids behave and it is very very very embarrassing um all right let's go here let's trade mar hren peterson amazing he's still going that's a double check now i'll double the rooks i'll bring my pawn forward i'm not playing this actually that precisely but i i need to do a little bit of a better job double up on the file i also have the outside pass pawn which is very very very valuable in the end game i blundered that that is a fork and that is very annoying but let's beat magnus in an end game let's beat him in a rook end game it's the only time in my life i will be able to say i beat magnus carlson in a rook end game i'm two pawn in a rook end game i have an outside pass pawn i'm going to walk my king over here and i'm going to cook magnus carlson that's what i'm about to do king f1 king e1 king here king here he he can't stop me there's nothing oh my god this is this must be what magn what it feels like to be magnus just cooking everybody in these end games i'm going to bring my king all the way up to oh i got two pass pawns now a&h you can't beat me now magnus i'm too powerful i am the i am look at me i'm the best endgame player of all time now king oh i hung that pawn too actually that that was pretty stupid but uh he can't stop both is he going to go here he is he is going to go there um let's just take as many pawns as we can to go yeah he's not he he can't stop all my pawns i'm going to take this take this he just doesn't have enough pawns there we go now i just have to not stalemate him and i am pretty bad at with those i i generally all right i'm looking forward to playing like the 2,000 version and the higher one because they've really uh they've really made the 1500 one brain dead as well let's make rooks let's just disres magnus a little bit pre moove pre moove pre moove pre [music] moove yep and we'll promote to another rook and we're going to we're going to win like this this where we're going to cut the king off we're going to stop the promotion and uh we're going to get a ladder mate just can't let him sneak in a queen every move should be a check you know what just for good measure i'm i'm just going to go eat the pawn because you never know all right dink dink dink oh good defense that was that that was good that was good dink dink solid game did he say anything else no no hints i don't even know i don't know i have no idea what they wanted chef magnus cooking up a tour deforce dinner for his friends but still last time magnus doesn't cook food he has a chef stop it all right last game i played a modern this game i'll play guess i'll just play something don't call me magnus call me chef okay chef okay this is this is the this is magnus after getting a head injury skiing okay he he's still clarifying he wants to be called chef that's that's weird behavior it's queen pawn game is he going to play a london no he plays whatever that is i'll i'll boring i'm i guess i'm playing a reverse london that's what i'm i missed the voice line what what did he just say i missed the line it's it's not telling me what he said what did he say no go back ah fine okay keeping attention here chef boy rd mama celeste one king on what the what is he saying okay let's trade this off is he gonna go here that's not this is not that he's just naming chefs that's what rest in peace by the way anthony bourdain um is he gna go here is that is that the big idea make a reservation make a reservation with another bot after this maybe one all the way down the page what are they saying what are they saying down the bot page is that what they're say i'll whip up a tasty night kimbop what the isn't kim k why does magnus the norwegian chef make korean food what what i'll steal 86 your king from my kitchen what the i i keep looking things up because i have no idea what they're talking about okay anyway playing in the center is good does chef magnus see the pawn is hanging i could sack but that might be a little bit too much might be a i'm not sure my queen has backup there uh let's lock out the bishop isn't the bishop trapped can't i play a6 b5 isn't the bishop trapped uh-oh uhoh chef magnus uhoh oh is that a a good move what if i do this now wait can you go here uhoh uhoh uhoh no i don't think it's an uh oh because i think i can take i'm going to get three pawns for the bishop and i'm still threatening to trap this bozo's bishop over here yeah i can just take it right i can just trade and then play b5 sorry chef magnus you got your bishop trapped yeah i know you want that but uh you're not going to get it you're not going to get it your bishop's going to die sorry bud so now i am three pawns up pretty good pretty good pretty good this guy might be worse than the last bot and now we can just march down the center of the board here we're not getting trapped so let's just march in knight d5 that doesn't do anything what what was the point of this there was no threat okay we could trade some pieces i can also plop my knight oh i got to be careful i got to not get my piece trapped so let's just let's just start with h5 this bishop is pretty bad uh e4 nice move trade some pieces ooh he's just letting me walk in huh i mean two connected past pawns that deep into the territory is not going to go well mr magnus oh my goodness chef magnus i apologize chef magnus oh my connected pawns on the third rank is game over e2 d2 or d2 e2 i don't know they both look good d2 e2 i got the rugs behind them i'm sorry what can i promote to another knight i'll promote to a bishop oh disrespecting the goat because i can h cuz this they gave me the chance let's eat all his pawns put the knight on there knight d5 knight f4 e2 i they really should not have they should not have done this to magnus because there is no way i can get this level of a victory even even if magnus was on his deathbed i think he would do better than this all right takes takes let's clean it up that'll make a beautiful paon flambe have no he's still talking about cooking food he's getting cooked and he's talking about cooking food all right he can't move i'm going to put my pawn on f4 and we are going to suffocate the man that's what we're going to do right now how do i get a checkmate net how do i get a checkmate net let's give a check let's take the pawn he still has many legal moves and then i can put my uh it's not a stalemate not a stalemate and we need to checkmate him uh what's the fastest checkmate here i probably need to wrap my rook a certain way this is very annoying let's give a check and then let's go to that's not made either oh my god this is this is very annoying knight here king here rook f2 king here i want the rook on f2 and i want the knight on g4 i think i i i need the knight on g4 so let's put the knight on g4 and now we set a checkmate net there we go all right thank you for the game you are now an official chess.com chef shut up all right last game against magnus or i don't know is it is it all right let's let's let's go actual magnus 2882 hi i'm magnus carlson oh i was waiting for him to move i'm so star struck you know okay let's play d4 i guess i played d4 last game but it's okay knight f6 i will play my i'm the 16th okay why do all his voice voice lines just sound so brutally annoyingly arrogant like what we know that's why they made bots of you you don't need to tell us all right if i was the world champ they would have made bots of me they only have one bot of me okay anyway um should we play a main line what should we do let's play a main line main line d4 c4 play z6 play the catalan maybe i missed that voice i missed that line what what did he say queen's indian let's see how long you last good luck good luck to you bozo don't talk to me like you know me okay this is a line queen c2 oh my god i keep missing the lines cuz they they bring them up this is a fun way of developing agreed uh knight bd2 this is the queen's indian black tries to put pressure with the bishops i'm quite good in positions with a strong bishop like this also all yeah yeah same i had a game like this against emelio cordova i remember i had a had a game like this he says h shut oh my god be quiet let's grab the bishop let's give up okay it's a little bit scary the tension is building yeah you and me both queen d1 this is a weird move though because he's going to have to move the bishop anyway or he's just choosing not to i can appreciate a good night every once in a while what does that even mean i guess i can play pawn 2 e3 right i mean like i i don't really want to play pawn 2 e3 the thing is if i castle is he going to take my knight like is that is that the idea he's going to take my knight and then he's going to take on d4 do i take and then a castle do i take and then play b4 really don't like the concept of taking and then giving him the b file but i also don't want to and i don't want to play e3 because i feel like i'm weakening my position over here a bit but and then i'm you know he he he might take this pawn on and and and things like that h take knight d4 cd4 is also quite good ah i'm already thinking let's take let's take and then try to open up the position i mean i i expect rook b8 no he didn't okay it's nice of you to take care of your king thank you magnus b4 because i feel like i need to i need to get rid of that weakness bishop b2 take take he can't take with the rook because i have a pin if knight takes i have rook take let's go bishop b2 i like this actually i have have some nice space i have you know i have open lines take take he can't take with the rook what i don't think the best move is obvious here what the i'm i beg your pardon what what exactly is wrong with the x-ray of the rook to the rook what he just wants both pawns he's just giving me yeah i know takes but that's not your voice line magnus that's hikaru's voice line oh my god that's a zuk i think i'm a lot funnier than the bot version of me you you are the man okay my queen is hanging i have queen d6 at which point he could take do i want to play an end game against the magnus endgame bot let's play an end game against the endgame magnus bot let's do it oh that's not the best move i don't think that's the best move i think i need to keep queens on i don't think i have enough firepower but let's just make a funny point let's just let's try to be humorous let's try to be humorous all right e3 oh he said how dare you wait he said how dare you you are stronger than i thought is that true i don't know i was programmed to say that that's very funny okay i i don't know where the how dare you thing happened but whatever e5 um this is this is scary i mean an endgame against against magnus let's play h3 i want to stop the knight from coming to g4 plays h6 now i don't know if i want to trade the rooks do i think that i have a good enough position to win with just one rook if i have the king of the rooks oh i think this was a mistake the real me would probably play a better move but the bot me will settle for that i don't think i don't think getting the bishop off off the center was right something tells me this was wrong because it allows me to start transferring some pieces over rook a2 yeah i'm i'm getting confident that pawn is not instilling a lot of confidence in me what about rook a4 now i'm i'm making the bot play d5 magnus doesn't like making committal pawn decisions your piece must be in good shape with all the moving it's doing yeah yeah you talk more trash i'm going to i'm going to ruin your life how about that clown my bot is almost 2900 is there any tougher bot you can find knight whoa if take knight c5 is the idea can i take and then take the next one i mean this has to be right right this is what i what i did um do i have rook a3 take and then here and then maybe no that doesn't look can i take and then and then i mean it's equal but he has a pass outside pawn i don't want to give up my rook for no reason i i don't see a reason to give up my rook for no reason so i will not be giving up a rook for no reason um okay still not fully convinced that this is like that good for the bot rook c 1 king d6 knight c4 do i want a knight or do i want a bishop which piece do i want do i want a knight or do i want a bishop which piece do i want to preserve which piece is better oh that's so tough i'm going to say i want to trade the bishop i don't think my bishop is going to be that good in the long run and i do think i need my knight i can take he's got to take like this maybe i have rook c1 stuff knight c4 stuff take take very tough to say very tough if i take am i am i creating an asset for him for the mongus bot i don't know very very very difficult king f2 let's bring the king let's not let's not rush anything i respect you for challenging me but i don't fear you i mean i would hope not mr greatest of all time tough g4 control some pawns i don't know is this weakening like what is uh bishop e2 very tense position but uhoh here comes the pawn here comes the pawn i got to get out of here i don't know how though i can keep walking my king but is that fast enough yeah what if i go here okay he goes back let's continue to try to get a trade maybe he'll go here oh oh ah yes yes yes yes that's huge wow the bot decided it couldn't make any more progress oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah all right yes that is how we do it but i'm not finished i think there is still something there's still something here right where's the secret bot where is the secret bot new game okay they said at the bottom of this page there's a chest bot called the magni and it's elo is impossible three magnus carlson's what the what how strong is it okay i'll play black hello we are the magna we are the ult what the what what is going on okay okay how good is this thing we are happy to play yo that's creepy bro i don't i don't like that man oh my goodness yeah and and so what we would say good luck but luck cannot help you queen's gambit accepted i'm chilling what the what what is that that's just a mistake what is that what they just gave me a pawn what was that that was just that's just a free pawn and i'm just going to castle three out of three magna agree on castling yeah but youo lost the pawn okay but i'm just the pawn up i don't understand how how do you agree the position is equal you're a full pawn down what what is this what is this nonsense gambit that these guys just invented i'm going put my knight there i'm never getting mated okay beast 6 queen e4 don't don't blunder that but i just go here i don't and we have been the number one chess player in the world for a combined 30 years nobody cares you you're a pawn down you're not going to mate me either if you trade all the pieces i'll just go here what this is terrible what is this thing doing okay and rook b8 b6 now now i can play b6 cuz this isn't even a fork one out of three magnite is hungry and want bro ch like i'm got too much time on their hands man they got too much time on their hands doing this nonsense the magna have chosen the obvious move yeah you don't say queen d6 i don't get it i i'm still up a pawn and just g6 how will i ever lose famous last words but seriously like i'm just i'm i'm chilling i am completely chilling i'm going to play b6 and then bishop b7 and i i get my bishop out what is the wow it's still trying to attack me i don't understand i don't understand i mean i'm the worst i mean i can't lose right like maybe i'll lose an endgame or something but it does what the  rook b5 is crazy it wants to go rook e5 but what if i play bishop a6 and then i trade bishops what what if i what if i hit him with with one of those oh bishop a6 rook e5 bishop d3 is this the idea okay let's overprotect my pawn i need to just find a repetition that that's that that's what i got to do okay it's going to triple up or that whatever that does okay i i think i'm trying to get it to play c4 that's terrifying because it just did what i thought we are the m thank you i was unsure what your name was because you only said it like 46 times yeah but now what if i just wait what if i don't do anything what if i just wait and pressure this pawn right but what if i play like rook f4 rook d8 or even bishop d5 now oh no that hangs a queen take take rook e7 that would be bad that would be bad rook f4 queen d4 rook f4 rook d8 maybe rook f4 bishop d5 i can take now i don't want to go here because it's like so depressing but i might not have a choice oh this is getting very difficult let's go rook d8 i guess the m mag m uhoh three out of three magnite evaluate this position as advantageous uhoh i can't take uhoh uhoh uhoh uhoh i'm still defending maybe i'm not defending oh no oh i'm in i'm in trouble it's going to take maybe i can go for this pawn oh i can't i can't touch anything it's just not letting me like it's not letting me move i'm i'm doing what i can to get this ewn but it's just going to defend oh no oh if that works i'm so cooked i am so cooked if that move works is is it going to take what's the take i don't what is the idea don't i just take on e6 what what how am i oh and now now it's going to kill me now it's going to kill me yeah we are the magni that was nuts it just straight up played a gambit i've never seen that in my life all right let's get oh wait that doesn't even work oh but that works the magn have selected the best i can't take because i lose my queen it's threatening bishop c2 i can't defend against that unless i play rook c6 and if i play rook c6 it forks me and my king has no legal moves maybe queen g5 last chance i think i'm i think i must be lost queen oh and now it's going to sneak brutal and it's mate no it's not mate what i thought i was mated oh it's just going to take my bishop it's not taking my bishop ah it's going to take my bishop with check or that yeah yeah check and that's the end because i don't have this oh i don't have any checks and i'm going to play rook there and get mated wow okay they did not get satisfied with one magnus so they straight up invented a bot that is three magnus carlson's and what does the game review say and what does the game review say me against three magnus freaking carlson's that that that that that's that's what we're working with here my game review is on the highest settings so it's going to take a little bit of time i mean if e4 is like what even was that that was the magn versus gotham chess magnus carlson bots are here ch.com i kindly advise you to add a happy hour magnus um maybe some others long video today but i do hope you appreciated it um e4 was a bad move right e4 is a mistake so i guess it plays in a way where it gives away a little advantage early and then it just bulldozes i mean i was doing okay i wasn't yeah like it wasn't but i guess it just has a really aggressive playing style that was fine it was equal and then where did i make a mistake queen d7 i guess was a bad move rook d8 was a bad move yeah wow i you know well my estimated elo was 2,900 and it's was 3450 so i can't really hate you know look i'm i'm
