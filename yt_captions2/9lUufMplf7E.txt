today is the 6th of april and i've only had one question on my mind for quite some time now and that is what is going to happen to stack overflow now that we have ai assisted chats such as bard and chat gpt to kick off my research i first tried to do a simple comparison by seeing which was faster for a simple coding problem stack overflow immediately thought i was a robot but that's okay i'm a pretty intelligent robot so i got past the captcha and i made it to the search bar soon after i then asked how i could get the date in python this search gave me the following results and with another 20 seconds of research i managed to get this answer which was somewhat what i was looking for but then i decided to try the same thing with chachi bt and we're using the default gpt3 model for this so i asked how to get the date in python and in a split second the answer it output was this but it didn't stop there it also provided an explanation and a way to format it so for a simple question like this i found chachi bt to be a clear winner in terms of speed and usability we didn't have to wait hours to get an answer that either called us stupid or mentioned that our question is a duplicate although it is important to specify that chachibiti can confidently give you wrong information that is true so i tend to follow up my chat gbt searches with a fast google search to make sure i'm on the right page and sometimes that leads me back to stack overflow but moving on to the company that owns stack overflow the company that owns stack overflow doesn't show any significant sign of decline from what i see here is the history of process for the past six months as of the 5th of april of 2023 displayed by the google search engine and for those of you who are not aware of what process is process is the company that acquired stack overflow back in 2021 i also read a few news articles regarding the launch of chachi pt and any correlation that might have with stack overflow potentially declining websites like tech cable have written about stack overflow declining since the release of chat gbt but i honestly don't know if this information is reliable considering it was in december that tech cable mentioned that the decline and a lot of people go on holiday usually in december my channel also saw a dramatic decrease after the launch of chachi bt but again the end of december and january are the worst months for many companies due to holidays and i personally don't see people using stack overflow as much while they're on holiday so i decided to try another website the metaverse post which made a bold statement in terms of stack overflows traffic plummeting as chachi bt launched this time we got a much more more radical numbers such as that stack overflow faced a 50 percent decline upon the release of chad gbt on the 30th of november i personally find this data very hard to understand and read and once again the decline also takes place during the biggest holiday season for most western countries so it really leaves me open to wondering if chachi bt really led to this massive decline or not personally i have no idea what the next step for stack overflow is going to be but i'm really curious to see whether they will continue to compete in the new market of ai i also had a nice chat with chachi bt about the future of stack overflow and chat gbt mostly had nice things to say aside from the toxic community and questionable answers that you might get from a community driven product but no matter how hard i try to lead it in the negative direction chachi pt only had optimistic things to say about stack overflow and i don't know if this is due to the internal politics of open ai or not i also asked it to give me financial advice based on whether i should invest in stack overflow chat gbt will always warn you that it cannot give you financial advice but if it was hypothetical it would tell me to invest in stack overflow to sum it up i still don't know what stack overflow is planning to do in this transition of ai assisted programming it's true that they still have a system that helps you get answers for more specific questions when it comes to code but i personally had to wait hours before getting any response for more complicated coding questions if i got a response and that highly depended on the good soul that was randomly roaming stack overflow on that day i didn't find any updates addressing the future of stack overflow at the moment but i will continue following the newsletter and i'm also very curious to hear what you think about the future of stack overflow let me know in the comment section down below but with all that being said as always thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next video
