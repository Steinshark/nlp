how repet use legal threats to kill my open-source project now here's the deal i don't even know what repet is okay i have no idea i've never heard of them i don't know anything about them say hi youtube tell me how you feel about youtube how's the youtube going how's my hair right now look how big this hair is why aren't you subscribed have you liked my newsletter look at my course i'm going to sell you hey have you bought my vitamins i'm taking off my short i'm actually have no idea where that just came from it just came out and i just felt it it just it just it was it was coming i just i just i just i did 10 years of just alex jonesing into a single distilled moment and it was fantastic uh anyways i think you should take it down and stop working on it i'll be engaging our lawyers on monday if it's still up by then we are a tiny company when you interned with us ooh this is okay so this is interesting this is interesting luckily we are bigger now and crucially have a lot of money to to pay top lawyers now if we're forced to go down that route ceo of repet in a mail to me oh that is just first off i mean the ceo sounds like a just a a bag filled with dicks when you say it that way okay it's literally just a bag filled with them like you just tossed it in yikes um second off threatening an intern on an open source project like that's real that's real weak gross i have received an official response from repet and my open source project will be back up soon please see the bottom of the blog post for an update the rest of the content will remain as a historical artifact well we're going deep on this historical artifact because this is crazy okay this is wild hi my name is ridon i graduated college last year and now work as a software engineer at devop or in devop infrastructure in my free time i also m maintain a number of open source projects while i was in college i intered at a startup called repet uh this blog post is the story of how repet is using legal threats and their venture capital funding to bully me into shutting down an open source project they don't like all right so what is repet i don't know what repet is all right small ppc that's that's that's small dick energy okay that's not that asmin big dick energy that is clearly small pp energy okay that's like a p tag level energy that's not even a div tag it's p tag it's like the smallest of all tags just the tiniest tag um repet makes uh a web app you can uh use to run code online and different programming languages sometimes i'm shocked that things make money that's a real company that's a real company right now a company that i paid for it you paid for it why would you pay for it i got to hear this why why why does someone pay for repet can some can can you help me on that one why why why do you pay for it repet is a very good product okay so people like repet okay okay okay okay they don't make money lol remote interviewing okay that's fair that is actually really really fair i think remote interviewing is a great a great use of any of these kind of especially if it's like a collaborate co-editing experience totally reasonable all my homies hate repet okay okay kind of like uh coat i get it it's a nice environment to set up with uh set up st standpoint and collaboration okay typically uh typically whenever i do this kind of stuff i just use ssh and vim like a real developer if you want to co if you want to like if you want to interview with me you better get the hell on a shared ssh instance and if you don't kn know t-u get the hell out of here you don't know t-u get out you don't you don't know what you're what are you a developer what are you script kitty you script kitty i don't think so repet makes running makes a web app to run code in different programming language this is nothing new just google run python online for proof so repet value proposition is extra features like sharing your work installing thirdparty packages and hosting web apps uh i work for repet in summer 2019 where i asked where i was asked to rebuild reet's package man management stack and make it open source okay that's quite that i mean that's a hell of a project for an intern uh if you like reading about tech stuff read all this stuff i took a job elsewhere in summer 2020 but still chatted with them occasionally by email when they reached out to tell me something cool repet had developed what was my open source pro project ru fast online playground for every programming language okay so i can i can i think i understand a bit more why repet maybe felt there was some there there was some conflict of interest i don't i don't think unless if you sign something that you can never like there's like a x year window that they have any rights to sue you but i mean this like if i were to leave netflix tomorrow and then start schmeck flix fast online net not netflix i started conflix you know you could you could see you could see some problems right prime berry if i started primberry you know there's a problem you're leaving netflix come to twitch winky uh send me send me an invite uh the the aspect of repet that i really enjoyed was how it was let's see how it supported lots of different programming languages i wrote another blog post for repet about how they do that this got me that got me thinking how many programming language could you possibly cram into a single website to explore that question i put uh together my own little web app that could run code online after about a day i had something that worked if you're wondering why it was so fast it turns out that you only need 30 lines of code to let people run python in a web app okay okay okay okay okay okay um these are the real questions you know scientists were too bisy busy asking how many languages can we cram into a web app instead of asking themselves will my previous employer attempt to sue my ass for this open source project this may be why there are so many websites for running python online uh after it was working i started adding as many different programming languages as i could as you can see from the excerpt from my project history i got a little ov excited all the languages all languages 17 working now you can run many languages you can run python more languages more more uh anyways i eventually ended up with 216 languages including all 38 from repet 100 languages from uh y yuku endo quin relay uh and a good deal more besides you might ask why did i spend so much time adding obscure programming languages to a web app nobody was going to use well let me put put it this way it is the weirdest 2020 hobby you've seen is it the weirdest 2020 hobbit absolutely it is the weirdest 2020 hobbit a hobbit hobbit a hobbit it's also a hobbit living probably in a mountainside not like a it's not like a dirty basement that he was living in it had lots of sunlight um it was clean and nice it wasn't like a you know a goblin he wasn't being a bas basement goblin all right one day i got an email from repet letting me know about the new feature they released i figured this was a good time to share my open source project with them in case they wanted to take inspiration from my work finally python c package cash hey awesome glad you eventually worked out a good way to do the 8020 uh uh way to go or oh gosh reading dyslexia is happening i didn't sleep well last night so you know what's happening right now my weirdest 2020 habit was watching the prim eng guy okay that's a good habit i actually had a fun let's see i okay i actually have a fun project of my own related uh on a related note reu codes don't worry i have no intention of trying to build out a platform with users as etc etc like you're doing with repet uh but it's been fun to learn about the infrastructure trade-offs of scaling a platform like this uh to hundreds of different languages rather than just 50 or so just hashtag quotes it what an intern take right there and on as small a budget as possible in case there's anything interesting you want to take inspiration from uh the code is at this place right here best okay just gives the code literally gives the code shits on them a little bit and calls it a day right i mean like that you could this is obvious intentions right here the guy got a little excited about a side project at first i got positive response but then 30 minutes later out of nowhere repet accused me of unethical behavior and stealing design oh cool yeah there's a few of those uh like tio repet is shipping support for infinite languages soon users can run anything and everything including different versions of the same language your design is eerily similar though does replit version had the same run button placement too we're a lot bigger now if you're interested in coming back we've hired senior engineers in man managers see our blog post from the latest week okay so that's at 3:15 3:43 so i mean less 27 28 minutes later took a deeper look and this does feel like a clone even down to the language description and the execution modes and the ui design we have a lot of copycat so i don't really worry about that it but this feels weird and unethical since you worked for us and now you are copying internal design decisions even bad ones [applause] let's go let's go not only is the guy i mean we let tim cook right here okay he's obviously going a little nuts but on top of it dunking on his own internal private designs that is so good repet no wrecked it yes oh oh the man overcooked he overcooked oh my goodness this is too funny this is too funny because now this has to be publicly stated as well which means that the people who worked on the designs are feeling kind of shitty right like look at this you're coping internal designs even the bad ones what this is how you were going to ship a website what is this made with htm x like what is this this is this is clearly not a fantastic website it also does that one thing where you know how you're looking at a big grid it also shows a bunch of gray dots everywhere my eyes get all like messed up this is a mad a modern react this is server components baby all right now none of these ideas i used in my open source project were internal design decisions they've all been published publicly on rep's blog i knew this because i'd been asked to write some of those blog posts during my internship and my project also wasn't any more of repet clone than any other website on the first few pages of of google results for run python online most of which looked exactly the same yeah i mean this is it shocking is any of this shocking flashbang coming here we go but i figur that i had missed something uh so i asked for details could you be more specific about what you feel is problematic about aru uh it's not my intent to steal any ideas and i don't believe i've done so let me go through the point oh by the way this you've already this you know you can tell this is okay this was intern mistake right here this is like partially admitting fault that maybe you did steal them it just wasn't your intent to do so this is just negligence stealing you should be like i did not steal any that's it okay just like a little little uh little little bit of advice on the internet if somebody says something about you and also involves a lawyer don't respond back and just say no uh no i no don't be a fool talk to a lawyer instead because this is just like how you get yourself in uh you can get yourself in some hot water saying those kind of things um the rest of this email is basically me repeating the previous paragraph of this article but with a lot more technical details you can read the whole email on imager oh nice and mirrored on the internet archive nice unfortunately repet refused to provide any specifics on what they were saying i had done wrong reiterating their previous statements and threatening me with the lawsuit okay this is this is insane we should not we should not have let tim cook we should not have let tim cook i we thought we should have now look at us i've seen a lot of blackbox clones throughout the years and they've arrived at radically different patterns gez it's almost like this person inter at one point and got a lot of ideas from you a lot of the design decisions you're coping are path dependent and what seems obvious is uh is only in hindsight after viewing company secrets in ip this is pr pretty this is a pretty clear this is pretty clearly a white box clone i haven't heard the term white box in a long time okay okay it is unethical and would obviously uh it would be obviously so to outside observers as well feel free to consult your mentors or people with more experience than than you in in the industry no no he means white box so there's blackbox and white box testing blackbox testing means you only test like the outsides right it's meant to be uh on the airplane there's the black box right i think technically it's orange but a black box means that you have no idea what goes into it everything goes into it and it just tries to hold all the details whereas a white box means that you're able to go in and uh see all the internal details right so you know everything about it so there is like a uh there is something there by the way this is hilarious feel free to consult your mentors or people with more experience than you in the industry to understand that this is obviously unethical okay i've thought about it a bit and it pains me that i have to do this but i think uh uh you should take it down and stop working on it i'll be engaging our lawyers on monday if it's still up by then let's go and then to put a cherry on top repet sent me another email reminding me that they just raised $20 million from their investors last month i do actually want to see this i really do want to see that email because nothing says small pp uh okay no no i nothing says small pp energy than an email like that uh and they weren't afraid to use it against me the me in question being one of their previous interns who just graduated from college a year ago who isn't running any kind of commercial operation whatsoever in addition to being unethical it is also pretty lame and obvious to see commits like this uh repple it superiority yeah okay that's that that sucks that that sucks right there obviously the name yeah oh we were a tiny company when you interned with us and we went out of our way to treat you incredibly well despite being uh the most demanding intern we've ever had hat oh my goodness like dude classic classic like it's like the classic most small pp energy kind of thing you can do like this is true pag energy right here which is like not only are you doing that you're also like just just bringing up insults that have no bearing in the conversation right like you know right now that guy lost it right this is an emotional reaction he th this is nothing right like if anything the only takeaway i have is that even let's just say he's right let's just say that aru was completely stolen from repet it was unethical and it wasn't good right i can understand where he's coming from right especially with all you know the guy was an intern and now he's building something that's like a clone and then he has commits like this and he feels a little upset okay i get it i'm i i hear you i hear you uh but at the end of of the day if i were an investor in this company and i saw this i'd be like hey man you should have handled this way different like as somebody sitting on your board or put money into your company when the hell did you lose your [ __ ] so easily right this is this is crazy um anyways as a p myself i regard this behavior as uh as uh as jsx uh fragment tag energy it is this is some serious fragment tag energy right here i mean we're getting we're getting tiny luckily we're bigger now and crucially have a lot more money to pay top lawyers now if we're forced to go that route i'd like to point out two things about this email the remark about commits like this this is actually misleading there's only one commit in my project that mentions repet and it's the one i already showed you earlier from my third day of coding when i just added 38 languages that uh repet supported before moving on to another 178 other languages i wanted to add it doesn't matter i mean this is just like again who you trying to convince people who are super technical or if you had to explain this to a lawyer right who you trying to convince it's just always probably i mean i would have made the exact same mistake honestly i would have made the identical mistake so do i feel bad about this no i just just know that whenever you do those kind of things if at some point you get legalized sucks you know what i mean the remark about me being demanding turn i'm not actually sure what this is meant to imply especially since repet had just tried to recruit me earlier that day see the screenshot on their first email but i'll leave it alone because it's not really relevant to the issue at hand owned wrecked put it on the shelf right he's absolutely right he did get literally offered a job uh naturally i i took down my project right away and gave it some time uh to for feelings to cool and sent repet and an apology i figured something might have been lost over email so i asked to get on the call good move you know what this in he impresses me more and more this raidon fellow like that's a really good move uh other than you should probably never talk to somebody that says they're going to sue you uh because anything you say careful could be used against you in a court of lie okay we've all heard we've all heard this okay careful but this is great this is great communication i love this um i apologize for anything wrong i may have caused you or repet by my actions i hope it's clear that i had no uh only good intentions again don't admit fault never admit fault when i whenever i get canceled on the internet people will be like you are a dick i'm like i know dick refuse it refuse to take the dick i hae it uh let's see i was entirely unaware of anything problematic about reu otherwise i certainly wouldn't have sent you a link for the to the project as a further gesture of goodwill i took the repository uh immediately upon let's see i took down the repository immediately upon receiving your complaint however i'd like to get our relationship back on good terms and talk through the issue uh would you be able able to get on a video call this weekend this is such a good response i absolutely love this every last person here needs to take note of this notice that raidon in this article has been wronged a lot of things i would say had not gone his way he responded instead of he was insulted he was threatened with lawyers and several times really kind of disrespected and instead responded with this really kind of clear thing like hey i listened to you i would like to fix things we should talk through this not via text like this guy is a champion absolutely love it if there's one thing to take away from this article it's just like the importance of focusing on how you communicate and even when people have the smallest of small p tag energy you still don't respond back in kind people that respond in kind it just doesn't look good for you either right and it doesn't make the situation any better this on the other hand is fantastic because then later on when you write a blog post like this you absolutely look like a champion like look at this guy anyways unfortunately repet ignored this email so i sent another one another one following up this one got a response but not the one i was hoping for thanks but there's no need for a call as long as you've taken down the project i have no problem with you i accept your apology and wish you all the best thanks week weak sauce energy weak sauce energy uh just in case repa didn't understand that i wasn't okay with this situation i sent three follow-up emails explaining as such over the next few weeks all of which were ignored in other words okay so may okay maybe now we're looking like the desperate x okay maybe his okay we got some things we could maybe pull back on in other words repet stands by its threats if i republish my open source project then they will sue me with top lawyers is repet right repet claimed my open source project was a clone of repet based on their trade secrets internal designs unethical to build let's examine this claim part by by part in developing my project was i making a a clone of repet in developing my project did i make use of any trade secrets of repet was it unethical for me to develop an open source project that is similar to replit after working for them questions one and two have a fair number of technical details and i put them in a separate post okay awesome tdr my project isn't any more similar to repet than 15 other commercial ones you can find on google by searching run python online yeah okay i think that's actually a really fair argument honestly i think this is a really fair argument uh let's see every sim similarity between my project and repet can be explained by looking only at github repositories in blog posts that were published online by repet itself making them obviously not any kind of secret i like that that's a good way to put it i could buy that too now let's address question three was it unethical for me to develop an open source project that is similar to repet after working in them in my opinion the answer to this question is no for a number of reasons i'm not sure how i feel right i i don't know how i feel i don't know if it is or isn't unethical i'd have to really think about that like the thing i see that's unethical about it uh is that you worked for the company i think that if you didn't work for the company and only used it yeah there's no non-compete of course there's not but but ethical versus legal are two very different questions okay there's very very different questions between ethical and legal right like right now you can like any any dude can cheat on his girlfriend and it's unethical but there's not like some moral there's not some legal quandry that you're going to get into in a non-contractual relationship you know what i mean so it's like there's no legal requirements there and therefore unethical and legal are very very different questions and so is it unethical i mean i i can see the argument yeah i'm curious i'm curious let's let's do a poll because it is actually very curious if uh what everyone thinks on this one i i mean i can side with both sides on this one so i don't have a strong opinion because i'm also not even sure i'm trying to think of what is the ethic in question do you know what i mean you know what i mean if is it unethical for a netflix employee to le uh to leave and go rebuild the youtube's video player um it's interesting i don't no uh is it unethical it's like did you work you worked on the adaptive streaming engine and then you left and went and work at youtube on the adaptive streaming engine is that tech experience getting hired and better pay i would say it's probably that i don't know i i honestly i don't have a strong opinion either way on this one this is what i feel like i'm opinionist on this one uh yes no i actually have uh i don't know i don't i i don't think it's unethical i'm gonna i'm gonna land on the side of unethical or on not or i'm g to land on the side as it's ethical that's kind of where i'm at right now as long as you didn't uh you're not using anything patented never look at patents never as a software engineer never look at patents this is the single most important advice i will ever tell you never ever for any reason look at patents if you are a software engineer if you are even known to look at patents if you even have history of looking at patents and you happen by accident to even see the title or any mentioned detail of any competitor on software engineering design patents and your company is doing that you they actually have the right to sue you for patent infringement it's like real talk as a software engineer never ever for any reason ever open up patents ever it is incredibly dangerous it is wild that that can even happen but but people will and they do and companies are pieces of crap sometimes also software patents are insane just saying there are many ex uh fang employees who leave and create a replica of the one products yeah exactly see that's exactly this is why i'm saying i don't know i don't think it's unethical for that exact reason it's the exact same thing um it's the exact same thing with the person saying okay you worked at netflix with on the adaptive streaming engine and now you're going to go to youtube to work on their adap aptive streaming engine therefore is that ethical or not ethical i don't think there's any ethic there right i i don't it's it's a competitive market and you're using your experience to drive innovation is that i don't i don't i don't know just don't bring it with you yet just don't bring your years of experience of trying to do uh like adaptive streaming the thing is is you by nature bring all of your experience that's why they're hiring you is the fact that you're experienced building something they want help on right like that's that's why people hire senior ui engineers because you've built uis before like this is a real thing this is this not how would you ever how would any senior ever exist unless if they stayed at one company to like forever my last job was a big uh was big on filing patents the lawyers were finishing uh up one when i quit and two years uh they emailed me frequently for signatures they wanted i was like i don't want to read through it again and you never uh and you never fixed the nonsense in the dock yeah yeah that's that's that's dude that stuff is wild software patents i'm really like i don't is the adaptive engine patented i have no idea you know why because i'm never going to look at a patent i will never look at a software patent i've never looked up one i'm never going to look up one i'm going to be completely ignorant because i'm going to build stuff only in my head right that i have yeah just don't bring the code yeah if you bring the actual code with you that's obviously unethical i think everybody here agrees that if you copy and posted your current company's code and then started an open source one hands down obviously that's just theft that's unethical absolutely but if you retyped up all the [ __ ] from memory it's going to be different it's going to be your take on it and how i i don't think that's on i i don't i just i i'm not convinced because that's experience yeah most people agree that it's it's not ethical or that it's ethical or that it's not unethical there's probably a difference because there's probably like unethical ethical and then some middle ground where you're like well you know it's like it's not unethical but i wouldn't say that's like a triumph of uh you know being ethical all right anyways hold let me get back to this let's let's get this done i do i do find this to be a very fascinating topic though because it is like it's very very gray if you follow the same design uh it is considering unethical in law yeah but how would you not follow some similar designs building something similar right like let's just go back to the adaptive streaming engine right because that's a very simple topic to understand that's extremely complex adaptive streaming obviously means we look at how fast we're able to download video and we adjust according the quality and the bit rate and other things as they come down so it's like how would you also build one that's not of similar design philosophies right hey what's up mustache hey baby hey new time chatter you know what i mean be right back in a p patent quick quick sort yeah uh reu wasn't built uh by a competitor let's see all right let's look at these um reu is entirely non-commercial i don't think that i don't think that that has any question into the ethicality of it all right i'm not interested in running a business whether or not you're trying to make money i don't think changes anything about whether something is ethical or not ru wasn't stealing customers from repet uh based on my analytic data there was 38 visits to reu during okay again this is also so i think again this has absolutely nothing to do with whether something was ethical or not again cu that like if all the sudden reu had from 38 to 38 million visits does that become unethical then right like how many visits make it unethical it's kind of uh it's kind of silly that that that would you know he is setting himself up for failure yeah these two are just like non reasons to to claim about uh ru wasn't built as a competitor to repet either since the architecture was limited to running on a single server anyone could bring down the entire ecosystem by just typing a fork bomb again again that's not a that's not a cult ethicalness uh let's see repet core value proposition isn't uh uh isn't letting you run code online you can do this in a dozen other places for free it's the features they offer on top of running code reu reu categorically lacked all of these features including having user accounts saving your work sharing your work publishing web apps persistent workspace is discussion forms uh github integration all those buildable but i think this is a better argument for for the ethicalness is that obviously we're not copying here uh we're trying to build a different product that's just onedimensional but again at in three days you could add a lot of these features uh at least this is better for the ethical argument uh we're building a different we're in a different vertical if you will um i had no bad intentions does ethic ethicalness does not involve in itions it just doesn't right if i cheat on my wife without intentions to hurt her i got too drunk in head a uh a drink and a wink you know one too many drinks in a wink and i ruined my life does that mean my intentions oh but intentions he didn't mean to hurt her yeah guess what it's still unethical yes it does it does not the only thing it does your premeditation on an act only increases how much trouble you can get in right intentions are a moral argument which we do punish more for moral quandaries right so if you pre-think about murdering somebody and then you murder them we literally call it i believe in uh in in law um uh forethought of malice i believe is the direct legal term that is because you've pre-thought about it and that makes the crime worse but it doesn't necessarily mean that it doesn't change the ethicalness of it whether you accidentally kill somebody or kill them killing somebody is still wrong right like if you got really hot and really angry and you shot somebody that doesn't somehow make it less ethical than thinking about it beforehand right it's still the wrong has already been done now it's like how much punishment do you deserve well punishment and and then the moral of it is different uh yeah legal legal is just a different situation manslaughter both are crimes yeah and you know if it's accident you're driving and and a duck crosses the road and you turn to the side and you accidentally kill somebody that's a a very different question right was that ethical or non-ethical i don't even think that is in the question i think you're stupid for swerving for a duck you're stupid for swerving for a small animal and potentially killing someone like that's dumb uh but it's it the ethics of it is way different all right reu was never intended to be a product again these are not none none of this absolves him of ethics right these are all the same argument saying well it's not the same solution band cars leave the ducks out of this uh i'm not a business person i'm just an open source dev who likes to build with things for fun i love that uh if you doubt my track record of building things that don't make money just check out this again that's none of us is we're not arguing that a note of conspicious absence of anything that's ever made a scent of revenue hey same here baby you should see you should you should see my project graveyard uh i would never try to steal someone's business after i worked for them hurting repet was not my intent uh in working at reu and accusing and accuse me otherwise especially without asking a single clarifying question and refusing all offers to have discussion shows a great deal of bad faith on the part of repent i agree with that great statement great statement right there uh if you'd like to decide for yourself who's in the right i'd be happy to put all the evidence uh in the open except for the code because repet standing by its promise uh to sue me if i do again uh a separate blog post okay with all the technical details you can also read all my communications between then and replit for a full and bridge yep we already already did that why would repet do this um encouraging open source development let's see repet states its ideals o i love this encouraging open source development yes love when companies state what they think is great and then what they do is the not the same i love that i look i love that it's my favorite the enron right and enron is the best right their theirs was like ethics is like their number one thing and then they totally do the opposite now this is unethical this is this is both morally this is a moral depraved behavior stating you like something but really do you uh giving back to the community we are uh migrating to bl of blah to do part of improving the ecosystem for developers everywhere giving back to the community the core uh of our language agnostic package management is now open source on github making it easy to share and remix your uh creations uh he advises others to fork and remix too okay interesting um this one kind of a little bit i mean making your creations on on repet you know little bit of context there um however uh repet action in this case reveals hypocrisy they say they encourage open source development but when my open source project offended them they shut it down with extreme prejudice love that phrase by the way if i could ever use the term extreme prejudice in anything i'm doing i would just i would just i just want to do that okay that's what i want to do i want to be that whatever that is that's what i wanted to be to describe me okay they claimed to be giving back to the community through their open source and blog post but when i tried to use those ideas in a community project they threatened asse me they say that they make it easy to share and remix your career creations but when i tried to remix repet itself it became a persona n yeah again again okay so we keep seeing people saying intentions do absolutely matter okay let's just put it this way if you think it's wrong if someone takes all the ideas and understanding they've learned from a company start a startup that directly competes with that company and then attempts uh attempts to make that into something right and their goal is like i'm absolutely going to do it or somebody takes the ideas that they understand from the company and out of the benevolence of their own heart does an open source project that everyone can learn from they're if you think one's unethical the other is also equally unethical because the problem isn't the outcome it's the act that makes it unethical now the legal is whether or not those things are illegal both of those are legally the same yeah they're legally literally the same that's what we're talking about it's the ethics of the situation did did the intention somehow make it nice oh you were nice when you did it therefore it's not bad it's just like yeah we're not saying that uh all right in repats email to me their threats were based on the fact that i had worked for them in the past yeah i mean this is the sole question right this is the qu this is the point of the question however i believe this reasoning is a smoke screen to see why let's take a look at some of the tweets that uh repet ceo uh posted after threatening me yc should have ruled not to fund copycats especially if the original company was rejected did replic get rejected from yc and his little salty is that what we're seeing right now are we seeing a little bit of salt always need a little bit of salty salt uh all right competition or inspiration does not equal copycats a defining feature of copycats is that they copy incidental things like the name or unrelated details which seem to be the case here i don't actually agree with that right like who here has recently used uh uh what is it hbo max looks just like netflix i mean it's literally a copycat it's i it's hard to call it inspiration they were aspired down to like literally the exact same layout with the exact same everything so it's like yeah that run button placement i know and so it's just like okay yeah twitch and kick yeah twitch and kick literally twitch and kick are identical their copycats i don't think you can really say this but i would say that twitch and kick are vastly different as well there it's a bit more unhinged on kick i'm gonna try to be nice here bit more un it's for the unhinged crowd again kick $2 million for two years i'm coming over okay i'm ready to be unhinged okay you you send me $2 million and a bunch of fireworks and we're going to make something happen okay we're going to make something happen i guarantee you also maybe a little bit of jack daniels if we're doing the the whole fireworks thing and maybe just maybe a go-kart i think if you gave me all of those we could make something amazing all right we're going to get hded on the un nature uh later deleted these tweets because they proved controversial deleting the previous tweets because people told me there's more to the story and i stand by what i said about copycats in general i wish to live in a world where genuine innovation is prized and pure copying is ridiculed kona and the team seem to be doing god's work okay uh and these tweets uh is it amjad is that how you say his name amjad points out that uh athens research was clearly inspired to uh by another company and argues that they should therefore be ridiculed and banned from receiving funding furthermore he says i stand by what i say about copycats in general and he disdains all people that he thinks are copying existing ones not just specific companies in his tweet there is a clear re uh resemblance between uh amjad's comments on athens research and his legal threats toward my own project uh he even used the exact same word copycat uh in both i feel like i mean i see where is going with this but at this point i i feel like we've already we've got the point you've delivered the blow uh you know what i mean uh but in this case since i have worked for a repet before amjed uh had an excuse to throw accusations my way accusations that if you're unfamiliar with the facts sound like they could be legitimate again that's because they have the a bigger source of legitimacy like anytime that happens that's a claim to think about minimally right uh just you know just throwing that out there uh i'd also like to reiterate that the uh person repet is threatening with top lawyers and a lot of money is a new grad with no company no funding and no commercial ambitions if someone with actual commercial enterprise were to offend repet i shudder to think what treatment they might receive all right how did repet respond to this blog post oh i'm very excited about this after i posted this article in the morning it was discussed extensively on hacker news around 500 p.m. amjed uh posted an apology on hacker news hey everyone i wanted to apologize for the inappropriate use of power here while i do believe there is an ethical line that was crossed here i should have called him to understand his viewpoint or yes there you go you know i i love when people say sorry in the past it's so good it's my favorite my favorite it's my favorite like oh damn i've been caught you caught me all right i'm sorry which is what i'll try to do now and see if we can get back this project back up again sorry i'm sorry raidon uh the lesson for me here is to internalize how i no long let's see i'm no longer the struggling kid from jordan uh fighting for more than a decade to build something and that i now have the resp responsibility towards our community and supporters to be kind and model better behavior i'm sorry i let you down and i promise to do better in the future do better hashtag silicon valley i love that phrase do better because it is the ultimate silicon valley thing it is the ultimate silicon valley and there's definitely yeah he is claiming that his past i mean everyone claims their past experience dictates their current positions and all that but i feel like at some point you got to know better and some people i mean real talk if he changes and he actually becomes better because of this incident you know who here just hate just to be real i have to learn by making mistakes okay i learn by making mistakes and so my mistakes luckily haven't been nearly as public as this and so just to give him the the positive if he turns and learns and becomes a better person and actually does use his power to do good things that's a win that's a w okay that's a w but i still think the situation is completely [ __ ] up right we can hold two things in our head at the same time that are very contrary right uh spoiler alert he doesn't oh no he also reached out to schedule a call naturally i agreed to do hey raidon i'm sorry that i excessive use of power yep okay okay hey uh amjed thanks for reaching out it means a lot to me i'd happy to get on a phone call would you be mind sending me your number redacted redacted uh you know what i mean repet seems kind of dumb anyways uh yeah i mean i think this probably hurt their business honestly this will be the downfall business if there is one uh other than their business model i'm not really sure why you i think it's a hard market to compete in i'm not really sure what you're buying uh unless if you're fully going for interview stuff you know just to like build a cool project yeah use an editor right why would you ever use an online code running tool when you just use an editor right that stores code online in a set of very consistent states that everybody's familiar with right uh anyways during the call uh i'm apologized for making legal threats but reiterated that he felt that i made a clone of repet and that i uh acted unethically eventually we agreed to disagree and he promised in writing that he was fine with me putting my project backed up hey r thanks for taking my call and as i discussed i'm wrong here for threatening legal action while i still think that to let's see that the totality of the design decisions were a clear privileged copy i don't think it's warranted uh my reaction i'm sorry for that and i give you permission to publish a re you uh before we hung up you said i will not be coping more stuff man stop saying [ __ ] like what are you doing what are dude take the w and while i'm not going to hold uh you to that i'd appreciate that please arrive at new ways of doing things make new mistakes i will not be copying more things lawyered okay dude all right thanks for the response and let's see as you requested during the call i'll add a update to my blog post accordly there is one thing i'd like to be clear about which is that you emailed your quoting me a bit out of context okay okay man all right'0 okay we're at of'0 people we've been'0 and uh not thinking about how my words would sound when taken by themselves i didn't record this phone call so there's really no way for me to prove this but in that part of the conversation we were specifically talking about your recent blog post about package management using nyx oh nice move uh nx by the way by the way it's nix you know nick mentioned let's go uh what i was saying was that i wasn't intending to copy your recent posted idea to install packages using nyx i wasn't saying that i agreed with you about copying other things we can still agree to disagree about that in any case thank you again for reaching out to get this resolved in retrospect i'm a little disappointed at amjad y uh didn't apologize for or mentioning public uh public doubling down on his decision to threaten me and didn't post an update to that thread after the phone call didn't apologize or mentioned publicly retweeting an accusation that i literally stole and published ip although he did at least delete that tweet didn't apologize for or mention uh making a nebulous personal attack in writing that i was a demanding intern right after that try right after trying to hire me said in the phone call right after apologizing that he felt uh as if i had invited me into his house and uh i had betrayed his trust i i actually understand that again i feel like there's i feel like we do have a little bit rate on i feel like you do need to just try to think about things from your perspective and stop thinking just because you have no commercial intent you are just a curious individual that that you also bear absolutely no potential like hurt feelings on the other side now you may think you're right and you may think that you acted ethically that's fine but you got to minimally understand the opposite side of the argument which is how would you feel if someone took what you did and you were trying to make a company and you trying to become you know make a life for yourself and then someone did this to you how would you feel you got to be able to do you got to be able to play both sides here uh still refused to list any specific part of replate he thought i had copied even when i asked him for such details multiple times during the phone call despite has continuing to claim both privately and publicly that i copied repet unethically misquoted me in uh making uh in writing to make me look like i agreed with his accusations right after reaching out to apologize for his behavior all in all i think this have gone better nonetheless i'm happy that we were able to get the situation worked out amicably and i look forward to moving on with my life including putting reu back up and after i can get things compiled again peace it's up you can yeah you can validate someone's feelings and experiences while disagreeing with them i agree hey thanks for the hype train by the way this is a very complicated article um wow this is very very difficult i think what this goes to show is uh i don't know uh i don't 100% believe the author i feel like he's putting himself into a better light and hiding a lot of details they wouldn't go to this link just to threaten an intern i don't you know i i don't know if that's true so i i'm just going to go with i'm i'm actually because i have i have no dog in this fight real talk i have no dog um i can understand we're both parties feel wrong about it um what are you going to do honestly what are you going to do in this situation right i think that the ceo kind of sucked i think some of the things this guy did kind of sucked they both need to take a moment he should have kept it private uh i'm not sure if he should have kept it private i'm happy that he kind of did that um someone fork bombed him that's all you know i'm not happy where either of these went but i'm happy that uh at the end of the day we get to understand more about repet which is a company that people may be paying money to and maybe you know maybe you can think more about what you like and how you like to support things uh i'm not sure if i really like any of this guy's response so like for me it's just more of like i'm happy i know these things what am i going to do with this information in life i have no idea and the name i'm not a lawyer agent don't take my advice as legal advice okay you should talk to a lawyer if you want to know anything at any point okay second off i'm looking for a sponsorship repet i could become the name of the repet a genen imagine what that would be only $2 million for two years same offer to kick okay just in case anyone's wondering a jen
