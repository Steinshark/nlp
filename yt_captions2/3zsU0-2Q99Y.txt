welcome to my new series called talk 
tech with tiff where i am sitting down   with industry professionals to hear about 
their career journeys and current roles i   created this series to hear from people 
who are established in the tech industry   so that we can all learn what these individuals 
do in their day-to-day jobs and the type of   opportunities that are out there okay let's get 
started today i am sitting down with serena who   is a product manager at zoomer media hi serena hey 
tiff how's it going it's going good how are you   good yeah thank you thanks for being here today 
thanks for having me i'm really excited i'm so   excited i was reading a bit about your background 
and your journey to product management and it's   so interesting because it's not necessarily 
a straight path which i think is pretty cool   so i'd be interested to hear more about your 
current role as a product manager yeah um so right   now i'm working for a canadian media agency um 
we basically do things everything from television   to radio print magazines events um things like 
that so i work on the digital team there and we   manage about 30 30 or so websites and apps um and 
yeah so for me i'm more concerned with day-to-day   development operations so everything from you know 
sprint planning making tickets things like that to   you know dealing with clients designers everyone 
from everywhere in the business wow that's   really cool it's i for dealing or not dealing but 
interacting with my own product managers at work   i can say honestly i think product managers have 
one of the toughest jobs because there are so many   balls in the air at all times and you're wearing 
so many different hats yeah it's definitely true   but i think i find it pretty fun i think it would 
be boring to just be doing one thing every day so   yeah the chaos can be overwhelming sometimes but 
it's mostly just exciting yeah you gotta thrive in   the chaos exactly it's gotta ride the wave i like 
what happens that's awesome but i know you have   you actually haven't always had a path to product 
management or it wasn't just a straight path   you uh you went to school for international you 
have an international relations background right   yes yeah so tell me and i know you've 
been in uh a media background as well   and i know zoomer is obviously media as well but 
what was your path like to product management   now um yeah so i've always had an interest 
in you know the performing arts and film   and things like that so my whole life i kind of 
expected that that's the route i would take um   the decision to do international relations in 
university was honestly a random one i made when   i was 17. um i don't think i ever really planned 
to pursue it or or anything like that but uh   yeah after graduating i started working in film um 
and i did not like it as much as i thought i would   okay so yeah um i really did enjoy the 
creative aspect of it of course um but i   found the i found like the organizational 
habits of a lot of people in the industry   maybe just don't align with my personality so 
when the opportunity came up to work at zoomer   which is still you know media very creative yeah 
but in a tech role um yeah i jumped at it that's   really cool that's good and i know going back 
to you so casually said too which i think is   super interesting how international relations is 
what you have a background in but even when from   my understanding when you were even going through 
it you knew maybe you wouldn't be doing it after   i get asked a lot from people who went to school 
for something different than what they want to   pursue and it stresses a lot of people out 
but you're so casual about it you're like   yeah i went to school for this but during 
school i knew i wasn't going to use it so   how give me your experience or your advice as to 
how important is it to go to school for something   i mean okay i'm not talking about going to school 
to become a doctor or you know what i'm saying   here but to go to school for something and then 
switch into a different role or different industry   um i think it really depends on what you want 
to do so for example when i wanted to go into   the arts uh as long as i was pursuing that on the 
side for me i felt like that was fine yes like you   know you can manage your schedule so that you 
know you can do that main degree and then still   pursue your interests and passions on the side but 
yeah i don't know i think it definitely depends on   the person but i would say if you have an interest 
which is not aligned with what you're studying or   working on full-time just do it in whatever 
capacity you can and the experience i got   just doing stuff on the side was probably far 
greater than the experience i would have gotten um   if i'd studied production or something i mean 
i can't speak to that because i didn't but   yeah yeah exactly but real world experience 
versus you know sometimes just relying on   sitting in a classroom which is important but that 
real world experience is something that is i think   so valuable 100 yeah like you know talking 
to friends who did study i don't know acting   or production design and things like that 
obviously their experience is very technical   they're super knowledgeable but i mean for me 
to just be like i'm gonna go do a film i'll   catch up on my classes later yes it was great 
like i learned so much and you just learn it in   the moment you have to be reactive exactly exactly 
so essentially do side projects or do internships   and what you're passionate about or take on all 
those opportunities and even if it's not what   you're going to school for yeah absolutely i would 
say so i love that kind of going back more to   your current role as a product manager um 
i'm going to brag about you for a second here   i know you transitioned from a digital digital pro 
sorry digital products coordinator to a product   manager and i believe it was three months yes 
yeah that's amazing yeah that's really amazing   i i don't know about that but um yeah it was 
easier than i thought it would be because   i'm lucky that i had a really good team to back me 
up they were so willing to help me with everything   and i think the reason i got the opportunity is 
because they were short of product managers so   they were like hey i think you can figure this 
out do you want to just do it yeah yeah that's   really cool hey they could have hired from outside 
so the fact they you know that's still huge and   i know uh with com becoming a product manager 
it also comes with learning a lot of new tools   uh so kind of two questions here one is what 
are some tools that you use on a daily basis   and the other is what are some tips for someone 
who is considering or wanting to become a product   manager how do you quickly pick up new tools um 
so for your first question in terms of tools i   use every day you know jira is the main one we use 
at our company um they love like the whole google   suite so you know google docs spreadsheets excel 
like there's nothing i use that's super complex   um but that being said getting familiar with 
wordpress was one of the things i had to do   um learning about jenkins learning like what is 
vs code i really started from knowing absolutely   nothing so yeah i think learning new tools 
google's your best friend it is it really is   i think you've said that in so many of your videos 
but like you just have to google things you do   you really do so for you mentioned jenkins and 
vs code those are all really technical tools   so for i know it varies product manager to 
product manager but how technical would you   say your product manager role is um for me the job 
description is not very technical i don't actually   need to know a lot um but that being said knowing 
more makes your life a lot easier yeah you know   because you are working with developers at the end 
of the day so if you could speak their language   everybody's just going to have an easier time so 
that's so true yeah like i'm still learning like   i'm still so behind on like all the things i want 
to know and need to know but it's just a process   oh you know what listen i feel like i'm still so 
behind i feel like everyone in the tech industry   feels so behind right yeah it's changing every 
day and there's so much coming up but it's just   it's impossible pretty much yeah and it's 
just like i feel like for me anyways it's   embracing that just recognizing that hey i'm 
never gonna have it all figured out it's just   constantly learning exactly and once 
you become okay with that like it   takes the pressure off a little bit it does i know 
when i first started i would often think okay i   need to learn this today and know this tomorrow et 
cetera and the pressure it puts on someone is just   first of all it's impossible and second of 
all it's just it's the pressure too much   yeah like if you put that much pressure 
on yourself you're never going to do it   exactly it's like you know exactly i agree so 
going back to working closely with developers   what is some tips that you would have for other 
product managers or people looking to get into it   who might be a little nervous for that because 
a lot of developers or some developers anyways   just want to focus on the technical parts and 
not necessarily uh focus more so on the client   or the task the bigger picture when it comes 
to the client so how do you how do you find   communicating with developers and how do you what 
are some strategies you use to be successful um well at the end of the day they are just 
people yeah so if you can explain things   high level to clients the developers might 
find that a little more frustrating when you   don't know exactly what they're talking about 
when they get super technical but um i think   putting an onus on yourself to try to constantly 
learn and if you hear a new word and you're like i   have no idea what this is looking it up and and 
just trying your best to meet them at the same   level yeah is probably what i would do um but yeah 
i think definitely depends on the team depends on   the person depends on your personality it's hard 
to say it's true every team's so different every   product manager role every developer every role 
really depends on the team too how it how it's   kind of run yeah exactly for sure that's really 
cool okay i have another question for you around   getting into product management i get asked 
sometimes they are considering getting into   product management but they don't really know 
if it's for them and i know it varies person   to person but what are some skills or some of 
your favorite things about product management   that maybe someone can go hey i like that 
too maybe product management is for me   yeah um you have to like dealing with people um 
all kinds of people that's probably a big one   just being comfortable with that um organizational 
skills definitely help and like that can come from   anywhere yeah so you know like for me i've 
always been like that kid with a color-coded   agenda so for me that was that was very helpful 
to have but um in terms of getting into it there's   so many courses available online um like udemy 
linkedin even like where you can learn agile and   scrum and things like that so i found that very 
helpful personally but also there's um courses   like you can do a csm or a cspo course and i did 
one recently and it was so helpful like super   helpful even if it's things you think you know 
just terminology and theories yeah yeah yeah it's   so true i've heard i've heard really good things 
about the csm uh it's a certification right yes   yes yeah yeah i heard it's quite difficult 
um i did cspo which is um very similar but   the spo is for product owners rather than scrub 
masters okay um and i wouldn't say it's difficult   okay but it's taxing it's um typically done over 
two days and it's like a 16-hour crash course so   it's um grueling but you know they break it down 
for you and if you have any familiar familia   familiarity with any of the words already or terms 
then it's a lot better yeah that's really cool and   so we're talking a little bit about what you enjoy 
about it the organizational side what are some   things about it that are your least favorite 
or you dislike so the chaos is a blessing and   a curse for sure there's days where i'm all 
about it and like loving it but then there's   days where i'm like okay like this like nothing 
makes sense why is this happening you know but   but that's life um i would say managing deadlines 
is a really hard thing to do um planning and like   sprint planning especially in my organization 
because it's media so things change very fast   and there's a lot of creative decisions that 
change quite a lot yeah um you know planning   a sprint saying okay this is what we're going to 
be doing this sprint and then having someone be   like hi i need this up in two hours otherwise 
we're dead so just kind of balancing that is   something i find a bit frustrating sometimes but 
it's okay exactly and as and as the opposite side   of that as a developer i think it's been honed 
it's been pushed on me so much to be like tiff   from other developers never give your product 
manager timeline which i know you're gonna hate   from used to say so i'm sure you have to deal 
sometimes too with developers being like well   it'll be done soon but yeah no definitely but i'm 
really lucky my the devs on my team are so great   that i'm like okay somebody's breathing down my 
neck right now just between you and me what are   we looking at yeah exactly the more authentic 
and and candid conversations you can have with   other team members i feel like is is the way 
to go 100 like you know they're my team at the   end of the day so having that relationship with 
them that's just between us like it you know it   helps because they know that i'm looking out for 
them they're looking out for me and it just makes   everything a lot easier and a lot less stressful 
when you have someone you know is like actually on   your side oh like one thousand percent i remember 
having some product managers who it was a very uh   very work-related work work relationship i 
don't know how you would say it but it was very   they ask when they need something and that's 
kind of it and it can definitely make for not   the best communication whereas if you're working 
closely with someone especially a product manager   that you feel like really has your back and 
wants you to succeed as much as they want the   product to succeed and it just makes for such 
an overall better work environment and i think   better quality of work overall that's produced 
definitely i completely agree yeah for sure   that's really so for someone who is watching 
this and wants to get into product management   management but has no background in it prior what 
is some advice i know this is a very big question   but what is some advice or tips that you would 
give to them of where to start whether it be   networking or just finding different opportunities 
networking 110 i don't think i ever would have   found myself in this industry if it weren't for 
networking um like talk to anyone talk to everyone   the best piece of advice i have ever gotten 
like on an actual networking call was   after the call always ask the person that you're 
talking to is there anyone else in your network   who you might be willing to connect me with and 
like it changed my life because you go from like   you know cold reaching out to people on linkedin 
and maybe they'll respond to getting one person   having them connect you with three people and then 
three more people it's game changer for sure yeah   i've never heard that piece of advice before but 
i'm always going to do that now exactly and like   nine times out of ten they will connect you with 
someone it's like as long as they like you even   if they can't really help you or help you get a 
job but yeah people are people are cool that way   they are and i find especially too i mean i can 
only speak to fashion and tech but in the tech   industry that people are so i was very shocked of 
how willing people are strange complete strangers   that are willing to help you they're just excited 
to have you in the industry they want to share   their network like it's a very big community 
which is pretty cool yeah no it's great and   it's very welcoming which is so nice yeah yeah i 
think people from the outside looking in think oh   this is going to be it's hard to break in it's 
very intimidating there's this like wall up but   once you just start networking and putting 
yourself out there it's it's pretty friendly it's   true absolutely yeah i just gotta kind of take 
it in and like just do it exactly yeah what about   coming from a background that necessarily yes it 
was in media but not around uh product management   how do you make your resume stand out when you 
are applying for this job now i know networking is   the biggest tip to anything but what are some 
what's some advice you would give for people who   don't have a lot of experience 
for the role they are applying for   yeah um the main thing i would say is just 
because you have experience in a different field   or different industry does not mean that those 
skills you have won't apply to your new role so   whatever it was that you were doing before there's 
definitely going to be some commonalities and some   skills that you have that you can transfer over so 
definitely highlight those whatever that may be so   for me i guess coming from film production 
to product management was like organization   managing schedules and deadlines and things 
like that so that's a big one um and also just   like general resume tips just make sure it's not 
more than one page if you're early in your career   i have been roasted for having like a long 
resume so just don't do it yeah i've been   there too i hear you because you almost want 
to overcompensate yeah exactly but i feel like   leaving enough space in your resume that somebody 
actually wants to call you back and talk about it   is helpful and that's like one of the things 
that helped me because you want to make sure   that you're putting enough information down that 
they want to talk to you but you're not giving so   much that they're like well i don't need to speak 
to them i already know what i'm getting wow i like   that that's good leave them wanting more in a 
way exactly yeah always leave them wanting more   i love that last question i have for you is what 
is some advice in maybe one or two sentences that   you would give to your younger self oh i'm putting 
you on the spot yeah um chill out i love that like   actually relax stop trying to over plan do what 
you need to do to get to the next step but also   take opportunities as they come and just say yes 
yes i love all of that that's great serena thank   you so much for chatting with me today i feel like 
this has been so valuable and i've learned so much   from listening to you thank you thank you so 
much for having me this was really fun thank you
