we're here at cs2023 and this year lenovo is bringing weird like how weird oh well this is just like a normal laptop with an oled display it's fantastic looks great right what on one side they have a very normal oled display this is actually just a fantastic display to look at if it works uh oh there we go okay geez that was scary um build redux build redux makes it easy to configure your new build with support guides to help along the way they also offer competitive pricing as compared to building a pc yourself head to build redox.com linus and start your new build today but the big problem with oled displays is the amount of battery that they consume it's so bad that i just don't even want to know lead display on my laptop because well even though it looks fantastic your battery dies almost instantly well instead if you just want to do like word documents reading things or so on you can flip over to this e-ink display now uh it's not the best looking display i've ever seen it runs at a rapid 12 hertz yeah that's one two not like 120 but that's actually very fast for an e-ink display and also okay it is pretty funny that's uh you are not going to be playing cs go on this thing but for e-ink display this is so cool also as you've probably noticed it's color the ink slays are almost always only black and white but they have somehow managed to make this a color display so you can just go through your emails read something i actually like it well i think that's interesting is you can see the whole thing refresh itself so i just kind of do this for a little while there's going to be most trails over everything that flash there though resets the eating display so that you don't have mouse trails over everything this is very cool if you're not using the e-ink this is a very standard but very high-end laptop so the oled panel is 2880 by'00 so that's 16 by 10. this thing's 100 dci p3 and color calibrated from the factory and also for processor you get an i7 1365u now that's only two performance cores and eight efficiency at the same time it's this big and has 10 cores in it it's pretty hard to complain about that what i will complain about though is the i o you get a thunderbolt and a thunderbolt and in fairness to them you also get a headphone jack dell what the they did it on this they have an e-ink display and they still managed to fit a headphone jack on there fix your 13. come on there are several ways to use this mostly you know like this but then you can also just fold it down and it's basically just a book hello hello there we go it is super cool that you can just use it like this like a book and e-ink is fantastic for eye strain this is the sort of thing where you could actually read a novel and not just have a searing headache at the end like you would on a normal laptop but the weirdness is not over oh not even close up next is the thinkpad 16p gen 4 and this has much more weirdness now here we have an ir full hd camera that honestly is pretty good but if you look on the back here there's a bunch of pogo pins which means oh yeah there's a 4k webcam we can just attach it right here like that there we go and it just works it's not quite tuned yet the software isn't quite there so uh if you look andy which one of these do you think's the 4k one that one yeah i shouldn't have asked a cameraman this one is clearly a lot sharper but the iso is terrible the the way that they expose is not done yet at all everything here it looks interesting to say the least now i'm sure what you're thinking right now is if it's struggling for exposure that means we just need a little bit more light and earlier today an acer's booth we actually saw a combo uh pogo pin on off webcam like combo but lenovo instead you can get a second 16p attach it's a separate attachment so we can we can go like this now by very simply having two laptops at the same time you can have a light and a webcam simultaneously or you could just use the light in the full hd webcam that's also pretty good in addition they also have a 4g connectivity adapter thing on my laptop you have 5g and it goes in right here but instead anyway up next on our tour of interesting products that i'm not totally sure why it's here we have the x1 fold 16. so it as i'm sure you have guessed by the name it fools and it folds way better than the last one too apparently this is rated for 25 000 folds before you will see any problems and they've also fixed the problem where in the past you store the keyboard inside of the fold because they couldn't get it to go quite all the way now there's a couple problems with that the biggest is that you get dirt and grime all over your keyboard which then you put in the middle gets on your display scratches that up damages everything bad time now instead it just pulled all the way like this to create a really nice convenient and quite small package for something that has a 16 inch display then you can just take the keyboard and slap it on like that and you have the whole thing just ready to go it's actually pretty cool now there's many different ways that you can use the x1 fold so you can have it in landscape mode like so or you can flip her over use it in portrait mode or you can place it onto the table use it like this touch right there get your keyboard or if you don't like that keyboard you can attach this one and boom now you have a 12 inch laptop given what it is this keyboard is all right but it is kind of hard to use and a little bit small now there were quite a few sacrifices to get this to hold so uh the i o is pretty bad there's a thunderbolt there and another thunderbolt right there that's it i know what you're thinking though i don't want to screen that folds that's just way too anxiety inducing even if they say that it's going to last for 25 000 cycles what i want is two displaced yes the weird train keeps on going look at this this is the lenovo yoga book 9i and we have two oled displays look at that now through the magic of origami we can take the little folio for the keyboard move it like this and we have an absolute battle station on the go look at this thing i actually kind of love it so you can use it either like this with two displays or if you take five fingers and go where now it's one very large display the way that it interacts is actually really well thought through my favorite thing is probably let's say uh we want to look at the gaming laptop awards up here i want to send that as a note now i can circle that insert a note and now i have that just in my notes what i just circled right there i could see this being so useful for so many people i actually really appreciate that it's like snipping tool on steroids and snipping tool is my absolute favorite thing maybe instead though you don't want it in battle station mode you can have it in dual portrait mode i don't know you can very easily have let's say your notes over here and your script on this side you can type it all out and sure you don't have a trackpad but you have two screens but maybe you do want a track pack well we can take it move it like this take the keyboard off there and put it right on top like that and now this screen's a trackpad it actually all works shockingly well like it's all tuned in a way that i wasn't expecting it to be that like final production ready i guess this is final production right it is final production but normally these things feel like engineering lab stuff this one actually works really well you know of all the really weird stuff that we saw today this one's actually kind of interesting wait no there's a fatal flaw fatal flaw io we have two thunderbolt fours on this side thunderbolt four on that side but guess what there isn't no headphone jack i thought you did a good job what are you dell so let's talk about the x1 carbon for a second not a whole lot has changed but that's kind of a good thing because this is just a fantastic laptop you get actual i o so hdmi full size type a thunderbolt and another thunderbolt right behind it and around on the other side we have another type a and a headphone jack thank you for keeping that lenovo for this latest generation lenovo have upped the tdp of the x1 carbon by heaps it has gone from 20. all the way to 21. but in all seriousness though this is an excellent laptop it's 2.5 pounds it feels awesome i'm sure that this keyboard is excellent yeah easy a plus absolutely love it is it touch it's not touch that's too bad as expected this chassis is incredibly well built it is 100 magnesium and 90 of that magnesium is all recycled also you don't have to feel bad about getting a laptop because it comes in this bamboo and sugar cane package this right here you can just hucker in your garden she's going to biodegrade excellent thank you also if you want a laptop that folds in a way that makes sense we have the x1 carbon yoga again not much has changed but they really didn't need to because it's a fantastic laptop in all seriousness though lenovo thank you for not screwing up the x1 i feel like the motto over there might be just if it's not broke go to weird somewhere else good job speaking of not breaking things that work really well lenovo's legion laptops here we have the 7i ai and this right here gets basically just a spec bump but it's a pretty serious one at that in here they have friends and rtx 4090 with a 170 watt tgp also we got the intel core i9 13900 hx and the ram in this is the fastest i have seen in a laptop that you can remove this one overclocked gets 6 000 mega transfers per second on that ddr5 how the heck did they do that jadak doesn't want you going that fast but they managed to do it aside from that you get a 99 watt hour battery that will probably last you 1.5 hours they said it's eight but that's uh optimistic to say the least also there's the legion 5i which gets a slightly smaller battery and not quite the same tdp but at least it only starts at 1449 instead of the two thousand dollars for the seven dollar one very important thing though this is apparently and i quote the world's most powerful ai tuned gaming laptop lenovo was very proud of the ai stuff that they put in here as if gigabyte hasn't been doing it for what three four years something like that maybe theirs works better maybe it doesn't i don't know we'll need to get this in the lab to do a test zoho won if you run a business you know how hard it is to keep everything organized but zoho one is designed to help run your entire
