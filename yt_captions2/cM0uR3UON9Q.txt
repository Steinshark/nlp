ladies and gentlemen regardless of whatever activity that you participate in there is a highest title in most things it's called grand master now in chess grand master is actually the second highest title you can achieve the first is chess streamer of the year uh having secured that title i set my sights on the grand master title which that was a joke uh is the most prestigious title uh in chess now i'm an international master many of you know that some of you don't that's the second highest title in chess and i get this question a lot what is the difference between you and a grandmaster and it's one letter but it's a lot more than that and in this video i'm gonna share with you uh a bunch of games that show you my shortcomings as a chess player uh this video is extremely uh depressing for me and this is a moment for you to now laugh at me because i always laugh at you right i'm always the big dog like hey 600d well today i'm i'm just gonna expose myself uh not uh please god no um uh if chest wise uh and uh this entire video was was brought on by this game so there is um i have a massive psychological block in my head when i play really good players um i panic i throw away good positions i am rarely outplayed from start to finish but i frequently struggle in the later stages of the game withholding my composure with staying focused and often in good positions i completely melt i just come like a puddle of like butter so i was playing a game i was playing a young turkish player uh and uh i i played an interesting sicilian opening this was a couple of days ago this entire game uh brought me to make this video for you my opponent played directly into my preparation he played bishop before and he played this move d5 now in this position the move d5 actually has to be played after queen a5 uh king b1 and then d5 so that black can put the rook on d8 all right um now i actually know this because i i recently worked on on an opening repertoire uh with uh with e takes d5 rook takes d8 and um my opponent just did this and and what's bad about that move is that it it just loses a pawn now a lot of people do this because they think well you know i'm gonna get a lot of activity i'm gonna play bishop e6 but at the end of the day you're just down a pawn and i and you know i i knew the opening better than like 2900 rated opponent so what do you do uh when you um when you play when you're up a ball where you trade pieces right i'm not trading because he's higher rated i'm trading because i'm removing his active pieces and i'm just a clean pawn up i don't mind a queen trade so he goes queen a5 i play knight c3 and i do this and i'm like wait i'm just a clean pawn up like it's i'm just winning i'm winning so most people when they're winning go okay well this is what i have to do to win this position when i get a winning position against good players the first thing that goes into my mind is either don't mess this up or you're gonna find a way to mess this up and probably what i need is someone to punch me in the face and then after that send me to a sports psychologist this is the major thing that is holding me back it holds me back and over the board tournaments and it holds me back in any games i play online watch in most of the cases i can maintain my composure for a while my opponent plays queen b6 and here i can trade rooks and i can even trade this rook and i thought i'm just gonna trade down i'm not trading down because again i'm scared of my opponent i'm trading down because i'm just upon up and all end games are winning for me right so knight d4 bishop d3 he goes here i threaten a checkmate he plays here and now he's just tangled this hits this this is pinned this is pinned i'm like all right that's it i tricked him into a bunch of trades look at this position i mean no human on the planet will lose this sure but can i win it so he goes queen c5 i play queen d2 now there's a very powerful pin he plays queen e5 f4 here and now i notice i have a very nice tactic utilizing the fact that the rook at the end is not well protected i play knight b5 and um i'm attacking a7 and i'm attacking this he cannot take because of the pin take take knight a7 i'm just two pawns up i have completely outplayed this this dude for 30 moves queen b6 hits my knight but i can go here that's nothing because his knight is hanging he can give me checks he's just losing he is just down two pawns and seven seconds now the only thing he has in this position is hopes for a draw he can't beat me on time because we both get one second bonus it's title tuesday the only draw that he has well frankly i don't know where he has a draw right i'm just gonna bring my knight back and after 33 perfect moves in this position i can play c3 kick out his knight and basically win a third pawn and just win the game now instead of that what i do is i begin panicking i begin panicking and i go for a queen trade and throw the game in one move so i i all that work all that work gone because now he has check and knight e2 and this is a very famous background draw because the king cannot escape because of a fork and it's a perpetual he sends me back and we repeat moves and we repeat moves he can't take my queen it's defended i'm like all right wow i'm an idiot i threw a draw then he plays queen d1 and now uh i give him a check i give him a check he avoids a check and now i have seven seconds to just make sure that i don't do anything really dumb like i see all of these discovered attacks but i can always go here i can also take this pawn i'm thinking you know a lot of different things and i blunder mate in three knight d3 check now i can only go here queen c2 i'm not defended and it's made on the next move like i'm sharing this game with you right and you're probably sitting there like all right so what you lost no but you have to understand when you lose games like this a hundred times like part of your soul dies and that that's one of the reasons i wanted to like it it is legitimately unfathomable that you could lose this position it's not like we even have a peace imbalance he doesn't have a bishop for a night he doesn't have a pass pawn nothing it's completely the same stuff but i have two more of it it's like losing a football match up two players and it just doesn't make any sense and like i anyway this is just the start and i've and i went through uh and i actually i didn't uh shout out to tacky who did was one of my uh moderators uh i asked to dig through my games i couldn't bear to look at it uh and i uh i said find a bunch of games that i lost in totally winning positions folks it just gets worse like it it really truly just just gets worse and worse and and this happens in over the board games too here was a game i played against mikola bortnick very very strong i am uh and he plays on the gotham knights this was a karo khan game i actually showed this game in a in a youtube video a while ago i think so i'm gonna go a little bit faster you know again opening knowledge sublime i get a completely winning position from the opening with black with black i get a completely winning position okay uh i knew that this was a pan off carl conline this is this line where you put your bishop on g7 and you give up your d5 pawn and white struggles to defend these pawns because obviously they're doubled so i played this very unique a5 idea and by move 11 i will i mean move 12 i was i was just completely winning like i was just i mean the game was over why because i have one two three four five six pieces ready to go and he can't defend this position from a tactical standpoint he wastes another move with his bishop 94 lights out minus four minus four move move 13. i mean i have the skills to play on the same level as these 29 2900 3 000 rated players i really do but at some point in every one of these games my brain goes numb completely numb all right and when your brain goes numb you can call that mental free okay anyway rook c1 rook d1 knight takes d4 and this is the position he's king marooned in the center of the board i am up a pawn he hasn't moved this night or his rook maid is probably coming he plays bishop to d3 i give him a check and here i make a mistake i play knight c2 thinking alright i can win both these pawns i don't need to play knight c2 of course i can just bring my rook or something but okay knight c2 he plays knight d2 i take on a4 and uh i mean i'm i'm still basically completely winning like his king is stuck in the center of the board now from this point forward what do i do um first of all i panic so i start spending more time right like queen c2 rook d8 all these moves look good kicking out the bishop so what do i play i play rook d8 92 suddenly he's defending his king so i try to kick out his uh his bishop now he gives me a winning position again bishop e3 now the easiest move in the world here is just queen takes b2 and push the a pawn just queen takes b2 push the a pawn queen takes b2 and push the a pawn what do i do i play a4 he can now take on b7 he doesn't play that queen takes b2 i play now all right bishop f6 trying to kick his queen out and now rook d8 is winning for me of course i have three seconds like i said i didn't manage my time well and in a span of like five moves i hang my queen like he attacked my pawn i could have pushed instead i went queen b3 and i hung my queen and let me tell you i just didn't see it like i said my brain goes completely numb i just completely panic like of course i'm looking at this position now like why didn't i play a3 i have no idea i cannot explain it to you my bro like okay two games down uh this game the next two games hurt so bad so bad i mean they heard oh my god um so i was playing both danzak this guy is like a 2700 uh young young player i mean he's super good and we had a very offbeat opening he played like a i mean as you can see we're both sort of doing some weird stupid stuff in the opening doesn't make a huge difference but from the opening stage i'm just better like i just have a rock solid position and he trades with me and we just get this and it's minus three i mean i again again in the first 15 20 moves i am completely winning against the 3 000 rated player i mean opening i have the opening abilities easily of a 2900 3000 online player like easily but then but but okay when i tell when i tell you guys that this is one of the most painful defeats of my life it's not an exaggeration so of course first what's gonna happen i'm gonna throw right so he plays b4 he sacrifices a pawn to create a blockade and i take a second pawn right he goes here i go here and now he sacrifices his rook to try to win back a few of my pawns and opens up the position uh for his pieces like this now of course he's completely lost completely lost but it's very hard for me to break through here and it's also very hard for me to get rid of his bishop right so i'm sort of stuck i try to play h5 he just plays h4 i'm like man like it's really hard to break through so i play rook c8 he goes here i play rook c2 he goes here i take his pawn i'm like okay i have to be winning i mean i took his a pawn but now i can't move my rook what do i do well what i do is i start panicking right i give him a check now i go a2 suddenly bishop d4 is threatening both my rook and mate so now i am i'm losing probably right wait maybe not rook f7 queen bee look at the time i have eight seconds to a minute thirty eight seconds this is how panicked i was i just i could not physically bring myself to move faster eight seconds i have on the clock here remember one second bonus so i'm like okay it's gonna be a draw it's gonna be a draw it's like it's a draw he's gonna threaten mate i'm gonna threaten his queen he's gonna give me a check i'm gonna threaten his queen right he goes here i go here rook cafe i'm like okay it's gonna be a draw that's it and he's not gonna be able to take my rook and suddenly after repeating he goes here trying to play on the fact that i have four seconds but now he has 11. he spent all his time he didn't want to draw i'm like wait a minute oh my god what do i do with four seconds on the clock my my bro my my uh predator brain kicks in rook d1 so now i'm i'm hunting again i find rook d1 pinning him sometimes this happens my brain recalibrates turns back on rook d8 check of course i can block but i have king h7 and here i find an absolutely spectacular idea he can take this pawn to win my queen but i have rook takes bishop and i'm queening i'm gonna make a new queen he plays bishop takes f5 losing the game what he had to play was rook d4 and maintain this pin he blunders the game away i outplay him with seconds on the clock with seconds on the clock he plays queen d5 attacking my rook on f7 and my bishop on g6 how do you guard both at the same time by very casually sliding back but i had just made a queen so in my mind i was like i want to go here when he played queen d5 i picked up my queen and i brought it back to a7 to defend my rook and before i could move it there i lost on time i was so nervous i couldn't bring my queen here it fast enough and i flagged i flagged i lost on time the variety in which i've managed to lose these games in this video is just some of the most pain look at the next one i'm playing like all the gotham knights i played mikola i played big fish big fish you guys know big fish for safe plays on the gotham knights play c car all the time this game was not dominant from start to finish by any stretch of the imagination like some of these other games this was a very complicated back and forth game also fair to say i've always liked to play offbeat aggressive openings so me getting an advantage from the opening is nothing substantial um it was just a very like an even game i mean i was very i was very fine in the first 15 moves so we were on equal terms then here i did something like i played like a total chicken i decided to trade pieces and uh i was worse like i i got to this end game and i was worse but notice the time okay i'm already down 40 seconds right i'm already down 40 seconds but i'm still you know poking and asking questions i got my rook trapped here i made a really stupid mistake and i was losing but i fought back i fought back and he gave me he gave me a he blundered but look at the time look at the time right i'm threatening knight f7 he cannot go back he cannot go back if he plays like f5 for example then i have knight f7 king h5 knight f6 king h4 and he's getting mated like there's mate g3 oh rook before bishop before but there's g3 and then like knight g5 so all of a sudden i'm like wait a minute i'm i'm beating big fish this this is completely nuts like he plays g5 right so i played knight f7 look at the time spent 95 i spent eight seconds i spent 12 seconds finding the courage to play this move that's just pure nervousness okay he plays king g6 now of course you don't even think here you just come back you come back because if king f5 you play rookie three and just g4 okay look how much time i spent on rook f3 another 13 seconds and it's a bad move now he plays knight d7 taking away knight e5 i give a check it's probably a draw but he comes forward he comes all the way forward he does this look how much time i'm spending on these moves by the way i now have 15 seconds his king has no legal moves you know what's winning here for white i find king g2 but i have five seconds on the clock okay i have five seconds on the clock where is the win how do i win this position with white well first i have to play knight f6 because what that does is it opens up knight e5 so i find this move and now i have four seconds he attacks my rook and that simply loses why does it lose because i can play 95 knight f3 but in my mind i'm thinking 95 he's gonna play like rook b3 but what does that change i still go here and i'm winning right like the whole point was to go here he's made it but i have four seconds and i and i and i see my rook is hanging so what do i do i play rook f3 and suddenly he plays h5 and that's it the the key difference is that per move he is going to be more accurate than me he plays h5 in one second one second he just immediately right i play rook g3 now he's winning and i resigned i think i lost on timer every sign but he's winning now he's winning because i cannot defend rook f2 and if i go back he takes takes takes g4 and he's completely winning he's completely winning because he's up two pawns this game of course i am less mad about but it just shows you how terrified i am of these players like i i spent 12 seconds taking what am i doing just take the pawn just take the ball and by the time it comes time to make really important decisions i have five seconds on the clock because i just physically cannot bring myself to play any faster um but okay this was like a wild game and i you know you can say this was time the last game was not wild i was just better for like 40 moves uh this game better you know uh and the last one i have for you is again we're in my in my backyard we're playing in the carl khan and uh yeah this one was not really time related i don't think it was a advanced karo khan i played a line 97 knight g6 that um i had been playing for some time at that point and i'm playing oh i'm playing robert hoffman from armenia excuse me for armenia uh very strong player and again 2900 so what happens in the opening i play h5 i play f6 he plays this look at the evaluation after 10 moves black is better i mean black is just better like i it's nothing surprising i think he plays here i play this knight g2 and um i start my attack on his king i'm down a pawn we have opposite side castling he plays bishop g4 i tried i mean i i don't play fully accurately um and uh he manages to get like a slightly better position from the opening but i started absolutely monster attack here and he misplays right he gets a little bit spooked by my attack he had some computer defense he could have played like knight f4 and then he could have played like knight f3 and then he could have walked his king out but i bluff a little bit and all of a sudden i'm winning all of a sudden his king is being hunted into the center of the board knight takes c2 and he sacrifices his queen to survive he sacrifices his queen he's gonna win a rook and it's queen and two pawns versus knight bishop rook which is 11 11. make a wish all right um i have a minute i play e5 he has to go here i play knight c5 this is checkmate i mean like he's gonna lose of course he's gonna lose right like he plays knight e1 right now in oblit like looking at this position right now you know what move i would play here i would play queen to d1 without even thinking queen d1 why because this pins the knight and d4 is now made in one it covers all his escape squares queen d1 probably just ends the game because if he gives me a check i can go king c7 i can play like this is not a concern because like i'm safe i mean i can like it like giving back some advantage but it's it's not really that much of a problem um of course queen d1 or i mean jesus take his pawns right so what do i do i play d4 check three seconds fine trying to trying to play fast okay now i play queen f5 not the most accurate move but okay now he plays f4 and um unfortunately here uh i just completely malfunctioned like he starts putting up some good resistance like all of these good grandmasters do they start defending they start playing quickly now i play queen g4 in seven seconds now i play queen d1 and suddenly he's created some barrier and if i play e4 he has knight e5 also if i play e4 he has knight d4 and if queen d4 rook d8 and i'm losing my queen so i think oh my god what have i done but e4 is still the best move because after this this i have knight d3 and i'm getting here well folks d3 he takes with check now i can run my king to safety instead i run my king to the center and after check king d5 he takes my other pawn and if i take he gives me check i have no attack i have no material advantage now i'm gonna lose so what do i do i play queen h5 and uh rook dhek he makes an inaccuracy but uh rook e5 is just it's just winning rook d8 i uh thought he was just winning my knight rookie 5 was winning on the spot to take my knight um five games of probably about 40 to 50. with the same thing over and over in a variety of different ways of course but most of them uh have the same exact kind of pattern where i'm very confident i'm very comfortable in the first 15 moves but i never truly in my head treat it like another day at the office like i have to maintain a focus and i have to maintain a come you know i'm just going to win this game like i would have this mindset against anybody my level or below i just panic i panic and combined with the fact that my opponents are really good in order to beat people who are 2 900 3 000 on shells.com or 25 26 2700 over the board feeder rating you have to beat them multiple times in the same game a lot of you have to do this too like if you want to beat people who are three 400 points higher than you you have to beat those people multiple times in the same game you have to shut down all of their attempts at getting back into the game just like in any competitive like sport like in basketball let's say uh you have to shut down comebacks and you have to be able to deal with the emotional roller coaster of messing something up giving back some advantage and then having to do it over again sometimes i i do succeed like i've won a few games and sometimes i do hold my nerves but this is single-handedly the most frustrating saddening depressing aggravating thing about uh my chess is that the sweetness of victory for me does not feel any better in fact it feels magnitudes worse than the pain of defeat like when i win a game it's a relief it's not like i'm proud i don't celebrate like losing games hurt so much more for me probably because i have an ego and probably because i think and i know deep down that i can do better but i just don't so uh yeah hope you enjoyed the video get out of here
