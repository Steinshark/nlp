ladies and gentlemen today i've got something very special for you that i hope you will appreciate as much as i do as a chess fan i used to make many videos like this in 2020 2021 the early days of the chess boom and since then i kind of got away from it because truly the historical chess deep dives just don't do as great for whatever reason but hopefully this one does and let me know in the comments if you want more content like this today the spotlight is on perhaps the greatest genius to ever play the game of chess and of course i'm talking about the magician of ria lvia mik tal mik tal was born in 1936 in as i just mentioned ria and he was one of the most influential chess players of the entire 20th century he won the world championship against the perennial best player at the time mik binck and tall was an absolutely fascinating individual he lived a bohemian lifestyle he drank he smoked he drank and smoked at the board if you're watching this and you're a little bit young he drank lots of juice and sometimes water he was an absolutely fascinating individual and his chest was like a breath of fresh air he sacrificed pieces constantly he attacked and struck fear into the heart of so many of his opponents and yet at first nobody took him seriously they thought that he was just a trickster that he played like a scammy type of chess and yet he was one of the only players to have a positive score against players like bobby fiser okay i'm going to show you four games from his illustrious chess career the last of which he played one month before he tragically died in 1992 he came out of a hospital played against gary kasparov arguably the greatest chest player of all time and he managed to win now mik tal said something he said there are correct sacrific there's two types of sacrifices in chess correct ones and my own and he also said in chess you have to take your opponent into a deep dark forest where two plus two is five and the way out is only wide enough for one you know i kind of like to play chess like that you know i i i'm not a i'm not a huge fan of playing chess in a boring way let me show you this incredible game that he played against the grandmaster hans hakim heck this was a not well at not at the time he was not yet a grandmaster i think he was awarded it a little bit later uh but he's still very much alive i mean a lot of the the chess players from the 20th century have passed away uh mik tal being one of them uh from excessive likely smoking and drinking which he did at the chessboard um but my goodness i mean what a player he was so this one begins as a standard two knights queen's pawn black plays bishop to b4 pinning white's knight and this game is played in 1962 so theory of the queen's indian in all these openings is not yet fully developed t plays a very principled way developing all of his pieces uh heck plays h6 trying to get rid of that bishop pin and then he takes and plays d6 very principal stuff gives up his dark squared bishop white no longer has the opportunity to play e4 and now black is going to take a dark squared approach to the game maybe play e5 a little bit later cuz he doesn't have that bishop that he traded and there we go now we notice that to breaks he he breaks certain principles he moves his knight backwards moving it a second time in the opening but it's because he wants the center that's what he wants t doesn't calculate he just plays on instinct he plays on field there's a a legend to tal one thing i didn't even mention in the introduction t was born with a congenital deformity he was born with three hands uh three hands three fingers on his right hand and yet despite that hardship that would stop many many people from doing many things he was a talented pianist he could play the piano extremely well while drinking while smoking while being a world chess champion despite that hardship it's just like this whole legend is just fascinating just absolutely incredible um and uh well here we go here we go t takes the center he's going to develop his bishop next there he goes you'll notice that hect is playing a very principled game so many pawns on the dark square very maneuvering type of game a lot of players like to slow down the burning fire you know they try to play positionally uh yeah t wasn't going to have any of that he's not going to get into a long-term maneuvering game in this game he blows open the queen side with the move c5 all right c5 the idea that when black captures the pawn which by the way he cannot take this because that would open up the b file and that would that would really soften up the queen side and so dc5 was played and t did this he said all right i opened up the queen side i got snipers at the king i'm going to give a check force black to block somehow and the best way often times to defend against tal was actually in a confrontational manner but players would play very passively they would play very very passively getting into these kind of like closed battles against them because they just feared his power so much like a powerful boxer queen back to e6 and t never stopped and here he played this move e5 you'll notice he has completely left his bishop to die it's because he's ready with a counter punch right away he's ready with this move e5 right off the bat he plays e5 and black strikes back with b5 a very very principal decision trying to get the queen out of the way and then he's going to deal with the rest of the st maybe he'll grab the bishop he's going to castle no this is the kind of player that tal was tal loved to sacrifice and he just had an instinct he had a blood lust for creating this havoc this controlled chaos on the board and in this position with a queen hanging with a knight hanging with a bishop hanging mik tal sacrificed all of them and captured this knight on f6 left all of his pieces out to die you can't grab all three at once all right you just can't do it it's not a free-for-all all right it's not a free-for-all if you try to take the queen you best be sure to hang on you can't take anything else you're not going to castle cuz the queen is still going to be hanging so he took now tal was able to get away with the move like like this because his pieces are well oiled and coordinated to target his opponent right after the queen is captured so tall plays on instinct he is like an avalanche he is like a like a train whose brakes have broken he captures on g7 simultaneously threatening to get a rook but also reopening the diagonal for the bishop all his pieces work together rook g8 and now the culmination of the sacrifice it is actually not rook to e1 which looks like it wins a queen because it loses a bishop and a rook in the process and when the dust settles t would be a full rook down he could grab the bishop on his way out but then he would lose this this is under fire and he loses the end game no no no no no tal did one of two things tal either completely took his opponent's soul or he would lead them into a deep dark forest and the the the road out of it would only be wide enough for one and it would be for him and the dust would settle and he would be winning in an end game bishop to f5 sacrificing another piece another piece and another piece all three pieces are hanging and yet they all work beautifully cuz you got to choose who you're going for if you take the bishop i get knight to d6 and i win the queen and i emerge in a better end game that very well could be the best move you can take on h4 right now you'll notice stockfish is kind of like demystifying the white attack but when you play it against tal you had to defend perfectly he took the bishop bishop e6 and then he tried to go for this tall just bulldozes in with more pieces king e7 and beautifully gets out of danger saving his rook defending the bishop and black still could maybe hang on and he goes g3 grabs this bishop takes a6 but like i always like i said when the dust settled tal was left in a game where he was down a pawn but black had one two three four eyes island doubled and completely shattered pawn structure and white was better white is better in an endgame despite being a full pawn down all of this made possible by by the fact that when his queen was attacked he played pawn to f6 shredding open the center of the board forcing his opponent to dance at his pace escapes into the end game and he converts it expertly the beautiful thing about t was he wasn't just an attacker he had control of the game in every phase and black ultimately succumbs to the pressure you know there is not much to be done we go to an end game rook a6 rook f6 look at all of black's pieces falling at the end of the day tal was trained in the pioneer school of chess under the toage of kent and uh i will actually show you a game a little bit later uh which he played against his trainer but but every every strong grandmas of that generation was just bulletproof at end games and this one is no different an incredible sequence of moves where he took down uh the german grandmas in a an incredible flurry i and remember i i am ending the video of the game that he played a month before his death in beating gary kasparov which is just otherworldly just otherworldly contribution to uh to the legend here is um a game that he played against his trainer kin uh and let me just verify actually that uh kin did get the grandmaster title because there are uh players i'm not actually sure he he did uh he might have been an international master chess title yeah grand master titles were were like instituted in uh the mid 20th century so officially he might have not even been a grandm you know what i'm going to leave it because out of respect for all his accomplishments uh i will leave it it might not be accurate but i don't want to demote him to my title cuz me and k blends do not deserve the same title i'm an international master as far as i'm concerned he was he was a grandmaster of the game um this was a game played in 1957 it's one of the most unbelievable games i've ever seen in my life it is a uh rouser variation sicilian and the motto of this game is when you play tal do not play the sicilian defense just don't do it now there actually is a variation of the caroan defense named after tal because he loved it's aggressive it's literally called the tal variation so if you play the advanced caroon bishop f5 h4 you are playing against the you playing the tal variation now this one was a rouser variation tal did not need a second invitation he got his king castled queen side as fast as possible looking to create an attack castles by black knight to b3 queen b6 and there he went against his sensei against his trainer rook to d8 and now tall was like look man chess is a simple game let me get my bishop back to hit the queen black is going to get to play b5 but i don't care cu here we go this is everything you wanted when you saw toal playing a chess game i mean it was like a heavyweight by i'm telling you look at g5 absolutely no doubts in his mind he doesn't even make a preparatory move there's no king b1 there's no let me get all of this settled knight d7 and now t plays a move that i don't get a move that stockfish doesn't even fully understand stockfish wants to play h5 and make preparatory moves this man t says you know what what am i waiting for g6 completely giving the pawn up to two different pawns that can capture black will probably take this way to keep everything intact because if black goes this way this this is weak this is open but g6 is a mesmerizing sacrifice because now it's like wait a minute that's not the move that white wanted to play he has no business playing that move tal had no business playing any damn move he had no business playing any damn move the the soviet school of chess thought that he was a he was a scam artist that he he was he was his chess was not worthy and look at this and look at this now he created a hook he created a pawn on in front of his opponent's king and look at stockfish suddenly appreciating his sacrifice gh 5 rook h5 doesn't matter all he gets is long-term attacking prospects the knight has to go back to f6 now the rook goes back to h1 queen is coming that's made how do you defend it with black black does what you're supposed to do strikes back in the center of the board simultaneously preventing queen h2 and ready to open up this you know what t played in this position this next move that he played is so disrespectful it is so ridiculous the computer here gives bishop f4 clearing this maneuver and then bringing the pawns forward you know what all played in this position against d5 he played the move e5 his moves are so godlevel stockfish needs time to calculate them you'll notice that against d5 stockfish very quickly spits out bishop f4 plus 1.8 but e5 if you take with the queen is completely lost because the queen is trapped and tal knew that by deflect ing his opponent's knight away from his king and blocking this diagonal he would seize the diagonal he would get this attack roaring forward and the defense would be borderline untenable the computer at this point wants to run the king to the center of the board knight takes e5 of course now modern day we have 2700 engine it says just go queen h2 just go queen h2 mik just play it because then obviously you have queen h8 mate and if the king runs you go here etc but but tall t was stockfish back in the day knight takes e5 he does all of this stockfish at this point claiming that the king run is good look at him go now t plays rook h7 stockpiling the pressure now stockfish begins reconsidering again it has no idea what is going on so kaben plays f5 bishop h6 look at this armada arriving on the h file and suddenly stockfish is like uhoh uhoh this is really really good you can't take because of this so we play rook d7 adding more defense and now a a shot to the to the other side of the board bishop takes b5 the bishop comes alive on the 25th move of the game it's been dormant it is one of the only pieces of the white position that has not moved and it snipes down a pawn a pawn that was going to be used to attack the white king you cannot take you cannot take because then you would be inviting trouble and also rook g1 this is the idea to put 22 points of pressure on the g7 square which becomes untenable black plays rook f7 rook g1 the bishop snipes the king from all angles the ken's position is is disintegrating this is absolutely i've never seen anything like this and now here comes his knight tal is literally going to get every single piece that he has into the attack knight g4 is the best move by the way defending himself by sacrificing but black's position is impossible to defend in the long run tal doesn't take any step back this is under attack this is under pressure this is ready to open at a moment's notice the knight is just ready this knight is is the last piece that has yet to get into the game it perishes tal doesn't even need it he plays bishop back to e3 stepping back hitting the rook here the computer finds like perfect defense the evaluation bar is like the cold shower of t's games because you know you're supposed to go here and that's the way that this 3650 preserves its power it's almost better to analyze tall games without that because no human at that time could find variations like pawn to d4 sending the bishop back and who knows tal would have probably found rook gh1 giving up his bishop for queen g8 king g8 rook h8 made so sometimes it's not even worth it because the computer doesn't even fully appreciate some of his moves he is literally finding moves for the computer has to reconsider so he played bishop back to e3 creating the threat of bishop c5 on the attack on the king the rook he left the bishop hanging he left that bishop hanging he doesn't take the rook d4 rook h1 rook to d7 and now apparently g takes f5 is also winning he goes right back stops the king's escape and as always the computer is just like trying to be a buzz kill here black takes on b5 rook h6 tal is down four points of material the knight is swarming the king the bishop is swarming the king white's king by the way has no defenders left just pawns just a matter of time but you cannot stop the attack you can take the knight white has rook f6 and then there's a force draw here gf6 bishop h6 rook g7 bishop g7 king e7 bishop f6 king d6 bishop e5 king d5 rook a7 and apparently this is a draw the black king marches into the center of the board no human on the planet would have done that against tal in the middle 20 mid 20th century and instead the white king slides to stop the pawn and the game is over the game is over queen c6 rook f6 check the attack swarms in you can't take the queen and black resigns because you're going to get here queen is just too slow to get to the king what a game what a game what a swarm look at this attack absolutely incredible bishop h6 rook g1 every single piece utilized every single piece utilized melting the souls of his opponents is m t just just a just a otherworldly level of the game and a level of understanding i got two more for you i got the iconic game that tal played in the 1960 world chess championship match against binck when he won the world championship at 203 years old he beat an incumbent champion who changed chess forever the bfix school of chess produced some of the greatest prodigies uh known to humans some of the greatest players known to humans in 20th and now 21st century chess and he beat him he beat him in 1960 and it was a sensation and the way that he beat bin who was a technician he was a surgeon chess player he was incredible he played these positional games is he took him to a deep dark forest of the king's indian defense he closed the center he created some stability but then he would just attack he would attack and it would be magical he could attack with white and he could attack with black he would use his pawns he would use his pieces rook c8 knight to h5 queen on b4 hitting from all three sides but yet the white position stable as a rock because that's the type of player that binck was but tal would play moves like rook c4 he would bring his rooks and he would attack on all three sides of the board like i said traditional evaluation of stockfish allows stockfish to retain some sort of advantage by poking holes in the mystique of the game and this is very comforting but what if i turn this off what if you don't have an evaluation bar and you have to sit here and face the wrath of tal let's flip it back to white's perspective to feel like what it feels to be t's opponents to face the wrath to face the complications black is coming to attack you over here so you capture because you know black cannot capture with the pawn cuz you will take his knight so bishop takes well that's easy now black doesn't have any opposing pawns he can't even make any forward progress well our rook is hanging so we go here and our plan is to go g4 a3 kick out the queen etc etc and then mik tal 23 years of age in the year 1960 arrives on the king side with his knight allowing a full piece capture a full capture of a knight to the incumbent best player in the world mel bin in 1960 gives up the knight not for two but for one pun one pawn now white here can strike back he backs up the bishop and he allows queen takes b2 he says you know what you can have a second pawn but then we're going to begin trading pieces tal says okay you see that was the kind of player that tal was he was like all right you want to give me a second pawn okay there's only there's only one way out of his deep dark forest we pressure this we pressure this this and this it's chaos the best move now for binic is to play rook to b1 which he does giving up his rook the point is that the queen gets stuck the queen is going to get stuck it's a very very dangerous position for black rook b1 but here tal says you know what i took two pawns now it's time to attack the in integrity it's time to attack the nucleus the epicenter of the white position all his all his pieces tied together f3 the shot from the side you can't take with the queen cuz the queen takes the bishop in the white position falls apart but i got news for you taking like this is also very dangerous because you open up a direct line of attack on your king that also feels very uncomfortable for example takes takes here you try to go for bishop 2 e4 well now i'm going to sacrifice because all of this is open that wasn't open before knight e4 queen b1 what's going to happen here apparently apparently after all of this queen e6 etc white has good chances but that's the thing tal set these situational problems for his opponents they have to out calculate him for 10 moves and they couldn't they couldn't out calculate him rook takes b2 he grabs the queen of binik binik plays rook b3 now the rooks are dancing but feni by the way let it be known is a full piece up white is up a full knight but the attack is swirling the pawn is a square away from queening and then in this position rook takes c3 was actually lethal trying to get the rook to d1 but t found the second best way according to the machine which is bishop to f4 and when it's all said and done he plays this end game like i said deep dark forest but when the path out is only wide enough for one it doesn't matter how he wins he could checkmate you or like he did in the last game or he can get you into an end game where you're suffocating he is also extremely high level in the last stage of the game he doesn't always need tactics and sacrifices he completely paralyzes the white position something that binick used to do to all of his opponents dances back grabs a pawn grabs another pawn and bck was frozen frozen on the back rank two pawns down bishop c4 even if he gets one of them back this defense is untenable he gives a couple of checks the king runs out rook a3 and just d5 bishop h4 swarming it's one pawn but my lord is it a quality pawn and for a second time in a row in this video tal gets it done in the last stage of the game there's just no stopping this pawn c3 the king comes forward but feni plays this and resigns because the king is going to dance down to c1 the pawn will go to c2 and you will move the king and you will promote and that is the way that's the way it feels to deal with tal you don't know which side of which side of the board he's going to get you it's like a mixed martial arts he might kick you he might wrestle you he might punch you i mean it's like any sport he's lethal he could shoot the three he could shoot the two he could you know he's like he's one of the most versatile players of all time and he can get it done in every single phase and like i said t t led a crazy lifestyle that's that's what the legend says he led a crazy lifestyle he smoked and drank the board he had a record in the 1959 candidates tournament against bobby fiser a 4-0 he laughed at a move that bobby played at the chessboard that's the kind of man that he was but that type of lifestyle will catch up to you and tal was sick he was sick in the 80s and the 90s um probably even i mean who knows back back in that day probably sick earlier as well but he came out of the hospital as the legend goes in 1992 to play a blitz tournament a blitz tournament in which gary kasparov was participating in 1992 kasparov had defended his world championship four times at that point and he had played five world championship matches against karpov kasparov was the best player in the world since becoming world champion he was the best player in the world for 20 years probably t came out of retirement and this was a blitz tournament excuse me t came out of the hospital the hospital not retirement to play this game it was e4 and it was bishop b5 check it was this type sicilian defense knight d7 very confrontational very weird pawn's not getting taken this was a blitz game remember knight takes e6 kasparov played like this and uh even at the age of 90 uh excuse me even in 1992 at the age of um 56 um tall didn't need second invitation queen on c7 rook to e1 all his pieces ready to go one of these bad boys is is going to open up that center kasparov took a lot of time in the opening uh and he tried to push back tals pieces he was he was kind of ready he was ready for one of these pieces to rip it open he's playing all the best moves he's looking to pressure here now t plays f4 f4 and the thing is if you play knight g6 or even knight c4 this is lethal this is a very common sicilian sacrifice that opens the center and black can't cover himself king d7 is queen g4 mate can you imagine kasparov losing a game like this no of course not kasparov was one of the best calculators in the world and he found h6 he found a very nice idea here with all of this under pressure the only move here is g5 counterattacking white again the point is if you play knight g6 well easy i go here and then i continue my attack your knight is actually a target which is all al t needed so kaspar had to strike back we've got two of the best calculating players of all time t in this position took the knight g takes h4 all this pandemonium is he going to open up the center what is he going to do he is he is going to open up the center with e takes d6 bishop takes d6 knight to d5 wow tall roars in sacrificing a knight again easy with this here how do you defend yourself e takes d5 e takes d5 with the attack here and now black plays king f8 and tal plays queen f3 and the threat is knight to e6 the threat is rook f1 doubling up tripling up maybe rook to e6 in some lines as well then bring this rook over here black can grab a pawn and try to get out with like bishop to g3 but that's very very dangerous stuff you're playing with now the fascinating thing about this game is that this is where it ends if you look at any database this is where the game ends how how's that possible well apparently kaspr lost on time apparently so much energy and initiative was was being put here on kasparov that he spent a lot of time in this game finding moves like h6 and bishop and g5 that's just how the story goes another legend of this game goes this game was actually much longer than 17 moves we just don't have the 17 moves but one thing that is true from this game is i believe kasparov himself in an interview said this was the only game that he lost in this tournament in 1992 of course he was the best player in the world at the time multiple time world champion already so kaspar won a tournament in 1992 and the only player who he lost to was mik tal a month before he died think about that that is incredible stuff this is really truly the stuff of legends mik tal is without question one of if not the most interesting chess player who has ever lived he is a creative genius he would attack on a level like nobody else you wouldn't even need to he wouldn't even need to calculate certain variations the level of panic he instilled into his opponents was was unbelievable another one of his famous quotes was um that he elevated his level in chess when he realized that he wasn't the only one nervous at the board so were his opponents his opponents were just as uncertain about their moves as he was and that played into his hands that played to his benefit um i wanted to dedicate a video to him his games are unbelievable i mean i could covered 20 games in a in a video uh his history uh maybe i will do that if you have a favorite game of tall uh you want me to cover in the future or certain tournaments do let me know in the comments and um i'll see you in the next video get out of here
