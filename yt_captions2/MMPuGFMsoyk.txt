so you want to become a full stack developer in 
2022 but you don't know where to start you don't   necessarily have the time or energy or resources 
to go back to school for another four years to get   your computer science degree does this mean your 
dreams of becoming a full stack developer are gone   definitely not as someone who has been there 
and has graduated with a degree that wasn't in   computer science to now where i am today as 
a software developer i can ensure you there   are so many different ways to getting there to 
becoming a full stack developer today i'm going   to be sharing with you some of my top courses i 
would suggest for anyone who is looking to become   a full stack developer these courses are taught 
by industry experts on full stack development they   are teachers that have been renowned for 
so long and i'm so excited to share them   with you all these courses are on udemy and 
honestly i can say i have to give so much   credit to udemy especially in the start of 
my career when i was learning and upskilling   constantly it's pretty much my number one 
resource or it is my number one resource   i go to when i need to learn something new 
before we get into it though make sure to   hit that subscribe button for more tech and 
coding related content give this video a thumbs   up and also leave in the comments other video 
topics you want to see okay let's dive into it   i'm going to go through the top five courses 
the courses that i list are not in order from   number one to five or five to one these are all 
in my opinion equal on just the top five courses   to become a full stack developer the first 
one is by dr angela it's the complete 2022   web development bootcamp now if you've taken any 
kind of coding related courses on you to me before   you have definitely heard of dr angela she has 
some of the most top-rated courses on udemy when   it comes to coding and technical related skills 
so it's no surprise one of her courses is on   the top five list okay let's get into what about 
this course that i really love and what makes it   stand out well the first one is the length of it 
this course is really done in a lengthy way where   you're committing over 55 hours to this course and 
yes well that seems like a long time imagine if   you are someone who is coming in with next to no 
experience when it comes to full stock development   you are learning the basics from html css and then 
continuing building blocks on all throughout this   course okay i'm going to pull up on screen 
here just a list of some of the technologies   and tools you will learn in this course so as i 
mentioned html css then it goes into bootstrap   javascript jquery and i love actually that it does 
focus on jquery at least touch on it a little bit   now some of you might say well jquery is a 
bit outdated it's not really used that often   it's still in my opinion so important to have a 
fundamental understanding about what it is why   it was used initially and what has really taken 
over from jquery then it goes into git and github   and version control which i think is so important 
and it's something that when i was self-teaching   myself or even went to a bootcamp that was really 
missed so i love that she brings that into this   course and for full stack you are going to be 
learning node express working with databases with   sql and also too with mongodb so i really like how 
she touches on that as well with authentication   firebase and then it goes into more frontend 
things with react react hooks and web design   another thing that stands out for me and another 
reason i would take this course is because you   actually are building a physical or not physical 
a tangible product where you're building your   portfolio and i love how you can come out of 
this course with a portfolio already developed   and not to mention this is a certificate course so 
once you complete it you have a certificate which   is always a nice thing to put on your linkedin i 
feel like i could talk about each of these courses   for hours on end i promise i will not i'll just 
get to the the highlights and i think the reason   behind my excitement for these courses is because 
they are so well done and so much time and effort   is put into them and as someone who has been 
there and has taken so many of these courses   i really really appreciate the effort and the time 
and how these courses are laid out that it truly   is one of those courses or all of these courses 
aren't wasting your time you're not going to   take them and regret taking them which is so huge 
because there's so many different courses online   that really you feel like at the end of that 
why did i take this it was a waste of time   and one thing i have found with udemy is it's 
consistent they always have the best courses   and the best quality and i never feel like i'm 
wasting my time okay now that we have that out   of the way let's go into the next one next on the 
list is a course by oak academy called full stack   web development with react angular and node i 
really like how in this course they touch on both   react and angular because a lot of courses just 
specify or touch on one front-end framework   or library and in this case you get to learn too 
and i think it's really important to learn too   because it really shows you the differences and 
similarities between different frameworks and   libraries and in this course one of their mottos 
or moto's motto motto motto is to learn by doing   and you're going to be doing a lot of different 
projects in this course so by the end of it   you'll have essentially a portfolio in itself with 
different projects in react and then also angular   also with this course you have actually with all 
of these courses you can have zero experience   going into it so literally if this is day one for 
you and you're like i want to learn how to code   i want to become a full stack developer this is 
for you they really go from the basics from html   css and work their way up the only caveat i don't 
even know if it's the caveat but the only thing   to note is you have to be mentally committed to 
the time length as i mentioned the last course   was 55 hours this one is 36 hours almost 37 
hours so you need to be in the mindset that   this is going to take time and this shouldn't 
come as a surprise to you it should actually be   seen as a positive because any good course or any 
good teaching it's going to give the appropriate   amount of time to learning something so vast 
and so big okay the next course on the list and   i'm sure you are not surprised it involves python 
because a lot of our videos we have done recently   together talk about how python is the number one 
programming language in demand right now it's just   it's everywhere right now and that's a good 
thing because python is definitely a more   user-friendly language to learn first 
which is great that it is so in demand   so next on the list is python and django full 
stack web developer bootcamp now this is a   course that is around 31 hours almost 32 hours in 
length so once again it's a full commitment course   uh but i do love how unlike the last two 
courses i listed it is focusing on python   now i'm sure you're going to stop this and be like 
well if what is better python or should i learn   javascript with react and angular what should i 
learn there is no right answer all the courses i   am listing and what they are teaching are super in 
demand and very transferable so whether you take   a python course or you take a javascript course 
it's not going to affect if you get the job based   one based on the other if you learn python you 
can still apply for jobs in javascript and vice   versa it's not going to make or break employers 
understand that just having the skills of one   means they're very transferable and you can easily 
pick up another okay back to this course so other   things i really love about this course is it's 
taught through various different interactive ways   so through video lectures through walk through 
code projects exercises uh downloadable course   notes i'm a huge per i love when instructors 
give us notes to download because a lot of times   necessarily i won't not necessarily i'll be 
referring to them in that moment but saving   them for later has become super handy and it also 
helps me not have to write so much of my own notes   and once again this course as well has a 
certificate upon completion which is another   great thing to add to your linkedin okay next 
on the list is the web developer bootcamp 2022   by colt steele now if you are a udemy regular or 
has been have been on you to me at all if you are   searching up any technology or coding related 
topics i'm sure you have heard of colt steel   he has some of the best courses out there in my 
opinion some of the topics are really well broken   down his ratings are through the roof i mean 
4.7 stars out of five and there has been over   two hundred 200 twenty thousand ratings that's 
crazy to have such a high rating with so many   uh people writing you so you know right there 
and then this is going to be a great course   one thing that stands out to me about this course 
is you really get to use some different tools   for example i love that in this course 
you're actually using postman to   monitor and test different apis and that's 
something you're going to be doing in the real   world so getting familiar with these tools in a 
course is something that's really helpful because   then when you are in an interview and someone asks 
you hey have you used any of these tools have you   used postman you can actually say yes i have i use 
them to help build this project okay last on the   list but not least on the list is a hundred days 
of code 2022 web developer bootcamp by my personal   favorite i feel like i said it for every every 
person but maximilian was one of my first uh i   took i think so many of his courses when i first 
started out like almost all of them so i have a   huge soft spot for max's courses because they are 
just so well done and this course i really love   because once again we are getting into it for 
79 hours so this is essentially like going to   okay maybe not as much in length but really going 
to a boot camp or going to a short form boot camp   because you're going to learn everything in and 
out and you have to be committed to this course   and what i really really love about this course is 
it breaks it down into a learning path for you so   as you can see on screen here there's days one to 
five what are we going to learn on day one to five   days six to eight nine to ten and that 
is something that you don't really see   in a lot of courses and it's such a great way for 
anyone who really struggles to learn on their own   or stay focused to realize that hey this is what 
i need to accomplish in these this amount of days   then i can have a break and then move on to 
the next part otherwise taking a course can   sometimes feel overwhelming to certain people 
and not knowing when is enough for the day or   when to stop or how much time should i put in this 
course breaks it down for you which i really love   okay those are my top five courses i would take if 
i wanted to become a full stack developer in 2022   now i think i've taken many of these courses just 
different versions of them by the same instructors   uh you know four or five years ago when i was 
first starting out my coding journey in full stack   development and they are still super valuable 
for anyone who just wants to even up their skills   who's already in the industry as well okay i hope 
you found this video super valuable and helpful   and curious to know which course are you going 
to start taking leave down in the comments i've   linked you to me down below so make sure to go 
check it out thank you all and i will see you soon you
