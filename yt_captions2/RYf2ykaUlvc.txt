on february 27 2023 amd's ryzen 9 7950x3d was formally declared to be the best cpu at every price point in the desktop market at least by everyone else normally gamers can count on us to confirm or refute manufacturer's claims allowing them to get the most for their money but we said nothing well about that first our testing was plagued with so many crashes that our original script for this video had us speculating whether amd had validated this chip at all and once we worked that out we're going to touch on that later our performance numbers were so far off what others were reporting that we went back and we retested everything and what we found was that the deeper we dug the more complex the story around this chip became fastest on the planet yes but maybe only on roads that most people wouldn't drive it on fastest segue on the planet no but you're watching it anyway to learn about our sponsor any desk experience seamless and top-notch remote access with any desk you can

out any desk at the link below here are the original graphs that we were going to publish for our ryzen 7950x3d review you can pause if you want to look closely but what matters is that at 1080p while we did see performance improvements over the regular 7950x no matter how many times we tested our data never quite lined up with amd's own and if that wasn't strange enough look at these modern warfare 2 results lower than the 7950x then we turn up the resolution and i mean how is that even possible normally the performance differences between cpus should shrink as we move to 1440p or especially 4k because we're shifting more of the demand over to the gpu well not here instead our 7950x3d managed worse performance than its x denoted cousin in multiple games at 1440p we retested it and retested it a lot same thing and this flies in the face of the conventional wisdom that cpus should be tested at a lower resolution to better reveal their relative strength i mean it's basically benchmarking gospel that if it's better for gaming at 1080p it should be better or at the worst equal for gaming at any other resolution i mean outside of gaming we expected performance to be underwhelming due to the 7950x3d's lower clock speeds and tdp the last gen ryzen 7 5800 x 3d behaved much the same way because 3d v cache just doesn't help that much with most productivity tasks but it was supposed to make up for this with its outstanding gaming performance something we simply weren't seeing the bottom line is that the review we never published was scathing performance was not in line with amd's claims especially when we increased the resolution and from what we'd heard and what we're now seeing supply was expected to be basically non-existent this combined with our experience with the early drivers our bios issues and the crashes we saw all pointed to a rushed possibly even paper launch amd had every opportunity to contest our findings but when we showed them our results they basically went yeah seems okay so with nothing else to go on if we had launched that review we would have been the only outlet with a broadly negative take on this chip to their credit amd did eventually acknowledge that our chip was probably defective saving us that embarrassment and giving us us the time to get the story right now we had some hints that our review sample was more yellow than golden with the integrated gpu enabled windows would immediately crash once our geforce gpus drivers loaded and across four different expo certified memory kits we experienced constant crashes and memory intensive applications like blender and 7-zip both of these behaviors were absent with regular non-x3d chips and this pattern was observed with multiple motherboards meaning our x3d cpu was the only common denominator so you might think why is that only a hint at a bad chip well the thing is these kinds of teething panes are a lot more common than you'd probably think on brand new platforms if you recall we had very similar stability issues with first gen ryzen and with 12th gen core especially at higher memory speeds usually though they end up being footnotes in the review process because everything is pre-release and we often see these things resolved by the time they're actually generally available but but they're important here because all of this troubleshooting and reporting all of our findings to amd including the anomalous performance data ate up two days out of before that we had for testing wait only four days to evaluate this thing ah i'm glad you noticed that the unusually crunched review window was another reason for us to believe hey maybe our chip is perfectly normal and amd is just trying to limit our time with it so that we don't dig too deep i know that's a pretty cynical take but the truth is we have seen the strategy before and aside from the crashing our performance numbers were at least close enough to amd's expectations that even they initially told us yep everything looks fine but here's the thing silicon is notoriously fickle especially with these bleeding edge process nodes and good or bad might not be as binary as you might think for any given wafer fresh off the production line there are going to be multiple unusable eyes it's just the way it is as exact as the manufacturing process is it is truly ridiculous how small each transistor is these days smaller than even a virus and when you're working at that level you're at the mercy of literal quantum physics get the gate pitch off by a fraction of an animator and maybe that transistor doesn't flip as quickly as its neighbors and you can't ramp up clock speed or maybe some of them are bridged together and entirely non-functional unlike our tech accessory holder from ltdstore.com it's got lots of compartments and it's very functional now these kinds of defects are normal and these flawed lower performing processor dies are often used in lower end products which is fine except that from time to time a chip can be so marginal that it barely passes those usual quality control checks and then ends up falling short in the field this is what we call losing the silicon lottery winning the silicon lottery on the other hand isn't simply getting a working chip it's having an exceptional one one whose production had very few defects giving it extra headroom compared to the average for a given design in other words a good overclocker this is the part where i tell you that once we got our replacement chip all of our problems disappeared or at least would be if i were a big liar the stability problems are gone but the performance problems the ones that led to our negative conclusion in the first place are actually no better these new numbers then that i'm showing you now are the culmination of what is now weeks of testing and troubleshooting and they leave us with some really tough questions like are amd's yields bad are we so unlucky as to get two poor performers in a row or is our testing methodology out of whack somehow when we ran our original tests we made sure to use amd's recommended settings with fresh windows installs and most importantly fresh chipset driver installs that last part is much more important than usual because the pre-release chipset driver only installs the new performance optimizer and the awkwardly named ppm provisioning file driver when it detects a dual die x3d processor like the 7950x3d or 7900 x3d the release driver might behave the same way by the way so if you buy one of these as an upgrade double check to be sure we're gonna have purchase links down below these two tools are essential for getting the best performance out of these chips because only one of its two dies has 3d v cache and runs at a lower clock speed while the other is a standard cash die that's optimized for higher clock speeds performance optimizer then automatically promotes the appropriate dies course as the preferred cores in windows scheduler while the ppm provisioning file driver parks or puts to sleep the cores on the unused die games will then assuming everything's working properly typically gets sent to the 3d v cache die for best performance and as far as we can tell this is down to a simple integration with windows game mode and xbox game bar rather than any special sauce that's been cooked up by andy themselves an important thing to note though the driver does not disable the other die entirely and if enough threads are needed it will wake them up even if you're in game so it's worth noting that a 7900x 3d would wake up more often since each die has only six cores instead of eight unsurprisingly then if these features aren't working properly the windows scheduler is just flying blind unaware of the differences between the two processor dies and it'll end up ranking the best course based on the fastest available across the whole cpu something it can't rightly determine this can lead to situations where an app might run across multiple dies at once despite only needing one die's worth of cpu threads which can incur latency penalty since the dives will have to transfer data from cash to cash rather than accessing it directly now we confirmed that ours is definitely working correctly by comparing our data running stock versus having only one die manually enabled in the bios so you can see here that in games our performance numbers are roughly the same between stock and forcing the v cash die while forcing the frequency die often ran much slower all of which sounds totally normal and fine right with the right drivers x3d performs better for gaming what's the problem the problem is that it doesn't look at f122 at 4k with ray tracing enabled this is a really heavy gpu load so our cpu should easily be able to hit max boost but not the 7950x3d i mean we expect it to run at a lower clock speed than the 7950x but we didn't expect is this inconsistency i mean with adequate cooling both the 3900k and the 7950x are rock solid at 5.5 gigahertz but the x3d it's all over the place that ended up leading to lower gpu power and therefore lower gpu performance and when we looked at the cpu package power we can see why the 7950x3d in this gaming load is drawing less than half of its rated 120 watt tdp such low power draws certainly impressive but on a chip that advertises pinnacle-tier raw gaming performance it's not a behavior that we we want to see and our replacement chip behaved like this across three motherboards from three different vendors with multiple expo certified ram kits with fresh windows installs and even with different chipset drivers so there were two things wrong with amd's review kit to us the defective chip and the bad product positioning i mean if you like to drag race your 700 cpu at 1080p high hits the bee's knees but i think it's fair to say that most people with this kind of money are running 1440p monitors at least and probably don't mind turning on some in-game eye candy and for them our data simply doesn't support the conclusion that the ryzen 9 7950x3d is unquestionably the gaming performance monarch that isn't to say it's a bad chip amd in our mind just made the wrong call by calling out their less impressive and less defensible claims of performance leadership and instead we feel they should have put far more services on their true strength performance per watt i mean if we step back you are getting core i9 3900k ish performance for a substantial reduction in power consumption even in a gpu bound scenario like this one that's astounding mind-boggling even under a full prime 95 load the 13900k consistently pulls over 320 watts with the 7950x3d at less than half of that amd should be shouting this from the rooftops but instead they were so focused on the gaming performance crowd that we followed them down that rabbit hole expecting to find the same thing but as it turns out the dual die x3d chips work differently from most other cpus and it looks like the cores will aggressively try to clock down or even sleep whenever possible when they're not fully loaded and that would explain what we observed with our gpu bound scenario and with our 1440p results it would also explain where some of that lost tdp went our best guess here is that amd is airing on the side of caution when it comes to their x3d chips in order to keep them from redlining thanks to the 3d v cache being much more sensitive to voltage and to heat than a typical ryzen die this behavior of course means that there is some performance being left on the table and we can actually see some of that being clawed back with ryzen master's curve tuner function while it isn't the fully unlocked overclocking that we were promised for x3d going forward it does do a decent job of undervolting the chip allowing it to push higher frequencies more often the performance difference isn't night and day but you are more likely to see that performance leadership that amd is after assuming that your sample is more golden than yellow if you enable this function and in our gpu bound f1 run at 4k we can see that where the stock performance is all over the place it is much flatter with curved tuner enabled while also drawing even less power than it did before it's actually scary how efficient this chip is its performance characteristics like these which we first noticed to a lesser degree with the 65 watt non-x ryzen 7000 cpus that pushed us to start testing at multiple resolutions and that's the reason why we will continue to do so going forward it's also why we insist on re-running our tests with the latest drivers latest bios revisions and the same os date as of the date that we start testing a new product we've been doing that for years now and while it means we need to rush more to make these deadlines because we are retesting every time we're committed to giving you guys a lesser quantity maybe of truly up-to-date data versus a greater amount of outdated data the answer to the question then of whether the dual die x3d chips are worth the extra hundred dollars two weeks and 2300 words later is probably not if you need all of the strengths it brings to the table good gaming performance double-digit core counts and industry-leading power efficiency that's the big one then maybe but it comes at the cost of worse productivity performance relying on chipset drivers to manage the dissimilar dies and the inability to overclock in the traditional sense so i suspect that most people would be better off with the regular or x variants of the 7950 and 7900 or better off waiting for the 7800 x 3d but should be able to clock higher by putting more of its tdp towards its single die
