ladies and gentlemen today i got one of the best wins of my life you see i don't have a lot of opportunities to set records for myself or to make myself particularly happy in competitive chess those of you that are actively trying to go up and up the rating ladder know this struggle wins don't necessarily feel as sweet as losses feel painful and in today's video i'll be sharing a game with you that i played just a few hours ago in chess.com title tuesday tournament where i defeated the number one ranked blitz chess player in the world and overall the top five rated chess player in the world ali resa fua ali resa fua is the fastest ever human being to get to 2,800 elo in fact he beat magnus carlson's record he's currently 19 or 20 years of age i think 20 at this point and he's still frequently top three in the world he's also the highest rated blitz player in the world second is magnus carlson and third is hiar nakamura so i'd like to show you how i did it uh because games like this uh they don't come around in my career very often and actually this was part of a tournament on chess.com where i defeated a couple of other very very strong players i beat 2900 i beat a 3,000 rated player overall it was a very very good event for me uh and it's uh it's a fresh nice reminder for myself that i actually do know how to move the pieces to the squares and even though i definitely have extreme anxiety and psychological problems uh when it comes to competitive play sometimes my nerves hold together and you too can be 3100 chess.com rated players if you pre-order my book no i'm no uh results may vary um i started against ala with e4 i've been playing a lot of e4 recently but you know i can play whatever uh and also when you when you get a pairing like this you know mentally you're just like i'm going to lose so i'm going to play whatever i want oh also ali resa said that if i put him into a youtube video he would appreciate if i promoted his instagram so it will be in the description ala also uploads on youtube he also streams quite a bit and he's uh i think he's in fashion school i'm like not even joking so this guy's going to be a multifaceted individual anyway we played a carocon and i went for a fantasy uh the reason i played a fantasy variation is because earlier this year uh i did a tremendous amount of research on this opening uh while preparing it for my chessable course right because i have i have courses in in various locations the chessable one is is far more advanced than i would say that one's probably good for like 16,700 over the board so like and beyond uh and so fua played e6 the fantasy in my opinion is also one of the best ways to play against the caro khan there are many ways for black to respond the open fantasy goes like this uh the closed fantasy can go e6 or g6 so e6 knight c3 and he played bishop to b4 um and here i decided i was going to play a gambit um i'm going to be honest with you if ali resa played into the gambit i don't know how the game would have gone the gambit is a3 and b basically you allow black to take and you actually cannot take back you cannot take back due to queen h4 check which you weakened yourself when you played the fantasy but there's a gambit here that goes de knight h3 and then black plays something like knight f6 uh accepting the gambit is a little bit too dangerous and this line that goes queen a5 and then bishop d2 uh bishop d2 is actually not the best move i think it's bishop b2 and after knight c3 i think there's some move here like queen g i mean it's like very very complicated stuff but to my surprise alu went here i've actually never seen this move before um because most people who play bishop b4 go there with the intention of the knight dying so okay the bad news is i'm completely on my own against the person that is the highest rated blitz player in the world the good news is i assume i'm going to lose anyway so i'm kind of playing with like a blank slate so i developed my bishop to e3 uh and again the threat of take take take queen h4 doesn't quite scare me because i was going to do that anyway so he plays knight to e7 he doesn't play knight to f6 because that would actually allow me to play e5 and then b4 which is just a better french defense this is like me getting a french defense but also completely disallowing black from the major pawn break so knight e7 i developed my bishop to d3 uh and already i was getting very nervous actually i was getting very nervous that he was going to play this move e5 in the fantasy variation if black can make this big clash in the center of the board something is going to happen you'll notice i'm already spending a huge amount of time like 12 seconds on developing a bishop that it's mostly out of nerves that's not out of anything else so i develop my bishop he goes knight d7 clearly his position is kind of like a springboard like a trampoline like he's ready to to pounce at some moment uh and i play this move b4 cuz i thought now was a good moment to push his bishop backwards he's probably going to go here preparing e5 and then i was going to go here e5 and i was just going to castle and i was going to keep this tension just going to let him take me but he went bishop b6 which i i i don't know i mean i didn't particularly expect or not expect i was like oh okay so now the move e5 for him is obviously going to be very juicy cuz my bishop here is not defended by anything but having said that it's not particularly scary i could have chased after the bishop i thought i thought it was stupid because now my knight's here and his bishop just goes to a good square um so i played knight e2 and i mean again i'm fully expecting e5 but the good news is there's no threat there's no threat like i could just castle if he takes i can take with the bishop if he takes i can take with a knight like i'm i'm fine i mean i the position's not that bad that i'm lose i mean queen b6 i can just move my bishop back or move this knight here so knight e2 and now ali resa took i thought this was a not a bad move but i i i didn't really like it i think ali resa didn't want to castle and allow e5 i don't know actually now that i'm looking at that he would just take so i i don't and i don't actually know why he didn't but he he relieved the tension and i realized i don't have to take with the pawn i can take with the knight which creates two things number one one i can go here number two number one i can go there number two i can use my c pawn which um i think he helped me here a little bit i think this trade actually gave me more than it gave to him um he castled and now i should castle too i thought i should move my bishop to safety or castle i decided to castle without spending a huge amount of time and now okay it's like we both made you know 10 11 moves and uh and the position is um is equal which i knew and uh he's going to go here or here or here and i have to be ready right this is the part of the game where the best player in the world is going to beat the 2700 rated player uh i'm not you know and my classical rating is even more pitiful so uh ali resa played e5 this was his longest think of the game he played e5 and and now i i really thought for a while uh did i no 7 seconds i think i thought for a while a little bit later i was very nervous here i didn't know what to do i mean i thought about just reinforcing my center i thought about using my two pawns to go knight c5 i also thought about going knight d6 and grabbing that bishop but i really couldn't help like i thought that bishop was so bad like why am i spending so much time getting the bishop just to go i've got the two bishops i i don't know i i didn't so i thought you know what let's just keep it simple i' i've already he talked about him taking care is not that scary because i have good reinforcements so let me just move my bishop back to safety let me just keep the tension in the center then i will go here or here maybe this pawn will get to c5 in the future and with my bishop pointing there maybe i'll create some sort of attack so he took now was a big moment for me for again i wanted to just go knight d6 this was actually one of my first ideas i rejected it because of this and even though i get the bishop i'm never winning my pawn back so i did not do that so he took on d4 i thought okay it's better for me to take with the knight because if i take with the bishop then i'm going to have a really soft knight on that center square or i'm going to get hit with this diagonal attack and then knight e3 and that's just no good so i took with the knight and again i'm i'm as you can tell from the time usage i spent 23 of my seconds on that move it's just nerves because i was very nervous here about knight to e5 i was very nervous about this move and i thought look my knight is under attack he's pressuring my bishop and he's activating this bishop so confidence is already running low i'm like i don't like what i've done my pieces are loose in the center ali res is probably one of the best tactical players in the world right now why am i getting into a fight with a guy that's going to snipe me with one of his weapons right like this is very very and then i had this moment i went what if i give him my bishop so again more time i'm down a minute now a minute and a 3 minute game i'm down 33% of the a lot of time but i had this moment i was like i actually think him taking is better for me look at look and i'm right i mean it's like 0.05 but i'm i'm just going to move my rooks to the center and i didn't quite understand like if he plays knight f5 i was just going to play like rook d1 and uh you know if we have a huge trade i mean i think white is just doing very comfortably here very comfortable position white's going to put the knight on d6 i thought this was very nice for me i was like wait a minute i i i i don't think my position's all that bad i don't think it's all that bad but he plays knight d5 again in 6 seconds and and now i'm really i'm really stressed but then i was like okay i went here reren reb bolstering my center and ready to give away my bishop right i was ready to lose my bishop but then he didn't take it ali resa preferred that we had a horse convention in the center of the board so we get a horse cube when's the last time you saw a horse cube probably never cuz knights are traded very early horse cube there you go beautiful stuff and then i went you know what ali resa you're not getting my bishop anymore you just can't have my bishop so what i want to do here cuz neither one of us has a center pawn is we want to use the center as a springboard like we want to bulldoze the center dominate the center plant pieces in the center and that's how we want to win the game here he played a move i didn't think was was particularly strong i mean it's a normal move he played rookie eight the evaluation stays equal and he but i thought he needed to do something a little bit more emphatic like i didn't quite know what though cuz if knight c4 are trying to go here i'll just play queen e2 and he has to leave um so bishop c2 he put his rook here and i went i really like bishop b3 i really like this move because now nothing can go here and i'm going to go c4 and c5 like if he goes h6 my next move was going to be c4 and then i thought his knight's got to move and then i'll play c5 and you know i'll have the diagonal so i thought bishop c2 rook e8 bishop b3 4 seconds for me that's that's a miracle and now things got real bad here aldi resa thought for a while here and he decided i am going to bury gotham chess all right we have a totally symmetrical position the position is about balanced now it's time to provoke this is how good players defeat good players this is how really good chess players defeat just good chess players h5 now the computer is sitting there going what an idiotic move right h who cares about this right the best move according to stockfish is a5 the point is you need to provoke you need some sort of provocation and the pawn's trying to go here if i respond now i'm weakening my own king so i need to do something that does not respond but does something better i need it to strike back in the center i need it to go with my playing but i got a little nervous i didn't like this i didn't like the knights and i thought if i achieve all of this he's going to attack me i mean he's like i i i stop myself you know because look at this this looks very computer's not computer just says go here idiot but i didn't want to do this who would allow this stockfish stockfish would allow this so i decided i'm going to slide my king to the corner so my king is off this diagonal you'll notice i spent three seconds i just to play that move pretty quickly but now but here comes ali rza knocking on the door knocking on the door he's trying to play h3 do i play h3 i don't think so because then the bishop's targeting my pawn i don't know in fact he can sack he can sacrifice and it's actually really difficult to defend myself king g2 there's knight f4 check i lose and if i play king h2 he still has knight f4 i was like oh my god what do i do i mean i got to stop knight f4 right so i played queen d2 i spent 34 seconds on this move 47 seconds remaining and i thought oh it's over i thought that i messed it up i messed it up um because now he's going to play h3 and i realized right here i made a i made a slight mistake um there's a little sequence here that wins him upon i thought h3 g3 and there's nothing so he played h3 now the computer here is such a scumbag it says just take just take and play rook g1 and actually attack black i could have never done that in the million years that that's terrifying i mean maybe if i'm playing somebody my elo my friends my heart is pounding at this point right terrifying so i play g3 i'm like i'm not getting mated and i realized i've made a mistake i realized i made a mistake because i thought here i had night takes takes takes c4 but that's defended he could just move that right he just move that's what i thought the computer gives something even stronger is even more brutal i thought oh man and then he thought and he went here you'll notice he spent 34 seconds and i thought oh that's it but on his time while he was thinking here i realized that if ali reza sacrifices his knight and goes here i can actually put my knight on g5 it's seen by the queen but my queen sees the knight as well the knight attacks the rook everything is opening up the knights are gone take take when that knight moved there the bishop started seeing each other the knight will go to g5 attacking the rook on e4 the knight is also looking at f7 which is going to be opened up by the rook as well if the bishop moves and i can play c4 which hits the knight and then my queen would see the queen which is you see what i'm getting at this is a head spinning position but ali resa goes for it rook takes on e4 and now i played knight g5 now according to stockfish i should have played this move first but i went with my plan i only have 40 seconds i got to think quickly and aliv resa goes rook e7 and i realized something here i realized i have a forced sequence of moves that wins me the game in a total panic i have 38 seconds on the clock i am in total panic mode the force sequence of moves begins with one of the most forcing moves in chess which is a capture i don't have any checks so i play i thought if i take he has to take with a queen because if he takes with the queen he's unpinned he can't take with the knight because i take his queen he can't take with the pawn because i play c4 turns out i'm an idiot and stockfish just finds rook e 3 which and if i like go bishop c2 for example he t i mean rook e3 is so it disconnects i shut up stockfish i thought i was very clever and i thought he has to play queen takes b6 he also clearly thought he had to play that because he spent the second we both missed rook two e3 and then i realized wait a minute how does ali reza stop checkmate if he plays knight f6 i just take i just take and then it's check mate and i went wait a minute look at my time 19 seconds on the clock heart [music] pounding i can barely move the mouse can barely move the mouse he plays g6 and i realize i can sacrifice the rook rook takes f7 how are you going to beat the man who's number one in the world in speed chess you got to you got to do the only move you know how to do sacrifice the rook now the incredible thing is i can also sacrifice my knight the point is that queen g6 is falling this queen is far away and even though my king has no legal moves nobody is actually threatening him so i've realized wait a minute i can take his bishop slide one square forward and point my cannon over here and there's nothing he can do g6 and i sacrificed the rook the game is over i thought but i realized he has one and only one defensive move rook takes f7 loses i play queen takes g6 this is mate this is mate this is mate simple and straightforward rook takes f7 looks like a knockout punch the only way for ali reza not to lose the game and i saw it the counter punch bishop to f5 and now i am in some trouble because my queen is hanging and my rook actually can be taken but i plan that again if he didn't take my rook the first time i was going to sacrifice it again the rook gets a pawn a bishop and another pawn so takes and now queen takes f5 9 seconds remaining on the clock versus 30 now remember it's title tuesday we get a little bit of bonus time every single move at this point i'm in full panic mode but i know i'm not winning i know i'm not winning i know that his defenses are about to be built up and while i have good pressure the pawn is still protecting my king's escape and i'm like okay i just need to stay focused ali resa plays the only move because he's so good at blitz he plays queen to e3 you see if ali resa tried to defend his knight then i would have played rook f1 or queen g6 and he wouldn't be able to defend himself much longer he had to play the only move in the position which is queen to [music] e3 the idea is to cover e six so queen g6 i actually lose i have to trade queens and try to survive an end game so queen to e3 and he's got eyes there and he's threatening mate this is mate on e1 if i take it i would have to go back with my queen to block so what do i do in this position i play rook f1 with eight seconds remaining i bring my rook to the party i'm making sure nobody can get to me on the f file i've got queen g6 ideas i'm also ready to come back and take if i have to take i'm going to do it also i can take on d5 but i just don't want to yet i'm keeping the tension i'm saving that for the right moment now he can probably bring his queen back he can take on c3 al resa plays rook g7 protecting his king and i realized here i can do this now my friends i played that move with two seconds on the clock title tuesday is 3 minute blitz with 1 second bonus i think yeah i had two seconds of them i could barely make these moves i have 3 seconds remaining do you understand how stressful it is to play this move and now you're sitting there waiting for you you don't know if he's going to go here you know if he's going to go here you have no idea what he's going to do he plays rookie eight my time starts ticking he's got 6 seconds remaining i know that i'm i'm i'm i'm getting back into the game i have a bishop and two pawns for the rook and he's and i'm like do do i take on d5 and then i'm like wait a minute all i have to do here all that's going through my head is don't hang any pieces and watch out for checks knight f4 played with 1.6 i played this move with less than 1 second remaining on the clock my time was almost at zero i i shook i shook i shook and i made it to the f4 square and it's the best move because now i'm getting to this knight if he plays queen takes c3 i can take if he goes here i have this and i win if he does this it's also m in a few moves knight f4 ali resa realized that i'm now blocking my own path he played rook f7 i i have 1.6 seconds to make this move there is a winning move in this position which is queen to takes f7 but i have 1 and a half seconds to to even make a move a legal move so i go here i played that move with1 seconds on the clock one and i'm pinning him to his king and now i know that his next move is going to be this if in this position al res went queen g1 i would have lost because i was just i didn't know what to do like i so he took and with 0.1 and he made that move with 7 by the way i just i knew i had to give him a check there's a winning tactic here by the way which is sacrificing the queen and then going here so now this check and the queen is hanging bishop takes d5 c takes d5 and i just had to give him any check possible so i gave him this check queen g6 now it's back to equality the way i had to win this was again i had to sack the queen or i had to go here so that when he blocks i have queen d5 but now the position is likely back to equ quality it is a crazy scramble he plays king to f8 again i can sacrifice the queen but it's full panic mode it's just don't lose on time i made that move with 0.5 seconds and i think ali resa here realized that if he plays king g8 it might be a draw and i might even check him enough to win some pawns so he decided to make a run for it but unfortunately that walks directly into knight takes d5 which is a fork which wins me the queen and i made this move again with 0.5 seconds on the clock and in this position ali resa resigned he probably could have tried to flag me but this is a tough one because i would have pre moved a little bit i would have given a few checks i would have gotten up to about four or five seconds and then i would have managed to win this game but oh my god the heart rate was pounding oh goodness me um i didn't even realize i played this move with 0.1 this move caught me so off guard and and and this is the world's easiest tactic to find in a puzzle when you have 1 second remaining against the guy this good my heart i just can't take it like i'm in utter utter shock like i am just but i won i managed to keep it together just long enough and uh i beat a top three player in the world i think he's number three classical and he's number one in the world in blitz and um he is the fastest ever player to cross 2700 and um you should follow him on instagram because he's the man he's number five in the world but it's by three rating points so um sometimes it's nice to have a result like this for me because uh i don't particularly think so highly of my chess skills anymore uh and uh i would love to get the grandmaster title one day but unfortunately too many things would have to go right uh but it's it's nice sometimes to get a reminder that i do know how to play chess so i was speechless for like five minutes after this game happened so gg alza and i'm sure that the next nine times we play or 10 times we play the result will go differently couple draws maybe that's all i have for you today you know where to find me if you want courses or the book get out of here
