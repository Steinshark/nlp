ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the fed chess grand swiss this is the 10th round out of 11 and the top two finishers of this tournament will make it to the candidates which is the tournament that determines who is going to play for the world chess championship my friends first of all i'd like to apologize i'm uploading this recap at nearly 10:00 at night that is because today uh there was an in-person fan event in new york city uh so shout out to the over 300 of you uh who i spent some time with i was there for 7 hours today i was very tired signed books took photos with people chatted to so many people uh with so many people and um then i had to get some dinner and now i'm back home this round was absolutely insane hikaro versus fabiano basically for all the marbles i'm going to show you seven games of action all of which had a winner all of which had a loser and a very quick announcement the fan events here in new york city have been doing so well so i'd like to give you a very early teaser there will be a bunch of book and fan events in london and in toronto london is in november roughly 16 through 22nd i'm going to london uk prepare yourselves and toronto toronto will be in december that's all for now so if you're in those cities if you're not in those cities but you will go to those cities for the event there you go let's get excited it's been amazing to see all the people coming out kids as young as four and five gentleman uh today i spoke with uh was i think up up near 80 years old uh and a couple of 60s and 70s in there so just incredible to see thank you all so much for playing chess uh thank you all for getting this book and if you haven't gotten this book yet yeah you still have the holiday season ask somebody to get it for you for christmas my friends there is really not much of a way to spoil this uh so i'm just going to come right out and say it what hikaro nakamura did today was nothing short of absolutely sensational i am absolutely blown away uh constantly by this man's just competitive swagger uh you know he's near he's nearing 40 years of age and uh and chz that that really is like that is a lot i mean you you are running up the miles he has been playing this game professionally for decades and um he constantly finds a way to get it done hikaru tied for first versus fabiano caruana and i got to tell you my friends when i saw this opening the four nights i thought hikaro was just trying to make a draw like you don't play the four knights at top level to get an advantage it's just not what you do so when i saw this i went oh it's just going to be a very quick game some of you may be wondering like why is that well i'm not going to get into all the specifics but fabiano played you know he played this fabiano did not play knight c6 i'm i am very curious you know like what what hik caro's answer was going to be here would he have played the four nights anyway i'd like to think he might have but knight f6 is what fabby chooses and we get knight c3 knight c6 and then we have d4 takes takes bishop b4 all of this has been played many times before d5 and now you know there's a line here castles karu takes black castles and now before you take uh u castle c takes d5 and now several lines here for example queen f3 uh is one line i know bishop g5 is is some line as well and hearo plays this move h3 first so he prevents everything from coming here and he keeps some pieces on the board right he plays just a very very solid approach and we just have an opportunity for a technical feast it's going to be a technical game he car is going to bring his bishop maybe bring his rooks put some pressure on black's position of course position is completely equal this is not something you play for advantage fab plays c5 so fabiano still in his prep so is hikaru with rook d1 and ideas to pressure here bishop to g5 and now we see bishop takes knight now i would imagine that maybe rook d1 is more of a sideline than something like bishop to g5 because fabiano spends 14 minutes which is a big surprise you know in the opening for fabi now white can play no less than like rook c8 queen e7 apparently bishop a5 is possible there's many moves possible here uh but if black kind of waits white will play knight a4 that is the key idea and the bishop is sort of stuck to protect this pawn and you can't play c4 because that's the entire reason white move the rook here so fabbi damages hikaru's pawns and hikaru plays bishop g5 and now fabby plays this move knight e4 so the idea is that after something like takes takes and takes the queen no longer guards that queen c3 we're going to trade a bunch of pieces and we are all going to go uh home but he car goes queen g3 okay and you'll notice hikaro hasn't spent any time yet queen a5 hikaro plays bishop g5 you cannot actually take this pawn by the way in case anybody's wondering because bishop takes discovered attack so knight kn e4 takes takes plays queen g3 and the golden rule is like opposite colored bishops favor the attacking side right so for example if black plays like rook c8 white will play bishop f6 and as you see from the eval white is completely winning white is completely winning because that's mate this is no longer mate but you'll go queen g5 and there's literally no way to stop that so um the only way to actually stop that is to sack the queen and then play f6 at which point you are down a queen and everybody's asking why you haven't resigned yet plus l plus bozo plus ratio so king a is what fabby plays and hikaru plays a4 you will notice he spent 2 minutes so hikaru still knows the top hen should move in this position the opening preparation has led to a position of opposite colored bishops which means there are good attacking possibilities for both players hikaro plays a4 fabby plays rook e8 hikaro plays rook d6 now there he spent about four minutes yeah but he probably was aware that this is a key idea so the other computer idea is rook db1 and play here because because black can't play rook b8 because he would be blundering a rook so essentially hikaru just has what we call pressure you know how do you tell in chess you have pressure um you're it's very difficult for the opponent to make moves with their pieces and there is much more of a sense of danger to one side like this king is vibing all right that is a professional evaluation of white's position the king is vibing faby plays h6 also as you can tell the guy down 30 minutes is probably under pressure h6 apparently a mistake apparently the computer wanted rook b8 at which point hikaro might have rerouted again to put some pressure something like you know let's say bishop f4 here and then black apparently you know cannot go in with b2 because of rook c6 which is a move that i cannot really fully explain to anybody but uh you know i'm sort of forced to because i'm the recap guy uh and then i think you're trying to play bishop to you know e5 uh or bishop c7 which by the way traps the queen which i guess i sort of you know facilitated a little bit but essentially fabby plays here and hikaru just very casually like you know sets up pressure on black's position and and here's something really weird happens fabiano plays rook c8 he spends 15 minutes on this move and these two are pointed at the pawn so bishop and queen make what's called a battery which is when two pieces attack on the same line or diagonal and a sacrifice in front of an enemy king like this is very juicy but you don't really want to play it unless you have backup bobby one of the best calculators in the world plays rook c8 and hikaru takes on h6 and fabby plays f6 and that was clearly his idea uh g takes h6 is not possible because after king g8 you go check threatening this and if king f8 which looks nice um you can play queen f6 and you're threatening unstoppable things over here so it's a very difficult position for black fabby plays f6 hikaru takes another pawn now this is hanging queen c3 rook d1 you still cannot take here because i will take on e6 so rook e8 yaro plays rook d8 queen h4 and rook d3 and the attack is swirling but fabiano is making a comeback bishop h7 rook d7 look at this have you ever seen something like that it's a rook cube g5 fabiano striking back but here comes queen g3 queen b1 check apparently a mistake black has to play rook takes rook takes and apparently queen a4 not easy to spot all right now we have rook e7 rook d8 but look at hikaru so active queen f4 check we go to an end game but it's only better for hikaru who grabs the pawn on f6 bishop b1 rook g7 the king goes to f8 hikaru gets this king g7 and he goes for the pawn f3 g4 two connected pass pawns the pawns will run the bishop will come here and ladies and gentlemen on the 40th move of the game fabiano carana resigned and he resigned because hikaro is going to put his bishop right here and he's going to push these pawns and there is not a thing that black can do about it bishop c3 the bishop can't get that both these pawns are stopped these pawns are staring into each other ladies and gentlemen hikaro has just defeated fabiano caruana that that is crazy fabiano was 2800 during this tournament and hikaru just made it look pretty straightforward hikaru is in first place with one round to go and i got news for you he has company that was nowhere near the end of this recap again i am blown away by hikaru's ability um i listen i will heap tons of praise on the man that like that like i know what it's like to struggle in competitive setting and uh this man just finds a way every single time it is really really really impressive and there's a lot of pressure on his shoulders and a lot of people are watching vidit gti bugan daniel deak romania versus india bugan playing in a way where he pushes vidit back on the queen side and then in this position vidit played his move of the tournament this man said i'm going to start an attack with the pawns on the same side of the damn board bishop e2 knight a bishop takes e4 first knight takes e4 he sacrifices a full bishop to get the knights dancing in the center of the board look at that white has to sacrifice the knight back so that his bishop on e2 stays defended look at this bishop g7 aid is going to play f5 vid's gonna play f5 or he's gonna go here but the position is still very complicated vid grabs a pawn look at that sliding across the edge of the board knight c4 knight d3 both of the queens are feeling a little bit of danger right now takes takes white grabs the pawn on d6 vid is a pawn up knight c4 white stops the attack vidit plays b5 excuse me dak plays b5 takes takes and now in this position 4 minutes versus 36 seconds for white bit it the side h5 he is trying to attack h3 takes takes de gives the gives away the pawn for a pawn rook what a move by vidit look at this putting pressure the rook is going that way as well here comes vidit knight the knight jumps around h2 on the board and now the players make the 40th move we go to an endgame bishop 2 a5 attacks the rook rook f8 and here for a reason i cannot fully explain de plays here and i don't think he should have done that because that allows black to get a pawn and let me tell you that pawn that becomes the problem now suddenly it's very difficult for deok to move the knight jumping that pawn is going to start moving at some point that pawn is going to start moving at some point it's going to start moving at some point and the second that it did move deak had to resign he resigned because d2 is unstoppable rook e1 knight g3 just bishop c5 is going to anchor the king you can stop the pawn but it's impossible to stop the rest of black's attack knight takes d2 rook takes e1 and if bishop takes d2 knight takes g3 is mate my friends vided krai is tied with hikaru for first place with one round to go and and and the winner of this game is also tied for first with hikaru and vided i mean there is a winner in every damn game today d4 knight f6 andre yeno young russian grandmas versus par makulu young iranian grandmaster we have a catalan bishop d2 yesi peno has played many many openings in this tournament h6 a very provocative sideline queen c2 played by yes panko black play c6 a knight d7 a kg approach rook d1 a5 taking a little bit of space white developing in a very principled way now yeno says you know what all my pieces are set up i'm jumping into black's position spends 20 minutes carefully analyzing all of the variations of this move just for a balding international master clown sitting across halfway across the planet to just yell about it in like half a second he spent 20 minutes crafting that move knight takes e5 d takes e5 param completely in his prep look at this pam is not thinking everything that pam has done has been played instantly he is not spending any time at all e4 d4 pawn sacrifice rook d4 bishop c5 by param finally spending a little bit of time one thing i have to tell you by the way why would you play a variation where you don't think at all and then when you lose the pawn you start thinking i think he was probably deciding between g5 and bishop c5 or he was locked in the toilet but yeah yes that's the idea here you push white backwards and basically black says well i am down upon pa but i'm probably going to win this one back because i'm going to unpin myself and then you know now we have the following position and you know andrea is down 30 minutes but uh he's got a very nice position he grabs the bishop and he just have a very slightly better position it's ab versus efgh you can see the bishops right so what is white going to do white is going to expand on that side of the board and black really weakened himself so param chose a really really really random moment to play one of his most aggressive lines of the tournament i mean my friends the catalan is the most solid opening in chess it just is you don't mess with a catalan like this i mean it's like why like why i mean look at this i this is crazy but baram clearly did it with a reason he wanted to beat yip peno and yes peno said bro you can't play like this against me queen f3 i beat magnus carlson jeno was like bro there's literally a clip on youtube called the feeling of beating the world champion and it's named after me rook g8 look at this rook d6 just slowly encroaching on black's position look at look at the overextension here this is called overextended you push too many pawns too many weaknesses back there and now it's time for the house of cards to collapse h3 rook takes d6 bishop takes d6 the queen gets out of the way we don't want to trade queens cuz we're better queen g7 we bring another rook to d6 because the pawns you lose the pawn on b2 but now takes takes bishop f3 and you can't really go backwards because i'm going to play e5 and then i'm going to try to play bishop e4 he tries to sacrifice the rook look at this but now rook d4 comes back sealing off the queen the king goes to safety the queen's pressuring but the bishop comes to e5 this is absurd by the way that the rook is just not being taken bishop takes e4 and param makulu spends seven minutes and makes a fatal mistake instead of bishop takes e4 he had to take with the rook that's what he had to do because after bishop takes bishop takes takes there's pressure f3 the bishop goes back but if you take with the bishop first rook d1 and the queen is now deflected off of the back rank i take the rook rook d8 and in this position baram resigned because you cannot stop the attack on the king if here rook g8 if here that's mate if here that's mate if here there and then that's mate bishop e five b should be four we play just a couple more moves and param makulu resigns to andre yeno my friends it is a three-way tie for first hikaro vidit yeno hikaro has played all these guys already all tied for first this is crazy now i've got three games for three guys that was a windows notification sound i am very sorry about that that was my computer it's trying to tell me that i've got to you know do those uh you know those updates uh my friends three games for who's in second there are three players who are half a point out of first place they could play the roles of spoiler that would be absolutely insane one more game i have for you by the way prag nanda ramesh babu the famous indian superstar his older sister vali ramesh babu all eyes on her winning the women's grand uh the f grand swiss and she is 10 points away from becoming a grand master she's gained 30 rating points in the past 30 days what have you done in the past 30 days e4 she's playing tanong y one of the top seeds from china we have a classical sicilian this is called the r rza variation bishop d7 knight takes bishop takes bishop takes pawn takes bishop to b5 looking to make some trades and when the dust settles white gets a very pleasant position she's clearly sacrificing the pawn on b2 for reasons i cannot fully explain i think it's to try to trap the rook and if takes takes white has clearly some very strong attack so black plays queen g4 white does not allow her pawn to be taken and a very obscure position arises where tanong y just doesn't castle both her rooks are involved in the game but the king is just completely in the center a3 the rook goes back look at black just very k shut uh shut up it's a very ky shut up it's like a kid who does doesn't he's saying shut up but he can't really say you know shut up bishop h4 queen d2 black plays d5 look at this web web of pawns in the center vali kicks out the queen and takes queen takes f5 the knight is rerouting the knight is ready to go to d4 maybe pawn g4 in the future rook e three uhoh uhoh rook e s defending the king now queen before uhoh oh the queen's venturing out remember a couple of moves ago i told you that white could all of a sudden create some sort of attack out of thin air this is incredible stuff this is high high high high level chess pushing the pawns in front of your king cuz you realize there is no attack this pawn is hanging but it cannot be taken cuz he can't get through can't get through i'm going to go knight d4 knight c6 knight f5 i'm just going to be completely winning so instead of that tanong plays h5 but now i'm still taking h g4 and it's a race it's a race against time king d7 you lose the pawn on a7 with a check the king runs you give a check the king runs you give a check are we going to make a draw queen a6 king c7 no knight to f4 the queen slides back now you start repeating the checks you do a couple of more checks because you only have one minute on the clock king d7 queen b7 she grabs another pawn on c6 rook c7 both sides in a time trouble and dust settles by shal's three pawns up they each get the next time control rook e3 this is game over by sh wins again she just took down a 257 rated player she is now officially one of the winners of the women's f grand swiss mathematically speaking she could lose her next round and she still makes it she's still a top two finisher for the first time i think in chess history a brother and a sister are both playing in the candidates tournament v shali has just qualified to play the women's candidates prag is playing in the open candidates this is crazy what that has definitely never happened before i mean unless i'm like i don't know unless i'm an idiot but i'm pretty sure that's never happened before my friends there are three oh and she is 2498 and a half she's one and a half rating points away from becoming a grandmaster she has three norms she's 2498 she's gone up 10 international rankings in the last month it's insane completely insane quick summary of these other three games vincent kima versus vladimir fv this one a queens indian both sides castling very traditional stuff remember the win winners of these matchups are half a point away from the championship we get a game where there basically is a closed off center rook c1 and kimer goes and attacks kimer goes and attacks bishop f1 brings the queen over g5 there he is look at him look at him going in look at a very provocative approach from f of trying to flip the script and he tries to bring his queen over to h7 but h5 h6 is a weakness knight to h4 knight to g6 all the forward momentum is with kimer but f have one of the best defensive players in the world very creative guy bishop on b7 bishop on d6 lot of pieces firing this way knight e8 will kimer hold his nerves bishop f3 e5 oh my goodness so many pieces are staring at each other but the knight comes in he grabs it bishop takes the king slides out of the way the bishop slides out of danger rook takes g4 f takes queen takes g4 the bishop is hanging but you can't really take it but that bishop is hanging and there's a discovered check queen g2 rook g1 there it is the legendary famous tactic of double check he takes queen g6 i think you can tell from the eval it's the cleanup crew for vincent kimer and it takes 49 moves but he grabs another pawn you cannot take because of this the h pawn will promote vincent kimer is in second place three guys are tied for first vincent kimer just takes down vladimir fv tomorrow he can play for spoil sam seon arjin eri another two guys this is a queen's gambit accepted triangle is thing and my man arjin ari plays a note boom this is one of the most theoretically complicated openings in chess where black gets connected past pawns but white has a very very nice spatial position bishop's powerful center but look at this a4 look at this a4 move you can't take it because of queen c6 both guys spending a lot of time in the opening d5 aggressive move b3 the pawns are knocking on the door he takes he removes the defenders he's going for a checkmate f5 and he has a draw he's got a draw in hand queen g5 king h8 this a draw ar generary guys he tried his best but sometimes there is nothing to be done instead of a draw sean plays for a win but what are you going to do about f6 apparently knight d4 e takes d5 and seon might be better he can grab the pawn on f5 he takes it with his queen and in comes the knight to e6 and in comes the pawn to d5 but but let's not forget if these pawns survive the apocalypse black complete black is winning black is winning kn oh we're going to an end game this might be bad news arigi goes directly into an end game and even though seon can win a pawn b2 rook b8 how are you going to stop the pawn knight b7 rook c2 oh my goodness how are you going to stop the pawn how are you going to stop the pawn how are you going to stop the pawn he failed he failed to stop the pawn rook c1 was played in this position and the game ended i don't know if seon lost on time here g4 is still possible he might have just resigned but i don't think so b1 queen rook takes takes and i'm assuming he resigned because he did not want to play a position where he's going to be down a rook but it's over and seon had a draw but instead decided he was he was going for it and he tried his best but black did his those pawns survived and arjin regi is also tied for second place and last game of the day alexander prka yuri kuzubov queen's gambit declined these guys also play a very they play a long theoretical variation which ends in this position and white is going to try to break free like this there it is f3 very common in the kings in the queens gambit decline rook f3 rook e1 tried to play e4 e5 knight f5 all this good stuff here comes the h pawn and here comes black playing b5 look at kuzubov calling the shots with his b pawn and his h pawn and then he gets in on seven pr kuzov takes with check brings the queen and even gets the pawn on h3 look at this this is hitting everybody these pieces are staring over here but rook back to f5 blocking the bishop and the queen's view of the knight so takes check and white gets two pieces for the rook but he's going to lose his knight but you can't take the knight cuz if you take the knight it's check and mate oh my goodness oh my goodness so pawn to g6 from kabov but now rook f4 he's going for the pawn queen f7 check queen to f6 with checkmating possibilities queen e2 and in the time trouble kuzov has to lose the the queen and it's queen and knight versus two rooks g3 g5 queen g7 this is mate you can play g4 i will take i will win your rook so in this position alexander prka resigned my friends here are your standings after round 10 vali rames babu has one all but one per section if she loses only but uh batag can uh take her spot but she does not have a strong enough tie break and obviously remember top two finishers that's why the standings matter these standings matter andreasen hiar guati are tied for first place with seven and a half prka ari kim are the only sevens those are the only guys that can ruin this tournament wow that's all i have for you today it is now 10:00 at
