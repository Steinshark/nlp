all right welcome back to the show today guys so i have some pretty uh exciting news to share today actually today i got promoted to software engineer 2. um if you don't know what that means essentially there's a leveling system there's software engineer one software engineer two senior principal staff it depends on the company every every company is a little bit different and it's also weird because at microsoft within those promotions like with between software engineer one and software engineer two you have to get promoted twice it's a bit of a weird system so i'm not gonna go into it too much maybe i'll do that for another video but the point is that i've been at this company for two years and i've gotten two promotions one every single year um and today i want to share a little bit about how i've done that how i've managed that so stick around for the last one because in true youtube form the best one is at the end and if you follow the last one you could get away with just following the last rule and no other rules these may seem a little obvious at first but listen through them because i think uh i i bet you're gonna learn something and if you don't well your money back you get it because it's for never mind just a small disclaimer i understand that the the pace of one promotion every single year can't keep up forever or else i would be taking satya's job in like 10 years i think there are five components to getting a promotion so i'm gonna go through them one by one uh the first one i would say is responsibility so take as much responsibility as you can rarely if ever use the words it's not my fault in fact i don't think i've ever used those words at my job and i don't plan on ever using those words when you don't accept responsibility for something you admit that that thing is out of your control and when you admit something is out of your control um you can't really prevent it or you can't prevent against it so when you take as much responsibility as possible you're basically accepting that there are things that you could be doing the statement changes from it's not my fault to how can i prevent this next time so it's a bit of a mind shift a mind shift a mind what a mind state shift now when you're on a job when you're working at a place like microsoft there are definitely going to be times when other t when it when it really is other people's fault other teams broke you other services broke you and it'd be very easy to just say oh that's not our fault but in reality there's always something you could be doing right like if a partner team goes down there should be a way of detecting that there should be a way of of alerting you so you can alert them or alerting them directly or or some kind of built-in retry like there's always something that you could be doing so it is my fault or at least it is it's my fault that this outcome happened uh even if i wasn't the one that set all the events into motion and and managers love to see that kind of responsibility so the second one i want to talk about is accountability and with accountability um this one is is kind of similar but don't be afraid to say something is your fault in in the tech world people often use the word we when there's a problem so i'll give you an example um i caused a problem in one of my first months and everybody was saying we should have done this differently and we did this incorrectly and we should be doing this next time but you know in the back of their minds they are thinking it was you that did that right they're thinking it wasn't we it was it was jason it was you um so i think the best thing you can do is just confront that and address it uh if you confront that with saying hey guys like this was actually me that did this this was my fault this is why i did it and this is what i learned from it um you're going to see this this dynamic shift and what's going to happen is instead of you defending yourself they are going to defend you so if you say it was my fault what will happen is the team will say no it's not your fault like uh you know we didn't tell you this or this isn't well documented or we should have a better process around this what will happen is they will verbally say no this isn't your fault and they're really going to believe that so that that dynamic shift from actually being accountable it's it's really powerful uh the next one i want to discuss is dependability and this is kind of the one that you would think about when you know people talk about work-life balance and being always on and always having your phone on and so i hate to talk about this one because if you leave your phone on and your phone is always plugged into work this one is going to be easier i hate to say it i know that you know everybody wants a great work-life balance but if you leave your phone on then it's going to be easier at work you'll probably have this concept of being on call which is essentially you know somebody is responsible for the service for a given week so i'm on call right now actually if my phone rings and says hey your service is down i have to shut off the camera take out my work stuff and fix it um but i'm not always on call obviously now when you get out of university you're most likely not going to have very many responsibilities like probably just rent and student debt and world hunger and social justice um but but in reality you're probably not gonna have too many like direct responsibilities so if it's a saturday morning and you know the on-call the on-call person gets a phone call and they're working on something and you're just kind of sitting at home if you're not doing anything else just jump on and help them solve the problem i mean it's that simple like if you're available help and uh it'll do more than you think because not only does it show that you're a dependable person and that you are helping the team but it's also going to teach you a lot about your service because you're going to be on call one day and when your service goes down you're going to go oh yeah i remember my co-worker had this problem a month ago and you'll know how to fix it or just in general you'll learn about parts of your service that maybe you were never exposed to before so the more input the better really and then lastly obviously the person that you're jumping in and helping is just gonna really appreciate you and they're gonna say that to your boss and that's just gonna make you look great uh the next one i would say is be humble and thank people often now before you go oh jason obviously i thank people i mean i'm canadian i think people for i think people for being rude to me it's weird like let's say somebody helps you right obviously you're gonna thank them but what you should be doing is thanking them publicly so for example let's say bill helps me do something i don't know anyone named bill but let's say bill helps me do something i could say thanks bill you know hang up the phone and that's it but what i'll do is the next day at our morning meeting which is called stand up um i will say hey yesterday i was working on this bill helped me and you know he he gave up part of his day and he you know put aside his deliverables to help me uh so i appreciate that thanks for your help now this is gonna this is actually really really powerful so first off the boss is going to hear that bill is helping the team and so the boss is going to take note of that so that's going to help bill get his next promotion bill is going to feel good because he was publicly praised in front of the team and the boss so the next time you need help bill is more likely to give it to you and not even just that they he wouldn't because you know teammates tend to be very helpful but subconsciously he's gonna want to do it it's simple really at the end of the day now a lot of people miss this one because they're kind of shy so maybe they're like it's their turn to speak and stand up and they're kind of like oh what do i say and maybe maybe it'll be stupid maybe he'll be like oh it was nothing just thank people like it's really easy don't be timid about it just just thank him so this last one like i said uh this last one if you follow this one you don't have to follow any of the other ones and there are plenty of examples of people like this at microsoft um i mean you should follow the other ones but if you follow just this one you'll be fine and this one is be curious and take ownership so the easiest way to to get yourself a promotion is to become indispensable right and the best way to become indispensable is to find parts of your system of your service of your organization that have been ignored and to become an expert in them so generally speaking people avoid what they find boring or what they find confusing and that one's important so they'll they'll tend to ignore it as opposed to facing it and figuring it out so if you're curious and somebody says like ah you know this part of our system nobody likes to go into it because there's always problems that's a great indicator like oh i need to become an expert in this thing and uh when you first start your job you're going to be coming to your co-workers all the time right you're not an expert in anything so no one asks you questions you ask all the questions now once you make this change and you become an expert and part of the service especially one that other people don't like they are going to be coming to you and you're going to become indispensable to the team because over the years you're going to pick up all of these different little things people don't like certificates people don't like this code that hasn't been maintained in three years people don't like this people don't like that and so you pick it up you pick it up and over time you know two or three years passes and all of a sudden people are like wow if jason left the team today like we'd kind of be screwed and your team's going to love you for it too because they don't want to deal with it in the first place so i hope you guys enjoy this episode uh if you
