foreign [music] [music] for a long time i thought grading was all about years and years of practice but now as you can see if you just buy enough stuff you can be a professional colorist too that's exactly how it works yeah that's exactly it okay so i'm here with my friend alex he is a colorist based here in vancouver he's worked for all sorts of big name clients like bmw and hennessy neutrogena all sorts of big clients alex is like a top top tier pro i'm always bothering him with questions about color grading so i figured instead of just harassing him over instagram dms i would just make this video instead so that you can all hear what he has to say about coloring the first question that i know a lot of you might have is about whether or not you should be using log shooting and log footage or if you should be shooting in the baked in color profiles so alex like right off the bat for people who are just getting into this what is the basic difference between log footage and those baked in profiles that come with your camera so if you want to delve into color grading if you want to start upping the level of your production you definitely need to start shooting and log if you shoot in one of the profiles it might look good straight out of the camera but it gives you no versatility to play with the image if you shoot in lug however you can recover highlights you can recover shadows and it just gives you more data and your picture quality would just be better so one of the downsides of log is that right out of the camera it looks pretty bad right so it's almost like investing in the long-term quality of your project because you kind of need to do something with it is that right like you wouldn't you couldn't just do you couldn't shoot in log and then just make an edit and export it right once you shoot log you sort of need to do some adjustments yeah when you shoot in lug it's going to look horrendous like out of the camera is going to look really bad but after you apply few key fundamentals that we'll probably talk about a bit later like contrast and saturation you can get it to a really nice position and you have the the option of really manipulating the image to what you want and so what are you know when we talk about log and dynamic range how would you break that down into its simplest explanation like with the baked in color profile you can't adjust very much but with log can you do a lot with the highlights and shadows or yeah so i'll give you an example if you shoot a scene let's say there's a window at the back and you shoot it with a baked in profile usually what happens is you have to expose for the guy at the front or the environment at the back and in the front is going to be dark and so when you shoot with log it gives you more information so when you take that footage and put it into your software you can actually expose for the guy and then also recover highlights so your image will actually look like it has a lot more quality alright so i think that's like something that everyone should start thinking about if you really want to take the quality of your shooting to the next level it makes sense to start shooting in log but with that said if you shoot in log you are going to need to learn some color grading basics i guess a question i would have for you alex then is does color grading have to be really really difficult i mean i know you've got this wild setup and you tweak images for hours professionally but for the average documentary filmmaker who might be working with a small team who doesn't have the budget for a professional colorist can you still get decent results you can definitely it's like i when people come and ask me how to calibrate the the projects i always tell them you have to understand a few simple key elements if you get those key elements right your project is going to look solid doesn't really matter which software you use it's true if you want to go extreme and make it look crazy you need a specific type of software and i use davinci resolve but in premiere or final cut if you apply the principles it can look really really good cool and when you made the luts for me this summer which one did you use yeah definitely da vinci like there's no way you can do that in premiere premiere is great but da vinci is superior what what does it have what what does davinci do that premiere i mean i can't even explain it it has not even the keying the masking the isolation of the colors the beautification of the people i mean that's just to name a few so if you were just starting out beginning with premiere is a good place to learn the fundamentals but would you suggest that people try and start getting a grasp on resolve if they can 100 i think like i mentioned before if you understand the fundamentals you'll see it doesn't matter what type of software you use you're still going to implement those fundamentals so if you implement the fundamentals on premiere and you hit the ceiling because you are going to hit the ceiling with uh so the software and color grading terms and you want to slowly transition to da vinci i definitely suggest it they have a free version and then just like slowly start migrating and teaching yourself something else i wanted to ask you about is an expression that you hear a lot floating around the film industry or maybe when you're shooting in the field is let's just fix it in post oh god oh god is that is that realistic can you just fix everything later it's a colorist's worst nightmare fix it in post is bad it's a lie going to do it the best thing you can do is prime yourself while you're shooting or before you are shooting so that when you do start color grading you are starting from the best possible point especially if you start messing around with stuff on set and saying fix it in post your skin tones are going to look bad it's going to look horrendous and the skin is probably the most important part of color grading right yeah like arguably if you talk to any colorist if you get the skin right everything looks right everything is secondary to the skin so what basic camera setting should people really be paying attention to to avoid that sort of fix it in post mentality so i'd say there are three things that you have to look at the first thing is definitely get your white balance right if your white balance is correct in the scene you're going to save yourself a massive headache in color grading even if your white balance isn't correct and you try and fix it you can only fix the skin so much that you always see there will be something wrong and so not only does that mean not shoot in auto white balance it means dial in the right temperature right so 5600 for daylight or 3200 for tungsten yeah and so the second thing i would say always try and shoot at the native iso of your camera so you can easily find out what your native iso is depending on which camera you use and if you don't know what the iso means it means it's the the signal to noise ratio so it means if you are pushing the iso you are introducing more noise into your footage the more noise you have the grimier your image is going to be so if you shoot at native iso the picture quality is going to be the highest yeah i think especially for me when i was starting out because i came from a photography background i was used to pushing the iso a lot and instills and with the capabilities of modern cameras you know your camera might go up to half a million iso maybe but it's going to look terrible right grain is fairly hard to deal with in post so figure out what the native iso is like on the fx3 that we're shooting this on there's two native isos there's 640 and 12 800 but most cameras out there will have an iso where it performs its best so like when i'm shooting even on my fx9 i never change the iso i leave it on native and then if i need more light i'll add lights or put on a faster lens but you lose picture quality pretty fast if you start boosting that signal right 100 and then third thing i would say watch out for under exposing your footage it's super hard if it's underexposed meaning it's too dark to bring back the information it's a lot easier to bring it back from a light side so if you look at the histogram if you're shooting always try and kind of lean it to the lighter side and going back to the skin tones if you have maybe an environment that's really bright and really dark just make sure the skin is properly exposed the other things you can kind of deal with if you have to but if the skin isn't properly exposed you're going to have problems i mean i think that's a really good point because sometimes in the monitor darker footage will look nicer in the monitor but if you're shooting in log and you're shooting for with the intention of color grading then alex's point is really important even if it doesn't look quite as good on the back of your camera lean towards the lighter side especially if you're shooting with sony cameras because s-log loves light so don't darken it up because it looks better on the screen shoot with the grade in mind exactly so if you if it goes too dark what's going to happen is the dark pods are going to look muddy it's going to look muddy and really cheap so yeah definitely lean to the lighter side all right so those are some really great tips for how to actually set your camera to get the most out of the sensor and to make it easier to grade in post what can we do in post like for me i always try and find these hacks that will get you the best results without becoming a specialist in that field i'm sorry i'm not going to become a professional colorist how dare you i i'm interested and i'm gonna you know i keep trying to self-teach myself as much as possible i want to get as educated as possible in all aspects of filmmaking but i'm probably never going to have a setup like this or really understand grading in the way that you do and for a lot of people especially when you're first starting out what would be those foundational foundational elements that will make the biggest differences okay so these are the things you need to know contrast and saturation that's one super important to get together yes they are together see them as one getting the contrast correct and the saturation number two is you might have heard people say balance the image when i started out i was like balance them as what does balance the image mean it means your blacks are black and your whites are white in other words get your white balance correct if you get your white balance correct in camera you're not gonna have to deal with it in post and the third thing is always try and get your skin tones correct you want your skin tones to look as natural as possible and i actually have a little hack i'm going to show you how to get your skin tones on point all right so we're going to look at those three things it was contrast and saturation it was balancing the image making sure the whites are white and the blacks are black and nailing your skin tones and alex is going to show us a really cool trick for making that easy so let's hop onto the computer and alex is going to show us from start to finish how he would set about grading them let's do it okay alex so uh we have a new image on the screen you're going to go through what you would do from start to finish as though you were seeing this for the first time right 100 so i'm going to show you the easiest way of making your image look the best it can be so i grabbed this this is stock footage i have no idea what camera this is from so you don't even have to care the first thing what you're going to do is you're probably going to see this screen it's the it's like the editing bay first thing what we want to do is we need to change our workspace to color so when my color pops up you'll see all these weird scopes and lumetri and all of that stuff you might have something different but you want to end up here and i'll show you how to do that make sure that you have this open which is called a vectorscope you do this by right clicking and making sure the vector scope is checked this parade is called waveform luma histogram and parade rgb you can turn off just make sure these two are on yeah i think this is you know from the little i know about color grading these scopes used to terrify me they look so confusing but they're really not that bad and as soon as you get the hang of them um they they give you so much information about what you're doing so definitely take alex's advice and turn these on yeah they can look super foreign you don't really know i mean it looks like an alien language like what what what is this yeah and we're not going to go into exactly what's going on here just turn them on and then we'll show you why in a second exactly and one thing you might run into if you turn on the waveform you might it might actually look like this if it looks like this make sure to right click your waveform type needs to be luma don't make it rgb so this is what your image should look like you have the vector scope and you have the luma waveform that's all we're going to use okay so let's look at the let's look at the image itself so here's a girl with vr goggles she's chatting to a hologram first thing what we want to do is you want to have your lumetri color open we are only going to work with saturation contrast and exposure this is the first step there's a bunch of different ways to do this you can make this way more complicated but we're trying to make this simple so that you can take your log footage and get it to look good with the minimal amount of knowledge and like alex said earlier you can ramp up those skills and you can make it more complex and you can get into the nitty-gritty but for right now you can do you can get most of the way there by keeping it really simple 100 so as i said before the first thing we are going to look at is contrast and saturation so you know this waveform this zero shows you the darkest of dark and this hundred is the lightest of light you want your image to live in the middle of this you never want it to go below zero or above 100 it means you are clipping and so you're losing information and your picture is going to look bed so we want to always look at the waveform and see and make sure that it's living between 0 and 100 and also i mean the way it is now it's between 0 and 100 but it's compressed right exactly so if we start playing with this contrast you'll see what happens with the waveform it it's actually going to pull it's going to pull the darkest darker and the lighter lighter you'll see on the way from a visualization of this so if we pull on the contrast you'll see it expanding it's going to expand it's going to expand it's going to expand so let's say we wanted to expand here now you'll see in premiere you pull it and it's a hundred if you want to go more than 100 click on this guy and just pull it even further and it should there we go it should go to 150. so we are gonna pull it right here so what's the aim do you want to try and get the whites as close to 100 as you can or what are you looking for right now so this is where color grading can get a little bit tricky because it's all up to interpretation but you kind of want the docs to be close to zero you don't want it to touch zero and you don't want the contrast to be too high i say that because a good indication of a very cheap camera is high contrast you'll see expensive looking movies it's always a bit lower contrast because the lower the contrast the more information is in the dark areas like i said before when you start doing an adding contrast it kind of pulls the image so the darkers get dark and the whites get whiter and it compresses the end and so it gets smaller and smaller you don't want it to be too small yeah i think that's a really good point like the cinematic look is often much lower contrast than comes out of the stock profiles exactly it's like you can see here if i go if i crank this like crazy you'll see the docks are very dark if you go even more you'll see it started looking really really bad but if you go less you can kind of see there's more you can see there's more information in the dark dark areas and that's kind of what you're aiming for you don't want it too um like non-controsty but you kind of want to i want to love love this this is a good spot this is a good spot to start so the next step would be saturation with saturation you're gonna see what's changing is not the waveform it is the vector scope the vector scope indicates the color in your image you'll see red magenta blue cyan green and yellow and then you'll see all of this this is a visual representation of all the colors in this image so you can see here this kind of yellow and red or we can kind of see this yellow and red see there's a blue cyan blue cyan is this dude a hologram and then also a bit more like magenta so that's the the depiction and so if we go saturation we're going to go to the limits i'm gonna go as high as we can so now she looks like she fell into a nuclear nuclear wasteland this looks bad this looks bad so always what you want to do is you go saturation too high and then you slowly bring it back slowly bring it back to a point that you kind of like i feel that might be like good advice in general for when you're first getting the hang of these sliders is see what it does at the extreme end and then walk it back yes that's that's exactly it and a little pro tip we always watch out to make making the skin too oversaturated people have the tendency to make it too saturated and because we are humans and we know exactly what skin looks like if the skin is off people pick it up incredibly quickly almost subconsciously yeah they know something's wrong it's like if it's too saturated they kind of start looking sickly okay so i'm just gonna so what are you looking for in this scope are you trying to expand it as much as possible without crossing over that line or what what are you looking so what i'm doing now is i'm literally just looking at her skin that's all i'm doing i'm trying to get her skin at a point where i feel it's it's not too saturated it's not under saturated and now you could say well where is that it comes with a bit of practice but the third step i'm going to show you exactly how to isolate the skin and double check if the saturation is correct so you're doing it first by eye and then you'll go in with a bit more of a scientific approach exactly and so i'm gonna i'm just going to leave it here for now so i have the contrast i have the saturation okay so this is looking good it's a pretty saturated image you can also see at the back it's like the yellows are pretty saturated the skin is actually car on a really nice spot right now so the last thing that i would suggest you look at so it's contrast saturation and then exposure for me the exposure kind of looks good you'll see what happens with the exposure you'll see look at the waveform here when i start raising it up all the information goes up so if you want a bit of a brighter image you know if we go down she's kind of in a cave this feels a bit underexposed and if we want to brighten it up a bit that can work all the information is kind of in the models between 10 and 80. this is a nice spot to be in yeah and you can see there's that one little peak getting close to 90 or just above yeah once it goes to 100 you've lost all the information and it's burnt out right yes you definitely you don't want to go i'm going to go to the extreme i mean look at this image this is bad yeah and so yeah you can see all the information is crowding across that that hundred line yeah yeah so you definitely don't want to live there on it in the middle this is a nice little spot that's tip number one step one contrast saturation and you can play with the exposure once you're kind of happy i'm just gonna roll it down a little bit once you are happy with this step the next step is make sure the white balance is correct if you've done this before you shoot you don't have to do the step this white balance looks on the eye it looks right because this white looks white and this black looks black but if your image isn't white balanced and it looks a bit strange if you can find in your frame a point that should be white or should be black this is what you do you take the white balance so this should be white sometimes it's with with this guy it's a little bit tricky sometimes sometimes you gotta triple click it so do it a few times find a couple different references yeah and see what you kind of like so you'll see now after i did that the image changed the only thing about the image that has changed is the temperature and the tint that is that is all so if i reset this if i double click reset this is what we started with if i tell the computer this should be white it is going to change all the colors here in relation to how much it changes this one if you go so what i usually do is so like so what i usually do is when adobe says okay this is white he it might be right but for me this image looks way too yellow now it doesn't look it doesn't feel right so i'm just i'm gonna just leave it i'm gonna leave it as it's shot this feels a bit better to me so worth experience you'll you'll kind of you'll kind of have a feel for it so don't always rely on the white balance like i said before make sure when you shoot the footage if you get the white balance right you don't have to do this step yeah i think that's probably a really good point because it can be easy to get on youtube and find all these techniques and feel like you have to do them in these specific ways but at the end of the day it's your image and you need to like the way it looks so if you use that white balance dropper and it doesn't look good to you then it's not good right you trust your eyes 100 and i would also suggest always do less than more if you do something and the image goes into a direction you don't like undo it don't add add add rather go back and just do micro adjustments to until you're really happy with that image so the third step is tackling the skin and making sure it is perfect it sometimes it's really tricky explaining how do how do you know when the skin looks good and with this technique you're going to it's going to be solid every time effect tools that's the first step we go here we click the pen tool click on our skin so we're going to isolate her skin usually it would be on the face actually the forehead ideally but she has these vr goggles on so we are going to go on our arm so you want to get just a clean patch of skin with nothing else in it exactly now we have isolated this clean patch of skin now we're going to go back to the lumetri scopes and on the scope you'll see this massive line so this line indicates the skin tone it's a reference line so it needs to be on the line it can either either be a bit above or a bit below if it is a bit above your skin tone is going to look a little bit redder and you're talking about that that the misty pattern it needs to be in a direct line yes yes exactly this little pattern this represents than this guy and so i personally always try and push it a little bit to the right of the line because in skin you have blood vessels and the blood vessels are red and if you can show a little bit of red it makes it feel more natural the more yellow you go the more you run into the risk of them looking like they are nauseous and they have a disease oh really that's interesting because i remember i learned this trick and it was a total game changer for me but i've never heard that before so that's great to know actually you know if you have to air to one side always go towards the red and not towards the yellow exactly and one thing i love about this skin tone line is that it doesn't matter about ethnicities right this works for all skin tones because it's actually tracking blood more than the color of the skin on top right so yeah it's a it's a weird concept you would think people have different skin tones so it's in a different color it's not it you might have a different in how bright or how dark the the skin is but color wise it's always on the same spot so no matter what ethnicity the person is this line that's it this works this is the line you live by on skin so now we have this isolation we know it's actually it's on the line it's like it's really good i think it's a little bit to the left though so i would do a micro adjustment to the right and so this is how we do it you are gonna go into curves i'm going to turn off this little selection so you just see what i'm doing a bit better i'm just going to turn it off for now we're going to use you versus set u versus u and u versus luma and this might sound like greek to you or a different language this is how i'll explain it this is how we're going to isolate and change the saturation of the skin this is how we're going to change the color of the skin and this is how we're going to change the brightness of the skin right so they use hue basically means color and luma is luminance or brightness exactly and so you'll see all these colors here this is representing the entire spectrum of colors but we don't want to change all the colors we just want to change the color in our skin so how we do that is we go the color dropper or the eyedropper and we say i want this spot so it's going to make a little dent there so if i go really crazy everything with that color is going to be desaturated everything with that color is going to be crazy saturated okay so now we have this point now we do the same for you and then we also do the same for luma now we're going to go back and turn on our [music] little guy here so we now we can just see the skin we're gonna go back to the elementary and this is the skin but now we have these tools to just change the skin so if you want this indication to get bigger you're going to increase the saturation if you want to move it it's going to be the u so first what we're going to do is we're going to move it to red so if you move this upwards it is going to go this way right so you can see it's slightly on the yellow side of that line so by adding more red we're going to make it look more natural exactly and so we're going to move this a little bit a little bit up so if i turn this on and off yeah it's just it's a subtle adjustment it's a very subtle adjustment and and that's exactly what i said at the at the start color grading is all about subtle adjustments there's no big adjustments so this is what it was and this is the new hue so it's pushing it up a little bit i think that's a great tip especially when i was doing photography i would crank those sliders all over the place you know highlights all the way down shadows all the way up and it looked kind of okay but in video especially if you're going for documentary in a naturalistic look you do not want to overdo it yeah yeah and uh the the trick you run into or the problem you run into when you start color grading especially at the start you don't know a lot of things so you try everything and after half an hour your image kind of looks okay but it still looks really bad you should actually just start from you should start over because you've done too much you've manipulated the image too much it's not supposed to be there okay so now we go back we turn off the opacity so this means when i turn this mask off it applies it to the entire image so you'll see so it was like this with the hue adjustment now it's like this very subtle but yeah you're right it does look because now when you go back she kind of looks like a little bit sick yeah it doesn't look good this feels a little bit you can see the blood's kind of coming in a little bit more yeah that's wild so it's this feels a bit better and so now we're going to go to the universal set so when we do you versus u we are going to use the little isolation like we're going to turn this guy on but for the other two we are not we're going to look at the entire image okay so now saturation [music] go up a little bit because this this frame you'll see this color is kind of the same as this so we can't just move the skin tone if we start adding saturation to the skin it's going to add saturation to all the yellows in the shot so we definitely don't want to go too crazy with this i'd actually probably just leave it right there if i go back to the isolation a good rule of thumb kind of like the saturation should kind of be there not halfway between between this and that maybe let's say a third third is a really good little benchmark where you your skin needs to be so if you start cranking on that on that slider it's going to extend way out and that's too much about doing this right it starts it starts pushing it and it actually even deviates to the yellow a little bit so aim for about a third of the way up and you kind of want it on a straight line yeah i'd say third way up straight line and a little bit to the right the right of the line towards red yeah yes towards red and so i'll turn that off and then the last one this guy you want to touch minimally if you go really too dark you're going to start breaking your image or really light you're gonna break your image this is sometimes you'll find with these two you might get your skin tones exactly where you want it but sometimes there's something missing and it's not the color and it's not the saturations actually how light your skin is so this guy if we just bring this down a little bit it adds a little bit more focus on the skin and so i'm going to take off this sky and so before this is the image that we started with and then after the skin adjustments this is what we have yeah it's it's very subtle but i mean to my eye it looks much more like normal human skin yeah and now you have you have a good shot cool so that's really it's it's just as simple as that i mean not as simple as that you can go way deeper and i'm sure when you're coloring for coca-cola or something you're spending a lot of time dialing in all sorts of factors but for you know small teams and documentary filmmakers who are not working with huge budgets and huge crews you really you got that image looking pretty good in about five six minutes right yeah so then i guess on your timeline what you would do is instead of just dropping a lot over the whole thing you just go through clip by clip and repeat this process and by the time you get to the end you're going to have a an image that's most of the way towards professional quality yes and if you if you have clips that are shot in the same location with the same camera what you can even do is you take this grade that you just did and you just copy it to the clips and then you go through and you're like does it look good then you can make small little adjustments to fix it and that'll save a lot of time so you don't have to start from scratch every single time on each clip cool so start with the saturation and contrast then move on to making sure the whites are white and the blacks are black and after that dial on the skin tones using that that scope and you're pretty much good to go yeah this is this looks great amazing i mean it's a lot less complicated than you might think especially if you've tried to open up resolve and you're looking at nodes and all this stuff and you think this is impossible what am i supposed to do that seems pretty obtainable to me most people could repeat that process on their footage so don't be afraid to start shooting log footage you can get it to look really good without doing too much work yeah like i said before get the fundamentals right if you focus on these fundamentals and you practice it over and over and over and over again you're going to get really really good and your footage is going to look fantastic and once you have those fun fundamentals and you realize where the limits of those fundamentals are then you start moving into more complicated processes and more complicated software you'll see after you get the fundamentals solid the sky's the limit with other type of software you can do some crazy stuff cool man thanks a lot cool okay so that's it for this super detailed talk with alex and i personally thought it was full of useful information i'm not the greatest colorist out there and it was really nice to hear how just by mastering a few basics we can get our footage looking great now of course how much you want to tweak it and stylize it beyond that is totally up to you but at least log footage doesn't have to be so terrifying anymore if you like that kind of content this conversation was originally recorded for my upcoming advanced documentary cinematography course that's going to cover pretty much everything i've learned about the shooting side of high-end dock work in the last 10 years so if you're into videos like this you can click the link in the description and i'll let you know when the course is going to be live like in a month or two from now and i'll also throw in a nice discount for being early there's going to be a ton of content tips and exercises on everything from gear to how to cover a scene to the business of documentary cinematography and i think it's going to be really something special so check it out see ya [music] thank you foreign [music]
