have you ever wondered what are some of the most 
futureproof jobs i mean is that even possible   nowadays i am coming to you from the future well 
actually i guess when you watch this it will be   the past but today we are going to look at some 
of the most futureproof jobs going into 2024   now i'm going to pull down the magical curtain 
because the reality is it would be ridiculous if   i said there were jobs that were 100% future proof 
but here are some that are continuing to really   increase in demand but even more importantly we 
are going to look at what skills are required   within each of these roles because those are 
the skills that will keep you whether you are   in one of these roles or not in demand for the 
future future proofing our career it is possible   oh and you know what i got to do i'm a youtuber 
before you do anything hit that subscribe leave   down in the comments other topics you want me 
to cover this is how i make my videos is based   on what will help you and also give a video 
a like okay enough that youtube stuff let's   really get into it [music] now first off imagine 
a job like a video game something that you are   always playing but you never actually fully 
master that's what type of jobs are going to   continue to be in demand now let me explain what 
i mean by that is jobs that have you continuously   learning and upscaling although on one hand it 
can feel like a bit of a headache i mean when   does learning ever stop well the reality is it 
never stops and that's the beauty of it or at   the very least we need to embrace being forever 
learners also i want to note something for the   jobs that i'm going to cover today the three kind 
of main categories my role working in tech you   know years as a software developer moving into 
developer relations and communications my job   title is not within one of these three realms 
i'm going to talk about today but that's okay   is it okay it's okay and if yours isn't under one 
of these three it's okay too these are just three   areas that if you are looking to really grow your 
career with in technology that i would definitely   suggest checking out but even if if you're not 
the skills that these areas that we will speak   about bring will can translate into so many other 
roles it goes back to the whole premise or the   whole focus of being a forever learner all right 
i just had to get that out of the way because i   didn't want someone to watch this and think my 
job i'm going to lose my job like insert that   meme where it's the what is it the dog holding 
the coffee cup and his house is on fire we don't   want any of that that's not the vibe we're going 
for now the first job that will stay in demand   and really future proof for quite a while is the 
data expert what is a dat expert well there are so   many roles under data that will stay in demand 
that i'm just summing it up as the data expert   some of these roles include data scientist data 
analyst business intelligence analyst and more now   where does this come from well for one thing the 
global data analytics market is expected to hit   272 billion the numbers coming of my head it's 
just it's wild by 2027 so you can think based   on these numbers how in demand these roles will 
continue to be and actually another stat that i   think is really interesting is job growth for data 
scientists is projected at 28% from 2020 to 2030   that is a huge increase in demand okay that's 
great and all but where do i go to learn some   of these skills yes great question other tiff here 
are some resources if you are looking to grow your   career around data whether it's data science 
data analyst anything that i just mentioned   one i would recommend is corsa's ibm professional 
certificate for applied data science another one   is udacity's nano degree in data science these 
both offer really great certifications so it's   not just a course that you can put on your resume 
but you also get a certification to go alongside   it okay but for those of us who are not going to 
become data scientists or data analysts people   like myself what can we take away from this this 
industry of data as a whole that is continuing to   grow in demand well for one thing data is touching 
every point now it seems or every company and what   i've learned or what i'm trying to do especially 
in my day-to-day role working in tech is bringing   in datadriven decisions so making sure whether 
it be for a marketing standpoint or a technical   standpoint that these decisions i making are based 
on data now i'm not going to be a data analyst or   a data scientist ever in my career it's not what 
i'm looking for but what i can do is use so many   incredible tools i mean now with ai especially to 
help me base my decisions more so focused on the   data for example at the company i work at we use 
hubspot a lot and they offer really great insights   into to what data is available what uh you know 
users are clicking on where they are traveling to   different things like that and in turn i can make 
better decisions because i have insight into that   so even if you are someone who is not looking 
to change your career fully or anything like   that really take away from this in particular that 
making databased decisions whatever your role is   will continue to set you apart next up is the ai 
whisperer and similar to data i am putting a few   roles under this ai whisperer because there are 
going going to be many rules under this subject of   ai i know we keep on hearing about ai ai but the 
reality is ai isn't going anywhere anytime soon   well probably never going anywhere and within 
ai there are so much opportunity both on the   technical and non-technical side to get into so 
whether you are looking to do a career switch or   even grow your career in a different direction 
a direction that you know is more in demand ai   as a whole is definitely a good starting point so 
what are some roles within ai this includes roles   such as machine learning engineer ai engineer 
deep learning engineer even robotics engineer   i might put under ai maybe it should be its own 
category but i think the two can be very closely   linked and then there are a ton of other roles 
for example i know ibm has a role where it's ai   in data technical specialist so it's someone 
that maybe has a bit of technical knowledge   and experience and yes you're technical but it's 
more so about having the knowledge of a technical   person when you are selling to customers or 
interacting with them all right let's start   with data though let's go you know going back to 
point number one really emphasizing how important   taking data or making database decisions is what 
really is the percentage of role or percentage   that this role will go up let's focus on machine 
learning engineer according to forbes machine   learning engineers are expected to sar or jobs 
for it are expected to sar 334 per not 34% 334   per. over the next decade that is something i've 
really never seen numbers that high when it comes   to a specific job it is one of the fastest growing 
jobs in the us forbes goes on to say once again   tiff that's great but where do i go to take these 
courses yes tiff number two great question again   great good job here are some places you can go 
to take courses around artificial intelligence   and that specialize in different roles in 
particular one is stanford's machine learning   course on corsera you can tell i really love 
corsera courses mainly because they are taught   taught by industry experts a lot of individuals 
who work at very very prominent universities or   college i mean stanford and another resource i 
don't hear too many people talking about maybe   because it's hidden a little bit is nvidia's 
deep learning institute courses both of the   resources i mentioned offer a certification as 
well which is great for you in your resume all   right what about ai if you are someone who might 
not look be looking to become a machine learning   engineer or even on the business side uh ai 
and data specialist how can you incorporate   ai into your everyday work this is another easy 
one i think i think they all really if you were   someone who is open to technology learning uh you 
can really fit these into your day-to-day job with   ai it comes to being open to use new tools that 
come your way uh educating yourself on ai ai in   itself even saying it it's such a broad term 
and there's so much under it here's an example   of what i'm doing in my day to-day i don't use ai 
or build ai or i'm not a machine learning engineer   but what i did do is enroll in a postgrad course 
that is machine learning and ai hands-on so this   is a postgrad course that i'm going to be starting 
in february actually on that note let me know down   in the comments if you want to learn more as i 
progress through this course and it's going to be   doing a little bit of both one hand is technical 
so coding with python and really learning the ins   and outs around all these new technologies well 
not new technologies but new to me anyways and   to many people for actually building with them and 
the other side is more of the business side around   ai now i'm not suggesting everyone out here has to 
go take a full-on course on it but i would suggest   even learning through some youtube videos or some 
free courses online to really educate yourself as   to the terms within artificial intelligence and 
also to where it's headed because it's something   that will affect every single person's job okay 
with all these new technologies and roles popping   up it sounds like there's need for some security 
in the mix you are not alone in thinking that in   fact number three on the list is actually cyber 
security prize prize i hope not we need more and   more cyber security it's one of the industries 
actually within tech or across the fields that is   so in demand it is continuing the percentages for 
jobs within this field that are not being filled   is pretty staggering so what are some roles though 
within cyber security as a whole cyber security   analyst security engineer penetration tester 
incident responder threat analysis and the list   goes on this is another area well they're 
all really these areas where there's both   technical opportunities and non-technical a lot 
of people will either start their career out as   technical and then maybe move into non-technical 
roles or even vice versa i seen okay and going   back to data we always bring it back to data as i 
mentioned why is what are the numbers what are the   percentages really telling us the global cyber 
security market is actually projected to reach   375 billion by 2026 that is in 2 years and cyber 
security job openings are expected ed to increase   by 30% by 2030 those numbers are pretty stager 
by the way i found them on cyber security and   security infrastructure agency's website you 
already know what i'm going to ask courses i   already got them ready you didn't even need to ask 
here are some courses around cyber security cbr's   ethical hacking fundamentals course is a really 
great course that offers a certification other   courses are offensive securities certified 
ethical hacker or c certification and sans   institute online training now with cyber security 
it's a bit more tricky to recommend online courses   because it really depends where you are at with 
your journey in cyber security the biggest thing   though is i would definitely recommend searching 
up very specific things within cyber security   you're interested in the good news is there are 
so many good resources online okay well once again   i'm not going to be going into cyber security in 
my career at one point though i really thought i   was going to but here are some key takeaways if 
you are like me and maybe aren't doing a full   pivot into cyber security that you can bring 
into your day job right now or your day-to-day   life which in turn will help you stay ahead 
and really just be more i mean i'm trying to   think of another word other than in demand but it 
really comes back down to that because you're more   knowledgeable you're more prepared within your 
current job cyber security i think is a pretty   obvious one where it's around the security don't 
click on links you're unfamiliar with don't open   attachments or download attachments you're not 
familiar with make sure to do your du diligence   when it comes to reading up on cyber security 
best practices especially at your place of   work i mean it depends on the size of where you 
work and what their security policies are which   can vary greatly both good and bad but one thing 
to really note is to stay diligent yes you might   be working on your work computer and it's not 
technically all your stuff but think of it from   the perspective of this company if something was 
to go wrong because of something you've done it   would really affect your career for a very long 
time all right those are the three areas that   are are going to be future proofed when it comes 
to roles under them or roles using them and as i   mentioned throughout this video your role can use 
these different kind of sectors as long as you're   open to it and wanting to continue to learn i hope 
you found this video very helpful and valuable i   love making content for you so once again i got 
to say it leave in the comments any other topics   you want me to cover questions you have and i'll 
see you all soon thanks [music] everyone [music]
