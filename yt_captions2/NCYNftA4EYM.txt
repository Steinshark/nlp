well you don't have to sit up you could also just tilt your camera down a little bit and we're live welcome to the lan show ladies and gentlemen we are going to have a fantastic show for you today i'm super excited because i get to take possession of my new house today so i was thinking maybe i would show luke some pictures and maybe you guys could look at them too you can do you guys want to watch while we look at things i've already i've already seen the pictures i was going to pretend you hadn't so i have not seen the pictures this will be a first-time reaction all reactions will be genuine way to spoil it for everyone in other news microsoft has elaborated on the windows 11 cpu requirements and is defending the requirement for a trusted platform module so we're going to be talking about that what else we got luke there's uh sony charging developers uh 25 000 to show up on the playstation store that's that's cool and also fun and in other cool and also fun console news there will be tv style or i would i would probably say mobile style ads coming to console and pc gaming so cool i'm so happy with this yay all right um yeah let's roll the intro that actually sounds like the worst cool good day in the youtube comments says uh sell the house and get [music] sounds bitcoins a good strat yeah that sounds like a helpful suggestion the show is brought to you by redux honey and red wallet all right let's jump right into our first topic of the day microsoft has elaborated on their windows 11 cpu requirements and defended the tpm requirements as well so after the reveal like luke were you a little surprised to find out that 8th gen core and 2nd gen ryzen were listed as the minimum supported cpus very extremely i would actually say yeah yeah and this isn't one of those things where it's kind of like you know oh i definitely have not seen those pictures before like this is honest honest surprise right yes all right because now especially because my world is shattered my world is shaken luke i don't know what i can trust and what i can't because you know i thought you were a truthful a truthful kind of character and now i found out you've seen all these pictures already yeah yeah there's also stuff like was it was it i think vista where they had this like pretty high system requirement and then like no one listened to it and then everyone hated vista um so like but it but it works on those systems even though it was just a bad experience like it it doesn't seem like that's necessarily the case like it could happen so we'll get we'll get into this now the crazy thing about it though is that some older cpus because you got to remember there's two different uh important dates for a cpu there's the date that it actually was initially available commercially that's date number one and then date number two is the date that it went eol that it effectively stopped being sold and here's the problem some of those cpus that are that are older cpus were still being sold brand new less than two years ago like the ryzen 5 1600 af now microsoft has since announced that they are testing zen one and kb lake cpus via the insider program however installing the insider windows 11 build with an unsupported cpu will show a message that says the final version may not be available for you upon release which is a pretty big downer with that said our internal testing has windows 11 running on much older cpus so there's probably more to the story here than compatibility or performance we actually got it running on a core 2 duo and we just shot a video on how we did that and it seemed to run completely fine like core two duo yeah what's that 2007 2008 2006 that was oh wow i'm old it was 15 years ago holy shnikees anyway the other big requirement that has caused issues for people is the tpm or trusted platform module microsoft's pc health check app proclaimed that many modern pcs were incompatible due to a lack of tpm um the frustrating thing about that is that its only recommendation to rectify the problem was to buy a new pc the pc health check app has since been pulled and that's uh a good thing because the last thing you want to do after a period of prolonged hardship around the world is say hey you know what things not working out for you so great pc's a little old you know what go buy a new one but you don't buy a new one you don't just have a plane and a bunch of money to just go buy a new one why don't you have money to buy a new one you slob like that that's the that's the way a lot of people felt about it and that's justifiable because if you have a perfectly good computer why should you suddenly just have to throw it away and buy a new one because you don't have some little validation module thing and of course just because your computer might have the option to add a tpm doesn't necessarily mean that it will be easy to do it scalpers immediately bought out stock of tpms and put them up on sites like ebay for many many times the price the good news is that most platforms since 2015 have a tpm integrated into the firmware it's just disabled by default on diy motherboards so all this confusion has led manufacturers like msi and gigabyte to make press releases with supported lists of motherboards that can use tpm 2.0 although here's a problem um many itx boards actually don't have the the the the pins for the module which is a little frustrating because especially with high performance ones they're always looking for new ways to save space however most non-itx boards since 2013 have tpm headers and ever since skylake and first gen ryzen virtually all have firmware tpms with that said not all discrete tpm headers are the same asus and gigabyte each have three different types of them all of which are incompatible with each other so you can't just go on ebay order a tpm module and plonk it onto your system you have to make sure that it is compatible not just with your motherboard vendor but also with the specific model of motherboard you have now luke how do you feel about the requirement of a tpm it feels a little weird to me personally not gonna lie um i mean we can talk about what it's for i mean one of the things that tpm is great for is something like bitlocker full driving encryption because the tpm is it's a pretty simple device actually it's a little cryptographic device that will generate it's kind of like it's got a random number generator built into it and then it stores the private key for the encryption so that that can't be um it can't be stolen effectively it's a little kind of you could think of it as kind of like apple's t2 chip but way way less sophisticated so it facilitates hardware level encryption effectively um it feels like it feels like to me that this should have been a a like warning campaign type of thing where like microsoft tries to play because these things they they theoretically do help so i feel like microsoft should have been like hey you know while you're installing windows 11 we highly freaking suggest that you like turn this thing on or that you do this other thing i i or maybe they even block you and say your computer is not ready and then they do that thing where there's like the text based link in the corner that's like i don't care and then you can bypass it something like that that allows people to acknowledge that um microsoft thinks they should have this thing but they can just install it anyways uh it feels weird that it's a requirement for oems it's been a requirement for a long time now like i think a tpm uh some kind of tpm uh implementation has been required for at least four or five years now so it's been available to consumers since uh when did when was bitlocker added was that with vista or seven but i mean we've talked about this on lan show before there's there's skylight systems um skylake am i referencing the right thing hold on one sec fit locker 2007 yeah what's that yeah there's there's skylake systems that people are still using and still like gaming on and having a good old dandy time and they probably don't have the hardware for this even if that's like a pre-built from an oem um yeah no that's that's true that's true they might want to run windows 11 and they in my opinion should just be able to bypass it and again maybe they could do that like advanced user thing where the the like way to bypass it is like hidden in some corner that you're probably not going to look at unless you know to look there or whatever but i think there should i personally believe there should be some way to be like yeah whatever dude my computer's from 2014 or something i understood or beyond like i understand there might be some security problems with the fact that my system's super ancient but so here's what i think i think that this is the warning because windows 11 by and large has benefits over windows 10 but a lot of the under the hood ones seem to be focused on newer hardware right like optimizing for big little architecture cpus for example obviously if you are going to benefit yeah yeah touch devices obviously if you're going to benefit from some of those newer under the hood improvements you're going to meet the requirements for tpm 2.0 and everything's going to be hunky-dory and then if you have older hardware i think what microsoft is effectively saying is no problem run windows 10 then so that gives you i think the i think the uh end of support date is 2025 for windows 10 which actually does buy you another four years to upgrade so in another four years will a skylake system be starting to get a little long in the tooth i think that's probably fair to say but i mean i think it sort of already is but yeah well sort of i mean you could definitely play very triple a games on skylake yeah today 100 i mean even going going back to haswell ivy bridge you could still be playing very very high-end games as long as you've got a gpu that is good enough and you do a little bit of overclocking and all of a sudden you're laughing but there are other issues with running older hardware they have more vulnerabilities that are never going to be patched and i think that expecting people to upgrade about every you know 10 years or so is not entirely unreasonable especially if you consider that like today because there was that long period of stagnation where we just didn't see the same kind of performance improvements that we that we used to uh you know today we kind of take for granted that a 10 year 10 year old computer it should be fine right but can you imagine in 2005 thinking that it's okay to run a computer that was built in 1995 yeah not even remotely get real 2005 was the i think the athlon 64 was out uh let me have a look here there's one one of the things too is like we're talking about skylake and i think that's a very legitimate conversation but to bring it back even further like i know people playing modern games on sandy bridge processors yeah like it's it's 100 100 i don't know but like it's it's and it ties into that stagnation thing you're talking about etcetera but like there's people running these old computers and are they're just still not having any problems and like no matter what the like the hardware community is like oh yeah these new cpus are yeah well the vast majority of people aren't going to use that performance yeah maybe you will and that's fantastic and it's really exciting and that's that's cool but i can totally understand why someone who just uses a web browser isn't going to care about upgrading their computer so i think what's happening here is we are getting the warning shot my windows 10 is going to keep getting support until 2025 which means that you'll realistically be able to keep using it for a little while after that if you want to it won't be until after 2025 that the install base will really start to dwindle and you'll start to see game developers not supporting the os or you'll start to see companies like nvidia or amd pull driver support so realistically you could still be running your machine from 2015 by until 2025 2026 2027 if you want to push it and you're willing to roll that die in terms of security updates and you know in the context of going from okay windows 95 right you would have been running a pentium 2 if you were state of the art okay you were running 266 megahertz back in 1995. in may of 2005 you were running an athlon 64 x2 if you were if you were state of the art okay so yes um the hardware hasn't moved forward in that way over the last 10 years but that doesn't mean that computing hasn't changed that much in 10 years and that we don't need to do something about standardizing the platform that people are running on in some meaningful way and microsoft's justification for this ultimately does kind of make sense to me even if i'm not thrilled about it uh in a nutshell they say look this comes down to security um microsoft claims that pcs using a tpm and secure boot reported 60 less malware thanks to virtualization-based security and if microsoft wants a lot of attacks are in that vector these days exactly if microsoft wants to stay competitive with apple and google so google doesn't even have 10 year old hardware to deal with on chrome os and then apple just gets to deprecate things whenever it pleases them because they're so vertically integrated and their customers will just accept it um if microsoft wants to do something to move windows security forward like as a platform as something that they can really uh message about i actually think that this could be a big part of the reason that windows 11 exists at all so i don't see them backing down from this and i it's windows there's gonna be hacky ways to do it probably but yes i don't think that microsoft is going to endorse them in any way and the industry is going to be expected to adapt because we have you know four to six years to kind of figure it out and at some point windows has to get more secure and if this is the way they've identified to do it then windows 11 is this clear line in the sand that microsoft is drawing that goes okay windows 10 you know what it wasn't as good and this is why and you can keep using it for a while but guys you will have to upgrade even if you don't have to do it today yeah that makes sense that does make sense most of the most of the improvements like you're mentioning are kind of uh quality of life stuff yep absolutely you don't have to move on from windows 10. actually okay one thing we don't know is whether uh this is a really critical feature that i'm excited for direct storage so the gpu's ability to access your storage directly um but then now that i think about it actually no one's going to be running pci express gen 4 and not have tpm 2.0 yep so the whole thing the whole it's all wait where's that cronk i need that cronk jif it's all added together it all makes sense now if the pr if the benefits of windows 11 are performance benefits but that are applicable mainly to very modern systems then it makes perfect sense to just kind of say okay well then modern systems are gonna run windows 11 and not modern systems are going to run windows 10 and no one should really be that upset about it because you can just run windows 10 and you'll have a just fine experience like you have there are some other problems g says yeah tpm is a repair nightmare that is super true having having like encryption keys tied to the cpu in the motherboard socket is going to be a real nightmare for people who don't practice good data storage best practices because if you just run your machine you store all of your data right on your boot drive and you have some kind of problem you take it into a shop they have to swap out some hardware you could be in for an extremely bad time there could just be no way to access your data unless you stored your backup key somewhere that you can actually get it could be bad you know you have a water cooling leak right so you you lose a cpu and motherboard at the same time could be very problematic i mean i've been advocating for a long time for people to just not store any data on their computers but the reality of it is is i remember back when i didn't have the kind of money to just have an extra computer to keep all my hard drives in that wasn't that was that was just not possible even though you can build a decent nas for a couple hundred dollars i mean you want to 200 is not necessarily accessible to exactly but a huge range of people exactly i mean that is one benefit though of the uh of the kind of the stagnation that took place for so long is lots of people have upgraded their computers to get better performance but the hardware that is now orphaned is very very usable and as long as you don't mind dealing with the extra power consumption it is amazingly affordable to build yourself a cheap nas like think about it you don't even need a gpu you don't even need anything that's in shortage because intel's been building in onboard graphics for over 10 years now that's fantastic you just get an old cheap board cpu throw some crap ram from ebay in it and you're off to the races especially if it's idling all the time it is way less problematic in terms of power consumption compared to if you are actually doing something heavy like you're using it for uh plex transcoding or something along those lines yeah i i i wonder probably not much but i do wonder what this might do for linux advocacy because a lot of this old hardware like we've been talking is still legit especially if what you're doing is not heavy if you're not gaming if you're not video editing if you're not uh doing heavy things like that there's a wide range of them modeling etc um if you're doing word processing if you're browsing the web if you're if you're yeah there's so there's there's a lot of things you can do on your computer that isn't necessarily what a lot of this audience is doing um and once windows 10 uh stops being supported it's those types of tasks are actually very easy for the average user to pick up on non-complicated linux distros this is interesting gabriel garcia has a super chat in here one benefit of the min spec uh being coffee lake slash verizon two is that win11 apps can target extensions like avx2 directly yup that is a huge benefit all of a sudden having this kind of clear line in the sand for what developers can expect from a system that's running in os makes it a lot cleaner to optimize your apps yep that is you're probably going to see more and we saw this kind of stuff and it annoyed the hell out of me with with companies like elgato despite them making tons of fantastic and amazing things um their their stream deck was only supported on windows 10 for like a super long time when windows 8 windows 7 were still very viable operating systems i think you'll see significantly more of that with windows 11 if if that's the case um but yeah i think i think the low end system game more than ever even though it's already a bit of a thing i think the low end system game might look a lot more uh linuxy for the next while someone in flow plane chat said linux will run on a potato and i'm like yeah that's that's my point kind of um exactly a lot of these older systems it could be a very fantastic answer for it it'll be it'll be interesting to see if anything does kind of shift more than it already has in that realm the real tech guy says okay but like as someone who works in a computer repair shop from a customer's perspective why should i have to have an as that's that's a that's such a great question so when someone comes into the shop and they go why should i have to have an s the answer is you shouldn't but then if you want the simpler the simple easy magic bullet then what you need to do is you just need to pay for your onedrive or your google drive subscription and you need to practice good data management and you need to make sure that everything is backed up there that's the answer so are they trying to sell one drive sometimes what no no no no i just mean that no no no no i'm not saying you i'm saying are they no no i'm that's my answer that's my answer if you don't want to worry about oh oh oh i see what you mean so that that is the answer though so if you have heavy data requirements the answer is you need to make sure that everything is on a nas and all your machines are doing regular nightly backups and if you don't have heavy data requirements the answer is cloud storage has gotten so affordable i mean uh the the sponsor that we work with all the time the 45 drives builds their builds their storage box backplates uh backlash yeah backblaze it's super affordable to back things up to the cloud these days there's just no excuse anymore so from a tech shop's perspective the answer is educating your customers about what their options are to ensure that they're not going to lose their data it's it's and if they if they don't think it's important because i used to i used to work in a tech shop and lots of people would be like i don't need data back up i don't care about my stuff uh i always bring up the the wedding and baby pictures argument um because then they're like oh wait i can't lose those i'm like yeah where are you yeah it's like okay well maybe you should consider something like what if you if you don't want to put that stuff in the cloud there's some things you might not want in the cloud no matter what you can do local storage with the the three things where you have like on on the device on a similar device that might be in the same area and then on a on a hopefully different type of device in an area that is very far away you can do that thing if you can afford it and if you can maintain it or you can just go with the cloud whatever but you should have more than one copy of your data yeah absolutely i you know what was uh what was the eureka moment for me when i when i learned that my data needed to be back rated and backed up when i learned how a um when i learned how a hard drive works that was the moment for me because it seems wild right it's nuts okay like if you've ever actually seen the read and write head right if you've seen it move back and forth over the spinning disc okay at 7 200 rpm i remember i remember someone from western digital explaining this to me once they're like yeah at the outer edge of the spinning disc um you know keeping that head stable it's a real it's a real engineering challenge because effectively it's ripping around in hurricane force winds and i'm like what we hold on a second my precious memories are on this thing excuse me i need to go for a minute yeah it's crazy and the fact that they like basically never fail unless you drop them is is pretty nuts as well i don't know obviously they do but like i have hard drives that have been running for a decade basically it's unbelievable it's nuts um but but yes back up your data even if you think you don't care now um to maybe some of the younger audience i would say there's stupid stuff i had this amazing wallpaper once it was like a really great ultra wide wallpaper it had like uh it had like a horse and cart or something and it was like labeled with like console stuff and then there was some faster thing and it was pc or something it was this really cool cartoon show i remember that yeah i had it on my desktop at uh at the old office the old langley house and i i don't know i just like i've tried to find it again and i can't find it and i'm like oh that sucks i wish i had i wish i'd put it somewhere because having everything instantly available at your fingertips has been great in a lot of ways right like everything's a quick google search away except for things that are gone because the internet has gotten so big and so broad that it's so easy now for things to disappear forever there's this great flash game i used to play called pearl harbor where you're this you're this plane you go back and forth back and forth every time you get to the end of the scene it just kind of turns around and you're fighting something i don't i don't remember exactly how it played anymore because one day it disappeared and you can't play it anymore it's that experience is completely gone there's that whole saying like the internet remembers and it's like yeah sort of unless it doesn't and in in in in a lot of cases it does but in a lot of cases due to the sheer size of the internet it doesn't it's just sites will go down and all your stuff's just gone um so back it up i know a lot of the kids watching uh aren't gonna take this to heart because i i sure didn't but the memories that you have and like the photos and stuff that you have now um back them up you'll care later i haven't care now you'll care later i have lost uh a big chunk of photos once it was really hard it was really rough yep uh yeah people in floatplane chat are talking about their are talking about their bad experiences losing data um neil cortez says then your house burns down is burgled or flooded so there are solutions to these things um i have a fireproof nas at my house that i actually use for extremely important things i can't fit everything on it because it's just a two hard drive nas so it's just two drives in raid one but you should absolutely have some kind of contingency also conveniently i have a super fast internet connection both at home and at the office and i have keys to the server room so i can put things at the office if i really want to but off constant or off like general geographic area is also a very good idea like if you if you're planning on backing up data and it's not in the cloud it's that that three stages thing at a minimum is very important and raid doesn't count it it should be rated but raid does not count i i am surprised that there isn't um kind of like an open source super easy to use community based like hey uh you know i'll show you my data if you show me yours kind of backup app i've been pushing the unraid guys to build this forever like unraid friends or something like that where what i want is fairly straightforward just built right into the os i can friend someone effectively and we can allocate uh we can we can cross allocate a shared uh storage space to each other and then it will effectively just take whatever i want to put in my in my off-site important folder or i'll flag certain folders as as key folders it'll synchronize them to my friend server and store an encrypted copy locally on their server and then i can effectively take some of my storage and give them the same thing now you can set up stuff like this you can do it manually but i think it's the kind of thing i've told them for years now i think it's the kind of thing that could really set their software apart you can do it i what's that i would get evangelical about that i i and i know obviously yeah you can do this yourself and quite a few people do but some of the the you got to consider like if you are the tech person in this like manual setup you now have to maintain this for as many people as you you enter into that agreement exactly and i would love like to have this i would i would love to just like basically sell little boxes um that i'm obviously not making money on but sell little boxes to like my whole family and just be like okay we're creating a friend's storage pool on unraid it works updated every once in a while see you later um like that would be that would be great that'd be amazing i'd i'd go nuts with that but i'd try to get basically everyone i knew because like it's it it really sucks being the tech person for your group of people and then having someone be like oh i my laptop got wet or something i lost all my wedding photos and it's like yeah i told you to do backups for that and you didn't because i guess it was complicated or whatever and it would be great if like there was just some yeah i don't know i would like that i'd be unrate homies with you yeah for sure for sure and like i would like in a minute yeah i would just throw like a giant unread box at the office and everyone could just have their encrypted data on there i've got some people saying like hey you know what about if someone got busted with illegal content sure but it's it's encrypted so whatever illegal content they have you gotta you gotta imagine think of it kind of like if um you know someone put child pornography in their dropbox dropbox is not in possession of the child pornography that is encrypted data that they can't even read um ultimately whoever put it there is the one who would be in trouble in that case so there there should be no reason from like a a personal uh criminal liability standpoint that it would matter i would also think though that you'd want you'd want your unraided homies to be people you you know and mostly trust anyway but friend friend raid coming soon to ltt store says jamer gamerperson yeah exactly synology has that feature the last time that i tried to mess with it it wasn't exactly what lions is saying it can be done it's cludgy and synology nasa's are well they're synology it's not cross-platform so what i want is a way to just do it on something that runs on cheap commodity hardware yeah yeah because you like i just gave the that probably i probably put that person down that path because i said i would just sell my family these little boxes but um that's that's not particularly what i mean like my my brother's pretty techy my dad's pretty techy et cetera um they would probably just want to use some old computer hardware that they had laying around and connect some drives to it like it's they wouldn't want to buy a new synology now it's like yeah it's it's diff yep uh people are saying try explaining that to a judge i don't have to explain that to a judge you guys don't think this has ever come up like come on guys you gotta you gotta use just come up you gotta use your common sense here all right cool all right uh why don't we uh why don't we talk to our sponsors and then i'll be showing you guys some pictures

right so this is it this is it the new digs ah here we go should we start with um like the main floor i guess you know my favorite part of this is gonna be uh the part where you've never seen it before also that i can't see them oh well that's a little awkward uh all right well there it is i will bring up the stream but it will be it will be very delayed but yeah all right yep that that makes sense so that's the stairwell the uh the style is a little a little um over the top for for us um like it's super nice but in like a kind of old-fashioned kind of way um so that's pretty cool but there's something where like when when it's when it's decorated and done up by the person that currently lives there like people anyone who's like shop for apartments or anything done anything like that um they'll know like hey it's your own flair on things is going to change the place a lot yeah but that fireplace though i get a kick out of this picture frame so you've got the picture you got the frame around it you got the light that shines down on the picture and then you've got another trim that goes around the picture and i'm kind of sitting here going i don't own a single piece of art um what do i do what do i put there i have no idea there's all this there's all this like wiring in these walls um that just i don't want a light there what would i do with the light there you could put your uh your it's not your wedding photo um with one with you and yvonne on the thing oh the honeymoon photo yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i could i could put that there um i know you yeah i don't know man uh here's out of the things that you have that's the only thing i can think of yeah here's a shot of the kitchen um so we're probably going to refinish the floors they're solid wood floors which is super cool uh would be extremely wasteful to take them out so i think we don't like the color so i think what we're going to do is we're going to sand them down and refinish them something a little bit cooler a little bit yeah a little bit less a little bit lighter lighter maybe a little bit cooler we're pretty pretty overall happy the kitchen looks pretty amazing so many people are telling me to put a tv above the fireplace guys are you doing that to trigger me is that why you're asking me to put a tv above my fireplace it's the worst i refuse i absolutely refuse oh man brass caribou over on floatplane says i'm liking that kitchen desk um okay so that's not called a kitchen desk um that space is designed for you to take phone calls and write down messages and stuff yeah remember that kitchen desk there's so so many things about this place are so like 1995. baller 90s yeah yeah super baller 90s because everyone had coded phones right yeah and and you would often someone would call your residents and not be able to call a specific person so it was very often they would get the wrong person it'd be very often that that person would not be available at that time so you wouldn't want that like desk so you could like take calls um i think it was built in 1992 so that should give you some idea of the era of things unfortunately that means there's no network wiring whatsoever but hey at least they've got this fantastic built-in uh bookcase unit with this wonderful tv spot here that you can tell is totally the shape of modern tvs so that's really convenient [laughter] absolutely fantastic yeah it is crt tastic and then over here um this spot right here is a built-in cd storage unit by the way uh another very very specific art location i know right i just don't know what to do with that stuff it's just ah it actually has more than two fireplaces there is a uh there's at least one more i can't remember how many more there are because i think we're putting in one more um let's see that's so that's it for the main floor if you guys are bored of this i can definitely stop showing you house pictures but uh if you are not bored of it i would be happy to show you a little bit more of it there's a good look at the downstairs here i'm just making sure we can't see outside yep there we go there's a good shot of the downstairs so there's a foosball table there this is funny apparently this closet is specifically a little bit taller than a normal closet so that you can tuck your folding ping-pong table into it that is apparently a forgot thing that that's actually amazing oh my goodness dude so that's pretty great there is an unfinished basement oh man most of the basement is unfinished we're going to turn this area where the ping pong table is here into a theater room uh this area here is going to be like a a gaming area for me and my kids and my wife i'm probably going to try to cram five pcs in here i don't know if it'll fly so there'll be at least three for the kids and then my wife and i might have our machines upstairs in the office over here is gonna be so cool to have a five person land area though like i hear yes i understand but but oh it's not as big as it looks this is a wide-angle lens four at least four though because then you could do left for dad oh yeah okay i'll do my best i'll do my best okay yeah yeah yeah it is not as big as it looks at all that place is also pretty yeah someone could come over with like a laptop and you could just do like a temporary table yep for sure for sure and there will be a second uh or there will be at least one other gaming machine or there will be at least two other gaming machines in the basement so there will be one in the media room obviously and then there will be a vr space that's over where that foosball table was um that will also have a tv on the wall and will obviously also be gaming capable if it's going to be where my vr setup's going to be right so um i'm there's going to be a lot of content coming over the next little bit here guys because the place is is going to need a real tech makeover i don't think i'm going to do all of the stuff myself this time though i spent i mean it took me 10 years to get my current house to the state where i'm really happy with the technology situation with my server closet with my wi-fi access points everywhere i need them to be everything's hardline cat6a like this place is perfect i've got all of my base stations my lighthouses for my vr in the living room uh all wired up through the ceiling so none of the cables are running down the wall or anything like that but it took me it's not often i get home at the end of the day after work and i feel like crawling around in my crawl space you know what i mean like i i think i'm yeah i think i'm gonna let a professional come in and do the cat6a this time instead of doing it myself um yeah i so a bunch of people in floatplane chat were asking for moving vlogs i i can i guess you can speak to this i don't suspect there will be moving blogs but but no like what you just said i'm sure there will be like tech upgrade there will be content around the the house anyways so the uh people are asking to see the mechanical room so like the the boiler and furnace and stuff so uh it doesn't have a furnace it has in-floor radiant heat which is sweet and get this i don't even have to hire someone to do the check of it because jake got flir to send us that like thirty thousand dollar thermal camera so i'm just do it myself so you just turn the heat up across the whole house and then you just walk around with your thermal camera and make sure that there's no dead spots yeah pretty cool uh anyway here's the the mechanical room is crazy it's huge this room really is as big as it looks and the reason for it is that they had intended to put in a pool and they never did it and they had wanted all the pool equipment in this room and it never went in so it doesn't have a continuous water heater like we put in our current house but it does have two hot water tanks so you should basically never run out which i thought was pretty funny that is a very um 90s continuous heaters don't exist yet or they are too expensive solution to that and there is absolutely no ethernet in this place whatsoever so i'm gonna need that uh telus says fiber is available to the address though so that's good so someone in chat uh said where's luke's room and then someone responded this looks like luke's room nice i take it here this can be this can be luke's room jk this is the master bedroom pretty simple you know a lot of the places we went and looked at had crazy master bedrooms like there's just a weird sitting area in it like i'm kind of sitting here going who sits in their bedroom like that is so weird or they would have like a balcony that opens out in front of the house i'm sitting here going they'd have like a and it would be staged by the realtor or whatever and they would have a little they'd have like a little table for sitting and having tea or i'm sitting here going who would do that in your room yeah why would you do that in your room unless you have like literally a servant but like that's you know because it's always it's always places um where you would see this stuff that are enormous right and have a gorgeous backyard and patio so i'm sitting here going why on earth would i be sitting here sitting on the front of the top of the front of my house when i could just be in my backyard where i have privacy yes i would like to observe the cul-de-sac or wherever it is yeah or whatever i need to i need to observe every car that drives down my street perfectly um i think that's pretty much it for the pictures that i can show without showing any of the exterior and that's my goal is to not show the exterior of this house at all um something that we something that we did to make things a little bit um more challenging is a thing i'm just actually not going to talk about just to make my life my life easier so i get to go pick up the keys in 20 minutes which means we better get through some more tech topics otherwise we're gonna have had a one topic show so yeah thanks for thanks for looking at house pictures oh people are asking all kinds of things here uh it's so obvious you don't have servants says new master 96 um yes i do not have servants yes it has air conditioning i actually like the air conditioning at my current place better not just because i and i did it um but because it's uh it's room by room at our current place because we did it with mini splits whereas at the new place it's just one big unit so you're gonna you're gonna have rooms that are hotter and you're gonna have rooms that are not as hot and that just is kind of annoying um someone says looks like the roof needs to be redone uh the roof does need to be redone it's gonna cost like a hundred grand or something like that we're putting we're putting in solar though and stuff oh that's cool there's a reason we're going like super sustainable like forever are you getting power walls um i don't think powerwall's here yet their solar roofing stuff isn't here yet so i don't know i haven't actually looked into that yep tech topic tech topic are we still doing house questions um yeah let's do a tech topic for sure heck yeah former microsoft employee stole 10 million dollars in xbox gift cards amazing i'm going to butcher this name but i'm going to try vladimir kobashik was working at microsoft's redmond office testing e-commerce infrastructure he's 26 year old i don't know why this matters uh he quickly discovered a flaw in the system uh that he then exploited he did not report it he exploited it he started small uh he he started off with ten to a hundred dollar codes um he didn't generate really all that many but he was he was scalping them he was selling them two years later only two years later he had generated over 152 000 gift codes at a valuation of 10.1 million dollars he flipped those cards uh for bitcoin and then flipped that bitcoin for cash and was very quickly living on a seven figure lakefront home um i don't know how you could possibly think you weren't going to get caught for that um oh man and i suspect just like after a while of not getting caught he just thinks he's invincible and then buys a seven-figure lakefront home i guess so i nine years in prison for gift card theft i mean it was 10 million dollars he effectively stole 10 million yeah that is crazy apparently he was responsible um i don't see where this is yeah he he flipped so many cards 152 000 cards that were just generated of thin air right so he was responsible for global fluctuations in the price of xbox gift cards on reseller markets because he flooded them so hard holy absolutely crazy that's nice that is unfreaking real man oh what can you do about it though right uh yeah i mean the second it goes into bitcoin it's it's uh it's a little difficult to track i do wonder how exactly he was caught um i don't know if like one of his uh fellow employees comes and visits his home and is like how'd you get this but yeah pretty crazy pretty crazy all right i am getting a call from the wife so i think i'm gonna have to go pretty soon but why don't we try and get through a couple more topics here uh intel and apple are gonna be the first to get three nanometer from tsmc uh they are both lined up as the first customers for the new process which will be referred to as n3 and will be deployed in late 2022. it will offer a 10 to 15 performance increase at the same power and transistor count a 30 power reduction at the same clocks and complexity as well as 70 and 20 gains in logic density and sram density respectively according to an okay report both companies are already testing their chip designs that are being produced using the n3 process and it also states intel is apparently preparing at least two products to be made with the process one for notebooks and one for servers it's possible these will only be more niche products as opposed to intel's mainstream consumer products but only time will tell apple will be using uh n3 on an soc in late 2022 or early 2023 in the ipad and apparently that will be a new processor uh versus the current m1 which kind of makes sense because m1 will have had well it'll be two years at least two years old by that time we know that intel will be outsourcing some atom and xeon based socs to tsmc so it's a safe bet that these are among those products fascinating i have one more quick thing to announce on ltt store we have a new product oh yeah reflective heatsink shirt is here ladies and gentlemen look at this fantastic modeling team we've got that's right it's reflective has a reflective ltt logo on the back look at this guy look at this girl look at this guy look at this other guy hey and you can get them now for 19.99 also we have brought back mystery shirts they're 12.99 and they're a mystery a lot of them are going to be older and less popular ones or ones that are we only had oddball sizes left and good stuff like that so hey there you go they're a mystery but they're cheaper and i think that's pretty much it for the show i think i gotta go ladies and gentlemen so i'll just do a couple of super chats here oh my goodness there's quite a few but at least i managed to click the tab so they didn't all go away um adrian frick recommends a game the messenger i'm not looking for more games right now though i got a bunch of them got a bunch of them last week uh thanks bob costco anyone else notice uh little linus and luke's beards disappear going from the intro to the sponsor uh yes that's because the sponsor things are older uh michael says thanks for all the content love watching the videos hey awesome uh robert says windows 11 system requirements are a mess hard to keep up with the leaks and discussions and their own tool is still not for users yeah 100 uh the good news is that it's not actually launched yet so they've got time to get this stuff figured out yeah uh hunter says the tpm 2.0 requirement is going to put a strain on schools i can tell you for a fact my district can't afford slash doesn't want to pay for new positions um yeah that's actually a really really good point they do have quite a quite a few years um but i do know that a lot of schools try to stay on the most modern operating system at the very least so that that will make that tough tomex says live streams don't work in the floatplane app i built for webos tvs i'm going to fix it and test next week sweet a web os app that's pretty cool that's very cool yeah i'm an lg tv guy myself so unfortunately most of the time anyone's live streaming on floatplane it's me so there's no point in me watching it on my webos tv but that's fantastic um with that i think you probably have to go uh yes let me just see if there's and i know you're gonna want to get sucked into that i'm just trying to christian says look into smart vents they open and close based on room temperature yeah i've heard some of them aren't very good though so i'll have to have a look at that um and lyon says if you reach out to elon musk i bet you could get not only the solar roof but also the power wall uh i don't know i i kind of doubt it i don't we're not exactly on a first name basis i i don't think he cares um uh josh says hey a couple of wan shows ago you read a super chat i sent i didn't really expect you to read it let alone genuinely take it seriously it made my day so thanks for that hey you're welcome josh all right thanks everyone we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye [music] oops oh whoops i need the bit there we go [music] you
