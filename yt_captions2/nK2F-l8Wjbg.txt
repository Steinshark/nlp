hi everyone in this video we're going to be using weight painting to refine the way that the character mesh deforms as we move the bones around before we enter that though i quickly want to select a character in object mode and go into the modify panel and share we have this armature modifier which was added in automatically when we parented the character to the armature on this modifier i want to just enable preserve volume which is going to prevent certain areas of the mesh from shrinking as we rotate some of the bones all right i'll then select the armature and go into pose mode and then select the character and change the mode to a weight paint now because we were in pose mode previously we can right click on any of the buttons to select them and see a nice weight visualization for them so the blue regions of the mesh represent all of the vertices of which the currently selected bone has no influence and the red regions are the regions which that bone influences the most naturally colors in between are just varying degrees of influence so for example on this leg bone consider some light blue appear showing that it has to say slight influence over these stomach vertices and then that quickly fades into green then yellow orange and finally red now some bones like this chest bone for instance don't have any red because it's shearing influence over these chest vertices with the other bones in that region such as the two shoulder bones the neck bone and the spine bone all right now the way this way painting mode works is that with a bone selected we can left-click drag over the mesh to start painting in weights so here i've painted in some red down the side on the head bone so if i now rotate the head bone you can see that all of those vertices rotate with it pressing t to bring up the tool shelf we get all of our brush options so i can change the radius of the brush here and also the weight of the brush so currently i'm drawing in red but if i want to draw in a slightly lower influence i could change that to say 0.5 and i'll be growing in green if i change that even lower i'll be drawing in a light blue now if i click on there brush icon itself got a couple of different types of brushes so importantly versus subtract brush so we can get rid of some of the mess that we create or some of the things that the automatic waiting did that we are not happy with and another one i like using is this add brush to this lets us sort of layer weights by just repeatedly brushing over an area and in this way we can build up nice gradients there's a ton of other stuff that we can do but i'm going to get more into those details when we do the weight painting for the character's clothing and armor since those can be a little bit finicky and we'll need some more precise control but for now i just want to get rid of this mess that i've created so at any point we can revert back to the automatic waiting that we had at the start by selecting the bones that we want to revert in cs i'll just select all of them i've only modified the head bone but just to be safe and i'll go into the weights menu here and say assign automatic from bones and now we're back to where we started all right so i can i'll just play around a little bit moving and rotating these different bones just to see if there are any deformations that i'm particularly unhappy with so for example as i lift this arm up we're getting this big bulge up the side of the body which definitely needs to be addressed but apart from that most of the automatic weighting seems to have worked pretty well so we won't need to make too many adjustments in this video let's quickly try the legs they seem fine maybe the sort of hips here are moving a little bit too much as i shift the leg back and forth by the way this interesting color the twisting at the moment just represents that this is a non defamation bone this i say bone so it can't have weights assigned to it and the same goes for the to pull targets now to fix this a first issue i noted let's select the upper arm bone and i'm going to change my brush to a subtract brush and just decrease the radius a little bit and i'm gonna come in here and i press the edge to overlay this wireframe so i can see exactly where the vertices of the mesh ah just start painting over some of these vertices which the upper run burn shouldn't really be influencing can maybe make my brush a little bit bigger actually all right so that's already looking like an improvement i want to do the same thing for the shoulder bone so just paint over here and we can see obviously how the mesh is deforming while we're doing this so you can get a good idea of the impact of our changes and we can obviously put the bones in different poses while we're doing this to see how it's looking and the other nice thing of course is that since we have the mirror modifier all the changes that we're making to this arm automatically being copied over to the other side as well so that we don't have to worry about duplicating our work this shoulder bone is may be influencing the neck a little bit too much as well so come in here and just try and remove some of the weighting on these vertices all right that probably helps a bit the other thing i'm happy with is how these verses here are bunching together as i rotate the arm bone so maybe go into add mode and just add some weight to these lattices here all right so now as i lift this up those should come back as well and they weren't bunched together so much all right i think that is a big improvement so i'm going to leave the arm there let me just quickly reset my pose and then from side view i want to adjust the leg a little bit but the arm is kind of in my way here so i'll just select this and rotate it back and we can then worry about the leg so the bone that's causing the trouble is this upper leg bone here so i'll come in and just go into subtract mode and subtract some of the weights around the stomach i think perhaps the head of the bone is positioned a little bit too low down which is why so much of the sort of bottom here is rotating strangely so this isn't really part of weight painting but it's a good idea to adjust that so i'll just go into edit mode on the bones and make sure i've got the heads of both sides selected and i'll just bring this up and a little bit back maybe like so and that really seems to be deforming a lot more naturally now it's quite tricky to see how the knee is deforming with all of these bones in the way so i'm quickly going to go into the year armature settings and just change the display mode to wire for the moment so we can see this a little bit better and currently the knee looks a little bit strange especially at the front here it's quite pointy so i'm going to go back into which maintain mode with control tab or of course from the menu over there and i'll select the lower leg bone and just add some weights to this edge loop above the knee something like that and then for the upper leg bone add some weights to the edge loop just below the knee and that should help smooth things out and indeed it looks a lot less pointy now which is very nice the deformation is behind the knee still a little bit odd though so i need to come in and try and adjust that a little bit so for the softer leg bone we'll just be adding some weights here on the lower part of the leg and under the reverse for the lower leg bone just adding some weights above the sort of line of the knee and i think that should give us a fairly decent defamation it seems to pretty much okay here the only thing i'm still finding irritating which isn't really a weights issue but just coming past the pole target here how the leg is sort of flipping over so i'd like it if these pull target bones were just a little bit further out as a we didn't have to deal with that problem quite so much so i'm going to go into edit mode on the bones here and just move these bones forward on the y-axis like so and now that should be a lot less frustrating all right i'll reset the pose and i'm also changed back to the nice octahedral display and with that i'd say that the weight painting and sort of final adjustments of the ricoh complete and we can now look forward to animating the character in the next episodes so until then cheers
