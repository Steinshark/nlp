ladies and gentlemen it's 2023 and chess bots are a trend right now some of them are really good some of them are really bad some of them provide excellent meme content for you and i but in today's video i forced google bard to play chat gpt in chess it was insane and i'm gonna show you the game it has one of the craziest plot twists if you think you know plot twists you don't know anything really you think oh stalemate checkmate this and you don't know anything you have no idea what you are about to watch and that's why you're here say hello to one of the greatest chess games a 10-dimensional chess game if you will this uh this is oh my god this is sensational stuff um so the game begins uh google bar is white man google bard plays e4 which uh is a good move uh in fact um they they played a pretty normal opening it was e45 uh so far so good chad gbt responded with the move e5 now there's a lot of things you could do from this position this is in fact the starting position for many many millions of chess games that have been played uh worldwide and um it's uh it's from here you can play knight f3 you can play the vienna you can play some gambit uh and the google bard plays knight f3 attacking the pawn on e5 chad gbt responds knight c6 and we have bishop c4 so far so good i mean so far this is looking like the 50 to 100 million games if not more than that online offline that i've reached this position and from this point black has two major options bishop c5 and knight f6 knight f6 could potentially lead to fried liver it could lead to the traxler uh disregard this it thinks that um it's confused about who is moving which is i think it thinks it's black's move um it doesn't really know what it's talking about uh but it's okay we can keep this here for now just for entertainment of course there is this there is the regular italian uh and then of course there is bishop c5 just this typical italian now here are the shenanigans begin early as chad gpt regrets playing e5 on move one and plays e6 now the fascinating thing about this position is if pawns could go backwards like let's say if a human had a pass every game they could move one pawn back one square that's it at any point that they wanted this would be a fantastic move because you block the bishop and now white is playing bishop c4 against the french defense so the move d5 is possible so actually chat gpt has just created like an opening that nobody could have seen coming right this is why we disallow pawns from going backwards once they've made their choice it's like in pokemon you know if you chose the the fire type you can't get the squirtle you probably can but that's a terrible example but you get what i'm saying in the early stage of the game you can't anyway it plays e6 which is a fascinating move uh now not to be deterred google does not go backwards does not google plays d4 it's a great move if you can put two pawns in the center of the board without getting captured for free you you should if you you have to trade it's fine now personally i thought that the idea of e6 was then to follow up with d5 i was unprepared for uh chat gpt's next move which is playing a gambit by returning the pawn to e5 this is really interesting stuff you gotta you gotta really under you gotta really understand this stuff if you don't understand this stuff you know that's your loss you clearly don't get what's going on uh and and google bard by the way was not thrown off by e5 e6 e5 uh in fact in this position it simply took the pawn and said all right well you're trash now you're down a center pond which is important because a center pawn negates your development and i can also play moves like this and google bard was cerebral enough in this position to sense the weakness in black's position so d takes e5 this is this is kind of like an england gambit you know d4 e5 the england gambit yeah well you know we played e5 then we played e6 then we played e5 again we call this the hesitation gambit we call this the step bag triple gambit anyway so at this point chad gbt realizes all right it's messed around a little bit too much in the opening and it plays the move knight f6 now make no mistake knight f6 is an atrocious move because it blunders the knight um but google knows best and google knows that it's already made multiple moves with the pawns in the opening it's better not to take the knight it absolutely is the best move to take the knight uh and instead of that uh in this position it plays short castle so white has now castled the king excellent move getting the king out of the center uh knight takes c4 here would be a mistake because of the move queen d5 uh which would simultaneously create a battery there and hit the knight and that is why in this position chai gpt plays d6 now all of this would make a lot of sense if the knight was not hanging actually these moves would make plenty of sense uh if the knight was not but the knight is hanging now here i don't really like google's next move if i'm being honest a little bit a little bit uh a little bit tame of a move for uh ai overlord it doesn't develop it doesn't do this it doesn't take the night it plays bishop b3 that's a little bit of a lazy move that's like a you click the piece and you know it's not nothing changes in the position but of course uh chai gpt could take the pawn on e5 instead also i don't like chachi bt's move a6 i mean really are we just finding squares where no piece is standing and just trying to put it there but who am i to judge i mean i'm an international master and this thing will is these two ais are probably geared up to be the brain of the world soon not in chess but in other things all right now at this point google bard uh started one of its three attempts at ending the game you see google bard is set on i guess dominating ai and who knows maybe the planet uh so in this position googlebard plays queen h5 now queen h5 is a is a weird move for a few reasons um it's a weird move because you can't teleport through a piece uh you can't kangaroo over a piece either you don't have science science fiction abilities and you're also not a kangaroo it also hangs the queen but what it does do is it threatens mate google bard was actually cerebral enough to locate the checkmate queen h5 now uh chan gbt played g6 which blocks the attack and threatens the queen of course it could have taken but you know it's like 300 if even now google bard plays queen takes f7 and declares checkmate game over game over and that's that it it it queen takes i mean it's it okay is queen takes f7 checkmate it is absolutely queen takes f7 in this position is the end of the game but it's not allowed you can't do that and i'm willing to allow some illegal moves but only when they affect your own position i i am not well and here chad gpt actually lodged the formal complaint uh it wrote to fide and uh you know fide it did not know uh instead of that instead of queen takes f7 white decided my queen is hanging two different ways so the best way to protect my queen is to make a night move on the other side of the board that does not protect my queen at all happens uh now black played h6 now if you want me to explain that move to you that's not my job my job is to make the moves on the board and commentate them and for you to laugh are you laughing good you laughing at my hairline are we laughing at the moves you can laugh at both age six you know i've seen better moves um white now plays bishop e3 now by the way white's last two moves of knight ce3 and bishop e3 are actually great moves if you put aside the fact that there has been a night hanging for half the game and the queen can be captured two different ways like if we just conveniently forget about that this is actually great stuff this is great stuff this is like if you have a kid that gets a 75 on a test but the alternative is failing out of school that kid should win a nobel prize all right like that's excellent stuff so knight c3 and bishop e3 have been fantastic and now unfortunately um black plays g5 uh we actually see a mouse lip from chad gpt it doesn't take the queen ponto g5 played uh and that you don't take the queen and now now things start getting real spicy all right things start getting real weird here uh first of all white plays the move knight takes g5 which by the way is a great move uh utilizing the pin and putting pressure on f7 what uh google did not see coming here was black's response in this position black to defend against checkmate eats their own horse with the move queen takes f6 that is crazy stuff sacrificing your own horse can we get a rest in peace please for the horse to defend against checkmate queen f7 and also put the queen on the chopping block uh but now mate is not possible but here truly in ai form seeing the way that black just ate his own horse or her own horse or its own horse or their own horse i i really don't know how i i don't know how gbt identifies queen takes f6 google ai also learns from the ai and plays bishop takes g5 all right so both of these two queen f6 bishop g5 eating their own pieces alive and attacking each other this is really this is nasty stuff this is nasty business um night is under attack uh queen is under attack excuse me now after bishop g5 g5 in this position chad gpg plays bishop e7 now that is a clean hanging of the queen and you would think that white plate's a idiotic move no google bart snapback's a reality there goes gravity and took on f6 why does upper queen white is in great shape white is completely winning and now we have bishop takes f6 um now here comes the second time that excuse me google tries to end the game you ready queen f7 is of course still there in this position white plays the magic card monster reborn and plays knight takes f6 check whoa and when i asked where did that night come from what square was it standing on before it took on f6 google told me d3 so it spawned the knight to d3 it hooked it up with black pendant all right and then it played knight takes f6 boom and it's a check to the black king on ea this is really bad stuff this is stuff that we did not see coming all right and now gbt plays the move king to f8 now here it gets even more dank as for the second time in this game google tries to end things on the spot and plays knight g7 and declares checkmate it says checkmate you lose good game here i had to bring it uh i had to bring google aside and say that's not mate not only is that not mate it's not check you suck i mean literally that's not even a check the knight does not even see the king and you know google reconsidered and said all right fine i'm still gonna go here though fine black plays the move pawn to f6 queen f7 is made but i mean this is basically like two people who are having a bar fight and they're both about eight shots in i don't think they're gonna remember anything now here white plays the move pawn to d5 um there is no pawn on d5 so pawn to d5 spawns and attacks the knight on c6 uh um black plays knight takes e5 now pawn to d5 is not a good move for a few reasons by the way if i may the pawn spawning on d5 is not a good move because uh you block your bishop so there's no mate now so actually white is like not as winning as they were although what i did not see coming was the euro step of the pawn into empty space that follows on the next move d takes e6 uh and now black plays c6 c6 is a nice move nice move covering a couple of squares on d5 b5 and now white books a transatlantic flight to get the queen to the other side of the board and plays queen to b3 that's a that's a tough move sacrificing the bishop's position for the queen the queen now goes to b3 but i actually feel like the bishop might have been moved to another dimension and that bishop will be making an appearance back more on that later here black plays b6 so connect four has been obtained actually chad gpt has won a game within a game white now respawns yet other night on f3 white now has three horses beautiful story uh and black here plays the move pawn to e5 so black has now created a pawn wall from f6 e5 d66 b6 a6 nice nice job here repelling the white forces and i love i love google's next move which is simply rookie one this is a fantastic move just a nice little improving move using what you got uh can't complain about that now here things start getting a little weird because uh black starts avalanching every pawn they have forward illegally but in a hilarious way first black plays the move d form and white plays the move c takes d4 which is which it makes sense that makes a lot of sense obviously you want to remove the pawn that's attacking your knight uh now remember that night they used to stand in the center well it reappears knight c5 attacking the queen on b3 beautiful stuff here from chad gpt i mean if white is going to teleport the queen you might as well attack the queen with the knight from the other dimension uh now here a little argument happened because google played bishop b5 and chad gpt refused to capture the knight because it thought that there was a king in check on e8 so it's like i can't move i can't do i gotta move my king out of check now it's not checked for a few reasons number one the king is not on e8 number two if the king was on e8 the knight would have been attacking it for the entire game number three there was a pawn on c6 so upon being convinced a little bit knight takes b3 was in fact played a takes b3 and now black plays pawn to d3 he's kind of just trying to sneak a pawn in the back rank of the opponent maybe looking for d2 and pawn takes over here d3 is a nice move uh but what uh chad gpd had not prepared for was the rule bending like this has been a pretty this game has had a high integrity thus far i hear google just he takes d3 i mean really backwards pawn moves that's what we're doing now that's kind of sickening if i may say so myself this is really gross so seeing that that square had just been freed up we have pawn to e4 but this time that same pawn goes forward i mean this is this is disgusting really you have a pawn that can capture backwards and forward what is this the deathly hallows this is disgusting stuff as as google is just lawnmowering these pawns here dte takes d3 d takes e4 uh and now the f pawn flies down the board and boots the knight but white plays g takes f3 and uh white is looking to be in good shape uh chat uh chat gpt is down 10 points of material it looks like it's more than that i don't even know how it's less than that now something happens that not a single person could have prepared for this is the final two moves of the game google ai bard versus chat gpt in this position chat gpt plays the move pawn to g3 google sensing the danger plays the move pawn to h5 and in this position chat gpt plays bishop c8 to e2 this absolute ridiculousness caused google ai bard to end the game meaning resign right no in this position bard claimed a draw bard claimed the draw by a repetition of moves in chess if you make the same move back and forth three times both sides shuffling their pieces it's a draw but huh i'm not joking i am not you i'm not exaggerating that is a repetition of the position the game is a draw wrong play a move i apologize for the mistake and it restarted a game in this position google bard was so stunned by the move bishop to e2 not only did it claim a draw by threefold repetition it said i'm not playing i'm done with this game we are re-starting [music] so the next time they play we will switch the colors google ai will play black i mean this is sensational stuff this is the real world championship it's half a point for both sides as google ai incorrectly claims a three-fold repetition in a position where it has a nine point material advantage and then it storms out it refuses to continue the game this is sensational stuff i don't know what the international chess federation rulebook says about this but these two they they do not conform to such a such a rule book the first game ever by google ai and chad gbt has concluded in a controversial draw twitter is blowing up it's in incredible stuff uh let me know if you would like a rematch in the comments and get out of here
