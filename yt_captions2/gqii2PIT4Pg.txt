have you ever gotten a delivery you totally weren't expecting well that happens here too this was supposed to be a video about an unusual motherboard that we ordered from china and had been eagerly tracking as it made its way across the ocean imagine our surprise when instead of this we got this surely this level of packaging makes no sense whatsoever for a motherboard but for a full system where did this come from what is inside it can it play doom can you get one of your very own we're going to answer all the these questions and more after this word from our sponsor build redux imagine building your dream gaming rig and then actually buying it customize your build any way you want and let build redux do the heavy lifting all at a price competitive to building a pc yourself check out build redux at the link below step one is to not slice myself open on this packing crate this is freaking dangerous actually before we do that though our first clue is on the lid this was sent to us by c key a a maker and billybilly creator who started his own design studio in china to make mechanical keyboards back in 2019 shiki was inspired by a small custom form factor motherboard that another billybilly creator whose name translates to something like ancient ape made in partnership with maxon which moves many of the internal connections to the back of the motherboard kind of like we saw with that concept from gigabyte that was cool in theory but in practice left a lot to be desired oh yeah it's g to pry off you can't tell me what to do you're not my real dad the main innovation here then is that they sought to build a more cohesive version of that product and they're calling it diy ape because you see on previous iterations we'd seen that even though the cables could no longer be seen they would take up extra space whereas this it's amazing wo this side panel has no side panel this is sick this is the perfect marriage of an open a test bench style case and a case case no way look at this they even have machining on the case itself that matches the machining on the so this is a completely custom motherboard then what else is in here uh not a pc power cable i'm familiar with i'm familiar with the connector we use it for our lights in the studio i've just never seen it used for a computer the benefits of this are clear compared to the standard c13 power cable that we use it has a lock which means it'll never accidentally become unplugged but because the other end is uh for china and because i don't have studio lights at home the odds of me actually having a this are zero just kidding we got this but before we plug plug it in i want to talk a little bit more about how this came to be because there are two things that make the motherboard in particular different from others on the market there's the fact the connectors are on the back we talked about that but what we haven't talked about is that this shape of motherboard is one you have probably never seen before it has the same number of pcie slots that's one as many itx but it's as wide as a full-sized atx board giving it a ton of room for well what let's find out shall we ltt store.com ape calls this form factor ytx and in the absence of any official explanation we've got two theories as to why that would be first of all is why tx cuz it's really weird and different and second is that in pinion ape's name apparently sounds like yuan or something pretty close to why so it could just be his name any whatever it is i've got this open now giving us a look at what's going on inside we've got two m.2 slots one of which is populated with a 1 tb ssd i assume and the second one ooh this is cool can accommodate up to 110 mm m.2 drives so you could put an uh opan drive in here or something for example if you really wanted to we've also got an m.2 for a wi-fi module it's nice that you can swap that out even if it's only in the event of a failure and that's about it i mean it seems like the sort of thing that could have been put on the back of the board unless the back of the board is already full we're going to have to keep going before we do that though i want to fire it up let's put this heat sn back on man just everything about this thing just feels so good you know it's small but it's it's thick i like it man this thing is wild to give you a proper idea of how small it is the entire back is taken up by just our power input love that our gpu io and then our motherboard io which i would describe as not ext extravagant but certainly adequate you've got five usb 2 ports one of which is usbc dp hdmi four usb 3s 2 and half gig land nice wi-fi and audio and i haven't even talked about the front io yet we get another usbc this time usb 3 more audio two more usb 2s and two more usb 3 type a's okay ready this is really cool obviously it's not cheap thermal right for the cpu cooler custom motherboard this case has got to be worth a fortune but it is so cool few things are as universal is windows updates showing up at the worst possible time nope all right i missed it i guess i don't technically have to run c bench since you've already got scores here but let's do it anyway uh oh did we actually plug in the keyboard well that explains why we didn't manage to get into the bios okay that's definitely audible but the good news is that these lowprofile coolers can handle modern cpus as long as you're not going for a top tier core i9 or something like that it's just that they usually operate under such challenging conditions that they get overwhelmed because they're in small form factor cases that are stuffy in this case it's always drawing in this case it's always drawing completely fresh cool air from the room around it just ow be careful not to do that 12490 f what the devil is a 12490 f you know what bing yeah we're going to be oh chinese bing okay a cherry chip blah blah still suck more power than blah blah blah blah hybrid architecture blah blah gaming chip what is this thing intel hasn't publicly announced this chip but it is in their public facing database now turbos to 4.6 six cores the 1249 df has the same number of cores and threads as a 12400 but it turbos oh substantially higher it only boosts a little bit higher but its base clock is a lot higher it also has additional level three cash which is part of what makes it a gaming chip i guess it's still 12th gen alder lake so 12,000 points in cent bench is not going to be you know breaking any records but in actual games what are we looking at 360 ti that's not bad i don't know why but i kind of expected it to be something more modest like a 1650 or 1660 it's so small oh now we get to see our other fans kick in this is hilarious i don't know why this is so cool to me but just the gpu and cpu fans being case fans just tickles me i mean why not right oh we should do a duct mod i can't believe we've never done a duct mod that's where you use ducting and you just take it and run it straight to like a either 3d printed or just diy duct taped shroud over top of your gpu intake and you just run that to the front of the case do the same with the cpu that way you're bringing fresh air to everything duct mod yeah subscribe how surprising a micro usb port fielded like the cpu cooler the gpu cooler is certainly audible however if i'm gaming at 1080p i'm pretty stoked right now 250 fps i mean it's only 1080p but still wow i take back one of the things i said earlier are cpu sitting at anywhere from 75 to 80% % utilization in game now this is with obs recording in the background but that's not an entirely unrealistic use case it's possible that our cpu could thermal throttle under those conditions well we're not having any such issues in doom so that's good but i do have to say sitting here gaming next to it open air cases are one of those categories of products that i love to love but i don't think i would ever daily drive because while the drawbacks of cases are pretty clear i mean they suffocate all your heat generating components in this enclosure what the heck the benefits are also pretty clear cuz they also suppress noise another thing that's unusual about it is how hot it gets a lot of the heat from these components seem to be sinking into the giant aluminum block sitting around them i think it's time for us to tear it down and take a closer look oh shoot oh yes h it's probably fine i guess we start on the gpu side i cannot believe how tight they got the tolerances on this case i mean it looks like this gpu was made for the system another thing that i'm not sure how they did was get rid of the excess heat from the gpu are these the only ventilation holes got this here and this here that's it i guess that would explain how the case itself managed to heat up so much this does not seem to come off without the front panel also being removed oh wow different head screws that kind of makes sense does it i don't know actually wow thing is wild okay how do oh oh wow it's packed tight first things first no the gpu is not designed for this system this is just an asus rtx 360 ti snow leopard and the main reason that it was chosen is apparently for the orientation of the fin stack it goes this way which allows the heat to more effectively be pushed out the back of the cas and out this little vent here and i guess also into our power supply which is what is this a flex atx yep these are typically found in oneu rackmount machines so servers but i have seen them in small form factors before usually not this tightly packed no way it's screwed into the case through the screws that originally attached the pci back plate with the power plug here one piece p of which appears to be 3d printed um oh whoops there goes my cpu fan uh one moment please uh oh oh and this side piece came off too okay that makes sense cuz i took off the front panel things are whoa things are really happening now see the thing about small form factor is 25% of the job is engineering a case that can fit all your stuff the other 75% is figuring out how you will get all the stuff in there what is the build process for this thing you know is this the top panel or the bottom pan this is the top panel the pcie riser okay i was looking i'm trying to pull on this so that i can get this gpu out of the riser so i can get a better look at this but the riser itself is stretched so tight from the pcie slot on the motherboard over here that i cannot remove this pedal um one moment please hey hey there we go no way this power supply is modular because of course it is not a lot of points for upgradability of the system but absolutely ingenious the way everything is packed in here look at how tight this is i believe it now there is no room on the back to put your m do2s or whatever and you wouldn't even want them there because how on earth would you get at them but there's all your io 24 pin power for the motherboard 8 pin power for the cpu is way over oh yeah that's the top okay yeah there's our front usb sata other front usb third front usb front power connectors yeah there's some rgb headers none of which are used cuz you know this is like tasteful and classy right what do you need rgb for front audio connector is here which makes sense because the audio chip on this board would probably be right near the back panel and it would be right here let's see if we can get it a little more disassembled for you guys all right oh there we go it's all coming apart apparently he's only made about a 100 of these things things so it's not quite oneoff but it's certainly not mass production the amount of work that went into it to make so few units is just you got to admire it you know oh yeah this looks extremely challenging to mass produce even just the fact that you have to be locked into one only one model of gpu really tough because gpu manufacturers just on a whim they just continue this stuff they bring out a new one that's like .1 mm bigger because that saved them whatever won't fit anymore now i know how much deeper we need to go here we've got all the pieces of the case apart we can see our 80 plus platinum enhanced power supply but i'm sure you guys want a better look at this board wait a second the board isn't screwed in there's it just screwed in screwed to what nothing how is it in here oh shut up it's just slotted in or is there like one screw two screws in the riser oh i see well how on earth am i supposed to take that out oh i see i see i see i see i got this yeah i mean if upside down's good enough for the computer it's good enough for me shut up it just slots in here it's not screwed in at all oh the lock for the 8 pin power connector had to go that's been melted off there it is ytx the power supply isn't screwed in either no way okay i have to ask how much does this nightmare of an up gradability system cost the case msrp is about 350 us 350 us for the case you know what that's high but lower than i thought given the just i mean this thing is beautiful this looks like it's machined out of a single block of aluminum here wasteful but very beautiful given the shape of small form factor machines anyway how they're typically longer in order to accommodate gpus why not just extend the motherboard this way instead of doing what some manufacturers have been doing these days and you know piling up these wild towers of m do2s and audio chipsets and stuff like that it kind of makes sense i'm no longer asking ytx i'm asking why
