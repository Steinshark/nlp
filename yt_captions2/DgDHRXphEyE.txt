ladies and gentlemen it is with great pleasure that i welcome you back to this new series on the gotham chess youtube channel the road to grandmaster and this is episode number two in episode number one i announced the return of my desire for competitive play citing all of my recent inspiration citing my goals citing my shortcomings uh and what will be different this time around and i recorded that in a hotel room in kern in germany uh this episode uh will feature a lot of game review including a game that i played yesterday against grandmaster hikaro nakamura where i obtained a fantastic position but then you will see what happened as well as several other games i'm going to take you through the failures i'm going to take you through the successes what i learned uh and i also just want to shout all of you out because episode one was received better than any candidates recap the video perform med second out of the recent like 20 or 30 videos that i posted with the exception of the final candidates recap and one other incredible stat it had 6,000 comments that video had 6,000 comments that's like a top 10 video on this channel i am overwhelmed with the support coming from you all and the haters the haters who are saying i will go back into retirement and crawl back into a hole uh some don't even want me to crawl back out of it uh and i really i i appreciate appreciate all of you very very much and i hope that this uh spurs you on to reach a certain goal of yours uh we're all in this together i'm going to show you so much stuff uh in this series that i can because future opponents will be watching some of these videos and i can't expose all of my opening secrets let me know uh if you're interested in something like a behind the scenes like a patreon or one of these things where you know you can kind of go behind the scenes with me check out some of my training um i don't know if that's interesting to you or i can just make youtube videos and kind of break things down so let's get into episode number two um obviously i'm working on my openings i'm doing puzzles every single day uh i mostly use uh chess.com and chess tempo chess tempo is like a higher level tactical website relatively bare bones relatively boring for like the average just chess player but for master level players like if you look at the leaderboard it's all grand masters and title players um and i'm obviously you know studying openings uh which i can't really get into too much but uh i'm currently working on that now yesterday i played in title tuesday and title tuesday of course being the the tournament every single week where you get a chance to play against really strong players and so in the second round something funny happened i was paired against hikaru this is the morning title tuesday now morning title tuesday i was feeling really bad i was very jet lagged and also my allergies were ridiculous i have a really bad birch allergy and pollen in new york right now with birch is really so i i was playing like i felt like my head was going to explode um now the funny thing is i spent 23 seconds on move one against taro it's not because i was scared it's cuz i didn't know the game started so i wasn't on this screen i was on this screen and normally the game starts and i hear it i didn't hear it so i toggle back i see my opponent as hearo and now i have to make a mo i'm down 23 seconds against the fastest player in the world um now just a quick summary i've played hikaro multiple times this was september 2023 this was january 2024 now the good thing is when you're preparing to get the grandmaster title you're opponent is not going to be the third best player in the world like the worst grandmaster in the world is nowhere near hikaru's ability right but it's still an interesting thing to play hikaru and kind of challenge my nervous system so in september he was white and he played you know a very kind of like suffocating system where i tried to activate my pieces he blocked out my pieces and within about 15 16 moves you know i was doing okay on the clock but i got myself into a really bad position and then i just lost i mean it was like a 20 move game he played very very positionally and he just dominated me i went down without much of a fight we met january of this year this one was a french defense again he always kind of talks about like my dynamic style and he tries to you know play a bit more positionally against me and this game was very complicated you know we both kind of started attacking each other i was trying to neutralize him and um you know i was doing a pretty good job on the clock it was a very back and forth game and somewhere around here i missed a key defensive move uh right i think it was here where i could have tried to like take on e5 and then and then and then get out of my you know bad position and then right here maybe i could have taken on c4 i missed a couple of opportunities but ultimately you know hikaro came in and uh i had one more defensive move i could have played somewhere here which was trading on e5 and playing uh knight f5 which is this and this i missed it and he went on to win the game now this time around i played e4 and he played a6 and i was like okay he's you know he's doing that thing he does against a lot of players where he plays like a6 e6 d5 and so what i did in this position he actually made a recap about this game i was very surprised he was a bit critical of this move that i played um and on the one hand it's like you want to listen to the guy who's much better than you on the other hand i was like but i think i did the right thing i took on d5 here and the reason i took on d5 is because if i do this we're going to get into a big you know kind of complicated game of the french defense where he's going to do all of this stuff but if i play takes now we're playing an exchange french and black played a6 which is a complete waste of a move um i don't have a huge advantage but like you know uh it's like a french defense except for some reason here black doesn't play this or this this or this he plays a6 which doesn't make any sense also i was shocked taro was so critical about this move he played the exchange french twice in the candidates so he was like you know and then here karo plays queen d5 which is which is crazy that's a that's a wild move he didn't want to have a position of symmetry because again i would play boring chess and play for a draw he goes here which is a really provocative move because it just allows me to take more central space kick his queen out and now knight c3 uh b6 and so here i have multiple setups i can put my bishop out to d3 i can also play g3 bishop g2 and i went for g3 bishop g2 i thought was normal and now we have this position right and so at this point again i'm obviously very nervous i'm also down a minute which was not supposed to happen but i didn't know the game started uh and um now i know i'm a little bit better considering hikaru played a6 queen d5 queen d8 unfortunately the nerves are still very strong right and so i'm looking at moves like d5 i in positions like this when you have uh these two bishops on light square diagonals in another uh opening known as the queen's indian defense with b6 frequently you have bishops like this there's always a moment that the move d5 is possible so for example in the main line d5 is a possible idea in the queen's indian and then what you do is you go knight h4 so you pin the pawn to the bishop and you try to put your knight on f5 now i'm not dumb so i know that in this position i could play the move d5 but unfortunately when i at least play against hikaru uh and this is not just hikaru but in hikaru in particular and like probably when i play magnus again uh you just you get scared playing moves like this at least i do because i'm just like oh i'm going to mess something up and blah blah blah but no it's a common idea i could have played it here but what i did was also fine i mean i i just played a bit solidly and slowly which was just developing my bishop um and in hikaru's recap he kind of said you know i didn't play in a critical way here um another idea here is also knight e5 and then trading the bishop and then trying to put my queen on f3 and hikaru's point was kind of like when you start making content when you start coaching a lot in chess what happens is you you you end up thinking very simplistically you kind of try to keep things a bit easy and by default your brain doesn't want to over complicate things he has a bit of a point that is a very common phenomenon but in my case it mostly has to do with who my opponent is and that's not a good thing i'm just saying like i would prefer to like not get in a fight like let's not be confrontational but that only takes me so far now look at hikaru's moves he's playing every move he's not even losing any time so i every move i'm spending a lot of time because i'm i'm nervous i mean like i'm thinking do i move my rook there and then there do i move there and d5 like i'm i'm overthinking i spent 20 seconds moving the rook here right and now you know play rook e one and like now now i got to do something he played all these moves he's barely lost any time and i know something about hikaru and blitz when hikaru is under a little pressure or has an unpleasant position but it's not exactly clear how to break through he's going to play really fast he's so good at playing really fast and very good practical moves that force you to like do something like i play bishop h3 after another 13 seconds because i'm thinking well you know i'm i'm i'm going to put pressure maybe put my knight like knight e5 is a possibility but i don't want to trade bishop so i'm going to move my bishop to h3 this was my idea right i play bishop h3 hear plays queen b8 you know just getting off the diagonal again it balls back in my court now i muster up the courage to play knight e5 i've done everything i want now karo plays c5 and i i i was like wait a minute but c5 of course if i take he's going to activate his bishop but i have d5 and d5 will activate my bishop when it opens my pawn is going to start walking close er my bishop over here is going to open up and i thought i i i feel like i'm better and i played knight d5 but look at the time look at the time and here hikaru spent 54 seconds i think i am the first person in chess history to make hikaru think for 50 seconds in a blitz game all right so i'm just going to i'm just going to happily accept that reality okay but that should have sent something to my brain that i have a very good position i didn't know what my next move was like i thought if hikaru plays bishop f6 in this position i will play f4 i thought if hearu plays bishop d6 in this position i can't play f4 because he's going to pin my knight to my queen right as it so happens white's position is so good that you can lose the knight and just march these two pawns into the position right so i went queen h5 and the reason i played queen h5 is because if hikaru plays g6 i win i win because of a very common trick knight g4 knight h6 made so he can take my queen knight h6 is checkmate so i went queen h5 and i thought if hikaro plays g4 i'm going to play g6 i'm going to play knight g4 he thought for a little while and he played queen c7 now i need to do something and if you if you don't know that the position is plus 2.7 right if you don't know this maybe in a game where you have a lot of time you're going to figure it out even a minute 30 seconds on the clock i'm like can i sack knight g4 doesn't do anything right there's no mate so what do i do like i you know bishop f5 he just goes here but then there's maybe night so maybe bishop f5 was okay but actually if you think about it bishop f5 doesn't even there's no mate right so here i froze and so i was like i can't come forward because he's going to take me i actually can come forward so let me play this move because then i'm going to get rid of his bishop and then i'm going to try to push my pawn and hikaru did say in the coverage of this game it was a reasonable move the problem is then he guards this and i got to make a move i got 20 seconds and in the 20 seconds you know i i put my kn back and he marches in and now it's better for black it's better for black he dominates now he takes over the queen side he puts the pawn all the way to c3 and i'm i'm just stuck like i i i can't even play things like rook c1 because he will give me a check my king is in the open and i'm going to lose my bishop so i go here i have three seconds like hikaru could lose all his pieces and i would lose on time he he trades he takes he's up a pawn but you know just this and the game is over because he's going to push he's going to trade and all of my attack is extinguished and here he just took and i mean i had like 1 second so i didn't even have time to take back and i lost uh i lost because he's an incredible defender but there was also a moment where i had to realize what i had and i told you a move ago against g6 i had knight g4 well as it turns out knight g4 creates a l when i say unstoppable danger for black it is unstoppable the idea of knight to g4 is not knight h6 check but the idea is to sack the bishop and i didn't get that i was like what why would i do that like where's the mate right where's the mate i mean i don't like okay i guess there's knight f6 right but against king h8 against king h8 the mate is queen f6 knight h6 so it's here and then here and that's the mate so the idea is to still bring the knight back to the king side and it looks like black is defended but he's not queen h6 knight f6 there's just no way to defense so the best thing after knight g4 is for black to probably play something like f6 and now the computer is like well actually sorry it's the trade rooks trade rooks and then f6 because now there's no rook hanging and now the computer's like rookie six which i would never in a million years play because it just loses a rook then it's like knight f6 and then rook e like it's really hard to play some of these moves because if you don't do it right queen f7 so white still has to attack it's not over like you can get to this position and still lose but knight g4 would have been the way forward and yeah i mean i can sit here and say i was plus three but if you're plus three and you don't know it's not particularly plus three um so that was my game against taru um you know one thing that like i i i yes i would love to sit here and say i'm getting over my nerves and i'm and and i'm going to beat hikaru but again hikaru is like the final boss top three in the world i don't need to beat hikaru to become a grandmaster i was pretty happy with my play despite being very shaky and very slow and it could have been the jet lag it could have been like i was exceptionally slow i was actually slow in many games in the first tuesday here's a position i had against the 2900 and look at the time i have 15 seconds versus 124 i was slow every game every game and i was winning by the way i was plus three in this game this is the morning title tuesday completely winning position up upon dominating my opponent and then i like then i you know i got to 10 seconds and he went knight at4 and and and and then he like swarmed my pawn and i panicked so i went here which doesn't do anything and then i lost my pawn and i'm still winning but then i completely panic and now i'm just worse and then i went on to lose because i had two i me you can't two seconds versus a minute like what am i doing right too slow title tuesday's time control with this 1 second bonus time it it it messes up psychologically something where you're like well i i'll never lose on time so i can take my time no because then you're just going to lose the game anyway so i was very slow i was slow against taro i was slow against 2900 i was slow against 2570 this coast rican fm you know like look at it's it it's 8 seconds versus 153 and i'm winning i have a better end game and guess what happens in this game because i have no time i lose i lose the game cuz 3 seconds versus 127 is not the way you're supposed to play chess so brain was very slow in the morning uh in the morning title tuesday and i'm you know i'm i'm going to try to force myself to be faster be better speaking of which in the evening title tuesday there are two title tuesday tournaments i played against sanan shugu now you may remember and i will go to his profile because on his profile i can see our head-to-head record i had a game against him the most recent game that we played this was in my gm announcement video so you get to see this was literally like a week ago i played this guy april 16th it's this was 2 weeks later in this complicated queen's gambit where i played very well i blundered in exchange but my time i i handled my time pretty well throughout this game like we both were low on time and i actually made a big comeback and i actually from a losing position neutralized and then he kind of simplified and yeah he he tricked me in a scramble where we both have like less than 10 seconds it's going to happen in a critical decision-making moment between myself and a 2700 rated player in this case 3,000 blitz on average he's going to make you know better decisions than me for now i just need to improve that like one in every four one in every five i got to start taking one back slowly and then you know i'm maybe i'll never be a 3,000 rated blitz player but i'm going to try so this game we got paired again this time he went e4 and um this was interesting right this was this was a rematch after two weeks now this time i played a french and i played this line in the french that i really enjoy which is takes takes knight f6 and this kind of pawn structure where i get the attack on the g file i can put a knight on c6 this type of stuff and i was i was feeling pretty good in the evening title tuesday i'll share some games with you he played this setup and i and i realized right away wait a minute he's doing some silly stuff like he just accidentally developed in a way where he has to move his rook so he can't castle that way now then he went bishop g2 now the best move here for me is queen c4 just sort of hanging around the position i went queen a5 check i thought this move was also reasonable even though i'm helping him i go here and now i'm kind of attacking a couple of things then he went d5 and and here i overthought the position and this is um you know this is some this is one of these things like mentally here i calculated bishop c5 take take here here here here with the idea of bishop a6 and i rejected this because it's bad which is good it's good that i rejected that so then i thought knight d4 is a little silly cuz i'm going to like you know i'm going to get my queen in his territory and then he's is going to attack me computer likes it so i misevaluated that then i was like 97 is slow which is accurate so i went knight b4 unfortunately after thinking for 45 seconds i made the wrong decision it's a skill issue and then he goes here and suddenly i have invited him to storm me over here at this point i'm like okay stupid guy speed up he's not stupid guy i'm stupid guy speed up he's going to speed up just play faster it's blitz all right you got to learn from the morning title tuesday so he goes bishop e3 now i play c5 i'm thinking my position's bad i'm down a minute i got to fight all right i can't just roll over and die queen a4 i find a nice idea here bishop back to d7 queen d6 unpinning my queen trying to bring my knight into the game right and and i was a little bit worried about all of this but i'm like his king is still in the center so now we go and this is a nice idea by him bishop e4 so i play knight e8 i'm trying to play f5 try to play f5 he plays g4 we repeat moves once i'm trying to play h5 i get to play h5 now i'm going to open up the h file and i'm looking for this another thing i'm looking for is to bring my queen back and to put my knight on the d6 square exert pressure over here i'm down a lot on time though i have not done a good job on the clock like he he has kept this time advantage i play a6 i'm trying to attack him over here he plays a4 he's completely squishing me i'm down to 17 seconds but i'm still fighting rook h1 takes takes we trade and i play knight8 i'm much worse but i have 11 seconds on the clock i'm ultra focused i'm going to go here i'm going to go here right and here he does something very goofy he trades his bishop like this and i think i shock him here with this move king takes not rook takes now my rook is coming he's he's probably feeling a little bit of nerves here and he thinks for 20 seconds and makes a huge mistake he straight up hangs this pawn not only does he hang that pawn he hangs this pawn as well he probably thought queen c4 queen c4 knight b6 fork but queen c4 is a check so he's down two pawns but i have six seconds my time management caught up with me again so i have 6 seconds now at this point i realize he's going to play kn c3 that's what he's going to play because his bishop is hanging but i you know he's not going to retreat cu if he retreats i'm just going to play rook a8 i'm going to play rook a1 i'm going to win so i i'm like mentally i'm preparing for the move knight c3 and i have six seconds so i'm going to decide when knight c3 happens do i move my queen here or here right looking for this looking for this with pressure with pressure down there do i just move out of the way or or wait a minute do i take his bishop because i'm attacking his queen oh my god wait a minute takes he gets this i get that he gets that count the pawns one two three four five he has one two three i'm going to be up two pawns in an end game that seems pretty damn good and i have a history of not taking the simple way i have a history of i over complicate things like i'm going to put the queen here and he's going to give me a check and i'm going to get mated somehow so i make a split-second decision to trade it all now i don't know i don't know the evaluation i you do it's equal now as it turns out i'm dominated here i'm up two pawns but i can't really move them and i thought i'm just going to go rook a8 that's my plan and then rook here but he plays rook h7 and suddenly i'm like uhoh that's really tough to defend if i play king e8 he forks me so i got to go here but now here comes this pawn this is very scary i can't go here and i can't go here here cuz he forks me so i got to go king d7 but now he wins my pawn now i'm only up one pawn i go king c6 he plays knight c7 if i move my rook over there i lose my bishop rook b8 is the move that i have to play here rook to b8 but i have two seconds and i play rook c8 and that loses the game to pawn to d7 i cannot take this at all and the worst part is because he queens or he takes my rook and takes my rook the worst part is if i move my rook to b8 just plays here and he queens and just like that out of nowhere he wins the game again again and it's a mix of poor time management it's a mix of just freezing up early in the game overthinking just staring nervously at the position and later it just came down to a split second decision i mean it just came down to like i saw these moves and then i saw that and it's like do i keep the pie is on do i keep it complicated do i i go to an end game and as it so happens this is losing this is not winning for me it's not losing but it's unpleasant for me and um and i lose and what i should have done is i should have played queen a5 or queen b4 with the threat of this with the threat of rook a8 and i would have you know maybe won maybe i would have found a way to lose this queen f5 i would have maybe gone like to e8 but i have a lot of threats and you know much better performance than last time but same result now there were some good results there were some good results i played very well yesterday against people who were a bit weaker than me like 25 and 2600 i had multiple games at 95 96% accuracy just got to start doing a slightly better job against these really like strong guys like 29 and i and i know i you know i can fight with them and every game game starts the same every game against them i go i'm going to give my best they're not that much better than me and then i like freeze up sometimes and and and you know and even when i get myself into a bad position hikaro gets himself into bad positions he got himself into a bad position against me suddenly i'm fighting back like things like h5 right like i'm i'm creating practical chances for myself and that's important you know like maybe i i can do it in a slightly faster way but i i just i gotta i got to be more on top of it now i had a nice game to end the day against the 2400 rated grandmaster um although this gentleman is not you know i think he's 54 which in chess is like i mean v is like in his 50s but uh this was my last round of the evening title tuesday and this was a nice game uh this was a scandinavian defense and recently i've been winning like 70 to 75% of my games in the scandinavian i might be brave and play a scandinavian in an over theboard game uh unfortunately nowadays everybody knows all the theory everybody's trying to get an advantage in every opening uh i just realized the clocks are cut off for some reason i don't know what how long that's been going on but that's weird that shouldn't be like that um but yeah the clocks are cut off a lot of the stuff is cut off that's annoying whoa the ch.com logo is cut off what happened to this overlay yeah let's let's let's slide you over here weird okay we fixed it sort of and and um yeah in this game my opponent got very aggressive with the move knight to e5 uh and then g4 and what's funny is i played bishop e4 which is a mistake uh you're actually supposed to go here to prevent bishop c4 the main line here goes bishop c4 and then g4 and then h4 and then this is a very complicated system he went here and i thought well i can attack his rook as it turns out knight c4 is a very good idea by the computer and if i play like queen c7 after takes stakes the computer really likes queen f3 and it really likes white's position uh neither one of us knew that learning experience i was supposed to go back to e6 instead we got this position and i had some good pressure on his pawns i just thought you know he would play like c3 i can't take this it's called a poison pawn because of rook b1 you got to be very careful about your b file in these positions so the b2 pawn is the poison pawn because of various forms of counterplay but then he overextended and a lot of you ask me questions like how do you know the difference between you know space advantage and overextension and um yeah not an easy decision to say but a move like g5 like just pushing a pawn into your opponent's territory with no clear follow up computer already likes queen d4 but i thought even just like knight d7 trading his knight off and playing e6 like you got to think when you talk about overextension you got to think do i have a lot of weaknesses by behind my pawns once i push them too far like are these squares weak and do my pawns have more forward mobility and on top of that is there a goal like what if i don't castle this way what if i castle that way then these pawns are just sort of standing around right if you brought white's pawns back to those squares white's got a completely fine position here but because white has so many holes and these pawns are so close to me it's bad and as you can see i i do have an advantage he goes queen d2 trying to castle queen side uh here you can try to solve this yourself if you know your opponent wants to castle queen side what's a good way to stop that right now i'll take a sip of water if you want to this is the move that i played right bishop c5 and the point is this if he castles i x-ray him right puts this king here i put the bishop here but it's actually worse than that because i'm putting there anyway so now i'm going to win this pawn which is overextended now i'm a pawn up and he's definitely not castling in either direction by the way look at the difference in this game i am up a minute in this game i'm down a minute against hikaru i'm down like a minute and a half in like the end right and in some of these other games i mean i'm down more than a minute in some of these positions like this was by far the craziest i was down a minute and a half straight up so i don't know if it's the rating i don't know what it is probably is it's like a bit of you know the the the rating the the the uh the opponent and knowing how good they are in this game i was just sharp i took two pawns i gave a check to make the king move now white can't castle i gave another check to get the king to move again and i just gave another check trade some pieces develop i'm up two pawns white's king is stuck in the center easy way to play here stop your opponent's threats obviously don't blunder a checkmate it trade queens if possible and then just continue to apply pressure so i gave a check i u sorry i moved my queen i gave a check and i just made sure white cannot attack me with his pawns he couldn't play that move anyway because of knight e5 but to put up a bunch of pawns on light squares to counteract this bishop is completely fine queen goes back to e7 pawn goes up so he can't ever apply more pressure and now i just put my rook on the file i played king f8 it's not really necessary but i wanted to walk my king to g7 rather than castle just get off a light square but here black can do a lot of different things and put my kn on c4 i think somewhere here he ran out of time but i thought this was a very simple and straightforward game where i applied pressure for a while now i was going to win this pawn and here he lost and actually you know this game uh i think i already game reviewed it once i played you know over you know 90% and i thought it was very clean uh i got doc some points for playing this mistake in the opening but um i played a nice game and and i had an advantage for a while and it was a good game and i i ended the evening title tuesday by gaining 20 rating points so i had some good wins i lost to some 2900 rated grand masters uh i also drew demchenko who's 2900 gm and i drew uh shout out to the brazilians cror also 2900 gm i had a winning position against cror not here uh in the beginning of the game by the way look at this i had a winning position against cror uh and we both had comp you know low time and then he had a winning position against me so i blundered like an idiot and uh he was completely winning against me and then we ended up making a draw sometimes that happens so i played hikaru and i was plus three and a half for one move can't really say that like you know i should have won the game or anything like that but i should have handled my time a bit better and i'm i'm going to continue to work on it i i got to force myself to play faster force myself to be a little bit less hesitant it's a long journey i'm doing my best uh and you know i played one game after title tuesday ended against like a random 2600 and i like won a minute up on the clock it was like not even and i crossed back over 2700 so my goal is to get back to 2800 which is generally my my blitz level uh and uh puzzles will continue openings will continue and uh yeah listen again the support is crazy 6,000 comments on a video is unbelievable considering i average something like a thousand so appreciate you all very very much uh pursue your goals as well get some sleep uh eat good food and uh maybe i will be posting some other stuff like if i take some lessons with grandmasters and they train me or something like that uh maybe i'll will record some of that if you'll enjoy that just let me know what you would enjoy in the comments if you want more behind the scenes you want me to do you know put something behind uh like on a patreon where i show some of my analysis a little bit deeper or some openings or whatever i don't know i can vlog going to places and but i'm very excited to be back and win lose or draw uh i'm going to i'm going to work on myself work on handling losses better and we're going to just try to keep improving a little bit every single day i'm almost 30 all right getting better at chess at 30 is like to the grandmaster level is a tall task so we're all in this together i'll see you all for episode number three get out of here
