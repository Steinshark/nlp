and action there you go hi everyone thanks for joining me today thanks for 
having us i think a good place to start would be   just if you could tell us a little 
bit about yourselves your name   maybe your previous uh career uh the program 
that you initially maybe went to school for   or what you were in your your past life prior 
coding dojo lauren do you want to start sure so   previously before starting the dojo i was a 
receptionist at a orthopedic surgeon office   i actually went to school for japanese and chinese 
so i have a major in chinese with my i'm sorry i   major in japanese with a minor in chinese and i 
was going to maybe go into translation but never   really got into that field so i was doing 
receptioning before the dojo i took their   part-time accelerated online and i graduated last 
november that's a big career switch which i will   get into more later but that's really cool how you 
went from you know healthcare in one aspect and   and languages to i guess language is in another 
way just coding languages erin what about yourself   my name is aaron hill i did eight years of iit 
for inside the military for on civilian side   that's pretty much the only type of job i've 
had and i did the three full stack program at   coding dojo i graduated uh last 
march in 2021 oh wow that's awesome   so pretty pretty recent ago really yes ma'am and 
remember what about yourself my name is fermar   leach i was actually an account coordinator for 
uber freight and i took coding dojo during kovit   and i graduated in december 2020 and i was 
essentially in the supply chain logistics   industry before moving it today so really everyone 
had a pretty big career switch i would say so why did you decide to join a coding bootcamp 
i mean there are so many different ways to   learn how to code what was the reason behind 
deciding to go to coding bootcamp instead of say   self-teaching fully or going back to you know 
college for four more years what was what was   the reason behind going to a coding boot camp 
um for me it was mainly i didn't necessarily   have the money or want to go back for another 
four-year degree since i already have one it   seemed kind of like a waste of time in my opinion 
just spent another four years getting another   bachelor's degree when i already have 
one and self-learning just it wasn't i   it was too hard to do it on my own i needed 
some sort of structure and some sort of guidance   so i looked into boot camps uh for this for 
their structure and for the support that i needed   because i had tried learning by myself but ran 
into a lot of issues of i had questions and didn't   know where to turn to ask i didn't know what to 
google i didn't know how to use the internet to   help me so um for me it was a lot of just i needed 
the support i totally agree you you pretty much   echoed my my reasoning as well when i went to 
coding boot camp it was that in between you know   like self learning just seemed i didn't know how 
to google properly like you're as you say use the   internet i really like that phrase too um but so 
self teaching i tried and it was going nowhere but   then going back to school for another four years 
just seems crazy to me what about yourself aaron   actually right on par with lauren 
it's wanting that structured learning   i have adhd really bad so i'll end up getting 
into a rabbit hole that was a complete waste so   going to a boot camp it gave me more of a 
structured learning for the fundamentals   which helps me in the long run it does and going 
down a rabbit hole especially with coding i find   is so easy to do because you can spend there's 
so especially when you're entering the industry   there's so much to learn and it's just like how 
am i ever going to learn all this then you just   go one direction then the other direction it's 
just yeah i can relate to that you don't know what   you don't know exactly yes what about yourself 
remar pretty much the same three times piggyback   on that for the structure this is actually my 
second boot camp that i did the first one that   i did i couldn't finish because i was working 
full time as well so the time i didn't have it   and what made it so good for coding dojo is that 
i had the time because of kovit so it was the best   time for me to do it and of course i didn't want 
to go back to school i already have a bachelor's   and i also find the college courses 
a little bit less structured but also   how do i put it more convoluted than anything 
like the bootcamp broke everything down in a   much more succinct way than college does so yeah 
that was pretty much it for me yeah yeah even to   kind of hit on what you're saying remark 
i when i went to my coding bootcamp   i had i literally had some people who at the 
time were going to school for computer science   and i took this it was during the summer 
so they weren't in class at that time   can't go to the boot camp because they said the 
exact same thing they were in the midst of their   degree but they're like we want real world 
experience like hands-on projects so i thought   that's pretty interesting too what was your 
decision-making process like for someone who   is maybe considering going to a coding bootcamp 
there may be uncertain is it worth the you know   the price tag are they actually going to find a 
job what was maybe the decision-making process the   the pros and cons i know we kind of touched 
on this in the last question but was there any   kind of is there any advice or insight you would 
give to others who are kind of on the fence of   if they should go to a coding boot camp or not 
um i mean for me it was just i really needed a   career change i was not happy at the position 
i was at it was very toxic work environment   and i just was not thriving in it so i knew i 
needed to change and i took an aptitude test   that had brought up coding which i had tried in 
the past and was like all right i liked it i just   didn't have the resources to be successful at it 
so i figured if i could have the resources to be   successful at it was something that i had kind of 
liked doing and it was fun to kind of dabble in   um so i decided just to kind of take that leap of 
faith and just go for it but you know like there's   so many growing jobs in tech right now it's never 
gonna go out of out of style so to say you know   there's always going to be drops in text so i 
knew there'd be job security for me um it's not   like like translating where eventually computers 
will probably take over that at some point and   you won't have the need for human translators 
anymore so there's more job security for me um   there's i didn't even realize the amount of tech 
jobs that there are out there not just just purely   developers but you know i'm actually not even a 
developer anymore i'm a technical program manager   um but you know i didn't realize all these 
different options that would open up to me   from taking the boot camp i thought my only option 
from taking boot camp was going to be a developer   and that was kind of it but it opened up so many 
other doors which included the technical program   managing which i'm doing now um and i'm actually 
liking it a lot more than i did when i did just   purely developing so i'm pretty happy with the 
way things turned out but for me it was it was   it was a big risk because i was like what if 
i don't see a return on my investment you know   what if i take this boot camp and i come out 
i hurt tons i didn't like it i didn't finish   it i don't find a job i'm at a lot of money but 
you know i just looked back on i did it in the   past it was something that i had really enjoyed i 
just didn't have the structure or the time to help   or not the time but i didn't have the resources to 
kind of help me pursue what i wanted to do with it   so i decided if i got those resources i kind of 
got all my ducks in line then maybe i could be   successful at it and i just decided there's a lot 
of tech jobs out there yes finding the first one   was probably going to be a little bit difficult 
but it's not impossible other people have done it   i kind of just went based off of the reviews as 
well and seeing that other people have done it   um so if other people can do it 
i'm like well why can't i do it   i love that and i love that you hit two on you 
know going to a coding bootcamp and learning   code as a skill it doesn't always have to 
translate directly into a developer i think code   is so valuable in so many different roles even 
if you're not maybe using it for eight hours a   day but just understanding it and having worked 
with code and having that skill it just opens up   like you said endless possibilities i really think 
that's really cool how you pro technical program   manager right lauren yes that's really cool uh 
is a side note what what does that entail like   what does uh for those of you who are maybe not 
as familiar with it so i do a lot of things that   a normal program manager would do it's like 
organizing um but the technical part comes in   i deal a lot with documentation and i'm the one 
that writes the docs for the spat or the specs   for the apis that we're creating for any 
document for any of the programs that we're   we're creating any apis any backend infrastructure 
i write documentation on how that works and how   how you can access it i kind of try and bridge the 
gap between tech and the real world so i try and   write can i write both api technical documentation 
but also like conceptual documentation   uh to help bridge the gap between technical 
and real life so that if someone who's   maybe has a little background in technology but 
not enough to really know how the apis work and   at least come to our website see like okay they 
have an api that does i know i kind of know what   an api does or that i need an api to do this this 
api clearly writes out exactly what it does this   is exactly what i want we're going to go with 
this company for our for our project but that's   basically what i do and i do a lot of github 
managing issues managing issues for the team   making tickets for team members uh that's the 
other part of kind of more the program management   side of things that i do but the technical side 
is a lot of writing the documentation and kind   of being that final that final step before we push 
to development is i look over everything and make   sure that it all looks correct nice that's 
really cool that's a very interesting role   yeah i know i'm really liking it awesome well 
congrats erin what about yourself what was   there the was there any uh advice or insight for 
people who maybe are on the fence for coding boot   camps i ended up getting my choice it was during 
during covet also and the one the representatives   from coding dojo ended up giving me a call and 
i just kind of like flung with it from there so   they told me it was three different stacks that 
i would get experience in and uh everything   else that we spoke about it was all sounded 
wonderful so ended up taking a deep dive in and so i would probably say it was because i was in 
between jobs and i've always had some type of want   to learn on programming that i kind of jumped the 
gun on that one and i i don't look back one bit   uh i love it that's really awesome i love 
that and i'm so happy to hear you don't   like that you just you love it you don't look back 
and and uh because you said it was it was last   last march sorry erin right november of 2020 
is whenever i started and then march of 2021 is   whenever i graduated out nice um i have actually 
joined a few discord groups uh with like different   programmers and stuff and a few of them they've 
actually said that they do highly enjoy that   boot camp graduates that they 
do enjoy those a lot more over college just because it's a lot of information 
you you can show that you can learn a lot in the   short amount of time yeah yeah i've heard that too 
from so from a lot of people as well like because   on top of learning the technical skills and and 
and the other skills you're learning at a bootcamp   you're also learning how to learn really quickly 
so you can adapt to different situations and pick   up languages quickly or technologies quickly 
so that's that's interesting you've heard   it too i yeah i remember hearing that before 
that's cool remar what about yourself yeah so   for my decision i mean it was it was kind of 
straightforward for me like like i said earlier   i was out of a job because of kovit and i had 
already taken a boot camp before and i always had   an affinity towards tech and so during that time 
frame i'm just thinking i need something to do and   i was on facebook and coding dojo popped 
up so i took interest and i saw that   they had the three full stacks and i had 
never done full stack development before   so it was a new thing for me but i'm always 
curious about learning and so i made the call and   i received a call from the recruiter and i started 
and it was it was a pretty easy decision for me to   make because i always wanted to upgrade my skills 
and i would say it's my advice for others who are   trying to decide on whether to go to a boot camp 
or to go through college just i would say the   number one thing is probably know your budget 
because i would say that boot camps yes they   are expensive and there are a number of them out 
there so in doing your research you got to know   what kind of budget you're working with because 
that will help in the decision process as well   but if you're in school and that's something that 
you want to do i would say go for that and that   way you won't have to deviate per se and do or 
go or overextend yourself so i'm trying to say um   so if you're already in school for computer 
science continue that finish your degree out   and if you want any additional you can do a boot 
camp but again it goes back to knowing your budget   um because like i said boot camps are they can 
be expensive and that would be a huge determining   factor for a normal number of people especially 
with the way inflation is so oh yeah i totally   agree and it's one of those things that i 
think we all mentioned you know it's it's   taking that risk that un it's the unknown you 
know you're putting out a lot of money for   what feels like the unknown you don't know are 
you i think as lauren who mentioned you know   am i going to finish it am i going to get a job 
afterwards like it's a big risk it's there's a lot   of decision to it so i like that that point too 
just know your budget so i think it was aaron who   touched on this a little bit but coding dojo 
is known for their three stack methodology   methodology what was it like learning three 
languages essentially at once like was it a   positive experience was it stressful what was 
it like maybe we'll start with aaron this time   how did i know it was going to be me um it 
was a blessing and a curse at the same time um   like remar said earlier he he actually 
did a boot camp before i ended up going   to a boot camp afterwards um and learning 
the three stacks i think is amazing because   after i went to coding dojo i did kind of start 
looking into like more boot camps just see what   they offered uh and i saw quite a few of 
them it was just one language at a time and but i like the three stack   especially in the beginning because 
uh with python mern and java you get shown the three like three types 
of web development with and   you may or may not like python in 
the beginning whenever you take it   and you might actually think you want to do react 
with front end but come to find out you do not   like it so you ended up wasting all that money 
doing front end on something that you didn't   like but you do still learn the fundamentals um 
which that was actually my case i actually thought   i would really like python but i ended up with 
c sharp on of course i didn't even take um so i mean it's one of those things that it's it is great because 
you do get the view of all the languages are of   many languages but at the same time you don't 
have a lot of experience with one language   and it just goes back to what i was saying 
earlier it's you don't know what you don't know   and how open that can be once you start 
deep diving in one language yeah yes exactly   what about for yourself lauren um for me i mean 
it was great learning all three languages it gave   me a very broad overview but i felt like it was 
kind of it was it was it was good it was bad um   the good thing is you got an exposure to a lot of 
different technology you got exposure to quite a   few different technologies the downside is you 
didn't become an expert in any one of those so   then when you went to go look for jobs it was like 
oh we're looking for a react front end engineer or   something like that it's like okay well i def 
i kind of delved into react a little bit but i   didn't really get to do a ton of react projects 
i learned i just skimmed the very top of it so   i don't know if that's enough to qualify me for 
this job per se because i didn't spend my entire   uh like six you know six months doing react i 
spent two months on react two months on this   two months on that you know it was spread out 
so like while my software development career was   at a total of like six months my total time 
in react was only like a quarter of that time   so that was kind of the the downside of it but 
you know there's pros and cons to both of them   and i've heard i've heard it go both ways you 
know it's great that you get to learn all these   new technologies at once it shows that you're 
an adaptable learner and that you can learn   quickly and adapt um so that's that's a good 
thing to show when you're looking at you know   trying to do all these all these languages at 
once and not necessarily becoming an expert in   any one of them but then the downside is when 
you go looking for a job sometimes they're like   okay well you've only done like two months 
of this this language how are you going to   how are you going to get onboarded and you know 
get up to speed with everything which you can kind   of play out you can again play on the fact that 
while i was able to learn all these technologies   in this short amount of time i'm a quick learner 
i'm a quick study you know all those great things   they might still those can still play to your 
benefit basically yeah exactly it's definitely   there's a lot of pros and a lot of cons so it's 
just kind of navigating it what about yourself   remar so i actually agree with what both aaron 
and lauren said i also see it uh an additional   benefit to learning all three full stacks the way 
that they taught them and it's kind of based off   of how they their methodology of teaching they 
don't give you everything because they want to   they're they're trying to groom you to be a seeker 
of knowledge basically so a continual learner   so and they have this term called google food 
strengthening your google food and essentially   that means you go and you seek out the answers 
that you need in order to solve the problems that   you're trying to solve and i actually like the 
methodology of learning threefold stacks because   i got to see the connections between all three of 
them the differences between all three of them and   the way they all kind of can fit together because 
you can actually use python as a back-end and use   react as a front-end or you can do c-sharp or 
java as the back-end with react as a front-end   javascript as a back-end um and you can also you 
know mix and match them all together because they   all are in some ways interchangeable or they can 
all speak to each other in some kind of way so i   actually like that aspect of it all and of course 
the downside is you don't become an expert as they   stated already you don't become a full-blown 
expert but i also think that is also the the   the draw to it as well because they don't they're 
not trying to make you an expert they're just   trying to teach you how to learn i guess and so 
in learning how to seek out the solutions to your   problems you actually learn more about coding 
itself and that that was also shown inside of   the learn platform they only gave you bits and 
pieces of how to do certain problems and then   they gave you the rest they told you hey don't go 
into the documentation so deeply right now you can   look at this later on your own time it wasn't like 
oh look at this documentation read it all in full   we're going to go through this completely and this 
is how you become no there they taught us how to   basically learn how to code essentially and 
so that can go to every other language like   like now i didn't do java during a boot camp i 
did see sharp but i actually went back in and   relearning java for my position that i'm in and 
it's all really because of the way coding dojo   taught me i was able to get gain those skills to 
learn how to do java and i was able to connect the   two together and see oh this is how it's done in 
c sharp oh this is how it's done in javascript so   yeah i i i like the three full stacks of course 
the the cons of it not being you know being an   expert in it it's not the full focus but 
i also think that that's a beautiful thing   as well because you you know you can become 
an expert over time it's a lifelong journey   yeah i really like that yeah it's learning 
how to learn so you can pick up other things   in the future as well kind of thing quicker 
from those skills the next uh question i have   for you is what was the job process like and and 
alongside this with what is your current role so   you know leaving coding dojo and maybe you're 
not in your your first role anymore but what was   what was the job process job hunt process like 
and what is your current role and uh maybe we'll   start with remarks we just just touched on that 
briefly yeah so my job hunt process it was it was it's honestly disheartening a lot of times 
because i didn't i didn't i didn't immediately   jump into the john punt right after the boot 
camp um for a tech job that is i actually   went back into supply chain and logistics and i 
was there for about eight months or so and i had   moved states i moved from chicago to indianapolis 
for the job as well it was with jb hunt and during   that time frame while i was there i started 
just thinking like i have this skill and i'm   not doing much with it and i was going back into 
refreshing my knowledge with python javascript and   c-sharp as well and i'm just like okay why am i 
not doing anything with this so then i started my   process of looking for a job within tech 
and that process itself was just sending out   numerous amounts of applications i had to get my 
resume retrofitted essentially to include all of   my skills on there because it was still showing 
like my customer service stuff from like 2009   and i had i hadn't updated it or anything 
so i worked my career advisor uh donald and   he's awesome by the way he helped me get my resume 
up to snuff and i just started sending it out and   just start applying and i i must have gotten over 
at least 150 or too close to 200 rejections and   and it really just got to the point where it was 
like this doesn't seem like this is for me because   i can't even find anything like this is ridiculous 
i'm over here looking for entry level positions   most of it was remote but they were all looking 
for like three to five years of experience like   i don't have that it's not for me what is 
going on here and so when i finally got to   the point where i started getting interviews the 
next step was passing the tech assessment and   that also slapped me back into reality as well as 
like you don't know as much as you think you know   um it started setting and then passed the syndrome 
and it was like okay this is vastly different than   what i've learned i need to get back into it 
i need to learn more and i just kept learning   kept trying to gain regain my skills up and um 
i saw a post on discord from someone who was in   my color name is deja allison and she posted 
how she had gotten a job with the home depot   and so i was like okay let me go ahead and try to 
apply because i've been applying for everything   and i haven't gotten anything a bunch of tech 
assessments i pretty much bombed those i'm just   like okay i'm not really doing very well let me 
try this and got a call within like a week or so   after i filled out the application and had 
the phone interview and then i had the virtual   interview and those went over very well and 
then the next step was the tech assessment which   again i was really scared about so i was like okay 
i can do this this is something that i can do and   i worked on the tech assessment and i didn't 
finish the second portion of it but i got a call   from the recruiter like right after that second 
interview and she asked me how it went i was like   it went okay i'm still trying to finish up this 
other algorithm to finish figure it out and she's   like oh you don't even need to do that you already 
got the job and i was just like oh my gosh what   this is only the second time in my life that i 
actually got a job right after an interview so   i was just i had tears in my house like i've been 
fighting and trying for all this time to get this   and it's finally here so i'm now a sophomore 
engineer at the home depot i've been here since   uh january of this year and it's been a an amazing 
journey because i've been learning something new   every day i'm doing devops something that they 
didn't even teach inside of coding dojo i've   been working on pipelines and it's just like all 
of this is just so surreal so yeah that that's my   story i'm sorry i don't need to take up too much 
time but every time i tell it it just brings so   much passion out of me because it was just a it 
was frustrating but again that was that euphoric   feeling whereas like i finally made it now it's 
just to continue to keep going from here so   first off me congrats that's he that's such a 
wonderful story i absolutely love it and i also   really appreciate how honest you were you know 
because it's not easy it sucks like applying   and applying getting rejected rejection after 
rejection the technical interview process in   my opinion i i i do not like it it sucks i 
i'm terrified for it it's not a fun process   and preparing for it is like a job in itself so 
remark kudos to you that's congrats that's huge   thank you erin what about yourself first 
i want to say i'm glad i'm not the only   one who fall back into their previous 
job makes me feel a little bit better   um after the boot camp i did actually 
interview with the company i used to work for i didn't keep up with career services like 
i should have and for anyone watching do   they help out tremendously the earlier you get 
with them the more they can help i wish i did   but i actually interviewed with the company i used 
to work for um before a c-sharp position and going   into that interview already knowing the people 
kind of helped me out just because it was a more   relaxed environment we were able to talk people 
to people instead of interviewer interviewee did not end up getting that job just because of my skills and the pay wasn't 
where either one of us were wanting it to be   at um and then after that i ended up falling 
back in my my old position uh doing it again   and then come january time uh i 
actually landed a position with blazer   uh working with c sharp um and that was actually 
the exact position i was looking for it's   it which was amazing in itself right there um that 
and we were able to work out paying everything   uh through the steps uh i did pretty 
much same thing remarked it fell back   didn't i didn't really continue it too much um 
until i was like you know what i want school for   four months for this i gotta continue on this and 
then so start focusing back on that and then uh   ended up laying the position i'm at since january 
so about six months now wow congrats that's really   huge for for you you started in january as 
well uh what has just as a side question what   has it been like the are you feeling settled now 
because i know it takes like quite a few months   you know to get familiar with the code base 
and feel comfortable with it like are you   do you feel like you're getting there or with that 
mostly um they actually kind of got me spread out   in like four different spots um being a tester for 
a program that they've already started building up   uh because they're actually flipping that 
over to blazer from angularjs uh which was   what like 20 years ago so i'm learning that 
helping test out and fix those bugs i'm also   working on a a blazer program that i've helped 
build up from scratch to help get call times it's   kind of like a call monitoring for our franchises 
and then uh they got me on another project where   it's pretty much doing the same thing testing and 
helping uh build up the program wow so you're busy that's awesome well congrats to you as 
well it's huge thank you lauren what   about yourself i know your current role 
but what was your journey to get there so i i'll say that my journey was was slightly 
different than remar and aaron's journey um   it still was it still had a few bumps in the road 
but i started looking for jobs pretty much when   i was in my last stack um i started getting my 
resume ready sending it out you know i was like   i'm ready for this like i want to get something 
land something as soon you know as soon as i can   out of boot camp because i i wasn't working while 
i was in boot camp i was fortunate enough to be   able to sustain myself without working but i was 
like now i really need to get back in the work   and start earning money again so i really wanted 
to find something as soon as possible so i   i started looking end of probably beginning of my 
third stack um is when i started kind of prepping   my resume and kind of just like testing the 
waters out sending it out to a couple places   just seeing okay let's see what happens type 
of thing um and i was able to i was actually   i got my first job offer and this one was just 
just i'm just i'm telling people this because   just be aware it does these like sketchy 
things happen um i got a job offer and i   had never even interviewed for this company and 
they were offering me a job and they were going   to pay me 50 an hour and i was like but i i had 
never even applied to this company i had never   interviewed with them but the job offer looked 
legit and like it didn't look fake but i was   like something doesn't seem right about it so as 
much as i was like oh i'd love to make 50 an hour   you know i was like that something doesn't feel 
right and around that time i also got another job   inquiry i wouldn't say it was an offer 
yet but it was an inquiry about um kind   of more of an internship type of job where 
it could convert into a full-time job and   it was going to pay significantly less money 
than the job that was being offered at the 50   but it seemed more legit and i actually had an 
interview and like talk to the real person so i   decided to go with that job because it seemed more 
legit and the process i felt more secure about it   versus just going in to this other company and i 
was like i'm just going off a piece of paper that   says i got a job and you never even contacted me 
for an interview not even a behavioral interview   so i was like something i don't know i was like 
we're gonna go with the job that at least talk   to me and i got to talk to them and i got to ask 
questions so i started with that job in january   and i was there for about a month and then 
due to reorganizational uh conflicts they   actually let me go so i was out of a job from 
i actually was able to turn around very quickly   um i was very thankful for that i will say that's 
probably not the norm for what happened to me but   i got very lucky that i was able to turn it 
around pretty quickly and i um started my new   job beginning of march so um i've been with 
this company signal4d since march and i actually   got hired as a developer um but the idea was i 
would be kind of a fluid developer and i would   kind of test out a lot of different areas and kind 
of find where my strengths lie because originally   when i looked at my resume they said oh she 
doesn't have enough experience and passed it over   but then they looked they were looking at my 
linkedin and they were looking at my cover   letter and and the the vice president was 
like there's something about her that i just   like so then she brought it back to the 
cto um and they talked about a little bit   more and they're like let's just let's 
just talk with her let's just see what   you know there seems like there could be more 
conversation here so they they reached out to me   uh had the behavioral interview and the the 
vice president loved me she was very happy   with me and said yeah i think i think mark 
will want to talk to you i think i think the   cto is going to want to talk to you and he did 
talk to me and we had a very great conversation   and he was kind of probing my mind you know what 
where did i want to go in tech like what did i see   myself doing did i see myself being a heads down 
developer did i see myself doing kind of he hinted   at like program managing and like customer support 
type of thing and at the time i was like i don't   really know like i don't know i just went to a 
boot camp and i'm gonna be a developer that's what   i that's what i think i'm gonna do um but i agreed 
that i would be kind of testing everything out   um and then i came into this job as a 
developer but i was doing more program   managing because that's what they needed at 
the time and then over time um i think it was april beginning of april um i actually got the 
promotion the technical program manager where they   said you know you're doing a really great job in 
this role i think this might be the role for you   like how do you feel about it um and i said 
you know i'm very i'm actually surprisingly   very happy with it i thought i was good 
i thought i wanted to be a developer   and that's the only thing i could be but the 
with the tech knowledge that i had gained that   i the developer was the only option for me um but 
it turns out there's plenty of other options out   there and this one is just as good of a position 
as a developer um if not better in some ways so   you know i would say too to people you know don't 
limit yourself to thinking the developer is the   only option for you and don't just shut out other 
opportunities because they're not developer roles   because they could actually turn out to be 
really really interesting roles like even   if it's like a customer support engineer or 
i don't know something else that's not just   titled engineer or developer i love that that's 
a that's a great story and it's such a good   thing to highlight too because 
i think a lot of times people   shut out other opportunities just because 
they're focused on one thing and you never   know where if you're open to opportunities you 
never know where your career will take you and   and what you end up really enjoying okay 
i have one last question for you all so any career i mean this is a very broad question 
but however you want to answer it so any tips for   anyone who is looking to make that career switch 
i know we talked a lot about uh your journeys in   doing so and you know the highs and the lows but 
if someone maybe is starting out and you know the   feeling before you make that career switch it's 
really you know gut-wrenching what what would   you say to here's a better way of phrasing 
it what would you say advice or what would   you say to yourselves if you could you know 
speak to your past selves and give yourself   some advice before going on this journey uh erin 
we'll start with you you said before the journey   yeah like if you could talk to past aaron 
when you were just starting what would you   what advice would you would you give him that 
it is a great feel it can be stressful but   you can go through it take it one day at a time 
rome was not built in a day that you can uh and to focus on the foundation of 
everything because if you can get the   basic building blocks of programming it will 
make the rest of the time a whole lot easier   and like i said earlier is take breaks too like 
uh like remarks said the 20-minute rule that   coding dojo has like every 20 minutes take like 
five-minute break and it will help a lot more   than it will it'll not help if that makes sense 
it totally does and it's so important it's it's   one of the things that is easiest to forget is to 
take the breaks though remar what about yourself so i've answered this question a number of times 
to even those who are inside of the coding dojo   um itself but probably when you 
phrasing is saying what would i   tell to my past self if i had to go 
through this journey again i would say just i would say self just stay eager to 
learn because that is the most important thing   that you can have when taking this journey and 
in all honesty if i could do it all over again   i would have jumped in a lot earlier i would 
have done this i would say maybe two or three   years earlier than what i am now because of just 
just the sheer amount of information that comes   out every single six almost every six months 
something something new is updated something   has been changed a new feature has been added 
so jumping in it earlier would have given me   a head start to where i'm trying to be or where 
i'm trying to go i'm grateful for i am now but   if i had the information that i had two or three 
years or maybe five years earlier i would have   taken that leap then i'm just being like okay this 
is what this is what i'm going to do instead of um   personally if instead of going to college i would 
have done this i would have done the boot camp and   i would have actually probably come out even more 
ahead than where i am now um but that doesn't   discount the journey that i've been part of 
because it's been a very amazing journey thus far   so and i would say extending that advice to anyone 
who's considering joining a boot camp i would say   it's it's an amazing journey it is it is not for 
the faint of heart anyone can learn how to code   but not everyone is going to want to code because 
this is the field that'll either make or break you   because imposter syndrome is very real and you 
will deal with it on a regular basis however the   way to overcome that is to constantly just keep 
just keep learning because the more you learn   and the more you practice and the more 
you do it it the better it gets with time   coding has with the way coding dojo has taught 
us the way i see code now is like everything is   interchangeable every every language has the same 
basic data structures everyone everyone has the   same basic rudiments to learn essentially becomes 
if that makes sense so learning that rudimentary   the getting that rudiment in those rudiments in 
red so i say will help you in every other aspect   of coding itself because everything feeds off it's 
everything feeds off of each other it takes time   and it takes effort and dedication you get in what 
you put out well i'm sorry i mean you get out what   you put in so that's the best piece of advice um 
that i can give and also do not be afraid to ask   questions because there's always someone who knows 
something more than you and you may not know how   to figure it out at that time but being willing 
to put your pride aside and say i'm just going to   figure this out on my own i'll take the 20 minute 
rule if you can't figure it out in 20 minutes   find someone to ask a question just get someone 
to help you and you'll be better for the long haul   i love that that's great thank 
you lauren what about yourself   um for me if i were to go back look back i would 
just tell myself you know take that leap of faith   just do it you know it may not work 
out for you but it can't you won't   it won't be a detriment to you i guess is my 
point you know the worst case scenario is i   find out i don't like it but i gain new skills 
um for me it's it for me it was kind of like   things can't get worse than they are right 
now for me um so this is a this is this is   this is one of our ways out and if i 
don't go ahead and do it then i'm just   keeping myself in this bad position where 
i'm unhappy my mental health is not great   you know everything is just spiraling out of 
control but this is a way to take back control   and start getting my life back on track so i 
would say if anyone's kind of in the situation of   maybe they're in a job they don't like they're 
in a career they're not happy with maybe they   just want to advance their career you know just 
make your decision and stick to it you know don't   be too much don't fiddle too much obviously 
weigh the pros and cons i'm not saying don't   just jump in head first but you know weigh the 
pros and cons but as soon as once you make your   decision just stick with it and just know that 
this was the decision that was right for you   and you could there could always 
be what-ifs always can be what-ifs   but you know don't get hung up on those what-ifs 
just this is what i'm planning on doing this is   what i want to do this is what i'm going to 
do and then take the steps to actually do it   i love that thank you so much thank you 
all so much for sharing your journeys and   and where you are today and and i 
know this is just the beginning of   so many big things you know just even hearing 
your stories about your perseverance alone like   i mean it's it's amazing and it's just the 
beginning of massive things so thank you all for   for taking time thank you for having us 
yes thank you okay i'm gonna stop recording you
