pc building simulator 2 is out it's now this video is sponsored by epic games and i can't believe that i am getting paid to do my three favorite things build pcs play video games and kick jake's ass that's right you're going down i've never played this before so you very well could be right i only played that one time i've never built a computer before either so i don't know what i'm doing but because i challenged dennis last time frankly it was a cakewalk this time i'll be up against someone who actually has some pretty legit pc building skills so if neither of us pretty legit pretty little come on i do this for a living that's a complex that's a compliment you so with that out of the way neither of us haven't even looked at this thing let's get down to business what is this computer in the splash screen it looks scary it looks ridiculous why does it have eyes four-way sli is not a thing anymore okay the best part about that sli is it's like dual slot too the dual slot water wow these have got to be like 9 800 gtx's or something i'm trying to think what actually used a single wide four-way sli bridge nothing oh yeah i think it's just for show bro we found a flaw okay in all seriousness though this is obviously just a showcase pc the game is 10 off exclusively on epic games at launch so you guys are going to want to check that out and without further ado let's get into our challenge which is that jake and i each have to start a new game in career mode and get to the point where our shop is successful enough that we can rename it which i don't even know exactly where it is so is there is there uh should we do a free build first to kind of get the hang of it or do you know we're going into it i'm starting you're starting i'm starting i was marveling at the accurate model of that rtx graphics card what about the ram the ram looked really good that looks amazing my understanding is that they have actually collaborated with parts manufacturers to get real cad models of these cards to convert into models that they can use in the game so i'm expecting them to be like realism mode accurate if i've if i've learned one thing in life it's never meet with the insurance agents on an empty stomach all right step one i'm already winning this thing because i'm getting these boxes at the back all right okay we got a casual random box with an rtx 3080 in it yeah for sure oh wow heck yeah have to i have to twist all the screws oh my gosh you literally have to twist the screws where's my ltt screwdriver yo pc building simulator 2 team okay i want the screwdriver in there let's go dlc we'll get you the model all right that's smart the way it rotates the pc on the table and the camera so that you can do like uh it's pretty'0 degree rotation but turn the case all the way around that's really it's realistic too because you can't like float around it you know like you're not an omniscient god of building computers i mean i am but i don't know about you wait this is an msi computer let's go to msi wait is this just the did it copy my desktop background man into the game i love island it totally is it copied my desktop's background into the game did it really it okay that's unless this exact same msi background is on this computer in this game it copied my desktop background that's kind of cute okay i don't think they should make you put the side panel on to fire it up personally that's bad mojo yeah that's bad juvies i want to get my pc fixed but found only an empty space and a pleasantly smoky aroma i gather you no longer in business without a dress us sure i'm water pulling a graphics card and i'm actually taking the cooler apart wait you're just going ahead past the tutorial i think i'm in the tutorial this is part of the tutorial is it not when does the tutorial end i don't start i'm water cooling a gpu i'm not stopping why they have thermal grizzly even though oh my goodness corrupted files fan i have to remove the thermal pads see i'm trying to like read and like understand what's going on i thought we were doing a tutorial here yeah how do i switch off the pc i'm pressing i'm putting so much thermal paste though this is this is okay i just accepted a job to overclock a computer wow are you gonna have to go into the bios or does it have like xtu on it the level of detail is seriously impressive i honestly thought this game was kind of a joke but this is as accurate as a pc building simulator holy  i am in an evga themed bios really like overclocking no ways wait wait wait dude that's cool i'm about to water cool a computer and you actually have to make sure the loop goes in the right orientation oh it's walking me through if i press escape can i get out of this or no i just have to wait for 30 seconds okay that's kind of stupid i want to get out and go work on something else for 30 seconds that's how i would run my shop this actually spits out like temperatures and tells you if things throttle like what your temperature and your power draw and stuff you're joking right congratulations your overclock is stable wait these fans are backwards they're blowing out the front of the case i mean i guess it works i don't know why you would do it that way but sure did i just water cool the pc what have you been doing you're slack i overclocked yeah but i've already made pc yeah but it's now it's faster smart guys i have four hundred dollars and i did a most excellent job of removing the old thermal group wow it even makes you like apply the right amount of like thermal junk i'm putting so much thermal paste though paint it right i have to paint the case one of my main gear coolant well we're obviously gonna go with just clear coolant because i want this thing to actually work welcome to overclocking oh gosh wait i put orange coolant what are you trying to say i'm gonna lose this dude you're i'm slacking collect money okay let's give your business a new name go back to the hallway i win i win i already win you can give your business a new name now jack coos so wait we're only doing danger den i'm clearly a better whatever this is virtual computer builder fixer than you okay get wrecked what should i call it i'm gonna call it arlo's no my case is incomplete pc building i'm sorry donna cafe you build a pc and arlo's here can we get arlo put into this game please oh man this is wild so i didn't put the pc lot pci lock back in and it's real mad about that wait i'm not allowed to do mine yet holy crap am i really this slow you're pretty slow dude yeah i'm pretty slow nozzle size apply on glass what he wants me to paint on the glass how do i rename the shop all i did was paint this case red it doesn't even tell me how to rename the shot oh here it is can they give me tips and stuff is that i'm like so good at my job they give me tips what cannot use this company name it is not suitable what did you name it suck it jake let's try jake socks all all i'm hearing is you lost jake sucks is now fine oh great changing your workbench type holy crap this game is deep right done the tutorial or whatever but we are there is oh so there's a decorator app you can decorate your your shop look at my shop look at this space themed now holy crap let's go with sure you know what no i'm gonna spray it green screw this customer slider to increase the nozzle size you're not going to get paid linus how are you going to make your rent yeah you like that customer oh yeah oh no it's still tutorial so it won't let me do it wrong they want the glass sprayed too customer is an idiot customer stupid i mean i can see that being a theme for uh pc building simulator game you can't get tips for jobs but what you can start doing is selling computers out of your shop right so you build computers you can build computers and and sell them wait did i even buy the right cooler there are so many parts already and apparently once you're fully leveled up what is it 1600 parts 1200 1200 parts did you get the email back from the guy who you painted the the case red for much appreciation for the new case it was exactly what i asked for unfortunately it was also so perfectly matched to the red i had used to paint the walls that i tripped over it and landed on my nose next project will be about the interface between technology and pain i'm really feeling this one that is pretty cute writing i'm not are have you gone out into the storefront part of the shop no i i like re-themed my shop did you know this is amazing did you get the tablet yet uh yeah yeah i got the tablet i'm just i'm on to decorator you can like like mod your shop i'm just looking i'm looking around the shop like it's clear that there is a lot of work to do yeah like look at this horrible screwdriver man this could really be upgraded lttstore.com i also think i saw a fly flying around did i imagine that i don't need to clean the cpu well okay fine i'll clean the cpu yeah the lights doesn't like doing a good job well you don't have to it performs the same unless it's like old this is probably old is that going to perform the same if it's old all right let's yeah whatever yeah whatever that's good enough it's got some thermal paste on there blah blah blah it's constellation it's a constellation you can't tell but it's like a fleet of ships rotate components bruh you can do everything what i mean i only played the first game the one time but this is a completely different level of immersion i mean the fact that you can remove and replace individual ssd mounting trays and stuff like that is wild absolutely wild there's a few places where they do allow you to take shortcuts like this ssd here it didn't make me actually take off the tray yeah put screws through the tray into the ssd then put the tray with the ssd back onto the computer like they're they're not just gonna make it completely not fun right the whole plugging the cables in every time thing it's getting a little tedious mind you i imagine when you get into later levels there's a lot more stuff you do per system rather than just swapping a graphics card really quick and i imagine that makes it a little bit less like that wait can you rip people off the objective is install a geforce 970 or better the labor budget is 170 and the parts budget is six hundred fifty dollars yeah you can just put whatever the hell i want in here as long as it's better i guess dude i installed a new cpu and it blue screen on launch no so is it not the cpu do i need to reinstall windows do i call them and say yo dog your computer sucks on you i didn't put thermal paste on the cpu [laughter] budget extra so i put a 970 in with a 650 parts budget and i got like 400 bucks from him all right so you do scam your customer so i should find the cheapest 970 then correct that's cool you get to keep the parts you take out of people's things so you can put together your ex machines so it's not just like new stuff dude my shop looks sick no way whoa that looks amazing got like rgb reflections in here and stuff oh yeah 100 chance of sale at 960 edit computer name linus smells hey what save oh that increased the price it literally increased the price can i make it smells bad this is cool it's starting to take the guard rails off a little bit i think yeah it tells me replace this cpu i see it's a ryzen 3 1300x you have to check i have to actually make sure i'm ordering the right thing holy crap i sold my first computer oh wait this is the guy with the red computer he sent it back he wants me to put stickers on it okay these are some softball jobs sometimes here where does he want the sticker oh my god they're so big a sticker bombed it it has the right number of can i put more yeah oh i can put more this looks like ploof's computer now huh welcome to free build oh my shop is like voice nancy linus i can't rebuild yet you love yes you have to back out it's a different mode did i not remember to pick up my shipment again where's my xpg 650 watt power supply i could have sworn i ordered that thing you have to pick it up when you order it go into free player i'm gonna hit you with a carrot damn it stare at you all right i'm going to free play god resume jake socks dude there's a thermal camera what like for diagnosing problems i guess so that's sick you guys can build whatever you want but then you have to run a benchmark after to see who built the like technically better computer why is the retail value of this thing 4 800 with a core i3 in it because it's the labor man you don't know okay it has a 30 90 in it look i can get what's the best parts i'm just gonna take all the best parts z690 godlike twenty one hundred dollars let's do it all right i finally found oh there's even a ice giant no way yeah right now there's a ton of different brands list them all amd i'm not listing them all i can't list all the brands included there's silver we got nzxt fractal design ice giant g-skill makes aios what the heck silverstone i like just applying way too much thermal paste it should make you clean it off if you put too i'm putting so much thermal paste though there isn't a single brand name hard drive probably because no one cares i'm not surprised though i'll say this installing threadripper is exactly as tedious as it is in real life dude if you install a power supply in free build mode it like does all the cabling and screws for you that's nice wow it's kind of cute how it cable manages i haven't honestly been paying very close attention to the music but there is music listening to some rap music right now it's apparently royalty free so if you're a content creator or a streamer you can definitely include in-game music which is pretty sick this is going to take a while to build a computer which i guess is like cool yeah you gotta you gotta go through it you know you gotta play the game purple tubing run start the computer okay i really do need to find this oh there it is it only pans up and down so when i held the middle mouse no oh it's opposite i forgot to put the ssd in and now i have to take the graphics cards out and the water cooling out and the cables out it's just like real life oh oh you said a hard drive gift oh there's no way to fix this get wrecked son there's so many things okay so can i still win this race i picked 30 90 ti and i have to unplug all three power connectors nice okay ploof do you know the answer to this my case has vertical gpu mounts i do not wish to use them there does not appear to be a way for me to not use them maybe you just suck why just use the vertical man who cares i don't want the vertical mount i'm using sli i'm using sli screws what are these cables i did okay my computer is booted i gotta add or remove you gotta install 3d mark all right i'm gonna 3d mark let's run time spy please don't make me wait for the whole thing oh god i think i have to wait for the whole thing this is cool though you can bend your tubes no way what you can bend your hardline tubes there's hardline i let the game run everything for me because there's no performance benefit i'm on a test bench so you know yeah but mine's gonna look sick do some swirls or something spirals oh my god you have to actually like wait for time spy to run this is cray cray it's like sped up like it's a short time spy but i am still waiting for times but i'm sure we're gonna have an extended cut of this on float plane for those of you who are uh 28 000 in times by is it gonna make me actually install an iq rgb controller that would be kind of awful actually it'll just won't install properly too right okay power supply storage graphics cards memory motherboard cpu okay i set all my fans to max speed now no i overclocked my graphics card ran time spy and it crashed dang it my temp is just pegged at 100 degrees 1.6 volts is too much apparently for an ice giant sorry ice giant my cpu is at 95 degrees what's your overclock and it is throttled i just got a blue screen throttle no way i'm factory resetting oh my god i'm still at 94 degrees i'm not throttling them oh come on i thought you said he gave up on overclocking i overclocked it just a little yeah i need the edge i want the edge oh my time spy score thirty thousand eight hundred oh i got i got destroy immolated 17 500. well i had two 39s well my cpu is throttling too that's okay though because my favorite game is wormy anyway so does it let you play yeah i'm playing some more me let's go so whoever gets the highest wormy score wins this may actually be challenging jake i played this game a lot back when it was the only game on my cell phone or try i don't know why you uh decided that you wanted this to be what determines the winner does your worm get faster too no what's your score 4 500 okay there's no way in hell i'm getting anywhere near that hold on brother you can change your peripherals k95 hell yeah before we end this let's take a look at each other's computers i haven't actually put mine back together yet my panels aren't even back on yet if we were going for a price to performance i didn't hit that this computer is thirteen thousand dollars oh you managed to spend more than me somehow well it's because i got all these fittings oh you can swap mouse pads there's rgb mouse pads okay wait there is mouse pads in the game we gotta get lte store mouse in here 100 please epic games come look at my computer it's pretty sick i don't know why they look like that what the hell do you see that this is going to be impressive look it's sick it's a 30 90. no this thing's stupid 239 you're stupid stupid like if you've been watching what he's been doing he's all like oh this looks this looks amazing yeah it looks sick it's like garbage you look like garbage this better be magic i didn't claim mine was magic what the hell is that oh that's that case that case is cool yeah it's a cool case right oh he used tridenty royal well yeah unironically yeah look how shiny it is i even remember the gold one they have the silver one i didn't think it was possible but somehow you made your bends worse in the game than real life shut up they are not okay how is it like like so so aggro yo you know what you should do yeah you should have rainbow cables that won't be necessary what i should really do is thank our sponsor epic games
