all right you degenerates this guy right here he just got fired hot off the presses john ria resigns okay here's here's first off here's a little here's a little uh little fact of life okay and i i this is very important to understand no ceo after a major public scandal resigns okay he didn't go you know what i messed this up here's my resignation letter find somebody better okay this is not some really respectful thing where you see in those movies where the people are just like my king i have failed you take my sword right like this this is not him this is not what's happening everybody else told him that he has to forcefully resign okay so c the the ceo uh has announced that he's retiring from the company effective immediately the news comes almost a month after the company announced plans to introduce a controversial install fee for developers which resulted in an industrywide backlash now we've gone through this what does it mean they're talking about i mean they had all sorts of crazy things announced in the plan at one point they just said all install so then of course automation does automation kick off those things what about pirating what about denial of wallet attacks and then they said okay no we're not going to do that it's only going to be new installs for people on accounts uh like so if one person installs it on steam and then they install it again you only get one charge because it's two you know two two non-unique installs uh and it's all self-reporting which obviously means that it's not going to be self-reporting here within a year within two years whatever going to be they're going to build out software for to be able to track you blah blah blah blah a lot of people are kind of surprised about this whole situation that went on i'm sure nobody's surprised that the ceo got fired at this point i think this is a completely reasonable stand but this you know the problem is is that everybody who uses unity and everybody who is a part of this situation should really try to understand what is all of this about why are they charging a per install fee well first you got to understand a little something about stocks okay and i think this is really really really important to understand unity is not that old okay so why would a company ever go public well there's really only two possible reasons to go public for a company first one is that the the the se suite and the people who own stock really want to start being able to cash out on these deals without having to raise some sort of private equity uh fund instead they want to be able to go out have the wide range and they want to be able to make liquidity into their stock uh that's not a very strong or compelling reason at all and it would make no sense to really do that as a company the second and really the primary reason why any company tend to go public is that they need to be able to raise an incredible amount of capital to go say from $500 million a quarter to5 billion a quarter that's how you do it they offer 20% of their company 30% of their company 50% of their company or whatever it is at some $60 per share and then they get a huge amount of public money hoping that it's a it's way better than having vc money instead you have public money and then you raise a whole bunch of money and then you're also having the the beautiful effect of having liquid money right so this is good to understand that right so every company that does any of these things you should you should look through this right yeah yeah reason number two is right number one is one i've heard people talk about i've never really actually seen it done number two is it should be purely done for expansion i've heard companies literally state we are doing this as liquidity stuff for our employees blah blah blah blah which just sounds bogus to me um okay so now that we got that under the way the next most important number is this thing right here which you should look at let's me let me make sure it's in the uh in the chart so you can see it is their basic numbers okay they made 500 million in a single quarter right that's pretty good it's going up their net income is still 200 million uh negative meaning that they cost about 700 million to run per quarter and they're making about 500 million okay so think about that for a second they are a largely negative company uh lastly i think it's really good to look at this they've obviously geared up and hired tons of people to be able to do this whole publicly traded thing to be able to do a whole bunch and so are they really raising an employees what is their cost i don't know what all their cost and everything is so these are all just really good numbers to understand and the reason why i say all these things along with the whole ceo being fired is that though the ceo is being fired though they've made a lot of good changes to their policy they are in a bad position right they're in a position in which they're going to be continuously losing money which means that their goal is to earn more money now they have an ads network that's one way they can earn money they have their per seat licensing fee which is a one way they can earn money right now that's totaling about 500 million they still need to raise it by another 40% just to to break even just to even have a pe ratio they don't even got a pe ratio their pe ratio should be is is is is a dash okay it doesn't exist because it's negative okay it it doesn't make any sense so obviously they can hemorrhage this kind of money because they raised billions upon billions of dollars upon iping they probably have five years of runway but at some point they need to raise their money and so are they going to be able to do that well what's their whole goal here their whole goal is going to be to add another fixed cost so even though the ceo's standing down even though all these things are happening they still need to charge people more money and that is why this fee is not going to change right so even though this guy did the bad thing and they're just trying to save face by firing him by making him forcefully resign they're not changing course and that just needs to be strongly understood which i think just makes this completely almost a unique situation literally the scapegoat right which is kind of good i think that's one thing that they did is i'm happy about is that they put some guy i'm head of game something like as the person that did the public facing for this this this price plan the ceo literally never made pretty much any single comment or anything about it but he had to i mean he and the other sea suite had to check it off and so how does this affect unity uh as an industry standard i think unity is going to probably you know quote unquote be okay i think they're going to continue on operating and they're going to always be able to you know they just have a big enough war chest of money to be able to kind of plow through this time while they're trying to raise it but i you know my guess is what we're going to see is we're going to see some layoffs tightening of the ship making things more cost effective b they're going to push forward through this plan c they're going to take away self-reporting d they're going to become very exacting for what you owe them they're going to really get after this because they have to right they're going to have to to be able to make their company profitable and the worst part about being a public company isn't that you have to make yourself profitable is that every year they want you to become more profitable because here's the end game is what how how to stock price what's the ultimate goal of any company when it comes to stock the ultimate goal of any company when it comes to stock is to raise their stock continuously and one of the best ways or to provide value continuously shall i say and so one of the best ways that is done is through two methods one method is kind of like the older way that's kind of going out of touch which is dividends dividends was kind of the old way right yeah dividends we got dividends in here that was one of the old ways in which we used to deliver value the second way that it happens is stock buybacks so the company actually restarts acquiring back themselves from the public $500 million at a time or whatever it is i think netflix did that in 2023 just earlier this year in march and what that does is it it it literally inflates the the stock price because now there's just less shares available and so it makes sense so instead instead of being beholden to continuously and always buying or producing dividends and increasing the cost instead you can just buy back periodically parts of your share thus making a scarcity effect happen within the share um uh they can also do splits splits a splits is a different way splits is largely for perception uh there's there's a bunch of theory around this uh 50 to $100 stocks are bought the most by mom and pop investors they're bought the most by non-institutional ones anything above is almost pure institutional buys and so that's what they want to do is if you can become into this stock region you get this really nice um you get you get this really nice effect of of having more and more people uh purchase into your stock so there you go so hopefully you guys understand all those things because i think what you see here with the ceo is that you what you should read in this is nothing has changed they just want you to feel better nothing will change all the same things are going to be demanded of the company all the same things are going to be exacted from all the game developers unity unfortunately wasn't satisfied with their business model they didn't want a couple billion a year they wanted tens of billions a year and this will be the cost of tens of billions a year now they may end up falling off as the soup dour of game development and if they do i i mean i think that's sad because they made a great product but you know there you go it's ironic how unity is fragmented yeah soup what now yeah i know public companies and low confidence yeah i mean the thing is is that i don't have a problem with publicly traded companies i'm not i i you know me on this kind of stuff i i'm kind of more in the benevolent category i'm just more happy uh didn't they revert to 2.5% exactly they did revert to 2.5% to be below unreal they're not as feature complete as unreal so therefore they're not going to be as expensive as unreal but nonetheless they're still they still are increasing their charges right and they're going to have to find a ways to continuously monetize you so ads are going to be pushed harder install fees have to be pushed harder sl royalties whatever you want to call it right they have to do something which makes no sense i mean the problem is they have a conflicting business model right they did charge per seat and now that that is not working you know that didn't get them where they wanted so now they have to change into par uh charge per install because that's just a lot more money right two and a half% of the whole pot versus some fixed cost of how many people are developing you know as they make their product better you need less seats less seats means they get less money so it's just something uh just something to think about so uh can someone explain to me uh people like r uh land those kind of jobs despite their track record the the thing is is that it's very easy to say oh these ceos are super incompetent but the reality is being a ceo is extremely hard it's one of the more political jobs ever everybody's gunning for your job it's an extremely difficult and awful i mean i personally would not want to be a ceo of a large company at all like that it just it does not sound fun right unless if it's a private company you don't want to do it right if it's a private company and you steer the ship and you're like i'm majority owner [ __ ] off right that would be great but if you're not it's really difficult right it would be very very difficult well that's because i am owner of a private company here the startup i own it it's mine right even netflix the the ceo is beholden to the shareholders thee board the ceo of netflix could be fired tomorrow if the board deems it correct and so that's like a real you know it's a real thing is you are constantly beholden to that momentum is hard too and so for me this is this is more of a systemic problem which okay now i'm going to talk a little bit about philosophy okay we're going to do this i don't often talk philos opical wax philosophical about these things but i got to do it okay tell me if you agree or disagree i think one of the biggest problems we have i love the stock market i want you to understand i love the stock market i think it's one of the greatest ways for the average person to accumulate wealth by simply investing in good companies good solid companies and leaving their money there for 20 to 40 years it will just it will literally you know 40x over your lifetime it's one of the greatest mechanisms ever to distribute wealth among people with wise ability right it is it's absolutely incredible but the inverse of it is that it constantly demands money and i think companies going public to ever expand and make more money is a huge mistake i think only some companies should ever do that amazon makes sense they want to try to do everything for everybody so it takes a lot of capital to do that whereas unity is just making a game engine i think they biggest mistake was going public 3 years ago i don't think they should have ever went public i don't think they should have ever been dissatisfied with making a billion effing dollars you know what i mean like i think that i really would love to see more companies being okay with being a hundred million company with being a billion doll company you don't need to be a trillion dollar company right you don't need to ever make more and more money and i think it would really make a better world i think for everybody to have companies that weren't so so that weren't soever pursuing always like always tons of money and so that's kind of how i feel about it i you know i like again i love the stock market i still think it's the it's been the greatest it's been the greatest uh ability for the average person to gain wealth ever that has ever existed in any country like it's an ext like anyone that can provide counter evidence to some greater vehicle there is no greater vehicle that we know it is one of the greatest things we've ever seen for the average individual it's also has been one of the worst things for the average individual so it's like is it is it fantastic right is it something that we should all think is just pure and perfect no i think there's a lot of problems with it right i don't think it's great for addex that's the problem it's actually the worst for adex the stock market is fundamentally the worst for adex that's what gets it its bad uh rrap is that a the stock market isn't a zero sum game you can buy and huddle do what warren buffering does what do warren buffering do buy low never sell right go follow someone that can make 30% year-over-year and just do what they do and just never change anything right it's just so silly that's my take on this whole thing which is that i honestly think unity's biggest problem is they just should have never went public they should have been satisfied they should have been satisfied with the incredible thing they already built with the literal they could have been internally think about this let's just invert this whole thing you never hired a huge amount of people you never took on a huge amount of debt sure you made aund million $200 million maybe $300 million as your ad network grew you made some money and you took all of your employees kept giving them shares and you started paying out internal dividends and made everybody who worked at unity be able to retire after a decade 15 years of working for unity prove and value loyalty and just do a good private company take on these things cuz good private company that's what they do they just they just funnel money back to the people who hold the shares that would have been really great that's what i i would love to see more of those right do they exist they exist all over the place they just don't exist i mean there's not that many publicly traded companies in comparison to private companies there's tons of private companies tons of private companies you know and they they do one of two things private companies they try to effectively get acquired or they start clipping tickets right does does netflix do that no we're a publicly traded company we we we do it by delivering shares they have a very very aggressive share uh uh policy of how to give and reward employees with with company shares uh we do options it's very great um i i am very very happy about it uh it used to be ultra aggressive it used to be so good but they quit that about eight years ago it was so dang good um anyways there you go the name is i mean i'm not the stockage in but i just hope you understand that firing the ceo all this stuff is is really inconsequential to what's going to happen unity has to make more money they're going to continuously pursue methods of making more money and if you are relying on unity you just have to go in with that mentality if you go in with anything else you will be disappointed and you will be s s sorely sad when they start dropping self-reporting and start doing install our tracking stuff because we need toensure sure who's
