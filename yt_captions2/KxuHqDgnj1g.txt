ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the world chess championship 2023 contested by yanyupumnushi of russia and ding luren of china now if you've been following this entire saga and in particular the recaps on my channel you will know that round five was filmed in a very different place that's because i secretly snug down to tampa florida to walk out with michelle curry for uh crater clash 2 which is a boxing match uh and if you'd have no idea what i'm talking about don't worry i literally took a day trip to tampa florida literally no worse weight to spend a saturday and i landed back in new york about 30 minutes ago and here i am making this recap so first of all sorry i'm late but uh the goat is back uh and you know what else is back folks exciting chess because it's three to two right now over dingly ren back to back decisive games this match is a boxing match in and of itself not actually because i don't think they would be allowed to you know be physically violent with one another but this match is absolutely sensational now you will remember that this is now ding's third game with white that's how it works his first game was d4 his second game was c4 this time he goes back to d4 and if you remember he had a very bad outing with d4 the first time uh in an opening that looked uh like this he played the move h3 so i mean just basically a head against the wall saying i i don't have you know and i'm gonna play kind of an exotic idea well this time he starts like this now knight f3 is a very committal move um it's a very committal move because in many openings the night really should be on c3 and you don't know if this knight is coming here um but it's a way to move order some people out of certain situations or it's a way to play the london it is a way to play the london and you know game six of yan's last world championship match do you remember that game were you following chess watch that game then finish this game and go type in game six magnuson that was one of the most legendary games ever and in that game magnus started with an exotic move order like this and it's kind of maybe some psychological warfare by ding like yan if you play e6 on the second move you know i'm gonna play g3 and maybe i'm gonna play a catalan via a different move order well then jan goes here and a london in a world chess championship now you never have to get made fun of again on twitter on anarchy chess on regular chess subreddit i mean the london in a world championship game we've really we've really really come a long way now the london is an absolutely like truly it's actually a fascinating opening because um i mean it it does have a very boring tendency but that's because you might not play it in like the meta overall way there's like really interesting ways that the london can become a different opening for example now it's a carl con okay so like every pawn trade in the london system can become a different opening how is it a karo khan white played e4 black played c6 d4 d5 edcd so the c pawn is gone and the e-pawn is gone now you just somehow by some really weird fashion right oh if takes takes made it into a caro so knight c6 uh knight bd2 and um a really interesting kind of tense situation uh has uh has arisen there's a lot of lines here like black has played in the two pawns and two nights set up he can develop his bishop he can play e6 he can play knight h5 there's really interesting dynamic ways to take a little bit of calculated risk in the london yam plays one of the most solid approaches uh he plays c takes d4 which is immediately clarifying the situation in the center of the board and then he plays bishop f5 so clearly based on the speed at which jan is playing this is what he had prepared so like he was ready you know he sat down before the game and went all right if ding plays knight f3 i'm gonna play d5 and i dig might play c4 or g3 and i'm gonna play this and then i'm gonna go for this kind of ultra sharp uh sorry ultra solid concrete variation and we're we are in that exchange karo khan setup but white doesn't have an exchange carlcon on the board because normally you have c3 and bishop d3 and really neither of those things are necessary right now uh and if you're going to play c3 which again it's not neces it's not necessary but it's a very reasonable move to prevent night before uh then you're not gonna play bishop d3 because that would hang a bishop so c3 well that completely abandons this plan um and now e6 now there is one very interesting line here which i would recommend queen b3 here to every beginner and intermediate player under the sun to apply pressure to this that's what i always tell people how to play the london system um well uh yeah there's this line bishop d6 which is kind of nuts and it's this line where black loses a pawn and the right to castle but is like fine and isn't worse at all and it's weird it's it's definitely a weird thing um so bishop b5 though is what ding chooses i actually once faced the move bishop b5 in an over the board game uh against the 2000 rated young player and um and i got nothing like i tried to my hardest to create problems and i just got absolutely nothing and you'll notice that ding spent seven minutes here so i mean ding was improvising it's not the thing it's not that ding did not know the best move it's that ding was choosing which of these lines he wanted to go for ding is completely making things up like as he goes i mean he just he's like i'm gonna play london and i'm gonna play bishop b5 and then we're gonna trade bishops and castles castles and now rookie one all right we know that in the london the two central squares are extremely important white would love to just completely dominate e5 black would like to dominate e4 but black can't really run in head first um and the reason for that is like i can just take and for instance if you do something like this it's a temporary boost of uh dopamine but you're gonna lose your pawn so uh white controlling these squares is you know is quite important and now you know this is really a nice position to get jan in because yan is like a snowball okay he uh if he goes downhill he's gonna get bigger and bigger like he's like a you know it turns into an avalanche very quickly um here he has to kind of make like very vague obscure positional decisions you know he thinks for a little bit plays h6 right like he spends six minutes and he pushed the pawn it's because the position is nefarious write this that's a weird efficiently play h6 you know now ding plays knight e5 is doing typical london things you can't take the knight because that loses the game on the spot to a fork um yeah you know there's there's various ideas in the london where you you know you route your knight somewhere maybe you move your bishop knight f5 so jan does spends another third uh how much time is that fourth sorry i just got off a plane i don't know how to do math uh those two things are not correlated um nine minutes on the move 97 right so it's just a little just a general kind of like uncomfortability and there's one more absolutely fascinating thing about this pawn structure it's a ragosan excuse me it's a carl khan but it's also a reverse ragozan which means nothing to you all right the only rr you need to know is uh rolls royce uh yeah but but it's a reverse so like ding is playing an opening with white which looks like an opening that he would be playing when he was playing black so it's like uh just super fast that's what he said london is very interesting right so now things okay i have control in the center should i start playing over here maybe maybe i can play h3 in queen of three or a4 a fascinating move that seemingly does absolutely nothing look how much time that he spent on it 29 seconds it's big boss behavior ding knows he would like to instigate over here and jan spends three minutes on a response and a6 is like so naturally your opponent plays ace four you'd play a6 kick the bishop out you know back to f1 why back to f1 because you don't exactly know where the bishop will redeploy and you don't want to trade because this bishop could be a target in the future for you you can try to gobble the bishop also if you trade the bishop you're giving black opportunities to develop uh now jan proceeds to play knight d7 and jan plays this move in less than two minutes and you know he's like well i'm gonna trade pieces um now anish giri on the move knight d7 like visibly gagged uh he was like this is not a good move it's just not a good move why is it not a good move well the trade overall sets black back and now black has a ton of pieces on dark square light squares and his dark squares are just very exposed and white's entire setup here is clamping on every set of dark squares possible and jan's pawn play and piece play is rapidly drying up he does not have a pleasant position okay rather than trading and by the way even rather than playing a6 maybe jan should have gone here and tried to put a knight on d6 but the move a6 as natural as it is might fundamentally cause jan to have positional problems so he he plays queen c7 and ding plays queen f3 now rook c8 now rook a3 a really interesting idea a couple of things here maybe you push b4 and defend this maybe you play rook b3 rook b6 maybe you play c4 and bring the rook to start an attack all right bishop back to g6 now the knight might come knight to b3 and that knight is just going to c5 folks alright and now we're gonna have a clash in the center of the board as black is gonna try to play one of two pawn breaks here uh ding plays queen g3 why does he play queen g3 queen trade benefits white why does it benefit white black loses all this thing in the center white can then play f4 knight c5 b4 full dark squared clamp light squared bishop is completely irrelevant in this position which is why queen e7 is played in the game now ding plays h4 which is exactly the same way that yan improved against ding this is the same exact thing remember yesterday do you not remember the same exact thing happened jan moved his h pawn and then clamped some more space he just kind of took free real estate and this move gives a escape to the king in the back rank and this move prevents a queen trade so a lot of things are happening here all right rookie 8 now by young here comes knight c5 hits everything beautiful square for the night that's called an outpost a square usually on the opponent's side of the board where a piece can camp out can not easily be removed from and now here comes e5 now the movie five uh by duboff daniel dubov was stated as this is either completely solving or i'm paraphrasing this is either completely solving black's problems or it loses immediately like it's just gonna lose it's just gonna lose so now folks something very intense started happening as you can see the evaluation is quite high ding has a very promising position he's applied a very strong positional squeeze however ding starts playing a lot slower and he starts making inaccuracies beginning with the move rook to b3 losing in a full point of advantage all right what he should have done apparently was played b4 threatening to take this because the whole point is that you cannot take because of the knight if black plays e4 f3 and you hammer away at this pawn instead of that ding plays rook b3 all right gives away this however what's worth more than a rook you rook takes e5 gets a pawn back and hits the queen in queen f6 the rook comes here to attack now knight to c4 and bishop takes why bishop takes because we've talked about this this bishop has absolutely no role in the game it is not a participant it is a spectator all right knight to c5 knight on c5 not 2 c5 pressures a lot of the black queen side and these weaknesses and this pawn is not so significant and i mean at some point you're gonna come and collect but look at things time things down 26 minutes on the clock zing plays the move h5 exactly the same thing that happened in the game between him and ding in game number five now in this position there was a way to relieve the pressure rook takes e5 how because after d takes attacking the queen and the bishop black has an incredible resource queen to d8 and if you take the bishop queen d1 king h2 queen h5 and it's a draw it's a draw by perpetual check it's a draw why because of this you stop guarding that and you lose the knight so obviously that wouldn't have happened but this is still very very maybe salvageable for black instead of that jan plays this pretty quickly this typical yarn stuff all right you're a fan of yawn you gotta hold your breath you never know when he's gonna play too quickly ding collects the b pawn and now a brilliant move escapes tactically escapes by hanging his knight to an x-ray defender the queen defends the knight but via the rook if you take boom and i win your queen which is sensational so 96 is a spectacular move but look at jan flying down the other side of the board a lot of you would put panic here this is very scary all right the queen is hitting the rook the pawns are dangerous right the knight can take this and in the end game this is a past pawn and it's the pawn that's furthest away from the epicenter of the board so you are constantly terrified that that point is going to become a queen so rook to a5 all right king h7 and now ding spends almost no time and plays rook c5 but here ding had his biggest winning advantage of the entire game and that was the miracle move queen to e1 which simultaneously does three things number one it protects the king on the back rank number two it defends the pawn on c3 and number three it sets up a double attack with the knight when you would say levy isn't that double attack already existing yes but if i play knight takes c4 in this position you don't guard the pawn or knight f7 for that matter so queen e1 is an incredible move ding misses it and he is down 25 minutes on the clock okay ding has to make his next eight moves in 19 minutes that might sound like a lot of time because you play bullet chess or three minute chess or whatever it's not a lot of time in a world championship match when you are on the verge of tying the match again it is three to two young plays queen c1 check king to h2 and tries to kick the queen out ding queen g3 surgical move defending the pawn on c3 lining up an attack on g7 at the end of the day this a pawn time is ticking for white if ding does not act now does not act decisively this is going to happen and that is what yan is banking on he's he's banking on the fact that that pawn has four steps to go frankly it doesn't have four steps to go it has like three steps to go because let me tell you something right now when that point is on e2 you ain't stopping it i got news for you you might not stop that pawn on a3 it might be too late at that point so he's gonna act right now time is ticking' minutes on the clock nervous sky high it's like 90 000 live viewers million viewers are gonna watch this gotham recap and if they haven't already call a friend and get them into get them into chess all right we're we're like uh you know we're like a multi-level marketing scheme minus you know scamming people and ruining lives uh knight takes c4 jan plays a4 look at how much time ding spent he spent one third of his remaining time on capturing this pawn calculating the consequences of the move a4 this is high tense stuff night drops back to e3 11 minutes on the clock to make the last four moves the knight is threatening the bishop now i told you a long time ago what about the move a3 well i told you a long time ago that if ding not long it's been like two minutes if ding does not act right now that pawn is going to become a queen well how do you act right now what is the most prized possession in the world of chess correct having a game that you sent to me featured on this channel the second most prestigious thing highest value is to go for checkmate this will be single-handedly the one thing that prevents black from making this queen and forces black to react defensively and the second the rook abandons the post you stop the pawn from the other side the rook 97 is an absolute god the rook on g8 all right is being is being put on the on sale counter of the store and still nobody's buying it hell they might put a sign take this for free on the side of the road outside of a house ain't nobody buying it all right so bishop to b1 ding has to act now rook c7 confidently played on the board rook to g8 going back to defend knight to d5 galloping forward and you still can't do anything because knight takes f6 and the pawn is not defending the pawn on f6 it's an illusion so you play king to h8 now it looks maybe like the attack is extinguished and the pawn has been successfully defended and the bishop is defending from a long way away but then goes to e7 and he gets his extra time and ladies and gentlemen this man ended this game with something so heinous so ridiculous rook to f8 now he he could play knight to g6 all right the bishop guards and the pawns not getting through and you might think that you know in the long run we're gonna get to an end game right this pawn might get traded upon a bishop of the night black seems to kind of be okay you know he's not going to blunder a mate anytime soon and if black gets the queen back and the queens come off the board black might not even be that much worse uh maybe even f takes g5 to open up the rook and uh in this position dingley ren plays the move d5 he spent 20 minutes on the move d5 do you know why he spent 20 minutes dude would you like to know what the move d5 sets up pawn push to d5 sats up one of the most disgusting queen sacrifices ever played in a world championship pawn to d5 sets up a brutal checkmating combination by force how it has to do with the king not being able to escape to e6 what let me show you pawn to a2 is now knocking on the door of promotion in this position dingly ren had forecasted queen c7 pawn to d5 and queen to c7 setting up veiled threats of queen takes pawn so if this knight g6 check opening up this game over that's the idea but what happens when black defends against all of that well knight to g6 rook g8 where's the win i don't understand and i got news for you remember how i told you that the move d5 sets up an absolutely brutal combination well in this position white is no longer winning white has thrown it all away except for one move which ding had seen when he pushed this pawn confidently to d5 in this position seemingly on the verge of holding everything and saving the game succumbed to queen f7 the hell does that do the move queen to f7 sets up an unstoppable checkmate how it sets up queen takes rook rook a8 if this then this but that's not the cool thing if this then this the pawn on d5 prevents the king from escaping dingly ren winning in style d5 surgical technique the threat the knight will fly away and it'll pop like champagne king h7 rook g8 queen f7 game over match three a piece this is the most exciting world championship match we have had in a damn long time in the chess world and that has a lot to do with how dominant and incredible magnus carlson is as a chess player but i got news for you i am not complaining i am not complaining what a game what a match it's three all after six we got eight more games to go now get out of here
