okay today i'm gonna learn so wait who are you learning technical things is so hard i wish i had a way to learn it faster okay that is very traumatic but in all fairness i've been there many times before in today's video i'm going to share with you different tips and tricks backed up by science that will help you improve your learning process learn at a faster rate technical things all right let's get into it so we don't end up like her oh speaking about learning technologies at a rapid pace and having the support to be able to do so i want to talk to you about coding dojo for those of you who aren't familiar i went to a coding boot camp which feels like a lifetime ago but through that experience it honestly changed my career path and in turn i don't want to be dramatic but we're being dramatic it honestly changed my life it changed my income my freedom my flexibility what i was able to do what i was able to create and that's why i was so excited to connect with coding dojo and share with you about them today actually not only share with you about them i actually got to attend some of their classes which was incredible i'll put up on screen here some clips from previous classes and it was so great to hear the questions that were being asked and how engaged the instructor was what was being taught i just i loved the whole process and it made me really miss my experience at a coding boot camp and going back to school there's going to be a full video to come going really in depth of coding dojo and the curriculums and courses they have to offer but i want to share with you on screen here some of a higher level of what they they offer today there's three different paths software development data science and cyber security and within that especially with software development there's different options from online full-time part-time part-time flex which i really love because i know as you continue to life is that a thing we continue to do life it gets busier and busier and having options to be flexible or accelerated maybe you are in between jobs and this is where you want to take your next step is really important also if i was to do it all over again i definitely i'd probably use software development but then also to cyber security is so fascinating and so in demand so it's data science i mean they all are they are completely worldwide so they operate all online so no matter where you are in the world you can attend coding dojo also too there are different funding options for coding dojo which i really think is important because i love that they are trying to make their courses as accessible to everyone as possible and i'll scroll down here on the page you can see there's different methods for funding also too you can talk to someone about it schedule in a time and speak to a huge human as we know which is hard nowadays so how does it work well first of all you apply get accepted then take the curriculum whichever you applied for let's say software development full-time boot camp in this course which is 16 weeks and it's fully online from beginner to advanced and within these 16 weeks you will learn three full stacks starting with the basics and i love that they teach more than one stack because it gives you good experience of getting comfortable learning quickly which we're talking about today and also to getting comfortable working with different technologies which is huge to stand out from the crowd when applying now one of my favorite parts of coding dojo is the amount of support you get after the coding boot camp so once you graduate it's not like they're like okay bye thanks for attending they are with you every step of the way ensuring you land a job that is best suited for you if you leave that job finding another job it's lifetime support i don't know as someone who didn't have that after recording boot camp i think that's invaluable i can't even put a number on that because it's something that is so hard to do on your own and having that support is just oh it's everything anyways i link them down below make sure to go check them out and if you are a coding dojo boot camp grad leave in the comments say hi i know i have some followers who are grads from coding dojo and a lot of you when i share about quoting dojo share your wonderful experiences with them so leave in the comments alright let's get back to it foreign okay we've all been like that tiff before and the reality is no one wants to be like that but we've all been there and why is that well there is so many cases for that but one of the main things that i have learned for myself causes that is mindset and i know when i even i was making this video i thought oh tiff are you really going to say mindset it sounds so cliche yeah it's just great have the right mindset easier said than done i totally agree but one thing that i've learned through really working towards every single day it's like a muscle it's something that doesn't come necessarily strong to me anyways if i'm being totally candid with you but something that i work towards every single day is i get to do this for example when i am even going through a coding tutorial with you all or filming one of these videos some days i don't feel like it some days i'm tired and i just want to lay on the couch or not learn something new to share with you but rather than having this oh i have to do this mindset switching it to i get to do this mindset imagine when you really think about it and shift your perspective to we have all these incredible resources online right at our fingertips that we can use today what's stopping us a lot of times it's our mindset it's our motivation and we won't dive into motivation and discipline in this video i want to share with you specific tips and tricks to learning new tech faster but i couldn't i felt like i would not do this video justice if i didn't bring in mindset at least to start with really sharing with you start flipping your script or flipping your mindset from i have to do this to i get to do this i get to be able to learn these new technologies that are available at my fingertips to earn more money to earn more freedom to start my own business whatever the case is sounds pretty amazing if you ask me okay this one you might find to be extraordinarily weird like tiff is this really fact or a learning technique i've tried it and i've kind of noticed a difference and i'm wondering if you've already tried this or if you've noticed a difference too and this is backed by science this is not just out of thin air which is chew gum yes you heard that right according to a study published by the british journal of psychology chewing gum can actually improve cognitive performance particularly when it comes to memory and attention so how does this really work well the study goes on to say that chewing gum actually increases blood flow to the brain which in turn increases the amount of oxygen of course available to the brain this in turn can help improve cognitive function and make it easier to focus and also retain the information sounds like a win-win to me so next time you are hitting the books you are studying make sure to have gum on hand although you got to be careful with how much gum we start ingesting our dentist might not be happy about this one but i thought it was so interesting chewing gum oxygen to the brain and in turn you're able to focus better and also retain more information okay i'm going to share with you probably one of my biggest kept secrets while it's not that secret because i'm sharing it with you and i've shared with friends before on how to keep up to date with technology and also to be able to learn at a really quick pace which really goes hand in hand when you think about it in order to learn new tech fast and keep up with trends and what's coming down the pipeline you need to be aware of what's coming down the pipeline and what these trends are and one of the best ways to do that is through newsletters i have so many newsletters i absolutely love i'll share with you some on screen here that really helped me keep up to date from future tech to cool tools to use some around css design some around different javascript or python courses or where it's trending and what it does is it allows me to be able to at a high level understand what's kind of coming up after a while when you're subscribed to a few of these newsletters you start seeing trends you start seeing oh you know there's a lot of people or a lot of newsletters talking about this topic my you know you just go through the newsletter and you actually see something that you're like this is very interesting to me that's something that i think is super important to do to keep up to date that is a way to do so that doesn't seem so overwhelming i've joined slack groups before i'm part of discord groups and sometimes when you are using them to keep up to date on what's coming up and can feel very overwhelming because you're just being bombarded constantly with messages and this is a good way to be able to control it at your own pace okay you are going to be so happy that i'm sharing this one with you mainly because it's something that we all love to do and if you don't love to do it leave in the comments i need to know who you are because i don't know i'm a huge fan of this what is it you ask napping believe it or not napping is actually shown to help you study and remember things faster how does this work according to a study published in the journal of nature neuroscience taking a nap after learning something new can actually help solidify the memory and improve recall so how this really works it goes on to say is during sleep the brain replays and strengthens the neural connections that were formed during the learning process so you know learn something new ingest it while you're chewing gum of course and then go ahead and have a nap and in turn while you are having a nap your brain will actually form connections for what you are learning about and i think this is so important about the nap aspect especially when it talks about when we're talking about learning technical things at a faster rate because there's this pressure i think as we work in tech or learning new tech to keep up with it and whether we admit to having that pressure or not it's kind of there the the culture around tech is there and i really don't want to promote that kind of hustle culture but being able to keep up with tech in a way that is maintainable and healthy to do is a really exciting thing and that's why something like napping i really wanted to include in this because it actually is really scientifically proven to help learn things faster but also too because we need to remember that we can't excel and learn if we're working in an environment where we are putting all this unnecessary pressure on ourselves putting all these deadlines on ourselves we need to be able to be flexible as life happens we get so busy so many things come up and i think it's a really good reminder that sometimes rest is actually the best way to take a step back and really ingest or understand the information that you had just learned lastly if you want to learn tech at a quicker pace you need to be able to embrace new technology now what do i mean i mean even with chat gpt and the use of ai coming out more and more don't shrug those tools off as oh that's cheating or oh that will help me too much i need to do this all on my own let go of your ego and start using these tools in the right way which by the way i have a full video about so we're not going to dive into different commands or prompts to using these tools but i'll link it down below at the end of the day though i've gotten so many messages from people that say i don't want to use ai or chat gpt because it's cheating tip you know it's taking away from my actual ability or skills no it's not if you are using these ai tools in the proper way proper meeting you're not using them to actually code for you when you are learning at least but rather explain things to you in a way that is valuable for you to understand for me when i like to be explained things i like to understand them from a kindergarten or child perspective honestly especially when i'm first understanding it because it breaks down these technical topics in a very user-friendly way okay those are my top five tips for learning at a quick pace especially learning technical things out of quick pace i hope you enjoyed them i think some of them were a little quirky strange which i love because i feel like there are a ton of videos that go through different topics similar to this and i wanted to ensure to include some that were kind of fun but also scientifically proven and backed up leave in the comments what you are currently learning i'm always curious to hear what technologies you are learning or working on hit that subscribe button and also too make sure to go check out coding dojo i link them down in the description go check them out they are incredible speaking of learning new things foreign [music]
