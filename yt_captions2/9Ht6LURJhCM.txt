for documentary filmmaking story is king and as much as it hurts me to say it coming from a cinematography background audio is probably more important than video for keeping your story moving forwards you're kidding me but getting good audio is easier said than done especially when you're just starting out and it's easy to get overwhelmed to make mistakes luckily i've already made most of them myself and so in this video i'm gonna go into five of the most common mistakes new filmmakers make on their documentary shoots and how you can avoid them at the end of this video i'm gonna give you one of my favorite strategies for how to deal with super loud environments so make sure you stick around because doing this one simple thing has saved me so many times in the edit let's get into it [music] hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsythe and on this channel i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years working as a documentary cinematographer and photographer if that sounds like something you'd be into make sure you hit that subscribe button because i've got new videos coming out every week over the years of doing run and gun shoots in difficult locations i've managed to make pretty much any audio mistake there is i came from a photography background before i got into video and so for me especially in the beginning i prioritized visuals over everything and if i'm being honest my first love is still the camera but i've come to grudgingly accept that without audio it's very hard to tell a good story are you kidding me and in documentary at least the very best documentaries there's so much more to audio than just doing one master interview and then layering b-roll over top for a documentary to feel immersive like you're actually there with the main characters as they live their lives you're going to want to capture audio as they talk to their friends and family or make difficult phone calls or strike up conversations with a random stranger these are the moments that will make your film feel intimate and personal in my opinion anyways i'm not saying a good sit-down interview isn't important because you need those too but getting solid audio in the field as things happen is going to take your project to the next level so let's get right into it what are the common mistakes i see in new filmmakers and how can you avoid them i'm going to start out with the most obvious one just to really hammer the point home the worst mistake you can make as a new filmmaker is to not make audio a priority i really don't think i can stress this enough pretty b-roll and slow motion shots with some voice over in the background is not enough for an immersive documentary you might be able to put together a cool short or maybe a piece of branded content but the best documentaries do much much more and audio is going to form the spine of your story if you have clean audio you can cut around sloppy camera work but if you drop the ball on sound it's really hard to tell the story with visuals alone once when i was right at the beginning of my career i was hired to film an interview with the former president of mexico it was a rush job and it was just me and the producer with no time to find a sound guy so it fell to me to handle the audio and i did the classic beginner thing and left it all to the last minute i had about an hour to get everything ready and i spent 95 of that time tweaking the frame and moving the lights just a little this way or a little that way trying to get the perfect roll off then the guy came in and i threw a live mic on him at the last minute and started rolling i didn't even put up an overhead boom or anything and during the interview i just kept my eye glued to the monitor to check focus when i finally got the footage onto my computer later i realized there had been a problem with my mic placement and the lav track was pretty much unusable and because i didn't boom my shotgun and it was like six feet back on top of the camera it was also unusable in the end the whole thing had to be cut from the final show because you guessed it the audio sucked the frame looked pretty good but it didn't matter and you're probably not going to be surprised to hear that i never heard from that producer again this is maybe an extreme example of a beginner's mistake because of course audio is important in an interview but i think it gets the point across audio matters and if you don't make it a priority you won't be able to push the plot ahead my advice is that if you have a budget hire a sound guy a good sound guy can take so much pressure off the dp and give the director peace of mind that the audio is going to be covered all the time so before you start rolling on a new scene or decide to blow your whole budget on renting a fancy drone or a gimbal system ask yourself am i giving my audio the attention it needs one of the best audio tools a documentary filmmaker has at their disposal is a wireless lav mic it's going to allow you to get good sound on moving characters and will cover you when they're not facing the camera or even near the camera but how you use them matters and the second mistake new filmmakers make with their audio comes down to mic placement just a second ago i told you how i messed up that interview with the former president because of bad mic placement and if i just moved it a tiny bit i might have saved myself a lot of embarrassment so where is the right place to put a lab mic well for starters hide it i know you might see news broadcast or youtube videos where the little wire is coming at the top and you can see the mic around the collar of the person speaking but for me this totally wrecks the feeling of being a fly on the wall observer and i think you should avoid this at all costs okay now that i've got that out of the way where should you hide it the mistake i made with the mexican president was to try and hide it on the outside of his shirt by trying to put it under his tie i couldn't see it in the frame and so i thought i'd done my job well but when i listened to it after i could hear every tiny little movement the guy made as the tie switched over the mic it was seriously terrible and as soon as i heard it i knew i'd messed up since then i've always put it under the person's clothes usually between the skin and the first layer that they're wearing now that can change if the person is wearing like five layers in a parka but my reasoning is that skin doesn't rustle like a shirt so it's just one less place for your sound to go wrong now i am not a professional sound guy by any means and i don't want to pretend that i am like the final authority on mic placement no all i'm looking is for quality audio actually mark bone made a really good video with a pro sound guy on his channel that i'll link to in the description about how to place lav mics but i personally basically try to get next to the skin at around sternum height there are a few different ways of physically attaching the mic and some work better than others depending on the situation taping right on the skin with medical tape is great but it can be awkward if you're a man miking a woman and if the person has a hairy chest it's not a pretty scene when you take the tape off most of the time i use these little undercover things from rye coat that you sandwich around your lav mic and then stick it to the inside of a shirt and they look great i'll link to those in the description as well they usually stay on there for an entire day and they also have the added benefit of a bit of wind protection if the person is totally covered in sweat or the stickies won't stay on for any reason a good trick i learned while filming a survival show last year is to tape a safety pin just below the end of the mic and then pin it on the inside of that person's shirt this works great when the subject is either really dirty or really really active because it won't fall off but just make sure not to put the pin on so high that it rattles against the tip of the mic okay so even with all those ways to attach a lab to someone's clothes there's one simple way i could have saved myself from ruining the interview with the president the third mistake on this list is one of the easiest of all to avoid and for any run and gun dock shooters i'd say this one is critical and that is not monitoring the audio as you go once i hit record on that interview i got tunnel vision on the monitor just checking focus and occasionally glancing at the audio levels to make sure he wasn't peaking but if i just been wearing a five dollar pair of headphones i would have heard that scratching sound right away and could have asked for a five minute pause to find a better spot for the lav not monitoring audio for that interview still haunts me to this day and the one positive that came from it is that i will never make that mistake again and you shouldn't just monitor audios during sit-down interviews listening to what people are saying through their lab mic is super important and can really help you understand what to film you might think you're hearing everything a person is saying but there are surprising number of times when the mic is picking up things that you aren't like if a character is whispering to someone else or talking to themselves having an earbud in will tell you that it's time to roll on something that you might not have otherwise noticed once i was filming in a batcave in kenya and the scientist i was with lost his way and for half an hour he couldn't find the exit tunnel it was pitch black and i couldn't really see what he was doing but i realized he was panicking only because he started to whisper don't panic don't panic to himself under his breath when i heard this i knew to start rolling and in the end this created a really powerful and very real scene that i could have easily missed side note being trapped in a cave when the only person who knows the way out is starting to panic is absolutely terrifying headphones are so cheap and you don't need crazy over ear ones either just get some that won't fall out and keep them on you at all times as soon as a lav mic goes on to someone pop in some headphones and don't stop listening until the mic comes off simple actually that batcave shoot is a really good segue into the fourth mistake i want to touch on and that's thinking that you have to have a good shot in order to hit record on the camera like i said already audio is the backbone of the story and you don't necessarily need to have a direct shot of the person's mouth moving in order to use it you can always layer over b-roll or a cutaway and even if something is happening in the pitch black or in another room if you're monitoring your audio like you should be and you hear your character start talking just hit record we live in the digital age and there's no real reason not to roll on something like there was in the film days so just roll for audio only and you can always throw away the shot later imagine this scene which was a real one that happened to me before i was following a business owner who was in a rage over a mistake one of his employees made he rushed into the office and slammed the door in my face a pretty clear sign i wasn't allowed to follow him he started yelling at this person and telling them off and i knew it was a great storytelling moment so i just filmed the closed door and let the wireless audio carry the story you'll see this all the time in docks especially in sports docks where the crews get locked out of the dressing room sometimes after a game that doesn't mean that you can't keep the story going though and a frame of a closed door with good audio in the background is totally usable and the audience will accept it you have to be monitoring the audio to know when these moments present themselves so keep your headphones in and just roll alright so the last mistake i want to touch on comes down to timing we've already established that wireless lav mics are a documentary filmmaker's best friend but stopping the action to physically get them on people can be pretty annoying when i was starting out i used to put this off so i didn't disrupt the shots i was getting but i've since learned that this is a mistake you should absolutely avoid the best time to put a mic on your character is as soon as you can as soon as you decide you're going to spend even a little bit of time with someone try and get a mic on them right away you never know when they're going to say something you might want to use and even though you can sometimes get people to repeat missed actions you'll rarely be able to repeat miss dialogue people in documentaries aren't actors and if you ask them to repeat something they said it's pretty much always going to sound fake so get them micked up as soon as you possibly can it's so much better to deal with a two-minute pause at the start of the day than realize they said something amazing with their back turn to the shotgun and you'll never be able to go back and get it again okay that's it those are five of the most common audio mistakes you should avoid when shooting your next documentary project but before i go i wanted to give you one bonus piece of advice that has saved me so many times in the edit especially when you're having to shoot in areas with a lot of ambient noise that you can't control and that's to see the sound so what does that mean imagine you're filming a scene with a character in their kitchen but they live next to the freeway and every two minutes a car drives past or maybe they live near a construction site and you can hear jackhammers in the background these sounds will jump out at audiences and they can find them really distracting but there's a very simple way to trick their brains into ignoring the sound completely and that's to show them where it's coming from i know it sounds crazy but all you need to do is show them a quick cutaway of that construction site or the busy highway and they'll forget about it i'm not a scientist and i don't really know why this works but it does the same goes for heavy wind or rain or anything else for that matter let audiences see the sound and they will ignore noise that would normally bother them this has been such good advice for me that i actually wrote see the sound on a piece of gaff tape and had it stuck to my wireless laughs to remind me to get those simple cutaways once you get into the edit and have them it can save what otherwise might be an audio nightmare so there we go if you can avoid these mistakes your audio game is going to improve big time i'm curious what other audio issues you struggle with so let me know in the comments and maybe i can make a video about them thanks for watching and if you learned something today think about subscribing it really does help this channel and if you like that one maybe you like this other one i made about five other mistakes you can avoid as a filmmaker that aren't all about audio see ya
