ladies and gentlemen it's currently january of 2024 and the game of chess has never been more popular over the last few years millions of people have either tried the game for the first time or got back into the game after learning it in their youth and in this video i'm going to take us back over 400 years into the early 17th century and we are going to take a deep dive into how the game of chess has evolved since the 1620 is year on the calendar we're going to look at some of the most famous players how they shaped the game how chess openings have evolved and transformed the game playing styles eras of chess and that's basically the entire introduction i hope you enjoy do let me know if you enjoy this type of historical content my friends we will start off with modernday chess genius gino greco from italy now you may ask yourself who on earth is his opponent nn who is nn nn is no name if you look at the historical uh files of the game of chess this is what you will find you will find this is from chessgames.com greco versus unnamed victims in the year 1620 unknown look at look at the number' italy question mark we don't know where this game was played but greco according to modern analysis was a genius greco was one of the early inventors of taking the center greco was one of the early inventors of sacrificing pieces and attacking the opponent's king and back in the day aggressive chess was the norm and in the early stages of modern chess development just two or 300 years ago playing the king's gambit giving up a pawn in front of your king potentially weakening your king to take control of the center was what the players love they love developing they love getting their knights and bishops out and you'll notice that actually in this game andn whoever no name is is playing in a critical way trying to defend the extra pawn trying to attack greco with this move but greco was a monstrous player and uh you know you know now stockfish can demystify the whole thing and say knight here is the best move and you sacrificed the night but greco did it his way he sacrificed the knight like this and as we can see you know the the this didn't exist this evaluation bar uh so i i almost just want to remove it and greco used to just slaughter his opponents swarm them with his queen and his bishop defeating players left and right playing these aggressive openings but this this this guino greco was was a man ahead of his time he was probably the best chest player in the world for like a like that entire period of 100 years in the early uh 17th century uh and he played very aggressively played incredible openings but also he played this opening which is the italian now the italian or the jooo and their names sound similar jano gino they're not the same thing uh the joop piano was actually popularized this move bishop c4 the italian game uh by somebody named pedro damiano who was actually born in portugal in the 15th century so in the like around 1470 this opening taking the center with pawn bishop and knight was invented the beginners watching this might know the fried liver with knight g5 and this and then the traxler which i have videos on and these are all openings that we play now but back in the day none of that was known how incredible is it that this position played apparently in 1620 and even earlier on the calendar is played nowadays all top level chess goes c3 knight f6 attacking this pawn pawn to d3 this is called the joko panimo there's piano which is normal sound and music and there's panimo which is quiet reserved and playing like this folks modern-day chess literally blossomed out of this and 400 years ago they were playing these openings i mean isn't that mindblowing chess is so weird how we just don't even have patches for like hundreds of years but gino greco like i said was a was a man ahead of his time and when his opponents played slightly inaccurately look at look how well he played he developed all of his pieces aggressively and he was a sacrificial beast he loved sacrificing he loved going on big attacks and without the engine to uh you know to to back up the claims you you know it it's uh it's one thing you see the computer is like well listen nothing i'll i'll be able to defend myself you know you're what what a what an idiot you know you're supposed to play a different move here well yeah no no back back in the day they did not know that and greco was a monster look at this allowing his own rook to be trapped in the corner because his attack is actually better than his opponent he allows a queen but he swarms in and uh gets a very nice checkmate knight can't take the queen because it's defended all this pressure but it's incredible how this style of play the italian with two pawns in the center like this taking the center knights and bishops this was played in in 17th century now the next era of chess after the 1600s like the'th century the 1700s 1700 to 1799 um was the early stages of the romantic era the romantic era of chess was born out of openings like the italian it was born out of openings like the kings gambit and the leading player of the'th century was uh franois andre fidor who was french now there were other players as well but fidor arguably was the greatest player of the'th century and um in particular one of the things that that that that philidor did and one of his major contributions was endgame studies before i show you one of his games you say what yeah well back in the day back in the'th century you could invent theory so filor invented the fact that the defending side in a rook and one pawn end game can get the filor position on the third rank of defense you know back in the day black would go here white would do this black would go here white would you know like do this and and then and and then and then lose okay like there you know you you somehow this pawn would promote and then but but but no filor discovered in the'th century that if a pawn hasn't crossed the third rank in a rook and pawn endgame with proper defensive setup you get this and this is called filor position you disallow the king's access and the second that the pawn crosses you go back to the other side you start giving checks that's what the fidor position is and it was based on the work of kan andre fidor it's just unbelievable that in the'th century you could literally pioneer transformational chess theory now this is t in every intermediate and advanced endgame book maybe sometimes to beginners as well now philidor also had an opening he loved to defend his center pawn like this back in the day you could literally invent theory on the second move you could be like yeah i just guard my pawn with d6 and then he would he'd love to play f5 it was like a modern-day vienna many of you know the vienna opening where you attack the center with an f pawn and filor used to do this with both colors he would say it's better to trade off a flank pawn for a center pawn so for example d3 not saying this is what he would do but he loved having two pawns versus one in the center that's the way he would he would change the game he played moves like f5 it's good to trade your king's bishop pawn for a king's pawn because that way you have more control of the center of the board just unbelievable stuff right like this this is the man who was the leading pioneer of chess in the'th century look at this dominant central control strong pieces and then as always back in the day they didn't care about bishop pair nobody cared that one side has two bishops that's a positional style what they tried to do back in the day is attack at all costs and again computer is not always convinced but this is the way chess was in the'th century this is the way you would play it you would sacrifice right pawns are the souls of chess pawns are are the soul of chess is something that filor said and they would just go on these big attacks and then transition the game into an end game and ultimately win it that was chess in the'th century it was romantic it was sacrificing pawns for open lines and in particular the'00s is when all of this skyrocketed in the'00s we had the birth of a new era of romantic chess starting with paul morphe now i will just quickly check in on this uh amazing article that i found on chess.com uh which uh which has like kind of the entire backbone of history of chess uh i will link it in the description if you'd like to read it it's by colin steinski and not stepinsky there we go stepinski beautiful and um in particular paul morphy uh was was kind of the embodiment of rmen anc and aggressive attacking ideas he trounced every major player in the world at the time and in particular in the'00s is when modern chess tournaments were born so players like howard stanton adolf anderson luis paul uh louie paulson as you can see here participated in the first ever chess tournament that was held in'51 the first ever chess tournament was held in'51 they had this genius idea to get a bunch of dudes in a room last time they took a shower or a bath was deb i'm not even sure we had showers in'51 and this is of course the opera game this is a very famous game if you don't know this game after this video go look up the opera game this is a game played by paul morphe and duke carl it's called night at the opera and uh it features tactical aggressive chess threats of checkmate rampant development of all of of all of the pieces sacrifice of the night to open up the black king long castle sacrifice of the rook and then sacrifice of the queen you got to take rook da this is this is called the opera game it's called the night at the opera it's got a lot of very fascinating tactical motifs if you're frustrated because i went through it too fast this is going to be like a 45 minute video probably so i don't want to add another 30 minutes to it but this game has been covered in great detail including on this youtube channel the point is that back in the day this is the way they play chess it was swashbuckling it was sacrificing sometimes it was dangerous and dicey but they didn't have a schmuck ai to tell them that what they were doing was not not correct also around that time all right we had guys like i like i said adolf anderson who played both the immortal game and the evergreen game he started with the king's gambit this is the this is the famous immortal game where he basically sacrificed every single piece to his name they they hated they hated castling back in the in the in the mid 19th century they hated castling they believed in center control quick development trapping their opponent's pieces look at this gambiing a pawn to deflect the bishop on off of the king situation over here this is the way they played this is what they played like i said there was no ai back in the day the games were crazy complicated the computer now says it's equal but back in the day they would sacrifice pieces left and right look at this bullying the black position knight c3 knight d5 he sacrificed his his rook over here he sacrificed the other rook with a check but when the dust settled he found knight takes g7 king slides over sacrificing the queen for a checkmate now you look at these games and you look at chessgames.com you look at some of the historical uh files of the games of chess you you don't quite understand how these things happen because like did they happen in a tournament for example even one move before disaster the position according to stockfish is equal like apparently instead of knight a6 you have to go here because then the king escapes knight g7 king d8 queen f6 like this is all great that's not mate because the king can go there so you know you look at some of these historical games you go wait a minute but he what but it says he could go here like why didn't they see that cuz they i don't know they they were distracted they weren't as good you know that that's just like i really it's fascinating because when you find these games the information for chess just didn't travel chess was kind of this hyper niche activity even in the 19th century until'51 when we started having our first international chess tournaments and we had guys like adolf anderson we had players like paul morphy like i said howard stanton stanton speaking of which stanton the stunt and gambit like this in the dutch we have openings named after all of these players morphy's defense of the lopez e4 e5 knight f3 night c6 we already saw how this opening is played for 400 years morphy's defense targeting the bishop in the spanish an opening that is played all the way up until now right now something changed right after the era of paul morphy and and adolf enderson and i will pop over um to our uh to our other window and i will scroll down a little bit and this is the this is the birth the late 19th century the'80s'90s early 1900s this is the birth of a couple of things number one this is the birth of modern-day world champions chess never had world champions we had a bunch of dudes meeting at a club and they would play and i don't know they'd play for hours i mean they would play for days back then they would seal moves you know nowadays you can't even play a daily game on chess.com without somebody cheating back in the day they would seal moves there was no cheating this was the birth of mod day world champions and in particular positional chess vilhelm steinet was at the forefront and um he had a disdain for overly aggressive play and he would uh accept gambit pawns close the position down and grind out wins he had no equal in the style of positional play and also at the same time uh right around you know the uh when steinitz uh was uh was elevating uh in status so was a grandmas by the name of rather not a grand a very strong chess master by the name of sigbert tarash and tares advocated for a lot of very fascinating things uh right around that time in the early 1900s tares came along steid came along and these players they would they they were very different they were very very different they liked control of the center but they liked bishop pair they would they would trade a knight for a bishop that was the early days of discovering a bishop is worth more than a knight they liked space they believe that the person that has a space advantage and is playing on a side of a board with a space advantage could potentially get a uh a long-term winning opportunity but they went head-to-head with players from the slightly next generation uh which are players like nimich ready uh emanuel lasar so there was a scientific era and a hyper modern era and they clashed that was the the birth of positional chess chess that did not require crazy sacrifices that we could see could be deemed slightly dubious and you say what is what is all that well instead of controlling the center with your pawns what they would like to do is they the the hyper modernists particularly by the name of aaron nich love to control the center with their pieces so players like ready this is called the ready opening you control the center with your with your pieces you don't need pawns in the center for example you control the center with your pieces right you fight for the center from a distance you you don't always need to stuff the center full of two pawns well this was a fascinating game played by two of the leading proponents of these styles nimich was a player that loved to control the center with his pieces tash was a was a player that believed in his methodology and i just found this game very fascinating because you know again we have a we have a mutual control of the center with pawns right we have a queen's gambit queen's gambit became very popular in the early 1900s is when that the players started started using these openings look at this this is nich that's typical nimich putting his bishop over here and by the way look at tarash right so they would they would take from each other they would they would take from each other they would learn from each other very very symmetrical game but as the center opened up you'll notice right tash stops the knight from coming to f5 he doesn't want his opponent to get the bishop pair right very interesting stuff and now takes takes bishop b5 and when the dust settles it's black who has the center and the bishop pair and so black imposed his game plan they they they love this stuff this is exactly what they wanted they love the sniper es bishops the control of the space in the center of the board and then of course they had to play right and black plays this move d4 and then sacrifices the bishop spotting an opportunity that these bishops actually can clos line the king there's no defense bishop takes h2 by tash and then he would get his queen in and he sacrificed the second bishop as well and the thing is if you take you stuff the king back to the h file with a move like you know king h1 and then the rook comes to help and this was how the hypermodern system failed because the hypermodern system the pieces would be stuck back fighting for the center but if you stuff them shut like with pawns you could get attacks like this it's just it's just very interesting like the clash of the styles right you get the bishop pair you get the control of the center of course i'm simpli i'm simplifying a bit yes absolutely but my point stands i'm simplifying a little bit but the point stands this was chess in the early 20th century it was this developing blossoming concept you know of these players like steinet lasar and then of course kaba blanca um and uh let me just show you the conclusion of this game how tash managed to beat nich by swarming him with his uh with his playing sty style hunting his king ruthlessly into the center and look at this look at this sniper set of pieces all squares control the king what a walk of shame ridiculous stuff ridiculous stuff around this time of tarash etc um we we got one of the most dominant chess players of all time we got emanuel lasker now lasar was uh was a german chess master and he was world champion for 27 years he was the world champion the longest reigning world champion to date by the way 27 years now you know back then there might have been 12 chess players it's i'm joking i'm not trying to discredit the accomplishments of uh you know of of of giants but it is interesting he was the world champion for 27 years and he was defeated ultimately by jose raul capablanca from cuba cuba uh excuse me capablanca was despite being world champion for only six years and losing it to alokin who was a genius of dynamic play around that time kabab blanca was deemed the epitome of simple clear-cut positional mastery he avoided tactical situations different to the romantics and would seize a seemingly small advantage that he would convert into the endgame his endgame skill was considered the greatest the world had ever seen frequently when we talk about chess history we say paul morphy would have been 2700 nowadays all these players would have been 2700 kaba blanca is widely said to probably transfer his skill set the most to modern day chess and a great example of this again i'm not going to try to show you these games and excruciating master class level detail but capablanca was a surgeon he was a technician all right and capablanca would play the queen's gambit you'll notice again this style queen's gambit the same thing that nimich played tarash played um one other thing by the way about the queen's gambit just back to that tarash game for a moment one of the openings that tash really liked to play is he liked to do this and many openings are named after tash because tash really liked center control he liked open space for his pieces he didn't like to be cramped that was the scientific school of chess the hyper modern school of chess didn't mind being cramped capablanca was the birth of a more universal anti- tactical player a player that just somehow understood where the pieces are supposed to go to what squares capablanca's playing style you'll notice smooth like butter never complicated takes space with his pawns slides the queen takes more space with his pawns targeting black's knight look at black restricted e5 controlling the night black is stuck on the back ring we're talking about lasker 27 years as world champion look at capablanca transferring the knight onto d6 and kaba blanca once famously said he doesn't need to calculate many many moves ahead which is a misconception of chess players kab blanca said he only sees one move ahead and it's the best move and you'll notice that the control at which this game is is is played is unbelievable just slowly trading off pieces and just maintaining a comfortable advantage according to the computer just a comfortable edge a bishop for a knight straight out of the school of chess of the last 10 15 years pressure targets knight to e4 looking there looking there a weak king the concept of multiple weaknesses was also born around this time h4 taking space potentially away from the black pieces control control poking prodding poking prodding looking for a weakness this is a weakness that's a weakness queen b7 check the king runs queen c8 threatening on the back rank and this game comes to an end in beautiful style as capablanca does find a tactic but it's only one tactic that he needs rook takes h7 his checkmate but it's defended by the knight queen takes f8 and this is the way that capablanca beat the players of the 1920s and 1930s i mean kabab blanca was was was a was a genius he was he was a simple man he played you know he played simple and yet genius chess at the same time it's chess that can only be appreciated and that's chess kind of cooled off for a little bit around'80'90 chess cooled off a little bit we got much more strategic games we got openings that were uh you know combative but but fighting for the center in slightly different uh way for instance let me just open up a separate analysis board we got the hypermodern school right which was which was targeting the center from a distance we got the grunfeld defense which would play like this d5 and later was adapted by by players like kasparov and by fiser so that school of chess developed theory for the next 100 plus years the fact that you could play a game where one side owned the whole central real estate but you would target that center from a distance the bishop pair space advantages pawn play so many things evolved from the hyper modern school of chess and then after players like capablanca alin we got the soviet era school of chess the soviet era school of chess and i mean this this could get a whole video on its own it's worth reading about let us pop over to our to our history books after kabab blanca we had alokin who was a dynamic genius kind of combining turning more into universal positional play with sacrifices with different types of complex openings and pawn structures and then we got soviet dominance from 1927 to 2006 players from the soviet union russia held the world championship title with only two exceptions alin binik smov tal p pan spasi carpov kasparov and kik the most influential chess figure in the world of chess uh influential chess figure in the world of chess my fantastic uh narrating abilities uh and definitely in the soviet sphere is mikel binik binik school of chess he was world champion and uh the binic school of chess inspired some of the greatest players uh that the world has ever known karnick kasparov karpov petan i mean etc etc and um after his long reign as world champion rather i should start here but pheni was known for iron logic and dynamic ability being able to change styles almost like a chameleon this is where the soviet school of chess influenced history forever the soviets in the mid 20th century changed chess from a niche hobby into a profession chess players were athletes sportsmen and women you had to be in good physical shape it had to be your full-time profession there was more money flowing into flowing into some of these championships and that sphere that sphere of dominance winning european tournaments inter zonals uh olympiads left and right different players like different styles as well you know there was the dynamic players like tal the genius but then there was petan ironclad defender all of this contributed to the rise of bobby fiser the soviet dominance of transforming the game into a respectable profession influenced fisher obviously there was cold war there there there was a lot of geopolitical things as well with chess but bobby fiser spawned kind of out of all of that he was the one who in the united states would stand up and play against the soviet chess machine and fiser tried to elevate the game of chess yet again to another level of professionalism and respect and sponsorship and media and he was a star i mean he really was obviously the l the latter part of his career you know it is what it is and and and all and all those things that happened but at the time it was fiser and fiser captivated the entire chess world in 1972 with his match against boris basy in particular this game this match almost never happened you can watch everything you want about 1972 um fiser was the first modern example of [music] a incredible prepper his preparation was unbelievable opening knowledge at this point skyrocketed with the you know the the the advent of uh chess books newspapers research that players did on on each other's openings analysis and and and databases that they were storing of different opening ideas this game played in 1972 by the way remember the capablanca game almost exactly the same yet 50 years apart isn't that fascinating 50 years this exact position holds up the test of time now fiser was known as a dynamic player he played many aggressive openings he was a ferocious calculator he would frequently uh uh he would frequently fight down to the very very very last pieces on the board look at this d tak c5 by the way ab queen a8 the the exact moves of this game are not important i will summarize them like a sports highlight show he got the knight for the bishop bishop is better than knight according to the the shoulders of the giants that these players have stood on right e4 trying to sacrifice a pawn to create pawn islands positional play in you know influenced heavily by late 19th century analysis d4 creating a light squared weakness complex he he played f4 pawn majority now limiting control of the knight movement who did we just see do that kaba blanca kaba blanca did the exact same thing you have a light squared bishop you want pawns on dark squares to complement that bishop bishop c4 queen rotating targeting the weakness that he helped create b3 look how many pawns fiser now combines on light and dark squares ripping open the position dominating the knight seizing the attack with the pass pawn a beautiful universal mix of positional and tactical play limiting black's knights movement completely dominating black's pieces the pawn on e6 a long-term asset and he gets in a4 completely shuts down boris spasy and the way he wins this game he sacrifices his rook and creates a checkmate net around the black king this game was so good boris spasy stood up and applauded i will make a separate video about this game at some point in the future the so chess machine stood up and applauded bobby fiser after this game fiser elevated chess to heights nobody thought was possible in 1972 nobody and from 1972 until around 1996 about 25 years from 1972 until just the end of the century right around 1995 let's say chess became karpov kasparov anand short etc karpov became the world champion in 1975 until he lost it to gary kasparov in 1984 karpov isn't so interested in his own plan but we'll keep on foiling yours carpov was probably the ultimate blossoming of the soviet school of chess he was an unbelievable player he was a he was a uh he was a like a like a like a snake he sucked the life out of you the way he played chess and yet his antithesis was gary kasparov they played five matches against each other from 1984 to 1990 five world championship matches hundreds of games they were the two best players in the world and it wasn't even close and it was not even close sometimes it was like close between third and second maybe there was a good day bad day no and this was the le this was less about the game of chess developing around that time in in in in 1990 1980 it was less about the game of chess and the styles in the era at this point players had styles but they were universal they were universal styles they of course had preferences karpov kasparov is probably the last time there was a very clear clash of styles where a player was a brutal calculator like kaspar kaspar played to win with white and black he didn't defend the way he defended was he tried to attack you that's the way he tried to attack that's the way he tried to defend rather kasparov played aggressive openings he played the sicilian the kings indian defense the grunfeld hyper modern openings born 70 years prior to his title reign so did karpov but carpov played openings that were a bit more solid bit more kind of intuitive and the way kasparov described karpov's play is that karpov ma managed to maximize the effectiveness of every single one of his pieces that's the way he would he would extract maximum value and so these two had a rivalry for 10 years around that time vishi anan from india became the first grandmaster in india nowadays it's up to like a 100 v shan alan completely changed chess in india forever which we will see the effects of in a moment but carpov kasparov was the last time i would say there was a a a a direct confrontation of style and you can kind of see it in this game whenever one of them baited the other into their style of chess kasparov uh that that side usually had the advantage kasparov and karpov played hundreds of games against each other look at this one kasparov played in a way like a waving a flag in front of a bull he loved a fight a fisticuffs type of chess game was everything he wanted and when it exploded it was crazy he would rip open positions he he he would he would jump his look at this he would sacrifice pawns jump his pieces into opponent's territory and he would be down multiple pawns but then he would win one of them back and he would strike from across the board like look at this position this looks like a like a like a modern art painting pieces are standing on edges all over the board they're they're hitting on opposite corners like this this was the type of style that kasparov brought and he struck fear into opponents his his opening preparation at the time was unbelievable but the reason why i say that this era of chess from 1970 to 1996 when when kasparov kind of had his big rise this era of chess was was kasparov's brutal opening preparation mixed with unbelievable tactical and calculation ability unparalleled ability as well in the end games he was a universal player with one really powerful punch which was his ability to calculate absurd attacking concepts is is his level at and that was surreal but now you have this rise of a player that has bulletproof chess openings with white and black ideas that nobody has ever found before because there are no computers coupled with this universal genius style how do you beat a person like that well the only way to beat a person like that my friends is like this gary kasparov would became the first chess player to lose to a computer right 1996 1997 the deep blue match this is when the rise of the chess computers started happening and of course kasparov went on uh to lose his world championship in 2000 to kramnick he uh he lost to krck uh when they played in uh the year 2000 but i'll pause here i don't have to show you any more chess games you say what are you talking about you last that kaspar of carpov game was like in the 90s what do you mean you don't have to show me any more g well kasparov retired from chess in 2005 then chess became a mix of different world champions we can take a look at that world championship list by the way after kasparov retired kramnick was world champion for a bit then it was anand anand took it from karnick anand changed chess completely in india just absolutely just i mean legend is an understatement for who anand is and then it was magnus carlson magnus carlson is the epitome of a universal player but he's very different from kasparov very very different he's not an aggressive tactician trying to completely take the soul of his opponents through attacks he does it with stamina he does it with end games with positional understanding but more than anything else the greatest change to chess from let's say 2000 and up you from like 2000 to 2015 and then maybe in the last like 5 to s years chess has experienced a computer and in particular innovation and information boom back in the 16th and 17th century nobody knew how to play in the 19th century players were getting better and learning a little bit more but so much was barren and unknown and information couldn't travel and there was no ai that could 100% confirm any sort of analysis so analysis was constantly changing at a snail's pace that's the way chess evolved for many many years but now in 2024 chess is so heavily based on computers that it poses an existential threat to the game in classical chess slow chess chess that has played over 3 to four hours chess openings are nearly solved meaning black can face no problems from white you memorize everything and you get a good position and that's that's crazy and the gap between the top players in the world and and the and the weaker players like the top 150 or 200 is closing their openings are on the same level so we speed things up we make them play 15minute chess against each other so you don't have enough time we make them play five minute chess against each other so you can play silly openings openings don't even matter anymore there's no point going for an opening advantage like kasparov did kasparov of new deep ideas in the opening and that's what he would do so much of that is gone now because of the era of information in computers another thing which is fascinating think about how many games are played online at any given moment we never had that before everything played in chess used to be a secret now title tuesday speed chess championship so many of these online events that are getting played even you just playing games online yourself are contributing to the information age of chess it's fascinating but there is good stuff that comes out of it the good stuff is this and this is where i will leave you look at the list of the youngest chess grand masters in the world abanu mishra youngest ever this happened in the last few years ges do maraju is a teenager javir sarav got it at 12 years these are kids becoming grandmas before the age of 13 this is what the age of information and computers does prague became a grandmas as a teenager no beck then we have nei who i think is in his 30s magnus carlson wei teenager sadani seon is like 22 mar andrea mazi from france is like 16 now this is this is a slightly older list so many of these players are from the modern generation some of them are from the older generation but so many of these are from the modern generation you look at the list of the top players in the world i apologize this website doesn't have a dark theme top players in the world ali resa fua just turned 20 i think you know we have kimer who's like'1 19 teenager this guy's young 20 teenager this guy's young so many of these players are breaking in the world's top 10 or 15 the whole thing is changing chess is completely changing and it has changed so much every set of like 50 years we started with non-existence we started with literally there being one or two people on maybe the entire planet who recorded some of these games and they understood chess at a level that that was just otherworldly players like filor who invented endgame theory tarash who invented ed opening ideas anderson and morphe who played some of the most aggressive chess games ever then we had steinitz right we had we had
