my daughters tried the new home theater last night and the reviews are in it's freaking awesome jake check it out i mounted the projector by putting it on a subwoofer box on top of one of the chairs i've got a laptop here with uh the best movie content and the best laptop speaker system and i got around the power outlet and ethernet jack in the middle of the wall by simply projecting onto the right hand side it's basically flawless it looks awful yes so when they watch the second half of the bad guys tonight yeah they're going to be absolutely blown away because today we are going to be putting up the projector screen ceiling mounting the projector and going from laptop speakers to 7.2.4 i think we're missing one pair of the speaker still but 5.2.4 oh and we're going to tell you about our sponsor ow ridge time to ditch that bulky wallet the ridge wallet can hold up to 12 cards comes with a cast strap or money clip and makes a great gift for dad get 15 off until june 8th at ridge.com linus [music] the bad news is we have a lot of work to do today the good news is we have some awesome helpers we've got dan we've got jamie who is actually wearing his old geek squad sweater which i love and they've already done some of the most tedious work for us setting up the projector screen how'd it go it took five hours or something like five hours what the now i gotta ask jake i was in there last night and this projector is so bright that even projecting on a black wall at 50 brightness it's like extremely usable so why did we go with a white screen instead of a gray or or a black screen it's a great question this is the screen they sent when i asked for a screen okay yeah it's a high resolution optimized screen at least this is their 8k model and that basically comes down to the the smoothness and the finish of the uh well the white part which doesn't have to be white but on this one it's white it has a really small frame i'm a little bit surprised at that i guess it gives you a clean look but it also gives you less um tolerance for light spill over the edge but it's like that velour to absorb any extra light and there's even like backlighting although i don't think we're ever going to use that yeah so bias lighting is included as a feature it appears to be rgb it's not like automatic bias lighting oh just wait what backlighting it just looks a color you said it ah okay it comes with a little remote and you can change it whatever color you want otherwise known as we're not gonna plug it in yeah oh okay hey thanks for sticking it on though are you welcome it only took an hour okay should you and i work on speakers while these boys finish up the screen sure sure okay we need to figure out how high the screen's going this is actually very important i hate to be that guy but i think we have to pull the screen in here for me to be able to visualize this there's no way i'm just going to be able to like see it in my mind's eye will you put tape that's probably more work than yeah let's just go get the screen look we have two lovely assistants that can hold it up for us there they are they're so lovely and dan and jamie are here you i'm knighting you night of the tech tips lift up well that's clearly too low yes thanks tips are you feeling that it's a little high yeah it's a little high both down a little how does that feel okay all right top one okay thanks guys wonderful all right we're trying to get all the sawdust off of the speakers i was just blowing it on to you oh thanks here turn around stop the speakers have been in storage for the better part of a year actually but we're finally ready to crack them out and we realized that see jake can you stop what are you trying to talk it's like a child i remember this conversation about the surrounds too and the way that i remember it going was that we thought we were too short but there's actually two speakers per box so we did have the right number no that's not how it went we were just missing a box uh because of some miscommunication i asked for another box and i think maybe they forgot to send it cool so we might just be hanging five for now okay and then we'll add the other ones later i think i'm quite good at blowing question for you how many lunches do you already owe me do you want to bet like two i think do you want to bet lunch that there are four surrounds here i mean i'd like for them to be here sure two lunches the other way so if they aren't here we're back to zero all right okay here they are oh you sucked really you actually suck that's that's scam do i sucker am i a big giant winner you're just a cheater i already emailed that you already knew you suck no i found them just now yeah just now when you were in there it took me like ten seconds screw you you probably put them there no oh i wish we didn't buy such nice speakers because they're so heavy didn't svs send them yeah but still and you just wish we didn't request well i mean i did i do i still remember how james i think was the one who sold me on the cylindrical subwoofers i don't know why based on that they had a smaller footprint by how much though james wait isn't this the okay so it's not much smaller than the sb 2000 which is over there which is just a little sealed subwoofer but if you move up to the ported one it's like right like it's enormous but this is poor this is ported and it doesn't take it basically takes up less floor space in that one dan you want to see some big subs that's a subwoofer no it's more of a super woofer are you insane there's two of them who ordered those i blame jake james actually tell me something okay you're the actual audio nerd dan one of dan's many previous jobs was working in a recording studio that's right what direction does this need to go does it matter it doesn't matter it doesn't matter so it could just point at the wall and we could get that nice clean look yeah the nice thing about subwoofers uh especially ones this size you can really put them anywhere the frequencies that you're gonna get from a subwoofer are like feet i thought that's like a lie though that you can put them just like wherever you want it's not wherever wherever but it's not as critical as like tweeters or whatever else got it okay okay but like yeah maybe it's a little ugly but like kind of me oh you see the woofer on the map maybe it's a little ugly he says for the viewers at home jake's concern is that by the time you put these subwoofers here they could actually impact your ability to see the very corner of the screen depending where in the room you're sitting and also block sound from the tower speakers let's just put them in and see what happens they're only uh they're only like 86 pounds you can hand bomb that yourself right nope nope oh you're gonna give me the sign yeah remember carrying the couch upstairs when you almost killed me that was fun yeah oh god oh you're getting crushed oh my butthole oh remember how we gave that couch to my in-laws and didn't even use it he doesn't know about that yet ah no [laughter] now i have the power oh jesus oh yes the speaker grills i can't wait to throw these away the tweeter has a mesh thing you can't poke it please don't can you stop it's not like a dome it's like child sees it child immediately starts poking at it gorgeous we mapped out the external of the screen it's true we did that we've got our cleat location and i guess we'll start drilling holes in the wall hey david hi it's real talk with dan and jamie uh real talk dan put it against the wall look hey we used a stud finder and look how much much of a stud it misses it misses all of them so our studs are here and here and the holes are not on top of those so guess what we get to do make new holes i guess i don't know yay yay oh anyway that's your update goodbye everyone you just trying to plan this out yeah i remember these speakers are kind of confusing because there's actually a couple different ways you can hook them up either right but you can have them act as two independent speakers or you can have them act as a single one and then it doesn't you position it like kind of back here and then one speaker will bounce off the back to give you like phantom surround backs yeah but they're real um and then this would act as your just your surround right but if you don't do that you're supposed to just point them like wood part out yeah kind of so weird to me had we given any thought to how to mount these at all do we have like walls so they come with little cleats and then you put feet on the bottom so they're slightly off space from the wall yeah and then they have fancy really low profile cables oh um but we still should probably put them just above these plates yeah yeah that was i think the idea like right here-ish and then there'll be a little banana plug thing here and the two banana plugs will go in and they'll go into there okay the actual speakers on the top are above this for the most part cause you're gonna be a little bit higher back there yep i'll be right about i'll be right about here i think it's fine yeah david was just doing a voice for the people in the comments that are gonna say i'm actually how it should be uh we know okay we know the center channel should go behind the screen but we aren't going to do that oh yeah where's the center channel gonna go just plonked we were talking about the cleats to mount the speakers so pretty there is this it yeah one for each speaker that holds up the whole speaker yeah and then there's little feet on the bottom that kind of like brace it off against the wall probably like that and then you see there's little like things on the side so that you have to put it right in the middle you can't slide it back and forth perfect very smart i'm looking into how we're going to mount these now um drywall anchors yeah yeah we have toggles too which are like beefy drywall angles and honestly like the way these are going to hang off the drywall i think regular anchors i have good anchors i'll go get my anchors i'll show them to you show me your anchors you shouldn't look directly into the laser level right uh too late on that one for me oh okay how's uh i can't see anything you can't oh okay i don't think there's any room in this house that i am more excited for like my last house was honestly perfect i could have stayed there forever but the one thing that i was always like vaughn you know man i really want a theater room i want a basement with a cedar room and this projector is so awesome what the was that that's the center piece of the screen okay it's only a little bent you know jake what i think we had accounted for the screen being higher because there's not really room for the center channel there yeah that totally is it's not that tall not in also being able to lift up the stage our one concern about the height right now is that the center channel is basically going to make it impossible to open these up any higher than about like this i like the height though yeah i don't really want to mess with it can you show me how high you can lift up this stage oh that's enough to be able to cable totally i'm over it yup i'm completely over it it'll sit here for now while we get a wall mount this is cool we've actually got each of our speaker locations wired up twice and this ended up being a miscommunication with the low voltage people but it worked out really well because they're wired up once and this is with four conductors so i guess we could buy amp them or run them in duet mode if we really wanted to that's going to this closet right here so you can have your receiver there with your connections to all your subwoofers and speakers and you got ethernet and power and all that good stuff in there and then it's actually wired up again with just two conductors to the mechanical room so if we wanted to rack mount everything in a completely separate room for perfect silence that could also be done technically um these are just random wood screws not the ones yeah um but it seems like yeah it'll thread in there and actually the way that these plastic ones flare out it just breaks off anyways so it should be fine yeah it should be it should operate pretty much the same way it's supposed to and if it doesn't we're gonna find that out really quickly yeah it wouldn't be the first thing that fell off the wall today the bar fell out again what yeah it's really bent now there's no way to retain it in the screen then the thing is that jamie tells me the bar is really just to stop the screening from like coming in and out uh-huh yeah it's just to keep it the fabric a little bit more rigid well we should still put it back in big moment time here we go big moment energy yeah it's really tight those screws oh uh you got to go over a little bit give it a little wiggle wiggle oh baby okay we're back from lunch and i think the plan is that i'm gonna finish up the last three speakers and uh the professionals here are gonna start figuring out the professional mount the projector sure according to this thing we have to start with the scary part which is drilling a hole in the ceiling uh-oh you guys excited no oh when you have a projector like the ls 12000 which has a optical zoom you can kind of position the projector wherever you want but there is a minimum distance and if you go within that it's not going to fill the whole screen now ideally we put it exactly at the minimum distance because then we don't have to use the zoom which means we get the most amount of light right but we also have like very ample light for a light controlled environment yeah so we'll probably put it you know six inches past something like that cool but we do kind of need to see how this goes together before we can drill the hole this is the epson screen calculator thing you basically punch in what projector you have uh tell it what size screen you have and the aspect ratio and it tells you your usable throw distances so our minimum is around 142 inches which is just just under 12 feet so i'm thinking we're going to try to mount it around 12 feet 6 inches or so just to give ourselves a little bit of wiggle room then we'll use a tiny bit of zoom but not enough that it's going to impact our light output by any amount that we'll be able to tell cool wow holy crap we are very far so this is like 14 feet the issue is just that this is where our access panel is for hdmi and power so unless we want to have wires running across the ceiling like that also it gets the fan from the projector closer to the front primo seats i did tell the contractors 12 to 13 feet and this is like 16. whatever i mean you don't want to see the projector either though so i i i get it black yeah i want to see that all right we're just going to put it like here-ish wherever the stud is yeah okay cool wow that's like actually pretty nice we've got a knob there to hold it on and another one this side to lock it in there and it's threaded as well all this is metal this is a really good mount that's amazing the way i had envisioned this was that we were gonna have like shelves for them to sit on because i'm an idiot so this is way better once that plate's in there and it's just like banana plugged in it's gonna look so clean hopefully these screws are going to be tight enough so this won't fall on linus's kids what nothing jesus christ dan that's dark if anybody is bored we could go get the receiver oh yeah look at that trick well the issue is that it only has a single uh 4k 120hz input or is it a single or a dual i don't i don't remember the point is there's much lower end models that cost like half as much that are more functional for what i would need and i think that by the time that room reaches its final form this will have been replaced by an hdmi matrix switcher and some other amplification solution and this will be completely utterly irrelevant sounds about right it looks pretty though okay you want to grab the side i'll try oh my god the stud is like here so i could have it here yeah and the projector would come back to like there and then there'd be kind of a jump that's fine or the next option is like racing no no no no okay so let's put it on this one yeah i picked up an nvidia shield tv pro as well i have the regular shield tv but i'm gonna put that somewhere else because if there's anywhere that we're gonna want 4k upscaling in the theater room it's going to be the place ah and no offense to what is it denon or whatever yeah no offense but nvidia's ai up scaling is probably better than whatever crap you're doing and then for the pc this is our original founders 3080 that i like temporarily took to put in my vr gaming rig as like a troubleshooting thing and then never brought back to the office so oop sorry about that it's the last scary thing we're drilling in the projector mount oh i hope i don't hit anything [music] oh i definitely hit a stud that's good oh god i mean that's not really going to do anything but screw it whatever hey david david do you like my computer chair get it it's a computer and it's a chair okay oh my gosh we're gonna gaslight jamie he had to stop and take a leak and he put this outside the bathroom door so when he comes back everyone just be like no i don't know what you're talking about are you coming back are you going to come back with sockets at some point they disappear what well where'd you put them is there any other sockets anywhere no i only have the one wait well did you get did you get like my sockets like did you get the ones in the in the drawer yeah well where are you like there's no one else here they didn't spring legs and just screw off i i believe you because i moved them [laughter] god you suck how much would you tow these in dan who's your main where are you gonna sit david where david is yeah point it at his left ear oh that's looks gonna look so stupid though yeah so point it like point it like most of the way to his left ear we got power in here we got a projector on the ceiling what else is going on here oh wow that is very not straight there's a lot of hdmi cable in here jake where is ron expecting us to okay well there exactly right there okay display side good he ran it the right way they're directional this is an optical hdmi cable which means that it's got to go well one way and this is the correct way we had three power cables and it probably doesn't matter but the thicker ones we definitely used for the subs they can drop to 1500 watts each at peak which is why this room has so many freaking circuits in it each of those subwoofers is plugged into a duplex receptacle that has its own dedicated circuit i believe this is a dedicated circuit to the projector up here because there can be pretty power hungry projectors this one will do like 300 watts or so yeah um and then i forget where the other circuits are in here i believe there's a dedicated two to that closet for just you know receivers and gaming pcs and xboxes and all that kind of stuff and we are powered up ladies and gentlemen where is the remote i don't think that thing's powered dude the circuit in the ceiling is off we figured out the problem the projector shares a circuit with this boy which is wow you're just gonna grab it i didn't even say i turned it off yet yeah i know it's off it's already off it was on it was on it was on yeah it's off now it's awful anyway this boy is power for the stage which the back row is going to sit on it's going to be about 12 13 inches high and it will have power inside it for the powered seats um well as you can see it's just bare freaking wires so having that circuit on is pretty dangerous but what we can do is we can just uh where'd my strippers go yeah we can just cap it off and then we should be good to go it's not like there'll be kids in here or anything cool let's go flip that switch back on watch that light on fire now much safer wait are we are we doing it i just pressed the button oh god this is not just a second hold on there's a plan i need to do a teddy bear stand okay so just go um maybe it's initial all settings this is actually a way smarter way to do this there we go okay okay see you later hey okay front front ceiling oh my gosh hey here we go wait this is that stupid audiophile grade switch yeah we've got a video coming about this ladies and gentlemen the worst part it's just up to 2 000 megabits per port like it's not wrong but oh my god is that the most misleading thing i've ever super misleading oh it actually like yes it's full duplex yes technically you can send a gigabit each way but that's not how anybody else interprets talks about it yeah looks pretty bright hey yeah well not with the lights on this is that 50 brightness 50 oh my god oh my god that's way more than necessary oh my god the lights are on oh my gosh and the window is open this microphone is so that the receiver can automatically calibrate for the room that it's set up in so what we do is we take it and we put it right on jake's face right here because that's the listening position sorry jake just one second you just kind of hold still for a second oh the fact he's got a defective face sorry defective face we're gonna have to put it here that's kind of that's kind of centered enough well they do boring software configuration stuff in here that you can actually check out in the previous video david and i are going to grab an ltt hoodie so we don't get cold and we're going to head outside oh right indoor hoodie lttstore.com we're not promoting this one right now though because we're out of stock so buy a win hoodie or a swag kit in the longer term i think a wooden shutter of some sort is going to be the solution to completely blocking light at that window but for the time being ah we've got a handful of options we've got this duvetyne which is like a heavy light control fabric that we use for filming we've got ram board which is just basically rolled cardboard we've got garbage bags david and i are going to go see what our options look like and figure out what works i'd say the most temporary solution is definitely the ram board why don't we try it let's see if we can get a good light seal and if we can then maybe we'll just go with that i don't really want to chuck some of our duvetyne outside ah oh no did i go wide enough uh oh david did i go wide enough yeah this is really not ideal what i'm doing here how darkened do you think this probably is all right this worked pretty well though yeah there's a gap there oh it's not bad though you what are you gonna go fix it yeah i'm gonna fix it here hold on before he's gonna do the duvet before you go center channel front right it's around right let's round back right so round back left surround a lot of speakers wow hey look you wanna hear some gloves okay that's enough webs i think everybody shut up jamie you sitting yep david doesn't know situation dude we have the plastic covers on the grills for the ceiling speakers so it completely screwed the calibration we could just like shout out svs right now this is this is their ultra 5.1 setup then we've got their pc pc2000 subwoofers and the in ceilings are from clips these are rpc'0'0i or something like that these things sound great like compared to my old sonos setup just all of these speakers amazing oh my god these seats have memory shut up i don't know how you said it but i just clicked that button and it just okay like i go to a different position and click eye again shout out valencia thank you these theater seats are actually incredible yeah first thing our contractor said when he came in here he was just like coming in to check out what we were working on he's like i don't know how i'm gonna get back up from this chair we take our reactions very seriously we've all like actually not experienced this yet okay you guys ready for some sound demos actually the center channel down there is like fine that's fine it does a really good job of putting it in front of you who's around you in three-dimensional space with breathtaking audio quality the sub the subs need to be more brings the on-screen action alive i mean this demo really is not very impressive right now with the lights on it still looks pretty good it's very usable this is like what i'm used to with most projectors you know like the audio oh man i really i feel like i'm in a movie theater right now oh me too it's like like it's full it's not okay the top channels that's pretty cool [music] this is a cool demo i'm gonna turn it down a tiny bit yeah [music] wow dude is this a tv or is this a projector i would have a hard time telling you really hard time in this environment for real though like holy oh my god my mind is just blown right now like look at the blacks that's pretty good man i can't believe this projector i know it's still a lot of money but i can't believe this only costs five thousand dollars i gotta be honest guys this is like uh this is like uh i made it moment i have wanted a home theater for so long this is legitimately a dream come true moment for me right now so this is where you get to a point where you might want to tweak the hdr on the projector a little bit but uh yeah still the amount of detail in the shadows crazy pitch oh boy you know how you were talking about that uh how you can have like projector screens that automatically aspect ratio control okay we could do a poor man's version of that we just have a couple little motors and just like uh like a duvetyne or a velvet thing that just goes and so you don't get that spell that's basically what the fancy ones do oh really oh i would have thought they would like extend or something i don't know i'm pretty sure it's just a curtain that covers the front i'm willing to bet if your name is mark zuckerberg there's one that like freaking reconfigures on its own mind you probably have a wall at that point yeah but i mean like they literally it's just like a curtain that covers part of the screen oh okay yeah well then yeah we could totally do that i think we could like diy that yeah just like we're gonna diy this segue to our sponsor
