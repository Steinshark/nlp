i'm a sucker for timeless advice especially when it applies to my filmmaking career there's nothing better than a good motivational quote or idea that helps you push through a creative roadblock or keep working on your film when all you want to do is quit and there's not a lot more timeless than philosophy ideas that have lasted and worked for thousands of years that have gone through wars and the fall of civilizations and are still being talked about today are worth listening to if you're into self-development and on youtube chances are you might have heard of ryan holiday he's on podcasts all over the place he's got a big social media presence and he's written a bunch of books on how stoic philosophy applies to life in the modern world the other day i stumbled onto one of ryan's videos that i'll link to in the description and realize hey this is amazing advice for filmmakers so in this video i'm going to cover seven ideas from stoic philosophy and how these 2 thousand year old concepts can help you as a filmmaker hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsyth and on this channel i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer i took philosophy 101 as a mandatory elective in my first year of school and to be honest i don't really remember much of it i remember the names of some of the guys but apart from one or two i pretty much have no memory of what they talked about the writing style was dry and out of date and when you're 19 years old it's really hard to care about confusing books translated badly from german but that doesn't mean the ideas weren't amazing it's just that the presentation wasn't right for the audience and that's what's so good about ryan holiday he takes philosophy from the source and presents it in a way that's easy to read and applicable to the modern world and when you dust off the language a bit you can see that these ideas are just as relevant now as they were when they were written so let's get right into it ryan kicks his video off with an absolute gem that i think is often really underestimated in the filmmaking world when you're starting out in your career you might look at some of your favorite movies and think that they were created in a couple massive bursts of output like they just exploded into existence or something but the truth is that most big projects in the world got done because of a little bit of consistent effort over time and that's point number one everything worth doing is the result of a bunch of baby steps more than big exciting jumps in my experience it took me almost two years of shooting photos six days a week before i got my first real paying assignment and as i try to grow this youtube channel the only way to make it work is to put out one video a week every week for years there might be a couple overnight success examples out there but the majority of us need to push the ball forward slowly and the way to do that without burning out is with a little bit of effort every day so if you want access to a tough location make three phone calls a day for a month until something works if you're trying to write a script don't try and get it finished overnight write 500 words a day until it's done if you want to get your short doc into film festivals but feel intimidated by how many there are start by applying to one a day so many people see the final goal and it's so overwhelming they don't get started real pros see the project as a series of tiny steps and they just tackle them one by one it might take months or years but if you're consistent it'll work okay moving on pretty much all filmmakers these days are freelancers there might be a handful of people out there working as in-house videographers for companies or our staff at a big website or something but most of us are working for ourselves that might terrify some people out there but for me it's one of the best things about this job i love being in control of my time even though i sometimes go a bit crazy when i go through a dry spell there are even times when i get super frustrated and think about applying for a real job but when i realized that it would mean giving up control of my time i usually drop it and that's the next stoic idea holiday brings up your independence is everything if you're a freelance filmmaker or thinking about becoming one your independence is one of the most important things to protect i don't think the stoics meant that you could never work for other people or that kind of independence i think they meant that you can't let the job own you or your time unless it's on your own terms you need to be filming your documentary or editing your short film or growing your youtube channel because you want to not because you have to at the same time you can't let your filmmaking career totally take over your life either because otherwise you'll burn out and you'll have to stop doing it keep your independence in your life and don't get owned by anything filmmaking included alright this third point really hit home with me because it's been so true in my own life and that's really that you have to have daily routines routines help you to attack those goals in small pieces just like we talked about in the first point and without them i think i would find it really hard to be creative there's this quote from the writer somerset von great name by the way why don't we have more kids named summerset these days that goes i only write when inspiration strikes fortunately it strikes every day at 9 00 am he sat down at his desk every day at the same time and that's how he wrote books it wasn't by getting up at noon or writing some days and skipping others a routine will keep you on track so you can chip away at those goals and it totally applies to filmmaking too for me this has been a hundred percent true and i'm not talking about when i'm shooting because when i'm shooting everything goes out the window and you just have to hold on for dear life most of the time i'm talking about the time between jobs when you wake up in the morning and there is no one telling you to work on your film that's when you need routines when i'm not shooting pretty much from the first day i get home i start doing the same thing every day until it's time to go back to work that means i set an alarm read for an hour go to a coffee shop to write do some sort of exercise then work on youtube videos in the afternoon i mean i don't quite plan my days out to the minute but i generally do things at roughly the same times in the same places it's sometimes the only thing that keeps me sane during slow times and without routines i doubt i've made it this long okay so you've got your routine all set and you've got a great idea for a documentary but instead of making some calls to arrange an interview or just grabbing your camera and going you decide you'll get started tomorrow or next week what that probably means is never apparently the stoics hated this kind of behavior and holiday's fifth idea is simple do things now don't put them off do them now while you can tomorrow or next week or next year none of that time is guaranteed you could have a baby or get in a car accident not that i want that i love you all but to think that your guaranteed future time is arrogant in the minds of the stoics when you hang around filmmaking communities it seems like everyone has an idea they're working on something that's going to be a huge hit once they're finally able to start working on it you guessed it later but the people who actually make their projects are the ones who don't put it off but just get started so don't wait until tomorrow start making calls right now the only way anything will happen is if you start the next point holiday makes is really more of a question and i think it's one we should ask ourselves as filmmakers and that's have you done the work if you've ever been feeling bad about where your career is at or why you haven't gotten that vimeo staff pick or why no one's calling you for international assignments the first thing you should ask yourself is have i done the work if i look at my own career i got started in the documentary industry pretty late i was already pretty close to 30. and when i got my first real production job it was for national geographic which i don't think is most people's starting point it could easily seem like i was an overnight success but the reality is i spent five years working as a professional photojournalist and four years before that traveling and working internationally so when i finally got the chance to jump on that crew even though i hadn't shot a lot of tv i was ready i'd put in the work whatever you're going after if it isn't working that's a real question you need to ask yourself have you really done the work and tried everything you can to get access to your story have you really tried your hardest to get out and shoot in the nicest light have you taken your camera day after day for years even though no one's paying you in my experience things only happen for people who put in the work the sixth point here starts out with the story about marcus aurelius who was one of the emperors of rome and by all accounts one of the better ones marcus aurelius was groomed from the time he was a little kid to be the emperor of rome and he spent every day in training for when it was time to replace the old one but the old emperor lived for a full 25 years longer than anyone expected and marcus had to wait the whole time just putting in the work every day until it was his turn it's always going to take longer than you think your filmmaking career is going to be the same it's going to take a long time much longer than you wanted to probably when i was first learning photojournalism my mentor told me that if i wasn't prepared to work full-time for five years without making any money i should look for something else to do in the end it only took three but i was prepared for the full five whatever you want to do write direct dp it's gonna take longer than you think so be in it for the long haul the last one is less about being productive and more about learning when to slow down according to the stoics you have to make time for stillness in your life and i think that's especially true today we're constantly plugged into our phones and there's information coming at us way faster than our monkey brains are built to handle you need to make time to slow down and think or you'll burn out yes you need to be productive yes you need to work but you also have to balance that with stillness this has definitely been true for me in my career and some of my best ideas have come to me when i'm on a long walk it's why you come up with a project idea in the shower or the solution to your edit while driving on the highway your mind needs space to breathe in order to be creative and that doesn't mean watching a full season of ozark on netflix go for walks meditate or just sit there and think with all your screens off you seriously need it that's it seven tips from the stoics via ryan holiday that are just so relevant to filmmaking i had to share big respect to ryan for what he does and i'll link to his channel and the video that this was based on in the description if you can find a way to incorporate these seven things in your life you'll be amazed what it does for your life and career thanks for watching that one
