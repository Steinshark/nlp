you could buy a zenbook duo a super cool dual screen laptop or for a third of the price you could buy the curry lander we found this gem on aliexpress and for 750 dollars it looks absolutely outstanding i'm talking eight core cpu qhd screen second screen and ah quick shipping i mean with excellent reviews and specs like that what could go wrong unless they lied freelander wouldn't lie no i would never lie to you about our sponsor build redux takes the challenge and the hassle out of building your own pc with configuration options support guides to adu and competitive pricing versus building a pc yourself why not kick your feet up and let build redux handle it for you head to build redux.com linus and start your new build today between the intro alex put together and my own first impressions i've got to say my expectations are actually really high there are some weird things is this a windows key for example i think it might be and is that an upside down hdmi port but the rest of the i o actually looks really good we've got two usb 3 super speed over here headphone microphone combo jack rj45 jack and then over on this side more type a a type c and a dc barrel plug for charging then things get really interesting at the back we've got an external pci express connection the only devices i've seen this on are an msi laptop from way back in the day that had a proprietary dock and then asus has a line up the g14 that has an external pcie thing but it's not quite like this i actually have no clue what this is at all it mentions it know where any of the documentation and i never turned it around while i was testing it even the website does not have pictures of the bag nothing oh they have pictures of the back it's not there i guess it shouldn't surprise me that much given that freelander is probably best known for its led backpacks but given that this has no branding on it whatsoever i guess they're just branching out into taking some other laptop from some oem and selling it and hoping for the best oh man this is really hard to peel oh interesting it has a hinge that lifts the bottom display up to a more ergonomic viewing angle like the newer zenbooks do this is an older one from 2019 it also has a very similar keyboard and touchpad layout i wouldn't describe the build quality as perfect or even as as good as the asus version of the zenbook but it's not bad 750 bucks yeah i keep waiting for the other shoe to drop here but then i keep noticing more and more things that i love about this is this is 16x10 display yep that is sick uh does it work yeah oh oh it's on it's on it's on okay creelander my bitter backpack competitor i wouldn't say they've done a great job of matching the brightness of the top and bottom display a big part of that is the kind of weak viewing angles on the bottom one you can see it dims quite a lot i mean asus is hardly perfect either but that seems to be more due to uh like an anti-glare coating on the bottom one and less due to uh just poor viewing angles but the touchpad works with no obvious issues gestures seem to do about what you'd expect them to do and by golly there's two displays okay well while you're here while you're here oh that resolution is not what they said it was though yeah on the product page they say it's a qhd panel that's 90 hertz what are you seeing here linus i'm seeing a 1900 by 1200 display and if this is 90 hertz i will throw up my breakfast and eat it again it's not and you cannot set it to 90 hertz oh but you can set it to exactly 60. oh good definitely some rattle to the track pad oh that's why you wanted me to check out the keyboard this was not obvious to me when i first looked at it but that's where the backspace goes it's the power button what a disastrous design decision who could possibly think that you should put the power button where the backspace is even if you owned this computer and built muscle memory around that the second you went and used some other keyboard because that happens from time to time you would be so like to come back to this thing and accidentally to put it to sleep that's not even the best part oh no can you give me an uppercase a [applause] those of you who spotted it before i did you've had more time to think about it why would they make the right shift a delete key there's no right shift key that's not even like oh we had a chinese layout or uh european layout that no layout is like that it's a crying shame because that's a deal breaker why would you do that this keyboard is a catastrophe a type just just reviewed the tommy hilfiger keyboard why do you keep doing this to me alex i think what i want to know is if this thing is full of fast computer or if it's full of lies why don't we dig into hardware info what are we supposed to have a 10th generation core i7 processor with powerful performance max turbo of 5 gigahertz and eight cores wait this is not an 8 core cpu at all this is a completely different thing hold on a second they're half right they're half right they've got the model number right but then they lie about the actual specs of that model so unless you go on intel arc and make darn good and sure what the specs of this processor are well what's the max turbo on this thing even it is five gigahertz it is five gigahertz but it has two fewer cores i take the two cores for sure that is freaking slow memory too 2400 megahertz that's like fine for ddr4 wait except that they say it's supposed to be 29.33 oh no and i'm supposed to have a terabyte of space aren't i uh 512. 512. hey they managed to get that right but i have never heard of hear reality before what kind of ssd is that oh wait so in this it shows up as one yeah the hx-001 dual drive yeah so there's no this is only one dread they partitioned it what is with this the other aliexpress computer we looked at recently also had a partitioned boot drive why i actually have no idea for that one the only explanation i can think of is you got people designing these things that are so old school that they remember the days when we used to short stroke hard drives so you would partition them smaller so that you would only use the outer edge of the disc which is which is faster on an ssd it makes no difference oh man this system is kind of stressing me out alex do remember you have a 10th gen i7 and a 750 laptop it's sex cores it's like actually not bad and 16 gigs of ram for better for worse and 512 gigs of ssd even if i don't recognize the brand one thing they did get really right though 95 watt power adapter this thing charges it super fast all right let's send a bench it nothing here stands out is particularly bad though i wouldn't expect it to i mean this is only what like a 35 watt cpu and it looks like it's got plenty of cooling in it quiet too actually they do say that they have their aas plus wind tunnel technology the ass plus wind that's wonderful but have you noticed anything kind of disappointing about this though oh wait no cpu package power 32 watts that's about right for an h series isn't it it is but it's not turboing it's not turboing it's at 2.6 gigahertz which is the base essentially all the time when you hit it with any load so like this guy right here this is probably also 10th gen 9th gen actually oh and it runs circles around it doesn't it we'll see in a second here but this got 8 100 points in cinebench or 23. i ended up with 5100 points the bit that kills me is that it's so well cooled that they very easily if they just program the bios better could have had a boost for way longer and it would have been probably like really 30 40 faster i even took the time to like install xtu and try and do some stuff none of it took i don't have the testing tools here they're all over at the lab right now i give you my personal linus tech tips guarantee that that is not 400 nits i went to the labs though do you want to see the results of the screens i i would love to see the results were they 100 coverage of the rgb color space srgb rgb 311 nits all right my eyes still work holy crap 63 coverage of srgb i know that not everyone is an expert on all the dci p3s and rgbs and srgbs so let me just put it this way for you guys that is dog crap i don't remember the last time i saw a display that bad i do it was the acer nitro 5 their first gen that was when i first started working here like six years ago with the tn panel it gets better though it gets better though oh my god it improves or it gets funnier both the bottom screen manages to do 100 of srgb okay and actually brandon from the lab seems to think it may be using the same bottom screen as asus's zenbook duos might explain why they weren't able to cheap out on it yeah like you can see the spectroscopy here yeah it's identical it's the same thing so they use the exact same panel from asus for the bottom and then just completely cheap out on the top it's 750 though so what you can do line is yes so you take your video that you're editing and you put it on the color accurate display down on the bottom and then you have the most room anyone's ever had for your timeline up on the other screen and everything is working against this thing the slow ram impedes the onboard gpu from performing its best and then the crappy turbo frequencies on the cpu mean that you're going to run into cpu bottlenecks ironically are we done with the windows experience oh no i want to try the webcam even on expensive laptops the webcam tends to be where brands cheap out and this is a potato and a half what resolution does this claim to be well they don't mention the webcam they don't mention the webcam if i were them i wouldn't mention it either but it has a nice bright indicator that it's working just for comparison here's the hp dragonfly i mean it's not great either this is one of the best webcams on a laptop linus now it's time to open it up and see what makes it tick yep all right let's do it you know what i'm kind of wondering right now is if this is on clearance on aliexpress this should not be a 750 machine even with the shortcuts that we see it is on sale so the normal price of this would be well this is canadian so 1600 canadian now it's a thousand canadian here's yet another thing the hardware folks did right look at this two screws no easily breakable clips nice easy access not just to the memory but to the storage as well love to see it and it gets even better there's another m.2 slot in here that appears to be nvme so it's just cheaped out on the drive how much cheaper is a sata ssd these days i mean we are talking pennies and on the subject of saving money the 2400 megahertz ram is not because they were saving money it's because they didn't program the bios properly this is 266 memory which isn't as fast as they advertise but is better than what it's running at all right that is a heck of a lot of cooling for this cpu they probably could have gotten away with just one of these i'm really surprised that they actually put in two i was expecting to only see one of these oh just you thought the fan would just be i thought this was just like mesh or something over here to make it look like there was heat sink yeah heat pipes are expensive that's not an insignificant cost for a budget machine like this which again leads me to believe that this was not intended to be a budget machine i think it's just ancient stock that they are desperately trying to get rid of yeah even the battery would indicate this is not a budget machine that's a 58 watt hour battery yeah i got over four hours of battery life which isn't incredible yeah but also like i was expecting way worse i thought it would be like a 25 watt hour or something it gets pretty decent at least that's what is written on it based on that everything else about this thing has been a lie it's possible that that is not in fact 58 watt hours beak says it's 51 and i tend to trust them because they got everything else right but either way for something like this that's quite a bit of battery okay fair i was genuinely excited for this linus i looked at the specs and the price and i was like that's legit you could even ignore that bottom screen completely ignore it and this thing would be freaking amazing on paper yeah maybe it makes up for it in some other way let's try out the speakers i'm sure those are great they're not very loud pretty quiet i've heard way worse yeah like a lot of them will take speakers like this make it twice as loud and just distort the whole thing not bad not bad they're fine [music] yes yes yes yes it costs five times as much it costs five times as much alex just like this message from our sponsor
