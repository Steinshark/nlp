after 10 days of construction our brand new emc chamber is done i can't wait to show this to you guys watch this here's all the wireless networks that are around here they just closed the door behind us but it takes about five seconds for your phone to go oh no actually i can't see any of those anymore and then maybe a couple more seconds and it's gonna go ha i got absolutely nothing zip zilch nada this is going to open up a whole new world of testing that would have been completely impossible for us before like how good is the reception on the latest iphone is your new tv making your controllers disconnect is your isp provided wi-fi router really so bad you have to replace it with one of these but wait a second you might think why would you spend weeks and thousands of dollars building this when you could just follow this simple guide from frank tifano on building a wi-fi blocking sleep thing and just do all your testing in there and the thing is you're not entirely wrong i mean in science class we all learned that to block electromagnetic waves it's as simple as wrapping an object or a space in conductive material grounding it and you got a faraday cage it's essentially what this is but watch this if i stick this tiny wire through this hole i'm going to go from minus 130 db to more like minus 70. how is that even possible the door's still closed i'm still inside a faraday cage well here's the thing while every electromagnetically shielded enclosure is a faraday cage not every faraday cage is a shielded enclosure and depending on the purpose of the cage there are numerous design considerations that must be accounted for let's say the purpose of our cage was to protect an occupant from a lightning strike well a grounded box made of chain link fence would do the job nicely but the radio waves that we rely on for cellular signals wi-fi and bluetooth they would have no trouble at all passing through that and the higher the frequency or the shorter the wavelength of these signals the more challenging they are to block and we saw this in action back when we bought those silly radiation blocking wi-fi router enclosures on amazon even though they used a relatively fine mesh and they did reduce our signal strength they still allowed our wi-fi to function meaning that a ton of emf was still getting through in that case that was a good thing because a wi-fi router with no signal at all wouldn't be very useful but for an emc chamber any leakage from the noisy environment around it is going to completely invalidate our test results thankfully our unit isn't cobbled together out of office paper holders but rather was installed personally by the owner of raymond emc whose encyclopedic knowledge of these things has been incredible helping us learn why sorry prepper youtube building a proper shielded test chamber is a lot more complicated than this or this or this or this segue to our sponsor raymond emc i actually didn't know at the time that i was filming it that they sponsored this video by giving us the whole rf chamber and they didn't mention that when i was talking to them whatever it doesn't matter the point is they did so make extra sure to go and check them out after this video if you need a shielded enclosure and a collect chamber or a shielded tent the point of my wire in the hole demo was to show you guys that when you want to eliminate back round electromagnetic interference the devil's in the details i mean sure any piece of metal that stands in its way can be a barrier for an electromagnetic wave that's why we always recommend placing your wireless router away from metal objects because the wave strikes them a current is induced and the wave ends up more canceled than kanye west the tricky part is that if you want to get all of them the electrical charge of the entire enclosure needs to be homogeneous aka there can be no holes or cracks that means that this tinfoil hat then is only marginally more useful for blocking electromagnetic waves than this regular one from lttstore.com and only one of its problems is that it's not grounded so then shielded enclosure step one is connecting it to ground but even that is easier said than done for starters i was two weeks ago old when i found out that our floor in here simply isn't flat enough shocking so we needed to pour a thin concrete slab on top of that is a six millimeter poly vapor barrier and then we get into the the real news starting with a 1 8 inch masonite board that acts as an electrical insulator between the enclosure itself and the floor then from the enclosure we connect the single point ground stud directly to the ground of our electrical panel which wait a minute why do we care about insulating the chamber if we're just going to ground it anyway ah if we let the enclosure touch the concrete directly we could end up with multiple paths to ground that could cause eddy currents and turn the entire enclosure into an antenna which obviously not ideal from there the enclosure is basically a box made of wood panels with steel sheet on either side but joining them together is more complicated than it looks every single one of these screws needs to be torqued exactly to spec and if it isn't the minute gaps between threads can be a path for electromagnetic waves to get through and this is not just theoretical paranoia on ours there was a single screw that wasn't tightened exactly the same as the others and the enclosure failed the' gigahertz test fortunately these guys are pros and they were able to quickly track down the rogue screw and tighten it so with all the panels tightened together we now have a properly constructed steel box but this is where things get really complicated how do you put a door in something like this i am so glad you asked back to our point from earlier if all we were trying to do was make a faraday cage we could just run a single wire from this door to the enclosure and we're good but if we want the whole thing to be homogeneously bonded we need to get a little fancier what you're looking at right here is a brass knife edge that goes into a brilliant copper contact frame this ensures that the entire door panel acts like any other panel of the box rather than allowing excess charge to build up on one side of it compared to the other and check this out outside handle made of metal nice and strong inside handle made of fiberglass because if it was metal it could potentially become a reflector and screw with our test results at least in theory how exactly do we know that it works well first we need to make sure we're properly hydrated by taking a drink from this fantastic insulated water bottle lttstore.com then we need to mosey over to this fancy spectrum analyzer and signal generator that costs i'm sorry a hundred thousand dollars what's really wild is it the guys from raymond dmc were actually saying that these kinds of tools have become much less expensive in recent years yikes i'm really glad i don't need to buy one of these i can just use theirs while they're here so what we're looking at right now is the signal generator is creating a one gigahertz signal i'm pointing this antenna at it and it clearly shows up on our spectrum analyzer now if alex closes the door you'll be able to see the boom that peak completely goes away that means the system works now we were asking the raymond dmc guys if they had any crazier demos than this and they were like well here's the thing imagine that the chamber is like brakes on a car this right here that's your speeding car and now the car stopped like really really well oh okay fair enough good demo then so now we've got a sealed steel enclosure that blocks electromagnetic waves and we can get in and out of it cool the next problem is that we need to put some holes in it for things like data power and making sure that the occupants can breathe now on the surface the data part is relatively straightforward we obviously can't use copper wires so we'll be running fiber optic cable easy what's not easy is that we need to put it through a very specifically designed hole called the waveguide now clearly this hole is going to let some electromagnetic radiation through like we can see light through it for example but by making the length exactly four times longer than the diameter of the hole we can stop any frequencies that have a wavelength a quarter of the diameter of the hole which is good right yeah right because they will reflect and bounce in the waveguide and cancel themselves out not impressed yet now that you've got all the background let's do the demo from the beginning again you can see here the chamber is working as intended nothing is showing up on the spectrum analyzer i stick my copper wire through here and boom whole day ruined but if i take that out and i put this plastic zip tie through here no problem at all i hope yes so fiber optic cables properly engineered hole we got this with data taken care of now it's time to talk about power and i gotta confess i was not sure how we were going to get ac power running in here without bugging up all of our test results so let's take a closer look noting very importantly that this is temporary these are just hacked up extension cables and our electrician is going to come and run conduit from our panel back there over to this box where the magic happens this is basically a power filter on the electrical connection that goes into our chamber it uses a capacitor and an inductor that are expect to allow low frequencies to pass through like the 60 hertz ac from the wall but as the frequency increases the capacitor and the inductor are going to clamp down and remove them making sure that only the bits we want get through finally we need to get some fresh air in here since sadly the lab isn't run by robots yet and the way these work is actually pretty similar to the wave guide that we showed you guys for the fiber except instead of a small handful of holes it's many many holes don't worry i got my prompter right here so up here you're looking at a matrix of hexagons that are stacked on top of each other that will prevent anything below 32 gigahertz from getting through this will be great for most of what we'll be testing to start but seriously you guys have given us the upsell already we're gonna need to upgrade some of these components if we want to measure millimeter 5g in the future assuming that anyone ever actually starts caring about cellular signals that can be blocked by a piece of paper to recap then we've got a steel box that doesn't let radio waves in or out that's good but the problem is that if we just have normal steel walls inside the signals will be bouncing around creating a bunch of modes and nodes or constructive and deconstructive interference with those bouncing around there would be no way to know if we were measuring the device itself or its reflection off the ceiling or the wall or the floor or some combination of the three to stop our test from interfering with our test then the walls are lined with these these are carbon impregnated polyethylene panels from tdk that were imported all the way from japan how these work is that carbon is a conductor but kind of a bad one so when the electromagnetic waves hit the carbon it creates an impedance and the energy gets turned into heat now this does mean that we can't put any super high power radio antennas in there the panels would either melt or light on fire or maybe both but since there are no plans to run a local radio station out of our rf chamber i think we should be okay all this effort will create a quiet zone in the middle of the room where we'll be able to accurately test all kinds of things once our gear arrives specifically we're going to start with phones using a fire cell 4g 5g lab kit that simulates a mobile network for all you big nerds out there by the way the chamber was designed to comply with ieee 299 just like the segway complies with the association for segway standardization 4.20 segway raymond dmc once again again huge thanks guys for getting us the rf chamber and look it has a four now so if you need a shielded enclosure emc chamber and a cook chamber or any of the parts that go into them they're super good at answering your questions they even have mobile enclosures if you need rf shielding when you're on the go so check them out down below if you guys enjoyed this video maybe you'll enjoy the one on our first attempts to buy an rf chamber that is still garbage in our warehouse thank you look at me on pyramid head gross
