oh my god that's your notes for this video oh no i i have a tiny bit more stuff down here the point is we thought rtx 4090 pretty fast but could it be faster good timing for that we're gonna be taking this 40 90 strix from its stock 450 watts of power consumption all the way to a thousand watts then we're going to be adding external voltage modification and chilled water cooling thanks to our thermoflex 5000 to see just how far this baby can fly why like this fly segue to our sponsor corsair looking for a thin high quality and portable keyboard well then look at this corsair's latest keyboard the wireless k100 air it's got hyper fast connectivity and all-day battery life it's cherry mx ultra low profile switches provide an ultra responsive experience that'll fit your work or gaming needs check it out at the link below one of the coolest things about modern gpus is their ability to dynamically boost their clock speeds in order to deliver the best possible gaming experience but as you can imagine they can't just boost infinitely so there are three main factors that we need to overcome if we want to increase their performance the first is the thermal limit this intuitively is put in place to prevent your card from cooking itself in its attempts to run cyberpunk at 500 frames per second that we're not worried about today though because one this cooler is totally over built this card survived at 80 degrees in a thermal chamber it's frosting over already alex i'm turning it off and two by the time we're done we're going to be running this quantum vector squared gpu block on it our main focus today then is how to overcome the other two the voltage limit and current limit for voltage control we're going to be using this cool little doohickey from elmore labs it used to be that through software you could just adjust the voltage on your gpu but then nvidia went and then i'm pretty sure that's exactly the email they sent out and made their partners lock down voltage control thankfully with a relatively simple soldering job and a usbc connection to this board that functionality can be restored as for current we were planning to do a shunt mod again like we did with the 3090 where we tricked the onboard controller into thinking that it's putting out half as much power as it actually is but this time thanks to nvidia's control freak nature it turns out we don't even have to two floating around on the internet are modded 1 000 watt bioses for the rtx 4090 whether these came from enterprising users or were leaked from manufacturers we have no way of knowing but we do know that at some point in the development process the 4090 was intended to be a much more power hungry card so we kind of suspect the former and as it turns out you don't even necessarily need to have a matching card to flash these bioses users have reported taking a mismatched bios flashing it to their card and it firing right up so thanks nvidia for making all 40 90s the same i guess convenient couple terrifying things about this bios first of all it removes temperature protections which is really yeah absolutely terrifying we can just be super easy to cook it yep and then gear will come over here murder us yeah and for another obviously it removes the current protection which exists for a reason so a our power connector to the board is only rated for 600 watts not a thousand minus 75 925 watts and for another the vrms on this board are a not designed to have a thousand watts going through them and b i don't even know if they're going to be cooled by the block because this is also not designed with a thousand watts in mind that's probably fine it's probably fine before we do any of that though we need to establish our baseline performance so that we know if anything we're doing is even helping this is our results for f122 what is interesting is we can see that the performance cap reason is just voltage regulation that is what's holding us back okay and our maximum draw was somewhere around 390 yeah 390 watts that's a lot of watts we could do better though that isn't the only number we need though there is some performance tuning that we can do without getting super sketchy by firing up gpu torque really oh tweak that makes more sense by firing up gpu tweet 3 my vision's going we can adjust our power target turn down in some cases our gpu voltage no we just crank it really it has no down by adjusting our power target our gpu voltage our boost clock and maybe we'll throw a bit of a memory overclock on it sure we should be able to eke out a little bit more performance in a way we would actually recommend replicating at home our power target's now 120 that's as high as it'll let us go plus 200 on the core plus 900 on the memory i think it'll be fine the hot spot is the one we're particularly going to want to keep a close eye on because that's the one that especially with so much power running through it is going to spike extremely quickly in the absence of adequate cooling i mean it seems to be still working yeah just let it let it do its thing i mean we can tell that the hot spot is the hotter one way to go yep it's very not happy yeah we clearly do need more voltage yep should we just send it maybe it was our core clock we'll adjust both at the same time okay here we go holy crap yeah it's nearly running at three gigahertz that's pretty fast okay what are we limited by voltage voltage okay if we want to get more clock speed then we're going to need more voltage oh hold on one second okay well i guess that test isn't valid anymore i was just gonna see okay 100 hit apply sure wow that actually worked uh now we're drawing 430 watts okay and the gpu clocks higher cool oh it's easy based on the scaling we're seeing here we might be able to go quite a bit higher maybe or the card will just blow up for just taking some sliders and going like that we went from we just got 12 more performance yeah and like our minimums went up by a lot that's awesome yeah overclocking who knew let's go faster four-way volt mod this 49e we need to make sure that we're actually modifying the voltages and not just some number on the screen is changing to do that we need to be able to probe this card now i don't know exactly where we can find core and memory voltages but i think there are some headers right here and if we just solder a couple wires to those we are good let's find out what these actually do or really concerned about here is the core voltage it is just at idle so it is currently 0.885 volts that's what we're looking for 0.89 probably it i don't know if you've watched previous attempts of alex and i to try and solder a graphics card um they usually don't go too well ah it's such a bad solution dude it's on i'm not joking why is it so crap is it pretty terrible what are you going to do with those wires i think i thought of them right there oh okay yeah uh all right that's probably fine and then like what are you gonna use to match that uh an assalamus oh no one's getting lead poisoning today so i'm just going to hold it there for a while it's the small things in life you gotta like man okay i think we're done sure there you go so there's hot glue on it look at strain relief it's so it's safe the best part is we didn't quite do it right so it'll look at the voltage you uh you need to probe one of these guys to get ground but uh there it is uh 0.89 volts is what we're drawing at idle so we now know that it works pretty good and you're just going to drag that all over the back of the card like that that's kind of what i was thinking yeah we'll see if we can get to any traces and short it out and kill it you were moving i can move this it took a while but the evc2 is working it's the sort of thing where like you know when you get something off github and you have to like you install the software in the drivers but for the drivers to work you need a specific version of java which requires visually all of that stuff it took me a couple hours but it's working yeah when he told me that he needed about half an hour i told the guys over there no less than an hour it has now been four yes oh my god it's not even bolted to the alex yeah you've only got four screws in it we can add more if you want but then we gotta have to add black plate it's fine it's fine oh the system works okay wonderful we're at 0.89 so this right here is telling you everything that's happening with the voltage controller at the moment yeah 1.05 yeah yeah 1.0 ish how accurate is this uh multimeter do i trust this or that you sort of don't trust either of them sick basically what we're doing here so 0.06 whatever you can see here like before we are voltage limited so you can go in here via offset how about point zero five yeah sure okay and are we gonna see this just whoa hello you can see the board power draw right there boop there we go that's the sort of speed we're looking for wow oh that's a lot of power draw over three gigahertz over 500 watts 81 degrees celsius and we're still voltage regulated oh oh it's a powerful it did there it is that little tiny green blip there i feel like if we give it just like the tiniest bit more voltage power is going to be our problem very loud and clear okay how about .065 sure now let's see is it gonna get is it even going to impact it mid run yeah so this is weird the power draw goes up but the frequency doesn't we all because we are power limited now wow we're just shy of 600 watts sir should we do a run at 600 watts and see what we end up with then the gpu chip alone is drawing over 500 watts that's a lot of power for one of those little guys it's like unfathomable right like those damn let's get more power all right cool to flash your bios it's actually pretty easy what you need is envy flash which is a little application here you put that in the root of your thing hold on can we just set the card back to default before we do that yes yeah and i'm gonna do that over here too okay update any kind of firmware be it on your motherboard or gpu you should return your entire system to stock settings and ideally you should be on a battery backup if for whatever reason the power fails in the middle of a firmware update it might survive it probably won't see alex i've seen things survive with this gpu it's a little bit less risky because we do have two bioses so if we completely bork one of them flipper over other one still is probably good before you change your bios you want to just make sure that the one that's on there you have saved so just gpu z look right there save the file even if you never plan to roll it back if you ever needed to army your card back to the manufacturer for example you would need to return it to its stock configuration not that you're arming this once you've soldered things to it but if you didn't do that now we can have a look at our bios wow wow that's a that's something yep we're in the matrix now boys oh oh wait um i think i can wait stop oh maybe it's fine now we maybe have the ability to murder this gpu if we set one now we cook uh i think'0 is where it was happy okay firing it up oh this is scary hold on we can do the math here it's at 14 of its tdp and the board power is 142 watts okay okay it thinks it's a thousand watt hard you know nvidia is going to lock this down with the next gen and i remember when they were cool we're in kind of a scary territory now as far as voltage goes okay and we're at 66 degrees and 480 watts we got a result but it's not going to be any faster at 145. that's an improvement oh that's a sizable improvement really we started at 137. oh all right yeah cool i mean it was a rock solid 3.03 gigahertz didn't move are we going to run out of gpu torque slider here i doubt it okay is that 210 i'm gonna give her another 20. average gosh it's fast but she's not consuming power how do we keep the card from kicking in its voltage cap like we're not thermally limited though something else is the problem it'll probably boost a little higher just being cooler but i don't think that's the issue here no all right i figured out what the problem was before we were only setting a voltage offset now i've like have the offset but increased the vo command so that seems to have broader voltage to where first of all the computer is reading a lot more accurate and also i have got some very high temperatures i turned it down a tiny bit but uh yeah thermal protections not a thing on this gpu anymore it's absolutely terrifying so uh i'll just give this a tiny bit more this might be fine it might not be fine i don't know let's see tiny bit faster i have to watch the hot spot temperature very closely because if that starts jumping up we just need to alt f4 and get out of here oh that is fast 3120 drawing 540 watts not bad i'm shocked how well this cooler works fps is the same but that's about expected i think we're about at the point though where to go faster we need more cooling so watermelon don't want to hear the most absolutely shocking thing andrew yes i have not quite thought through how this gpu is going to go in for whatever reason our ground lead here doesn't seem to be working so i have this in continuity mode right now peeps touch it to ground does not beep before we put this in there i want this to just work and not have to worry about this lead kind of falling off and ending up somewhere bad kind of like that one right there all right i think we're all good to put it in here we go it's kind of sketchy something like that ha wow this really isn't all that sketchy but it sure as hell looks like it i want to make sure that all of this is working perfectly before i turn the system on because if there's air bubbles in here there's currently no temperature protection on the gpu so it will actually just kill itself if i'm not like properly running water through it might as well top it up okay gpu hotspot 17 degrees we're good heck yeah one thing that i like to do if you hit windows control shift b like so it resets your video driver which can be quite helpful when you're crashing a video card a bunch of times well i think you did a fine job oh i know look at the safety straps so secure genius i always forget about the capabilities of this chiller she's chilly it's very good at its job unfortunately it doesn't really need to because what we've discovered is that this rtx 490 and for that matter pretty much all of them is not thermally limited in any way and in fact it's not even really current limited is it yeah i know we solved the problem where we accidentally were applying a voltage rather than a voltage offset but what we discovered is that even though we were able to get the power consumption up like 580 i think is as high as i saw it doesn't impact performance anymore yeah unless of course we were to apply dangerously high voltages but we're trying to do this somewhat responsibly i don't know i had pretty dangerous voltages there and like it doesn't go faster i guess the conclusion is twofold then one there's definitely performance to ring out of the rtx 4090 if only nvidia would give us the bloody controls to do it and two they made the right call to ship it at 450 watts given how close the performance is to the 600 watt configuration like this right here is probably as fast as it'll go i played with the memory a little bit you can get it going like 100 megahertz faster but at the same time i found that the actual scores went down so i'm guessing that it was not quite stable we're riding that razor's edge yeah nvidia gpus will pull back clocks for a couple cycles if they think they're gonna crash and so even though the number will be higher like in gpu z the actual score is lower so or rate at the limit at the limit of telling you about our sponsor first i want to see if we can get the limit of our power supply oh god we could give it a tiny bit more voltage get it up to about 580 watts the cpu even though we don't have like the direct dye cooler on it we can get a pretty easy like 400 out of thanks to this guy that's getting pretty close to the 1200 not quite okay let's see how good of a power supply corsair makes i wish you could cpu speed oh wow we're at over 600 watts on the gpu now oh yes what's the hot spot temperature 73 okay that's fine that's not hotspot hotspot's 95 95 oh that's hot will smith that is hot how's our cpu doing six gigahertz casual no and the rgb turned off did we call it editor please cut out the awkward pause while i was thinking of that just use a punch in or something just like i'm gonna call myself to tell you about our
