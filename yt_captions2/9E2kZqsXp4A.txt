don't worry we got this we got this we got this we got this we got this pull up pull up blah blah blah blah blah it's been oh my god it's got two power bricks attached it's been seven years since i have owned a laptop this thick and i can't imagine going back to something like this but here's the thing people must buy these things or origin pc wouldn't keep sponsoring me to talk about them which is what they did today so who are you like why do you need a full-on desktop cpu why do you need an rtx 3080 with 16 gigs of gddr6 memory why do you need multiple m.2 storage drives running in raid zero and why do you need all of it in a laptop can you even call this a laptop it's actually kind of a good question if it's not a laptop then i guess it means it doesn't have to compete with the portability of things like this it competes more with the portability of things like what you're looking at now so maybe that's the justification either way let's take a closer look shall we [music] we've talked a lot over the years about the way that mobile cpus have dramatically narrowed the gap between themselves and their desktop counterparts but in response to my question at the beginning of this video that is one of the main reasons that someone might look at the eon 17x or a similar desktop replacement laptop because inside this thing you will find not a mobile cpu but a full fat desktop intel core i9 11900k that is not just eight cores 16 threads of up to 5.3 gigahertz goodness but it's actually overclockable although i guess it remains to be seen just how far we'll be able to push it now right now i'm actually running a single threaded benchmark and we're going to have a look at whether we can actually reach that 5.3 gigahertz mark this is a very odd performance profile that they've got this thing tuned with i mean we've got six of our a cores that are sitting up near five gigahertz even though i'm only running a single threaded benchmark and that fan listen to it go they're serious about keeping that thing cool we're gonna have to open this thing up later we did touch 5.3 gigahertz as advertised though more importantly i want to see what we settled in at in terms of temps whoa can you hear it taking off andy we're headed straight to the moon that's why origin pc is space themed i guess now's as good a time as any to talk about i o and cooling because it's a desktop replacement you are really looking at more of a desktop tier of i o on the right you're going to find dual thunderbolt 4 ports usb type a we've got our dual power bricks here and they really do put the brick in power brick they're quite substantial on the back we've got i love this lots of display outputs we've got a usb type-c that can also be used for displayport two more mini display ports so you could actually run a triple monitor setup at three by eight k we've also got an hdmi 2.1 so you could do another 8k 30 hertz display out of that one two and a half gigabit ethernet then over on the left side you've got an sd card reader two more usb type a's a line in jack and a headphone microphone combo jack now of course they would have packed more i o into it if they hadn't been busy packing in cooling you just watch andy this is soon to be an industry standard benchmark pill the sails look at this look how far away from it i am as much as i might joke about it though the fans are doing an absolutely outstanding job of keeping this thing cool all the surfaces of this device are actually cool to the touch most importantly the wasd section of the keyboard is one of the coolest sections and you can see even though we just finished our 10 minute stress test in cinebench r23 we're running at 92 degrees 4.4 gigahertz now you'll notice see how it just jumped up to 4.5 so what it's doing is it's opportunistically turboing as high as it can it's actually running up against a core power and core thermal limit and then it's going back down to still a very respectable 4.4 gigahertz that is kind of incredible and you can wow now that the facts have turned down yeah it's very quiet now that is a full desktop grade 14 000 points instead of match r23 obviously origin sent over one of their custom hd uv prints so this is actually printed directly onto the chassis of the laptop it's not like a sticker or anything like that and they've got all kinds of customization that they can do so they're hydro dipping laser etching it's one of the things that sets them apart because you know obviously a lot of companies make gaming laptops but if you want yours to look really different this is definitely a way to go about it it's also worth noting that origin pc offers thin and light laptop solutions as well and you can check out some of the special offers they're running at the link down below let's pop this puppy open removable battery remember those this is a 97 watt hour unit so it's getting really close to the limit to what you can put in a laptop before you can't carry it on a plane anymore but if you have to ask how long this thing goes on battery then you probably aren't the correct customer for it just saying man look at the size of the hands here andy i mean it shouldn't surprise me given how much air they were moving but still look at the length of these screws are you compensating for something is it really that easy holy crap i don't remember the last time i saw a mobile device that was actually designed to have the bottom taken off that easily that's awesome oh wow i know right so the side heat sinks are pretty small but these back ones are huge this back heat sink goes all the way from here to here that's can enormous and you got two of them this one in particular is massive it's that wide here's our mxm graphics card and then our gpu memory is going to be built right onto that so this one right here has heat pipes going here here these are dedicated and this one oh my god oh my god some of them wrap this one wraps all the way around to this guy right here these go all the way so the cpu actually doesn't get any dedicated heat pipes all of them contribute to cooling the gpu as well and then you can actually see these heat pipes are connected to a vapor chamber so you've got your heat generation that gets spread out by a vapor chamber then gets moved to all these four cooling elements by all these heat pipes dang curiously origen doesn't specify how many watts this gpu is rated for on their website but that's okay we should be able to figure that out fairly easily with some diagnostic tools now before we get it opened up let's have a look at what we've got in terms of drive expansion so you can see two of our slots are occupied over here we've got a couple of mp 600 one terabyte drives and those can be configured in raid 0 if you're into that sort of thing they sent them to us not configured to raid 0 because we are not into that sort of thing so much and then there's an additional two slots one over here and one over here so you could put a total of four m.2 drives in here absolute mad lads now this is curious it looks like they've gone and applied thermal pads to the dram caches of these ssds so you can see that's how it's connected to this aluminum heat spreader here but not to the controller so i guess whether it's airflow through the chat see which i don't really i don't really see of any around here or something else they determined that the dram caches needed it more than the controllers the odds of encountering a situation where an ssd would thermal throttle meaningfully in the real world pretty slim unless you're trying to kill your drive and there it is this is a maxed ass out 170 watt peak typically sitting around 160 watt rtx 3080 and given that you can configure it with either a 4k 60hz display or as i actually preferred to go with a 1080p 300hz display you may actually be able to make use of all of that performance of course given that each of these is good for 280 watts surely it's equipped to hit the cpu and gpu at the same time let's see how much of the power it pulls away from the gpu in order to run that cpu full bar wait 3.5 oh wow it gave everything to the gpu nope there it goes and there goes the other fan cpu fans going it's kicking now obviously we can't a hundred percent trust the system's own reporting of how much power it's drawing but it certainly gives us a rough idea oh that's cool okay so you can really see the power dynamics at play there's just a limit to what you can do for power delivery in a device like this so watch if i put furmark in the background so cpu package power spikes up gpu power goes down to something more conservative either way we're able to get well in excess of 300 watts on the cpu and gpu alone which explains why we need two 280 watt power bricks not because this thing can actually suck 560 watts but because in addition to doing this it's got to run the drives the fans the rgb lighting all of that other stuff it also has to be able to charge the battery while it's doing all of that so it's not that you couldn't run it with a single power brick watch it's going it's just there you go i'm sorry i'm sorry please forgive me let's take a look at what those power numbers look like running an actual game so what you want i knew you were going to want flight sim what is with the obsession nobody actually plays that game i didn't mean nobody uses it obviously it's popular program just ain't no game son here we go ultra i'm not even gonna be able to take the plane off andy so do you hear this thing going we are in a loading screen got some performance metrics up here we're managing around 52 fps ladies and gentlemen okay throttle control to increase engine power gradually press and hold f3 oh it's a good thing there's nobody on this plane because otherwise we'd all be dead to take off gently press number pad eight okay but oh gently how do you gently press a button oh look at this this anyone could do this hey see you later vancouver to increase speed during climb okay number pad two and we're headed for the ground uh do you know how to fly the plane oh my god i'm in the wrong seat i've moved to the co-pilot's chair anyone who actually knows how to flight sim is going to be very unimpressed with me right now this is your captain speaking we are going to be visiting the united media group warehouse often sorry i know origin this is supposed to be about your laptop it's kind of about your laptop like look you got your gpu power 100 watts or whatever oh no no no no no no no don't worry we got this we got this we got this we got this we got this pull up so our gpu was anywhere from 100 to 120 watts our cpu was a toasty boy up around 80 degrees and our gpu was sitting at around 65 66. that's not bad it's not quiet but it's not bad yes this game runs on anything but it doesn't run at 280 fps on anything [music] man where have 300 hertz ips displays been all my life the fans might be loud but if the speakers can make up for it then maybe we get away with one here so there's your two stereo speakers and there's your subwoofer hold on i think there's more in the tank i didn't get it i didn't get it no stop moving okay three health need help i'm dead not the most amazing sounding speakers but they're definitely loud i mean i guess that pretty much answers what we set out to answer is this a gaming laptop yes um not cheap the cold hard truth is if you're the kind of person who needs one of these there's just nothing else quite like it so go check them out at the link down below if you're one of those people for whom this is an absolute godsend whether you're a mobile professional or just a gamer who wants a desktop grade gaming experience and something that they can take with them on the go they're obviously backed by origins lifetime support so that's 24 7 support as their desktop pcs and like i said before up to an 11 900k and rtx 3080 with 16 gigs of ram freaking crazy crazy machine
