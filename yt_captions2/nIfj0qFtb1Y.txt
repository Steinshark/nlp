all right so i'm going to be real with you here for a second typically whenever i do an article i have ja boy cam pre-read it to make sure it's like fit for stream that it actually works out that it's going to be you know not completely bizarre instead i'm just going to raw doog this one because how could i not payments to a non-existent company the alex jones funding for politics reliance on a single customer and that's just for starters i'm animated i'm alive i like to fight too okay this article was originally published in 2022 exclusively for subscribers of the luke du the luk journal it is being republished now for free oh nice all right mozilla the foundation behind firefox web browser is absolute mammoth with over $1 billion dollar in assets where does that money come from where is it being spent with firefox market share in uh in a nose dive how is mozilla reacting okay the lond duke journal spent uh some time with mozilla's financial disclosures and came away with some wild observations bizarre expenditures including to companies that don't even seem to exist political organizations with no relationship to milla's core business there's a lot here read to the end it gets wild woo what exactly is mozilla uh there seems to be a great deal of confusion about the organization mosa uh actually is many seem to be under the impression that it simply is a nonprofit focus on the development of firefox and while that is partially true it is only a small part of a much bigger picture by the way just so everybody knows rust foundation it's all i'm going to say what's going on here at the top exists the mozilla foundation a not for-profit corporation that operates out of california the mozilla foundation is the sole owner 100% for two for-profit corporations mozilla corporation and mozilla technologies corporation both the parent foundation and the wholly owned corporation are ran by the same ceo and executive uh executive chair mitchell baker okay okay the not for profit and for-profit aspects of mozilla are so tightly intertwined that the auditor's report makes a point of calling the collective group of three organizations simply mozilla and the report on their finances as a single entity okay that makes sense it does sound very confusing one other misconception may be that or that many have as mozilla's primary focus is the development of firefox web browser that does not appear to be the case there are three areas of focus according to the milla foundation rally citizens issues like privacy trustworthy ai and digital rights impact all of us who use the internet mozilla helps translate them into powerful meaningful change connect leaders we support activists and thought leaders shaping the future of our online lives shape the agenda this i mean honestly just reading this this sounds like something you would see in austin powers okay this like i mean it's so on the nose this literally just sounds like a plotline out of austin powers shape the agenda we publish open source research and host global con uh con convenings to make ideas like trustworthy ai mainstream we make the a we makes the ai accessible uh rally citizens connect leaders shape the agenda a strange set of areas to focus on as you'll see especially with i'm using firefox right now oh no one other item to remember as the uh as we go through these details firefox market share has been in a free fall for some time depending on the source it fluctuates between 3 to 7% of the total web browser market that's still really good i mean it's really hard to compete against uh uh chrome because it's literally every browser is chrome except for firefox you just like rip off the wall or you rip off you you know like oh what is this the new ie it's chrome what is that opera chrome i guess safari is the other one safari okay safari's jsc you win safari anyways how much money does mozilla have as of 2021 mozilla including the foundation the wholly owned for-profit corporations has a total asset of 1.1 billion usd that's billion with a b what is this some sort of kellogg cereal box i don't know i don't know how to read nutrition facts in dollar amounts this includes 400 million in cash overall assets jumped by roughly 200 million over the previous year how do they make money how do you make $200 million hey y'all got 15 million of goodwill i mean if mozilla gets 15 million of goodwill you think i could at least get like say 1 million of goodwill can i get can i get a little bit of that as you would expect with such numbers mozilla saw a significant increase in revenue in 2021 with over 100 million just to 600 million wow that's a lot of revenue royalties what are they royalti subscription and advertisement revenue other revenue 450,000 uh interest in dividend income wow 5 million 5.7 million wow net realized unrealized gains and losses okay contributions okay other income okay foreign ex currency exchange gain loss oh they actually made money on forex nobody makes money on forex net assets released from restrictions what uh all right they've made a lot of they made some money at the same time as total revenue was sky recording overall expenses went way down by roughly 100 million with the deepest cuts being focused on software development all right software development it's going down other programs okay it's going up a little bit management in general going down uh general funding going down i assume this is the current year this is the previous year i'm trying to realize i'm trying to understand this because it said software and engineering uh uh with the deepest cuts being focused here so i assume this is previous year current year cuz that's the only one that that kind of makes sense of deepest cuts right all right so yeah they've gone down they they've reduced their overhead by what appears to be 100 million as as uh what's it called as the article suggests okay to put another way if mozilla stopped earning money today it has enough assets to fund their current expenses for roughly three years thanks in large part due to rising revenue with combined cutting software development work where does the money come from if you look at the change in net assets chart above you'll notice that the vast majority comes from royalties all right with advertising and subscriptions next and then contributions an next uh as the two largest line items okay contributions is donations from people like you y'all are donating 7 million to a for-profit company i mean sorry for definitely a nonprofit that happens to own two for-profit companies sorry completely different my bad on that one uh all right contributions is donations from people like you mozilla actively seeks donations because as they put it we rely on donations to carry out our mission okay so you got $500 million in royalties 56 million in subscriptions and 7 million in donations okay yeah about 1.5% 1.4% 1.3% okay it's worth noting that this statement is not true we are proudly nonprofit non-corporate and non-compromised technically they make all their money from royalties and and advertisement and they make a lot and they're holding on to money so for something to be considered a nonprofit you're not allowed to like have net assets at the end of the year right you have to be continuously ensuring that everything is either spent on on uh employees or on improvements or something right you're not supposed to be gathering a large war chest of money i believe as part of the requirements of a 5013c i'm not sure if they're a 5013c but nonetheless they there's some sort of requirements about having net profit year-over-year and so by owning by the nonprofit owning to for-profit companies is that how they get around that is this is this how scientology got started by the way way mozilla is by far the most corporate place of all time mozilla is the only place that is as easily sue heavy for using their trademark infringements as oracle i am not really sure what this statement means but it can't be true all right mozilla does not in fact rely on donations to carry out their mission in fact if you remove donations from their yearly revenue entirely it would have no impact on mozilla's ability to pay for any of their expenditures and mozilla could not pay more than small fraction of their bills from yearly donations this is all true we saw from the reports it's literally like slightly over 1% since royalties make up such a large percentage of mozilla revenue let's drill into that a little bit royalties for what exactly according to the foundation's 2020 report royalties mozilla provides firefox web browser which is a free and open source web browser initially developed by mozilla foundation and the corporation mozilla incorporates search engines of its customers as default status or an optional status available in the firefox web browser mozilla generally receives royalties to a certain percentage of revenues earned by its customers through their search engines incorporated in the firefox browser got it search engines that's the cash cow and with annual report is light on the details it provides this key bit of information approximately 83 to 86% of mozilla's revenues from customers with contracts were derived from one customer for the years ended in december 31st 2021 and 2020 respectively receivables from that one customer represents 69 nice and 73% of december 31st 2021 and 2020 outstanding receivables respectively i assume that one customer is google what's the one customer that's a large search engine bing everybody knew it was bing how did you not see this coming bingo just asked js already in other words the vast majority roughly 70% of all mozilla's yearly revenue comes from the default sege engine uh uh placement just uh of just one customer in other words or let's see that customer while not named in the report is obviously google and parent company alphabet without that revenue mozilla could not continue to operate at their current level of expenditure without eating into their assets how much does their lead leadership earn while we're on the topic of expenditures it's worth taking a small detour into the compensation of mozilla leadership from the mozilla foundation form okay okay uh let's see oo got 750 thou plus 4.8 8 million bonus what a bonus yeah i like it okay then here's the all the other expenses man vp of global programs j bob not getting those sweet bonuses where's the rest of the bonuses i kind of feel i honestly just feel more bad about the rest of the senior leadership do they did none of them get it is it only is it only because he's chairman that they have to report it is that why no no one else gets bonuses my guess is it's because these these are all these all sound like e-level these are all uh e and d levels and so my guess is they don't have to report these things publicly right uh let's see the head of mozilla roughly earns 5.8 million during 2021 the rest of the executive team are ranged uh more or less from 100 to 300k interesting to note that mozilla ceo earned nearly as much as 5.6 million as mozilla received donations 7 million okay that's a little bit connection jumpy one could say but interesting also interesting that i just saying also interesting that the ceo received a bonus of nearly 5 million considering the pr uh the precarious position that mozilla is in being dependent on a single client continuing to pay for their search engine play placement unless there's a secret deal going on that looks like a company teetering on the edge to me i don't know if it's teetering on the edge 3 to 7% of all traffic going through google i think google is making more than enough money that seems like a pretty reasonable trade-off if you could have 3 to 7% of all internet traff traffic route through your search engine as google where you make a ton you make your exclusive amount of money on ads is that unreasonable i i wouldn't say that's unreasonable i would say that that's fairly reasonable could we could we agree to that it's it's about $5 a month which is about the cost of one subscription on twitch amazon twitch uh strange to reward the ceo for that sort of future uncertainty uh my guess is that just the rest of these bonuses aren't listed because they don't have to and that's it where exactly does all that money go mozilla is a billion dooll corporation where uh while their flag star product is in fire let's see firefox web browser the software development needs of firefox including manpower services and other expenses do not fully utilize the massive revenue of mosia uh not by a long shot with which begs the question what is all of that money being spent on okay i like this i like this this is where we go oh no here's the short sampling based on the available public documentation of exactly how much money is being spent and where mckiski uh mckenzie's mac group east 53rd street chicago sh it's always in chicago it's always in chicago uh 387,000 uh during 2021 they paid this much money to someone called mckenzie mac group mackenzie mac group is in is is a change management firm redefining innovation in the white dominant change man management industry from their linkedin page mckenzie mac group describes itself as black le non binary lead mmg is a global social justice organization mckenzie mack is a public speaker who regularly discusses her anger at white colonialism and her dislike of cis men and women the mackenzie mac company website blog primarily discusses abortion and trans related issues why would a company of developers let's see that develops web browsers want to pay her close to a half million dollars in one year that remains unclear it is however worth noting that this is a far larger expense than any of the executive team of mozilla earned their salary other than the ceo oh yeah that is kind of funny that none of the none of the other people earn as much as the mckenzie group they're running the company they don't even get to earn as much oh got them o got him okay from let's see wow okay action research collabora uh collaborative action research collaborative okay here's this one $100,000 was paid to the organization list uh listed as action research collaborative by the way uh just for everyone kind of watching and listening to this 387,000 100,000 those are the two big ticket items they still made $600 million here so we're talking less than that's like we're we're not even at 0.1% of their money they made last year okay so are these big ticket items not likely uh there's way easier ways to to to to launder money especially 0.1% right so right now i'm not like super this isn't like the craziest thing i've said but i'm i'm i'm i'm willing okay i'm just trying to be objective here i'm trying to read this being objective just let me try okay i'm trying my best okay i'm trying my best uh these are surprising let's see hold on 100 th000 let's see what exactly is action research collaborative that is surprisingly difficult question to find an answer to as they have no we website whatsoever yeah that always looks like just straight money laundering that just but what would they do laundering $100,000 they have a magic search engine that makes a bunch of money that seems like a way easier one what are you going to have some crazy auditor come in and look at all of your traffic well actually i don't see uh i don't i don't see definitely not uh cartel.com being used as a search engine right i don't see any of that uh anyways how many apr takes uh let's see what are the few reference is to it is the uh cornell newsletter from earlier this year where one of the founders states that action research collaborative is a standing institutional home that can support action research projects that bring together researchers community members and policy makers to be able to work together and address pressing issues as they arise that is literally not even an idea did did you guys just read that it's like chat gpt can i please have a sentence that contains 50 words that means nothing about today's activities they support research action togetherness researching community members policy makers researching pressing issues as they arise okay which doesn't really tell you much of anything no product or project no client no website no nothing the founder neil lewis jr appears to have focused his career on vaccine acceptance problems with white people and his theory that white people can not be victim of discrimination man i was not prepared for this like i said i read this article fully knowing i have no idea what's about to happen what what does this action research collaborative actually do why would mozilla need their services to be uh willing to pay $100,000 for it this remains entirely unknown it does seem just strange like right given given that they don't have a uh given that they have no website and they and their their their direction literally means nothing what do you like how do i get paid $100,000 i could come up with some some just bizarre ass platitudes i want this i don't even need to make a website i could make a website in o camel and hdmx does that mean i get $300,000 dude this is really weird i mean it is just we weird in the sense that what is happening here uh while the luke the lond duke journal does not like to delve uh too deeply into political woods trademark uh it should should be questioned why so much money possibly millions of dollars donated by individuals who thought they were supporting a web browser i mean this makes sense if you thought you were supporting a web browser and it turns out your donations literally mean nothing like literally less than you know 1% of their total budget in which is clearly completely blown out is being funnel into highly political organizations that have no involvement in the worldwide web web browser or any related standards yeah i mean i i think i'd be pretty bothered like i' be less bothered if it went to like w3 you're like okay they're trying to make the the worldwide web a better place all right discretionary spending $30,000 to mc technical incorporated in 2021 who are they well they don't have a website that's for sure the business registry listing is about the only thing of the company that seems to exist the listed address is someone's house how does a mostly non-existent company with no online presence at all no website social media reviews etc get paid $30,000 in discretion money from mozilla baby there's a love child that's a love child that my friends is a love child that is the keep your mouth shut love child right there guaranteed that's hush money this is if there's ever been hush money in my lifetime this is hush money this is hush money somebody has a photo of something going on okay mr ceo with 5.8 billion million dollars a year in revenue has something that people don't want to find out cuz it just goes to someone's house that's just straight up weird yep okay new venture fund uh all right this dude am i gon to get canceled for even reading this real talk one in the chat am i gonna get in trouble for just reading this even pick is like absolutely i mean this is this is a while let's see hold on uh you just got canceled for saying baby money before it was uh before it was fine yeah okay if this is cancelable i want to be cancelled let's keep going though we're going to get cancelled but hey this is pretty cool all right so new venture fund all right that sounds like just venture fund another discretionary spending of 375,000 that's more than any of the se or the leadership suite other than uh the ceo and then there's 375,000 in discretionary spending given to new venture fund according to influence watch new venture fund nvf is a 5013c funding and fiscal uh sponsorship nonprofit that makes grants to left of center advocacy and organization projects and provide incubation services for other left of center organizations the fund focuses primarily on social and environmental change okay so i guess this is like a a like a pack right a super pack of some sort some some sort of whatever all right mozilla the developer of firefox gave 375,000 fund that specifically exist to provide money and services for political organizations of another uh of one particular alignment it's weird that there could be a fund that funds funds a fund fund it's just i mean i mean personally i just think it's crazy just all of this in the sense that there are people giving they're asking for donations while making a lot of money that to me just see right like for me like even all this political stuff am i necessarily surprised i'm not that surprised right companies give all the time to this kind of stuff is that super surprising no but to say that you need to operate off of donations pulling on the heartstrings of people putting this really nice image of people working together and learning and oh my gosh look at this little kid learning javascript for the first time oh man we're so happy he's going to have early childhood depression from learning javascript right like you're looking at all this happening right here and then it's actually completely just fake right to me that's like 10 times more upsetting than the rest of all the stuff i'm reading right here like none of this is i'm not surprised at all by this stuff right right i'm not surprised by any of this stuff so far uh so the uh so many questions the deeper we dig into mozilla in their financials the more questions come up why does mozilla gives so much money to political speakers that have no relationship to their core business i mean that's fair why does a company do that that's that's a fair question why does i mean because usually you're doing anytime i see a company do something it's because they have an agenda right a company is out to make more money so why is it giving to anything other than lobbying right that's always usually what people think is that there's there's some reason why they give money it's because they want to they're appealing to somebody right it's a company companies make money that's what companies do and so if you think there's some other reason i'd be surprised for the most part why does mozilla seemed unconcerned with alienating a large portion of their user base uh why do some of the recipients of mozilla money appear to be uh to be nothing more than an empty shell companies with uh without even having a simple website yeah i mean this is a great point right here this is the point we should be focusing on which is why are all these these things being being given out and just go to someone's house why does mozilla continue to take donations if it doesn't need them and pulling on the heartstrings right they're they're really they're acting like they need them where does milla spend these donation dollars do they uh do they go to the strange discretionary spending or political organizations or do they go for development now if they went straight for development that's better we would all agree if they went straight for development then i'd have less of a problem with it but i'm still just very questioning like why would anyone just start asking for donations uh with 70% reliance on google competitor for revenue why is mozilla spending money on projects that have no goal of being a profitable and have no relationship to the core business what happens when google funding goes away milla appears certain that it will uh never will based on their spending why is that uh well i mean i wouldn't say based on their spending it doesn't seem like it seems very much so like it right they've been gathering money over the years they have three years worth of runway they've been reducing their expenses to me that seems like they're they're making the attempt of making themselves less reliant on google that's how i read their expenses um and their you know their discretionary spending and all that is 1 million of 600 million you know1 6% uh is this crazy i don't think it's that crazy probably just some basic tax offsetting and potentially hush money probably hush money let's be real it's going to be hush money what happens when the google funding goes away okay yeah why is mozilla decreasing software development funding when development of firefox is the cash cow and that is literally the tip of the iceberg all right the lundu journal sent out numerous questions and requests for comments from organizations listed here among many others to find answers will they be coming forth it will be interesting to see update to dat no request for clarification has been made that's pretty wild i mean i think overall my big takeaway here is still just this right my big takeaway is the this appearance of needing donations when they're making handover fist money from google and it's not like like they're going in the hole right they're not hyper negative they're not like not making money therefore they need this plus plus something else right anyways it seems kind of strange it's good journalism that was really good it's really good because it just seems super strange they should invest into the browser you think they' invest into the browser a search engine of their own because obviously it makes enough they make enough money from google to start their own ad business right but ads are obviously really really hard to sell so i totally get that i totally understand why people don't do search engines not a simple thing um as mozilla business model is bad well they obviously make a lot of money whatever their business model is they make a ton of money firefox can just adopt the web kit or chrome engine and save a lot more money fair yeah i mean there's a there's a lot of things they could do yeah it's not sustainable well right now it is technically sustainable by all objective measures it's currently sustainable with how much they're making the problem is is they rely on a singular client right so when you rely on a singular client if that client goes away you're no longer sustainable so google contains all the power in the relationship they can just simply go down that's that uh yeah the problem is they're they're at the they're at really the the sole goodwill of google what happ if google just says no thank you somewhat dishonest to p let's see to pull all of amazon into one pile and then make the arguments from there yeah i mean i i don't really know what milla does other than firefox and rust right that's all i that's all i know of mozilla oh thunderbird you're right thunderbird i' i've heard of thunderbird i've i've heard of i've heard of thunderbird yep yep yep yep yep my bad my bad my be they have a vpn service okay but their vpn service didn't really i mean i guess it did show up as one of the larger ones right so it was i mean they kind of pulled it all together i'm trying to have as realistic of a take i can from this article which is they're not spending that much on political stuff is it surprising i'm sure if you looked at any company at all you would see it right you would absolutely see donations right to all sorts of different things and every company is getting you know every person goes over every company and tries to cancel them based on their donations so do you see this all the time absolutely uh do i think it's a good move i think i think it's probably best as a company just to avoid the whole situation but it seems like there's probably reasons why they're doing it that we just don't understand the big one is the donations and then that $335,000 to just some person's address or $30,000 a year to someone's address i mean that just sounds like hush money right like that just straight up sounds crazy this one it's just some place with no anything there's just money call in the stock guy to collab on this one i know we should i i'd actually like to i'd actually like to talk to him on this one because i think he has a lot of interesting interesting takes probably on this one but it is it's it's it's bizarre minim this is bizarre this is probably the most bizarre line of the whole application uh could these be speaker fees they could be they could very well be speaker fees that's actually a great point i mean to attribute everything to malice is usually silly you just don't have the uh you know the understanding h i got to see what you're saying prime i used to work for uh mozilla in germany building a search engine competitor to google and it was pretty much pressured by google to stop that the search engine went on to be brave search now brave's making moves brave did something really smart they made the first okay so i'm this is going to be the hottest take i've ever had the only cryptocurrency i've seen that has any form of anything was braves and what i mean by brave is that they tied a currency to advertising and then when you use their browser and get advertised to you get some of that same money so it's like it's directly tied to money and i thought that was i thought it was like a pretty good idea brave makes funny ads they make funny ads i thought it was like a pretty good idea like out of all cryptocurrency i've seen which all of it is usually pretty stupid right when people are like bitcoin's a value store and i'm like yeah for a value store to have something there has to be value right you are a value store of perception which is the craziest form of value ever okay you can't why are you saying this right but bat at least like it has a real thing right it's directly tied to a real asset which i thought was really smart right uh monero monero's i mean monero is interesting at least it's it's private it's private sending right it's all very very private you can't trace anything is that good is that bad have they already figured out a way to trace it probably i mean the government cracked a tour network in like no time so have they figured out things to do with it probably real talk they've probably figured out all sorts of stuff uh you know i don't know anyways the name is the primagen
