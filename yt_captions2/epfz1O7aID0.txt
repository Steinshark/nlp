learning to code was one of the best decisions of my life he allowed me to escape a life that i hated and get my foot in the door into one of the most in-demand industries in the world and start building the career of my dreams the court are true that i wanna give to you in this video is that for most people who start to learn coding this is not the reality because 99 of people have absolutely no idea how to learn coding properly to the point where you can actually get these results the real rewards go to the top one percent but luckily for you i have spent a lot of time looking at the kind of people who are in the top one percent of programmers who are actually getting these hefty salaries who are actually like literally world-class at the skill of programming itself so i want to give you three keys the three things that distinguish these top one percent of programmers from the rest of the pack but then i thought to myself like even these three keys are really not enough because there's one more secret this secret what i call the fourth key that even i really only realized in like the past year that has allowed me to not only be greater coding but actually get something that is even more valuable than the skill of coding itself but before that make sure you pay attention carefully because this lost secret will not make any sense for you if you don't master these first three keys yeah so let's get started first thing that you really need to understand is that the top one percent they all have a system that allows them to learn efficiently and to keep their life organized and this past week i actually released a video where i go through a version of this system that i've now made available to people so if you don't have this kind of system for yourself yet i recommend you go check that video out it's gonna be the first link in the description down below so now let's talk about the first key that differentiates the top one percent from the 99 of programs so every year countless of people take their first job about free code camp or the origin project or if they're really serious they might even check out my premium flagship program python developer masterclass and they might even use the code imc for a sweet discount on the program anyway the thing is that even these top one percent they really all star in the same places they have access to the exact same information as you do so what is it then that differentiates top one percent from the 99 if everyone has access to the same information about coding well the first differentiating key is relating to how the top one percent use this information your average individual who learns to code tends to approach learning in the traditional way the focus is on memorization and they often seek knowledge passively by reading or by watching some videos and of course there's nothing wrong with starting with this is of course how you need to start you need to learn the basics somehow from someone but the mistake lies in what happens next whereas the 99 keep obsessing about watching or reading about some more and more niche details around kodi what they don't realize is that this is not actually how the human brain is designed to learn but the top one percent whether deliberately or by luck have realized that the human brain really only learns through action they focus on the action they focus on what they can make with code not on like what they can learn and things like this and when you really think about this like this makes sense like if you think of like a shoemaker they're not gonna go and just like learn in theory like all the things about shoes the laces like the insoles and whatever without actually making a shoe themselves like that wouldn't make any sense you wouldn't want your shoes to be made by someone who's just read books about it the same is the case with building software no one wants to hire a person who has never built real software so if you're really serious about living past the 99 of programmers you need to be willing to get your hands dirty as early as possible and start building real projects because the first key that differentiates the top one percent from the 99 is that they have a massive bias fraction like sure your first creations are not exactly gonna be masterpieces but all of us have to get through these scrappy beginnings at some point you need to start doing that as early as possible through having a bias for action and to see coding as a craft as an art to be used to create something not as this like science like chemistry where you're supposed to like memorize all these details and like see this is like this is a collection of facts because that is not at all where the value of coding comes from so if the first key was related to your attitude towards coding the second key is really related to your attitude towards work itself but really what does it mean to be above the 99 well it means to be above normal people meaning that you who cannot be a normal person you cannot see yourself as just a regular person who does regular person things and makes regular person decisions because making decisions like regular people is going to lead to a regular life so then we have to ask ourselves if we want to become top one percent software engineers to actually get these amazing results remember which are the things that we actually won at the end of the day what are the decisions that the 99 are doing all the time that we basically want to avoid and this might sound like a difficult question but if you really think about it like it's pretty easy to tell why most people aren't successful like it's currently a friday night as i'm filming this here in finland what i'm most people doing on a friday night well they're probably out drinking or maybe they're just like relaxing because i've deserved it at the end of my very tough week or like whatever what am i doing well i am filming these youtube videos because this is my business that is making me money and that is making me successful and i have chosen to prioritize my success and prioritize my career in the season of life that i am in so therefore i am doing very non-normal people things because i have chosen that i don't want to live that regular person life so what does this mean for you this means that when your friends ask you to come out drinking with them you're probably gonna have to say no more times than in the moment you would like and yes most people by definition of them being most people are gonna think that's weird they're gonna think well why are you spending your time coding like shouldn't you be doing this or that they're gonna think that it's not normal because by definition it is not normal but if you want top one percent results you need to be comfortable and willing to make decisions that normal people don't make and that is exactly what key number two is all about so these first two keys are really foundational but now let's get more specific so of course we all know the entire back there's a lot of languages and frameworks that you could be learning and let me just say what no one else will say they all have their place just because one person is learning c plus plus or another person is learning javascript it doesn't mean that any of them inherently have a better chance of getting you into the top one percent and into these really decisions or great positions in your career or whatever your goal is everything really just depends so let me just give you a sort of a framework to think about what you should be learning so the first thing to understand is that to be really great at anything you need to have a focus focus is the real currency of this day and age it's like fighting with a shotgun versus a sniper rifle sure that guy with the shotgun is probably gonna make some damage to a lot of different targets but you could be damn sure that if your goal is just to master one thing the guy with the sniper rifle who sets his sights breathes in and out and shoots is so much more like lead to actually hit that target so how do you pick your target well it really just depends on what you are interested in i've made a video of this in the past which i will also leave down below in the description but broadly for example if you want to learn game development you should just look into what other languages and frameworks used in that area if you want to make a desktop application you should decide okay do i want to make it for windows do i want to make it for mac or do i want to make it cross-platform just that decision will decide your language and framework for you so really you shouldn't be thinking about what language to learn you should be thinking about specifically what types of projects and things do you want to build slash be working on in your career and that decision will usually make the decision of language and framework for you so these are the three foundational keys that if you master and you just stick to it for long enough you will probably make it into the top one percent of programmers but then when i got to this point of planning the video i realized that just becoming really good at coding is really not worth it in and of itself like why are we trying to learn the code well we're trying to learn the code because we want some result as a result of it we want a great life we want money we want a certain kind of career and now having tried a couple of different parts around programming i've certainly realized that all of them are not created equal at all illustrate what i mean by this let me give you a story from my own life so when i got into coding i got into it for a few specific reasons number one i wanted to have a lucrative career like who wouldn't i wanted a career where i could have more freedom specifically i'd seen a lot of the time programmers are able to work from home they don't necessarily have as many meetings during their day and the third thing i wanted is i wanted to have a stimulating work something that was actually interesting and like logically challenging to my brains because those are the kinds of things that i really enjoy working in but had i made a slight pivot in like the exact direction of my career i could have got these three things much better for example rather than becoming a traditional software developer working for a big company had i instead become a freelancer or went for building my own starter from the get-go as i'm doing right now i could have got more freedom because i wouldn't have had a job i could have got even more pay as a freelancer or more potential for pay as a startup at least if you succeed and even more stimulating work because the thing is if you work for a big company as a software engineer your work is probably not actually going to be that stimulating like i can tell this from experience you're working on a very specific thing that was my experience so had i more properly considered what specific area of programming or what kind of programming career was right for me i would have got these actual results which we actually wanted much much sooner and to a much higher degree a lot of people start learning the code just because they heard online that it's like a great skill to learn from people like me or whatever but when you need to consider that just learning the code doesn't automatically give you an amazing life what are these results that you actually want like maybe you are the opposite of me and you want just like a very chilled nine-to-five life and you just want the stability of that salary those are completely opposite goals for me in many ways those two goals call for a completely separate path within programming for you that nine to five traditional part that was not right for me could be absolutely perfect whereas if you went to try to work for a startup or start freelancing you might absolutely hate it and realize that your previous job might have been better in the first place and maybe at the end of all of this you realize that actually coding isn't even the best way to give you the life that you want maybe there is an easier and better way and that is completely fine as well but the fourth and last key that is like the most important one is to be clear on your why because that thing that why is actually the thing that is eventually gonna keep you going in the first place because learning the code is freaking hard so unless you have this very clear why you're probably gonna quit before you get there anyway so right now you're probably wondering like okay what are these actual like different paths with encoding like what do you mean and you're probably also wondering okay who is each path right for how do i know right why for me and because this video is already way too long what i'm gonna do is next week i'm gonna send an email on my newsletter where i break these paths down and i prescribe exactly which one is right for your situation so if you want to get that email make sure to go and sign up to my newsletter down below it's absolutely free to sign up and sure yeah i want your email transparently when you sign up you also get some free notion templates that i've sent to everyone who signs up and after that no matter which path you choose no matter what you decide to do if you want to be in the top one percent of programmers you need a system you need something to track your progress to log your project to take notes so if that is something that you don't yet have i made a video down below that's gonna be the first link you can also click on here where i talk in a lot more detail about the system that i have actually created and made available to people so i highly recommend you go watch that next
