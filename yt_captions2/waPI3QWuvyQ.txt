even if you have been living under a 
rock for the past i would say two years   there has been no way you haven't heard the 
hype about cryptocurrency wherever you turn   whether it be on the news social media or to your 
friends everyone is talking about cryptocurrency   some people are totally for it and the next person 
thinks it is completely garbage and why are people   even spending their money or time on it today i'm 
going to be talking to you about what exactly is   cryptocurrency what is the hype around it why is 
there hype around it how does it work and if you   choose to what are some things i focus on anyways 
when investing in cryptocurrency i want to make   it very very clear right at the start of this 
video this is not a video to tell you one way   or the other if crypto is good or bad what you 
should do with your money or anything like that   i am totally not for that and that's not what 
my platform is about rather because it is such   a popular topic i really wanted to talk to you 
today and just provide you with the information   of what exactly it is in very simple and easy to 
understand terms so you can make those decisions   for yourself before we get started though 
make sure to hit that subscribe button for   more tech encoding related content give this video 
a thumbs up and okay let's just dive right into it   before we get into this video though one 
thing we need to answer right off the bat   is well what exactly is cryptocurrency when you 
think cryptocurrency think of it as a digital or   virtual currency that is secured by cryptography 
this makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or   double spend now i'm sure many of us have heard of 
the most popular cryptocurrency which is bitcoin   bitcoin launched in 2009 and at the time it didn't 
have much competition that is why a lot of people   who aren't necessarily extremely familiar with 
cryptocurrency always tie cryptocurrency and   bitcoin right together mostly because it was the 
first one that ever gained popularity and was   really spoken about it kind of started all this 
hype fast forward to today there are thousands and   thousands of different types of cryptocurrencies 
on the market and there are three main principles   a lot of them are established around the first one 
being cryptocurrencies are not issued regulated or   backed by a central authority such as a bank they 
are created using a distributed ledger blockchain   and peer-to-peer review bitcoin and really other 
coins are encrypted or secured with specialized   computer code called cryptography as someone's 
assets cryptocurrencies are generally stored   in digital wallets commonly known as blockchain 
wallets which allows users to manage and trade   their coins some other kinds of cryptocurrencies 
other than bitcoin that you might have heard of   include uh ethereum litecoin uh polka dot 
bitcoin cash stellar and so many more as i   mentioned there's literally thousands of different 
ones i wanted to share with you just exactly how   do transactions work uh and for this we're going 
to use the example of the cryptocurrency bitcoin   and i think this is really important to talk 
about exactly how transactions work because   for me anyways it gave me a clear understanding 
of kind of the whole flow and made it more made   cryptocurrency make more sense to me okay for 
this example i'm going to use harry and mugs as   the people they're actually my two dogs but as you 
know i am dog obsessed so harry and mugs so let's   consider a transaction is taking place between 
harry and muggs harry is sending mugs some bitcoin   this transaction is signed by harry's private 
key which is masked by cryptography once it is   signed the transaction is broadcasted in the 
network and almost everyone in the network is   now aware of this trade however it's important 
to note at this point it has yet to be confirmed   and a dealing in cryptocurrency is only valid once 
it's been confirmed this is where miners come into   the picture so miners will actually validate the 
transaction between harry and mugs and spread   it onto the blockchain this transaction now will 
become part of the database so then it brings us   to the question why are people even using bitcoins 
or cryptocurrency what makes them so secure so for   one thing as i mentioned earlier each bitcoin or 
cryptocurrency has an association to a specific   key or address which makes each one unique 
okay so you're probably asking at this point   if cryptocurrency is so amazing and so secure why 
is there so much controversy around it and there   are a variety of reasons which brings controversy 
to cryptocurrency i think the main one honestly   is social media and that's just my opinion but 
because so much of cryptocurrencies are really   controlled in a sense by social media by what 
is said about them on social media they really   fluctuate and if a prominent figure says to buy 
this cryptocurrency or that one or this one sucks   it has a huge huge impact on the market and 
this brings me to i think one of the biggest   points about cryptocurrencies and why it is so 
controversial is volatility so it there's our   extreme swings in the price of bitcoin and other 
digital currencies as i'm sure many of you have   heard about another big thing about cryptocurrency 
which actually i didn't really understand until   recently is the environmental concerns around it 
so there's actually bitcoin has a huge impact on   the environment and could be another big problem 
that cryptocurrencies are facing and why this   is is because the mining equipment that is used 
requires a lot a lot a lot of electricity to run   because this is so new and so popular a lot of 
people a lot of different i don't even want to say   companies but there's a lot of people out there 
trying to scam others i mean even if you go on   social media nowadays you always see those fake 
accounts of getting into bitcoin or blockchain   or anything like that and trying to sell you or 
any of those really scammy kind of channels and   it really brings bad name to cryptocurrencies and 
really brings down the reputation so with anything   that is so new so popular and potential of being 
of having so much money made there's obviously   gonna be scams and with that really brings down i 
think cryptocurrency's reputation as a whole okay   last thing i want to talk about is three rules 
that i follow when investing in cryptocurrency   now once again this is just speaking from my 
personal experience i'm not telling you what to do   but if you are considering looking into investing 
into it i just want to share with you some of the   things that i follow the first one is i do 
my research before investing and this isn't   just going on social media or reading elon 
musk's recent tweets but actually actually   doing my research and looking into it speaking 
to people i trust experts i trust in my real life   not that are just online and i don't know but 
actually speaking to real humans that are very   much more knowledgeable in these subjects than i 
am who maybe do this for a living or maybe do this   a lot on the side and have a huge passion in 
it but really finding the experts to speak to   the second thing if you are going to do this you 
need to make security your number one priority   there actually recently was an individual an art 
dealer in new york who had i think it was around   two million dollars of nfts stolen because he 
was using a virtual wallet and over a phishing   attack the virtual wallet was able to be hacked 
and the nfts were stolen so security needs to be   your number one priority and one of the best ways 
to do that is actually by having a hard wallet   so a physical wallet that you can actually plug 
into the web versus just having a plug-in on your   computer and my third piece of advice that 
i follow anyways only invest what you are   willing to lose especially when it comes to 
cryptocurrency this is so important because   as i mentioned earlier it goes up and down 
and it can be a roller coaster of a ride   so make sure you are investing only what you are 
willing to lose because otherwise you can get very   emotional about it and you can't have emotions 
in this kind of thing so for this i follow the   awareness of if i was to lose this tomorrow would 
i be okay could i go on not just investing my   life savings in it okay i hope you enjoyed this 
video and it gave you more insight to exactly   what cryptocurrency is in a very friendly way and
