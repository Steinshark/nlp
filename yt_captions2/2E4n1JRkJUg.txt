there's a weird point in the career of a documentary shooter when you suddenly realize that what used to be your hobby has turned into the thing that pays your bills figuring out what to charge that you can maximize your income is something we all have to deal with whether you want to or not for anything like me you probably didn't get into this business for the money but now that you're starting to take it seriously it's time to sort out your rates and make sure you get paid what you deserve for your gigs so in this video i'm going to get into the most common career progressions and financial brackets that the majority of documentary cinematographers will go through on their way to the top and what i've found to be the normal rates you can expect to get at each step all the way from camera assistant to series dp and at the end i'll get into what you can do to drive your earning potential even higher through gear rentals which is something that's been huge for me in terms of building up my kit and making extra cash at the same time the good news is that even though there is no magic bullet solution to get you where you want to be quickly documentary filmmaking can be a pretty well-paying job if you price yourself right so let's get into it hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsyth and on this channel i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer if you're into that kind of thing make sure to hit the subscribe button because i've got new videos coming out every week as you can probably see i am out of the hotel room i've been in for the last few weeks and back home but my apartment is a disaster of half pack bags right now so i didn't have the time to set everything up really nicely sorry if the messy workbench triggers your ocd but it's all i can do for now all right one thing i need to say before we start talking about money and how to make it is that if you're just starting out and by that i mean you've never really shot anything or had a paid job in film before you should absolutely think about working for free for a bit to gain experience obviously it's always better to get paid if possible but i've definitely run into more than a few aspiring filmmakers who refuse to work for free because they think that even though they have no experience of any kind that they're somehow owed a good day rate just for wanting to be a documentary cinematographer i'm sorry to say that no matter how good your taste in film might be no one is really looking to pay you much at this stage so if you can set aside your ego you'll probably get your foot in the door a lot faster working for free can mean creating your own projects that you sell or sell fun or if we change the word free to intern or volunteer it can mean giving up your time on other people's productions to get your hands on gear and learn the ropes a bit but until you have a one to two minute show reel and enough onset experience to actually do one of these jobs for real you're much better off volunteering then buying gear and waiting for the phone to ring in my opinion anyways this also isn't a video for people who want to make indie projects on their own and release them online and that's a really cool pursuit and something that i do as well but in this video i'm talking more about the professional documentary film industry where people get hired on a day rate to complete big projects usually in teams neither side of this business is better than the other but i'd say the mainstream industry pays a lot better than the indie world if you're able to get to a point where you've won a bunch of awards and netflix and amazon are knocking on your door for your next original film idea that obviously changes but for most of us especially when you're just starting out jobs pay the bills also for the purposes of this video i'm going to be talking mainly about my personal experiences working for us or european-based production companies there aren't any rules about this raids this is just what i've found to be true during my own career and obviously prices vary a lot depending on where you live but most companies will pay similar rates when doing an international shoot it's a really frustrating reality in the world that not all filmmaking markets pay the same and for my international friends it can be a lot harder to lock down similar rates when working locally but even though that sucks i get it if you can get connected with international crews coming to your city or country the good ones will hopefully pay you the same as they would from someone from their home country so these rates can still be useful as a guide in those situations like i used to live in mexico and while most of the local mexican production companies paid less on average than the us ones my mexican friends who worked on international crews weren't paid less for being mexican which is exactly as it should be so before you write this stuff off as non-applicable to you because you don't live in the u.s and i don't either for what it's worth i'd suggest working on your networking games so you can get those calls when production companies come to your country or city even for me living in canada the rates here are quite a bit lower than what my u.s friends can make so i spend a ton of time and energy making and maintaining contacts in new york and la so that when good gigs come north of the border i might be on the short list for crew i did the same thing when i was living in mexico and i paid out of pocket for my own trips to new york work at least once a year to do meetings and without doing that i doubt i would have gotten the jobs i did it worked for me and it can work for you too no matter what country you're from alright so that was a long preamble i know but i had to get it out so assuming you've done the basic groundwork what's the first step in the ladder of professional documentary cinematography and what can you expect to earn well before you can be put on the list of dps for hire most of us are going to spend some amount of time working as a camera assistant normally called an ac for short who knows why the initials ac and camera system are the opposite i think it's something to do with different job titles in the british versus u.s industries but if anyone knows for sure post in the comments down below i have no idea an ac's job is usually to support the camera team and unlike on a hollywood set where one person might do nothing other than pull focus well another one only changes lenses undocks the ac basically does whatever is needed in a given moment to make the shooter's lives easier that means anticipating problems before they happen like getting a new battery before the old one dies keeping tabs on the space left on the memory cards organizing media for easy backups setting up lights blacking out windows putting lav mics on characters or really anything else that the dp might need help with a really good ac will see the problems coming before they happen and if you can do this yourself you'll find that dps want you back again and again i'd say on the low end an acc charge about 250 a day but that you should try and bump that up to 350 as quickly as possible for me this is the first rung of professional day rates for cinematographers and a good ac can be worth every penny these rates are based on my own personal experiences and they're not written in stone so if you can get more ask for more but over the years i found 250 to 350 to be about normal for a hard-working ac and i'd say that's a good starting point when you're negotiating from here if you do a good job and the dp likes you and especially if you work on your networking and stay in touch with the people in the production office you might get a bump to a hybrid roll something like an ac slash cam off i've heard this role called a swing tech before or sometimes a field assistant i'm actually sure it has an official job title it basically means you're still the junior person on the camera team but you get to shoot and maybe fly drones as well as assisting the dps which gives you experience and if the show allows it shots for your real just make sure you actually get the shots before the production ends because trust me you'll never get them back from the office after everyone goes home at this stage you're an experienced ac and you make everyone's life easier you're still not a full-on shooter but you might be at the cusp of it and i'd probably try and get about 450 a day minimum for this i've been paid up to 650 a day for this role but those were extremely hard jobs in remote places and that's on the high end with a lot of shooting time and drone flying expected of me but if you're doing a lot of shooting on the production 450 seems like a pretty fair day rate in my opinion the next step is b cam which is the second shooter who takes their lead from the dp to get these jobs consistently you need to be able to know how to cross shoot effectively how to read what the acam is doing and how they're shooting a scene so you get complementary shots like maybe you're shooting the details and whites while the acam covers the medium shots or something like that and you need to know when to get out of the way like when the acam is on something important a bad b cam will constantly pop into the frame because they don't know what the acam is seeing or their shots will be way different than the acam making it really hard to cut things in post so if you're going after jobs like this you should probably have a decent amount of shooting and drone flying experience beforehand you should also know how to use a cinema camera really well so when the dp frantically asks you to grab a camera and start filming the third angle or get the drone up super fast you know exactly what they're talking about and you can make it happen quickly your framing composition should be solid as well so that the dp knows that when they tell you to cover something they don't have to review the footage because they're confident that you can make it look good without being micromanaged speaking from personal experience there's nothing scary as a dp than not trusting your bcam to nail their shots or looking through the dailies at the end of a shoot and realizing that all their compositions were off there's really no way to fast track this process and developing your eye takes time for me still's photography was really good training for this but the real secret is just time and a crazy amount of practice i'd say for a b cam spot you should charge around 550 a day with 650 being a pretty solid rate as a b cam thinking about leveling up to dp you should be trying to suck up as much knowledge about what the dp is doing so that when you finally get the bump up you're not overwhelmed i mean let's be honest you will be overwhelmed but at least you'll be able to stay calm and get through it once you've proven yourself a few times as a solid bcam eventually someone will take a chance on you as a lead dp this will probably happen on smaller productions first but if you do a good job your name will be passed around more and more the world of doc production really is pretty small at the higher levels and everyone wants to work with their friends so do a good job be a nice person and you will get hired and like i said a second ago you should have your photography framing and scene coverage technique pretty dialed in before you start taking lead dp jobs so don't be mad if it isn't happening as quickly as you might want you definitely don't want to take a dp job before you're ready and blow it because you don't have the necessary base skills fake until you make it is good advice most of the time but not at the professional level where the stakes of messing up are higher that's just going to hurt your reputation and make you feel better as a baseline for a dp i would try to charge a minimum of 650 a day if you're really new but try and get it up to 750 after a few successful jobs once you've proven that you can do it i'd suggest that 850 to 1000 is a really solid rate for a seasoned doc dp with most production companies not wanting to pay much more than that unless you've got some serious awards or credits under your name i don't know that many documentary dps regularly making more than a thousand dollars a day just on their day rate though if you win an oscar or an emmy this might be more realistic this is where things sort of cap out on a day rate in the documentary world and if you really want to earn more than that you probably need to branch into the world of commercials you might get less you might get even more but those rates have been pretty normal at least in my experience now making 850 a day is nothing to complain about in my opinion is especially considering how many people out there work jobs they hate for minimum wage just to get by but if you're super business minded there is something else dpus can do to bring in more cash on top of their rates and that's by renting gear this can be a very polarizing subject and especially in the commercial and narrative worlds many people will say that dps don't ever need to own a camera since a lot of those productions shoot on aries or red cameras that are really expensive it probably does make sense for most people just to rent on the day rather than mortgage their house for a set of lenses but the doc world is a little bit different and there are many times when having your own gear is an advantage or even expected especially when you're starting out later on when a big crew flies into your city with 50 pelican cases they might want to shoot on their stuff but at the start having all the necessary gear can pretty much be a condition of getting the job for me especially when i was living in cambodia and mexico most of the job offers i got required me to have the basic gear and while that can be an expensive investment the good news is that you can usually charge for it before you buy anything though i'd say to first figure out what gear the production companies who hire you are using and then get as many of those things as you can slowly over time i went with sony cameras because i noticed most production companies i was working on were shooting fs7s or r55s so i knew that if i got one of those the production managers would be happy to pay for and you can charge more for just the camera lenses tripods drones easy rigs whatever lights you can charge for them all if the production wants to use them one note of caution though is that buying gear just to rent can be a slippery slope because you can easily spend way too much money so make sure you're actually able to rent this stuff before you over invest but if you do it right it's possible that your gear can actually make more money than you a quick hack for setting your prices is to just do a quick check of what local rental houses charge then charge 10 to 15 percent less when a company asks you for your rates send them the link to the rental house tell them you're charging 15 percent less and it should be a no-brainer for them here where i live in vancouver and fx9 rents for just under 400 a day with discounts for longer rentals and that doesn't include batteries lenses or anything other than the camera body that adds up super fast when you factor in all the other accessories you'll be adding even if you charge 20 less be honest with yourself though about the volume of work you have if you're renting stuff out regularly this can easily double your income if no one is renting this stuff from you though you can just as easily dig yourself into a deep financial hole buying things that don't really earn you anything back for me getting into rentals only really makes sense when you're regularly being asked to work as a pcam or a dp as these are the kind of jobs where they want high-end gear so if you're still acing most of the time spending 25 grand on camera gear probably isn't the best business plan just worry about building your reel and practicing as much as possible and the big year will come eventually instead i'd probably start out buying used older model cameras and never ever buy gear on credit no matter how 10 might seem it's all about balance and timing here but if you do it right renting your gear can make a big financial difference now if these prices seem really high it's because we're all freelancers and sometimes we have to deal with big droughts between jobs we're paid for the lack of security and stability and considering that i need to buy my own insurance gear and save for a pension-free retirement you need to charge a lot now obviously if i worked at these prices five days a week for 50 weeks of the year i'd be doing pretty well for myself god damn right but the reality is that i might go weeks or months or many months without work during a dry spell and the high day rates reflect on uncertainty let me know in the comments what you personally charge for each of these jobs and let's compare the last thing i'll say here is that if there's something you really want to work on but they're not meeting your day rates do it anyways there's more ways to be paid in this life than cash so don't be so stubborn and refuse to drop your prices even if the project seems amazing i do it all the time and i've been doing this for over a decade alright that's it hope this video helped and that it gave you some ideas for how to price yourself in the world of documentary cinematography if you like that one think about subscribing so i can keep bringing out videos like this every week and if you did like that one maybe check out this other video i made on five times new filmmakers should think about working for free see ya foreign [music]
