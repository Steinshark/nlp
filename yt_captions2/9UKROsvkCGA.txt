we're here in micro center's brand new flagship store and they've given us full rain to build the most badass pc we can but we're not going to do just any pc oh this guy right here meet francis our latest sleeper pc by the end of this video it's going to be real fast thanks to micro center for sponsoring this video new micro center customers get a free 240 gigabyte ssd click the link in the description to get yours today no purchase necessary in-store only limit one for customer we're back here in the service center and the first thing we need to do is figure out what exactly we can fit into this case so nicholas has been working on this for the past week so it can accept modern components although this is obviously not like you know a massive modern pc case we're not going to be able to fit your standard stuff in here so first thing we need an matx motherboard atx is clearly not going to fit although it does look like we're going to be able to put in a full-size power supply which is nice it looks like we only have a 90 millimeter fan in the back here which means full size like an nhd 15 or something like that is not going to be able to go in unfortunately now we do have two options so we have this stupid bracket thing here for an aio we need to drill it it's going to be a terrible time if i can get away without using it i'm going to be a lot happier what how big of an air cooler we can get we will see first boss the tech bar looks like the only liquor they have is of the isopropyl variety but you know they'll repair your stuff for you heaps the laptop look at this two rows deep all the way down here heck yeah back here past the laptops are all of their you know complete systems if you're into that sort of a thing you don't always want to build your own pc peeps and monitors too geez this is one area that i'm super stoked about and that i've never seen in a physical store before 3d printer stuff look at this you can come in here and be like oh yeah this filament that's the color that it is instead of just having to trust some random photo on the internet and be like oh yeah what's the difference between gold and yellow now i can tell wow we even got some sls stuff here if you're into model making damn there's so much stuff in here that'll just save your bacon when you're in the middle of a project and you find out like oh yes i need this hat and normally you have to wait like two weeks on amazon here's our first spot that we're going to put some stuff in our cart though oh my god they have the pro siphon this thing's sick oh there's no way this is gonna fit this is one of the largest coolers ever yup shadow rock 3 will definitely fit so that's an option the salomon flower cooler that would also fit but i don't want to use it i think we got our cooler cooler master stealth rgb bit of an oxymoron but you know it's gonna fit and it seems like the largest one that will so there we go goodbye be quiet all right what are we feeling for a motherboard today dennis i'm kind of thinking amd what about this guy right here'5 dollars limit one for household here we go are you thinking ryzen five maybe ryzen seven 5800x i think this is going to be our tip oh this is wicked a bunch of water cooling supplies you know you can fill it without doing it like the sketchy way got a whole bunch of tubing here we of course are going to have one hacking powerful gpu in this thing so we need a power supply to suit it i think this one right here will do just fine 1200 watts evga p2 that's a lot of watts on this side over here we have all of our amd gpus now buying a gpu is a bit different you can't just like go in here and grab one you have to actually enter a lottery system and then that way they're able to track it and make sure that people aren't sculpting all of the gps it's actually pretty safe if we move down here there's a bunch of 3080 ti's but i don't think any of those will fit in our case wow would you look at that yeah that's a legit perfect heaps of ssds all along this wall but the one that interests me is raiding here western digital two terabyte hundred fifty dollars off wicked this thing's gonna be awesome this is going to be really cool it isn't fully operational yet but this is going to be their pc builder so you'll be able to come in here and be like okay i want a 30 70 an 11 900k yada yada and then they just bring you all the components and if you want they can put it all together for you in here we have the chassis garage we don't need a case ready for the best one in the store but they have over a hundred of them in here so if you want to look at a pc case this is where you do it look someone forgot their ltt water bottle here i hope they remember and come get it that'll be a sin ltt store.com final part of our build here just need some ram i'm thinking of going with this t-force 4000 megahertz c16 32 gigabytes of the stuff this is going to be super fast all right let's go and build it first thing i want to get out of the way is the cpu and cooler because if that doesn't fit we are boned oh wow it's gonna be close yes i'm happy tape it i see what the problem is everyone else on their dimensions did height length width cooler master for whatever reason did length width height i need to do a return i said earlier for cooling we're going to use the kraken m22 from nzxt it's rgb and should more than be enough for cooling our pc well let me use the speed hole before i permanently put anything else into place we're going to just do a nice test fit and see if we need to do the walk or shame again they have this really cool fantex halo digital rgb frame that's able to just go on the outside and fit in here and then we can just use our normal non-rgb fan and it's still going to look sweet star of the show rtx 3070 oh loads of space look at that no problem at all so we ran into a little bit of an issue that goes in there like that and pretty standard aio mount in the front but the problem that we have is that we need to have fan screws that go through here through this little bit of sheet metal and then out the back and the ones that it came with just simply are not long enough the fortunate thing is that here they do really wild exotic builds and i just so happen to have really long 632 screws for exactly situations like this so not the most beautiful thing ever but you won't be able to see it anyway storage time so two terabyte ssd should be more than enough i'm actually not totally sure if this is pcie gen 4. that would have been good to look forward i don't believe it is which is really a mistake on my bit but it was on sale so this is an exceptionally large one and again 1200 watts quite impressive i hope it just fits in it should that is comically large for this case so small problem one of our screws isn't quite long enough to fit through as you can see there's kind of this little indent here and that's stopping me from being able to get at it now was our beginning method a success oh perfect we did it this is the last bit hit that all right it's time to go i actually have a feeling this isn't going to work this is a amd 3000 certified motherboard not 5000 and it does not have bios flashback which is a huge pain in the butt actually oh and the nzxt logo goes upside down awesome that just worked we have our ryzen 7 5800x 32 gigabytes of rams use both of our stuff and our ssd was picked up as well so we are golden yeah not the most functional cd drives ever there we go now what you might be thinking is oh no now your cpu cooler has no air at all nice and quiet real fast all right let's test this thing out and see if it actually works so here in far cry 5 i'm gonna close the speed hole and see what happens not bad 160 fps on ultra i will take that for sure oh yeah our cpu is up to 86 degrees that's not ideal let's uh let's open the speed hole nice so speed hole opened 74 degrees is our maximum temperature on the cpu which is really not bad i would not suggest this pc would be great if you're like a professional video editor or something like that it is you know the airflow is not the best ever this chassis was never intended for like anywhere near this amount of componentry but cinebench it's hot for sure we're up to 90 degrees on the cpu even with the speed hole engaged but it held all core at four and a half gigahertz yeah zoomed in there after it did a dentist but uh you'll have to trust me i did four and a half gigahertz the whole time and it was just fine this is the sort of thing where it has a bit of an overclock from the factory with this motherboard if we ran in stock settings like like three and a half gigahertz is the stock that it's supposed to be at it would be more than fine all right francis is certified an awesome little sleeper let's go and put it on the shelf and see who gets it [music] thank you foreign [music] do you want to play retro games though it's it's not going to be great for that it might be a bit too fast what do you mean what do you mean kind of sauce yeah are you yeah well do you want to open it yeah yeah it's a 30 70. for 20 it's not a bad deal yeah do you want a little full specs sure so ryzen 7 5800x 32 gigs of ram 4 000 megahertz 1200 watt power supply two terabyte ssd any books all right not a not a bad deal i have to say um thank you it's a huge thanks to micro center for sponsoring this video and if you guys liked it hit like get subscribed i don't know what video should we throw them to dennis last micro center one where linus sold a pc for 20 bucks as well all right see you later
