it is august 23rd 2023 and you're watching the code report most of it let's go code report deville first developers will never admit it but that game-changing new app they're building probably could have just been an excel spreadsheet excel it's facts all which came out in 1985 could be the single most important piece of software for our modern service-based economy working with excel formulas at my dead end white collar job is actually where i got my first taste of programming i used formulas to figure out that i would never be able to own a house unless i got a higher paying job but you can't do real people with excel it is possible to hook it up with visual basic but that's just way too microsofty luckily he tweeted out this meme this meme is so good i cannot believe i cannot believe i never saw this but damn this is the greatest this is the greatest meme of all time as of yesterday microsoft excel will now support python a feature developed in collaboration with the creator of python guido van rossum which is totally awesome here's how it'll work in excel you have access to this new pi formula which can run python code against the data in your spreadsheet like for example if you want to put your data into a pandas data frame you can now accomplish that by simply highlighting your data and running the corresponding python code another huge i feel like it would have been nice if you could just have a is this like jupiter book but microsoft just classically being an [ __ ] is that all i'm saying right here is this just jupiter book but that jupiter book but more annoying jupiter book except for your data source is in an excel spreadsheet is that what we're saying it's worse yeah there's just it's just jupiter book but your database is your ex excel spreadsheet why would you ever want this i'm i feel like there's because the people that are doing all this intense visualization and everything they're doing it in jupiter book or they're doing it with a little cli tool i'm a little confused as why this is a w real talk i'm a little confused as to why anyone would want this i use excel for the simple stuff i'm just trying to show a w and that's it here's a w here's the result take this thing give me a graph that's that uh it's for normies no it's not for normies this ain't for normies okay you know what's for normies you know what you know this okay normies is when you want to simply just just like one two three four five bar graph it that's normies okay this ain't it okay learning how to make a multi-graph single image whatever you call this crap matplotlib it's just non-trivial it's annoying which benefit is the ability to use python databiz packages like seabourn and matplotlib more importantly though it allows developers to write their own custom functions that can wrangle and clean real world data sets which can be fed to the hungry ais in fact you could even do machine learning directly in your spreadsheet with tools like scikit learn that's pretty cool i don't understand the purpose of this the amount of people that are going to be debugging excel for the rest of their life this is just it honestly sounds like the worst possible future this sound this is oh people are gonna hate me for saying this this one's gonna be too spicy but we'll go for it anyways all right boys there's a polish [ __ ] we're stepping clean into it sounds like reaction react server components for for excel this sounds crazy well but don't expect it to train deep learning models with tools like pi torch and tensorflow and that brings us to the one major caveat the industry your python code does not run locally but instead runs in microsoft's azure cloud somehow microsoft cannot help but just eee everything your stuff on the cloud how is anyone ever going to use this what company wants to send their spreadsheet data up to microsoft what the hell kind of decision was this microsoft's so horny for your data all the time this will of course keep you safe from the dangers of spreadsheets and also from the hull that is managing your python versions locally they teamed up with anaconda to create a standard runtime for running python and fire ship is so good at this instead of becoming upset he's just given you the exactness of it all but man i ain't liking this i don't like this uh the fact that they run it on their cloud i know anaconda blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah but i feel like you could have accomplished this locally okay i feel like you could have done this locally sell in azure however being able to run python locally is far more privacy friendly and would be faster in most situations yeah the problem is that microsoft then wouldn't have a product to sell you you could use linux and run libra off it yes this is a product oh you've you've actually generated 17 graphs but we only allow for 16. that's 15 a month for 17 to 32 graphs do you see so right now your graphing limit uh you know oh actually you've done too many it's the enterprise graphing solution that you need that will be a thousand dollars oh i'm sorry you hired developers and built an entire ecosystem and didn't know about that i'm so sorry geez do you want to use copilot as well you want copilot integrated that's also forty dollars a month that's hey doc that's 40 a month for co-pilot to write your graphs inside microsoft excel yeah a lot of you didn't see that one coming did you you didn't see the one coming guess how much that's gonna cost you oh yeah oh yeah this is the greatest money grab of all time hey there dummy okay you're right you actually are right this is for normies it's to sell co-pilot to normies to generate crafts in the most entirely too complicated fashion sure you want to be able to just have a simple graph well guess what we got co-pilot and python it's 15 a month for that python 40 a month for that co-pilot look at that we got it for you how much better is this you got abilities ryan winchester is cheering let's uh uh take it back it's paid and it's in the cloud yikes i know all right take it back yeah you better take it back you better take it back sir this which has support for me sorry i'm so angry i'm sorry i i lost it there i'm sorry please forgive me javascript and python it has had those features forever but good luck convincing your boss that's a good idea it's just too free and too open source python and excel is going to be a game changer for the boring ass corporate world for the last few years i've been using google sheets with apps script which is one of the most underrated tools out there it's the same basic idea as excel and python but with javascript i use it for a variety of business related needs like it helps me automate the shipping of t-shirts and stickers to fireship pro members and it can even be used to create custom menus and dialogues however python is a far more powerful language when it comes to data analysis what the this is very very true uh as someone who's recently had to do a lot of data analysis in javascript instead we just built a python process to do the javascript to get the data munch the data and put it into a proper format and then you then use type python to do the actual the thing it's just easier that means is that virtually every white collar worker will now be able to go generate some python code with chatgpt copy and paste it into excel it's going to be co-pilot fireship you know it's going to be copilot okay you know it common problems out there microsoft will be the one running and hosting this code they already have the most powerful ai models and those models will only grow bigger and stronger over time nobody's even close to microsoft right now in the ai race and that's a result of their developer friendly strategy which can be broken down in three steps let's go fire ship let's go oh my goodness the most disappointing moment of my lifetime of my lifetime is when just recently let's see if i can pull it up i don't know if i can pull it up i don't know if i can pull it up uh i cannot believe vs code is free oh come on come on it was just a cup cup nobody got this i should have lowercase these two looking back and just had these three uppercased but look at this you say something nice about vs code and look at that their big worries is like oh no they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna be like charging us now no that ain't what this is about this has nothing to do with the fact that it's free damn yeah it's too subtle i know i struggle with the subtlety sometimes first they embrace the developer community developers developers developers developers developers developer i tried that once at a conference nobody joined in most embarrassing moment of my life then extend developers with awesome new features and tools then i seem to have forgotten what the third step is but this has been the code report thanks for watching and i will see you in the next one i loved it i loved it it hurts it hurts so much it hurts so much that all i want to do is go buy some more microsoft stock because we all know where it's going okay microsoft stock is going this way microsoft going this way and yes i like aspen gold the name is the asmin goldigen
