the daily life of a scrum master i know i'm going to be upset here we go i already think scrum is fake and awful all right hold on we got to get like okay uh verify to continue nah nah i don't want to do that i don't i don't want to i don't want to do that one of the most useless people you've ever met as you've probably guessed i'm a certified scrum master my net impact of any organization i've ever been a part of is zero i had no idea it was going to be this based typically when you go on tik tok you are going for the least based takes possible but this is really good this is this is awesome boring disorganized technology bullet noise is that what it's supposed to be bullet noise i love that just technology technology this is so good everybody knows i'm useless but nobody does anything about it the first half why do i love you tell me tell me what why why why do i why do i love i i i cannot believe i'm i'm enjoying a tik tok typically whenever i watch a tik tok i become i i i become so disappointed in tech tik tok that it's like it is just the worst tech tik tok is categorically one of the worst the worst it it's just my day i spend in meetings asking the engineering team for updates even though it will have no impact the other it actually does have impact it actually just slows everything down that's really it that's truly truly the real impact of it is it actually is a net negative for everybody the half of my day i spent collaborating on various articles on linkedin why so i can receive the top voice badge even there is something so beautiful about the fact that that there exists a social network in which is some somehow more valueless and meaningless than twitter can we just take a can we just take a moment for that it has more badges it has more awards it has more endorsing and yet it is single-handedly the dumbest website i don't how did that happen like what at what point in the world did we did we decide we want to create a social network as useful as scrum masters it's pretty wild though it's of no consequence it's probably in a useless skill like cross functional leadership anyways i digress thank you absolutely wonderful do i have an account oh i do have an account hell yeah i have an account i got 99 messages or whatever that is inbox is that an inbox is that messages or are these messages no inbox is not messages what the hell is what the h what am i inboxing if they're not messages i digress i digress i worked once with a scrum master 10 years ago and how it was described to me was the following that scrum masters are like the spirit of the team the spirit they're the spirit animal they're the dolphin and what they do they're supposed to be the human element to your otherwise robotic individual contributors where they bring people together and make success i'm not exaggerating right now so there are clerics that are bad at healing the man knows that was perfect perfect description perfect description scrub masters are clerics that are bad at healing can i i'm can i can i i might have to take this i'm pretty sure i get to take this pretty sure this is mit this chat's mit i'm taking that the problem is okay so real real talk the scrub master that i did have his name was ian not ian ian uh he was i really liked him and i i i got to this funny point where i couldn't understand what ian did cuz i didn't understand what a scrum master did but i liked him i would just chat with him what what what was that it's like a team counselor is that real is that a real thing all i know is i i enjo i i i i oddly enjoyed it but to be real contributed nothing to the team as far as i could tell like i i don't know if that if it was real my best manager was basically a counselor yeah see that's that's kind of where i came to which is a good manager should be more like you know should be doing this right so that's why i get so confused with what a what a scrum master is because i i can't like are you separating out like manager does no emotional side scrum master does all emotional support side what are you using at netflix my boss comes to me every now and then goes what are you doing and i go i'm doing this scrub masters bring tremendous value how else would i know what time i was or how else would i know what time i was if not being reminded about upcoming meetings damn bash bunny what do you think about that bash bunny what do you think about give me a oneliner do you love scrum masters or do you hate scrum masters or are you indifferent hit it hit hit me right now hit me right now isn't a scrum master a team manager she doesn't even know you don't even know you don't even know no they are the spirit of the team fash bunny okay they are the spirit animal they are the dolphin they are the dolphin of the team and you need to understand that that's what they do disappointed bash bunny though you didn't know this you're no longer my spirit animal a jen
