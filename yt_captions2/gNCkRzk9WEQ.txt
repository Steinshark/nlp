somebody sent flip my editor a glove 80 and then flip sent me the glove 80 i know c crazy line of events right so i just got a package that is a case that contains the glove 80 so i have absolutely no idea what's coming in here so i'm going to i'm going to unzip it look at that beautiful keyboard can we just say how beautiful that keyboard i have manual focus on right now so i can't help it i can't zoom it in flip zoom it in flip zoom it in for me beautiful keyboard very beautiful case i think that that is such a big wut by the way okay so first impressions i just picked this thing up if feels light lightness is not necessarily an indicator of quality of any kind but it does feel light so when i say light uh what i mean is that if i were to compare uh these two here let me unplug my current keyboard if i were to compare the current the the two you can see there is a a a vast difference in size there also does appear to be a slight difference in key layout uh not a thumb clusters it's fine thumb clusters are fine but there's a slight difference in key layout i would say maybe is there i'm not sure if there is a slight difference there might not be a slight difference i might be making this up anyways so there we go pretty cool i like it i like what i'm seeing uh do they do vertical adjusting so that's what i don't know he did talk about tenting but i don't see any capability of tenting on this thing so i i don't know so this thing does have a lower profile you can see it's a much lower profile so i assume the switches are it looks like they're browns looks like we got some browns on there comparison to be completely fair this is a uh kinesis with uh jades on it so diff different switches different switches uh kinesis is not hot swappable i don't know if these guys are hot swappable i know i i i i don't really know anything about keyboards uh i'm not a keyboard offici andado i just know how they feel so it it just makes it's like if it if it makes me feel like i like it then i love it if if they don't then that's that okay so there we go okay so we kind of got a little bit of sound difference weight difference this thing feels much much more heavy uh this thing feels a lot lighter it doesn't feel like a 3d printed model you know like when you use a 3d printed model how a 3d print will just feel dangerously cheap so as far as feel goes purely on feel uh one thing i really like about the kinesis is it does have a steel it's steel right here which is really nice and the plastic feels it feels heavy and just because it feels heavy doesn't mean it's better it just feels heavy like if i had to choose like if i had to choose one of these two to kill a person with i would kill a person with the kinesis i don't think i could kill a person with this okay good i think everybody understands the killer person test okay so i'm going to move these ones across and we're going to start getting this thing set up again i i i i don't even know how this keyboard works i have never even plugged this keyboard in so i have i have zero expectations as of right now so there's a button on the back a usbc cool usbc i like usbc happy about that okay so just the first hand resting test before i type anything bluetooth not wi-fi i know i was a little bit surprised over wi-fi they email okay just just your basic just me slapping the keys this feels really good feels really good i like that feels good when it's on the surface i do like it i do like that uh how do the low profile key caps feel the low profile keycaps do feel feel very interesting very definitely new slaping the keys i like slapping the keys okay i got a package over there yeah um on my mouse pad so my whole surface my whole desk is one big mouse pad it feels like it's a little bit slippery you know what i mean like uh they're not they're a little bit slippery and there's a little bit of wiggle to them i'm not sure if you can adjust i'm not sure if you can adjust these oh yeah you can adjust them so they they they they screw and they wiggle down here so super cool on that you can you can you can make it so that they actually properly don't wiggle so love that feature by the way that's super cool very good there we go i like it it's injection i know i know this is injection i was talking about the dactyl manuform i have a dactyl manuform which is 3d printed which feels cheap this does not feel this does not this does not have the same feel so i don't know how to tent them i don't see any way in which you can tent these guys so i'm not really sure what does tenting mean does it like if i unspin this i think tenting means that you can that you have some level that you can do this right i think this is what it meant by tenting is that you can do uh you can do this right here sorry i can't zoom in flip zoom in i i'll zoom in when i make like a video out of it but you can actually kind of tent it by doing this which is some amount of screwing in screwing out so super cool it also just adjusts for you to be able to make it highly stable i like that and you know the surface does feel grippy okay so i mean i like most i like most of the things that come here they come with longer tenting oh nice they come with longer tenting i only have i have one pouch nice so i got uh are these supposed to be the longer tings maybe this is supposed to there's like there's some extra pieces i don't really know what to do that there looks to be some sort of remover in here the other bag the other bag is empty i i don't know flip flip at them let's see you have keybinds to wirelessly switch between save devices okay i'm not really advanced into that use case so i don't know if it'll be very useful for me so here we go i'm just going to try plugging this into one side maybe we'll have a charge issue so there we go i plugged it in and do i just like turn it on okay i see a red light so i i think this thing is i think this thing is running i just turn on this one and does this thing need to be plugged in too this one's nothing's turning on so my assumption is that i don't have any power you should just need the left okay uh okay well i see hey i see i'm typing right here i'm not typing on this side so maybe it's okay turn it back on and i'm typing on that side all right hey that was pretty easy okay holy cow okay so the dactyl the dactyl side is really painful for me uh okay so i'm not used to this keyboard layout right here i am not used to the keyboard layout with these so this will be my hard this will be my biggest hurdle using the glove 80 read the effing manual when i'm off of stream i'm going to read the effing manual right now we are just doing a simple unboxing buddy something i i will say that i find much nicer right off the just right away is that shift is is a button right on right right here right shift is meant to be right here i like that i actually find that really really cool uh the the the place where tab is a little goofy and escape is a little goofy uh they did put they did put function keys on function keys are kind of interesting right function keys not too sure about that um it does feel different it definitely feels different escape escape escape escape escape oh gosh so dude oh my goodness okay pressing dude these is going to be this is going to be the hardest thing to switch between oh interesting okay so here's one thing i immediately feel interesting with shift being on the thumbs shift and control are a unique one to press now me personally i'm a reverse shifter so if i type with this hand i shift on this side if i type when i go back and forth i actually shift back and forth so that's real um as far as as far as hand size go my hand size is fine i have small hand size why the change because that's uh that's called using your keyboard properly which is the correct way i hate to tell you this this is the correct way okay the real way to use shift i know this may be surprising but you're supposed to actually use shift properly and not be a little you know little biggity okay just letting you guys know all right um okay so i'm loving everything about this keyboard the feel still the feel of it i i i do like the kinesis thickness i will say that the kinesis thickness feels really good i like my switches on the kinesis better but maybe glove can have that i'll have to do some research on that um the shift being only on the thumb it's going to be a really hard transition for me to do like shift control shift control uh that may that that just simply may be a hard thing for me to get used to all right so i already have my remap i already i i already have a software remap so oh my goodness okay that's okay it's right here here's my current stats here flip flip for you you need to keep this picture for a little while okay there you go here's my current stats decent stats i haven't typed in a long time as you can see it's been literally i it's been i i typed for just a group right here and that's it all right so this means that for me to be kind of to to feel good about this glove 80 i'm going to do effectively 97 tests on uh on monkey type to really feel how i you know to to kind of get the same experience the harder honestly the hardest part about learning a new keyboard is not the typing part i find that part to be to be less like kind of wild it's going to be learning how to use my thumb clusters the thumb clusters is extremely difficult i don't need keybr people i know how to type on a keyboard i don't need keybr my problem has nothing to do with me typing it has everything to do with me holding alt holding alt and control cuz they're in like they're just in different spots they're just simply somewhere else and it's going to be a much different everything uh did you review or look at the uh in the future at the zsa voyager no i have never seen the voyager you want to link the voyager this is me trying to do an honest review here i am not trying to let kinesis cloud my brain i love kinesis i will i will tell you this much that i've been using kinesis for 10 years uh for a half decade before they ever even said they would send me a free keyboard and then they finally paid me not too long ago for being for doing this for so long i've literally sold them thousands of keyboards i absolutely love kinesis so would i ever switch even if i like this keyboard better would i switch kinesis has been just so kind to me and they've been so good to me i would i i would never switch on a uh on a personal level because of that because often i use things because i i i love the company or i like who i work with uh but i will give this like the best most honest review i can of it itself because i think that that is i think that's the most i think that's the most honest thing you can do is to do that let's start doing this okay so i am pretty bad at this i hate typing in front of people especially on a new keyboard here we go you know what's funny is i have no problems uh typing and coding in front of you guys but the moment i have to do a test i feel like i'm like slogging in water okay here we go uh oh my goodness that's so hard to type on just fact to change uh new give problem we and after ah not very good at it not very good at that you know what i mean not very good at that it feels weird on that you know what i mean a new feeling for sure 90 words per minute not very good the yeah 90 words per minute is pathetic okay absolutely pathetic can you talk faster than you type of course everyone can talk faster than they type i mean you'd have to be a stenographer to go the other way um there's there was a couple times that as i was typing it felt really good i could kind of feel like okay i could be pretty fast here i think i could be pretty fast on this one um but we'll we'll kind of get there right uh let's let's do another one let's do it let's do another one repeat test next test let's try this again ah gosh that was so bad i do it so bad okay so i got a lot of thoughts now uh i wish i had my keyboard cam right now i wish i had my keyboard cam up and running it's like right there i just simply need to thread some power through and we'll be up and running i'm going to get that this afternoon but man you should see my keyboard it went from being right like this to being like this while i type i type hard and i it i move the keyboard so that's for me is a real big problem i really don't like that because that's the it's one of the reasons why i really liked this is because it's so heavy and these little grips are so grippy and so big that it was able to remain in place right mountable i know but i don't want mountable uh i'm a little bit surprised on how easy it is to slide it on this stuff right there should be r rubber thing rub rubbed things on the b yeah there are like this is kind of grippy it's kind of grippy for sure it's just it's very small and they're very far apart and i think that helps kind of move it and when you push hard enough like this thing right here you'll notice that there is almost no action right here so maybe here let me try that let me try extending these all out a touch cuz maybe that's my problem is that i need to extend each of them out a little bit and the reason being is that um maybe that see this big flat thing is when i type on it the the weight goes on here which distributes you know the normal force goes way down on all these grippies and thus it slides so let's let's just make sure that i do that ooh very wild one of these this tent right here is not tentable i did not know that so i can't just simply raise the keyboard off of this so this may provide some challenges brother said normal force yeah normal force so i'm not sure what to do with that because i i i need that normal force try no mous pad it would be way worse if i tried no mouse pad this thing would be slipping i i first off i can't no mouse pad my my mouse pad is stapled into my desk my kind of initial kind of things about this keyboard is that it feels nice i think that in generally like i i like the low profile but i i'm going to be real here for a second ah yes penis jokes yeah dude what dude sx what you you think it's gna i mean what channel do you think you're on i i will say right away that the lightness is making it hard for me to type on and i think that that's going to be a real challenge going forward for me especially with this one being unmountable or un unadjustable so i can't just simply raise this off the ground so i don't distribute the weight onto this thing which means i'm going to have to t to to the side and i'm not really into tenting to the side i like my hands in kind of like a neutral resting position so partial i guess a little bit of tent so maybe i'll see it i'll try to do a little bit of tenting see how it goes we'll see how it goes and so i'm not i'm not loving it we'll just say i'm not loving it but i'm definitely liking it right i'm definitely liking it right uh check that all six feet are properly touching the ground yes i i i'll i can check i can here i'll open this like i said i'm gon to be going through the guide so i probably have a lot of um i probably have some things that are very incorrect about the glove right now uh and so i don't want to um i don't want to i i'm not going to make like a bunch of judgments about it yet but i can tell you right now when i type because when i type yeah it's it's it's when i type that really it just moves so typing still is really low typing is not good i don't it feels slightly different than the kinesis but again that's that i mean can anyone be really not okay it's just again um again it's it's just that this thing right here when i push down on it it just gets it distributes the it distributes the weight into here and when i distribute the weight into there that means less weight on the grippies less weight on the grippies means less normal force less normal force means that it's easier to break static friction once you break static friction it's very easy to have uh kinetic friction take over and you just slide right and i don't want to slide i'm not a big fan of sliding you know what i mean physics and right your standard right these are all very very standard you want your friction to be kinetic no no you static friction is where it's at i want it i want it to say okay stepen hawking bro it's just a keyboard it's more than dude bro some of us type for a living bro and so if you type and your keyboard moves while you type that might be kind of uh annoying i don't type as hard it doesn't move yeah so that's that's that's a me problem and it's going to be a me problem and so i'm going to give this a onewe challenge which by the way i'm going to probably lose it because having like having all of your symbol placements change it hurts a little bit uh b moving keyboard that's going to hurt a little bit so we'll see how those two feel after a week a a kinesis layout is only fair i might switch to the kinesis layout see if i can get as close as possible to the kinesis layout that might be that might be a fair trade-off just so i don't have to struggle as much while learning and so we'll probably do that here soon but that's probably a fair one i think we'll try it out so those are my only two those are my only two gripes right now are those two and i don't think i can change them right like i can't change how hard i type so low profile doesn't mean anything to me you know what i mean so i we'll try this out for a week we'll see how we feel we'll see how we feel by the end of next week where where we got to on this thing all right the name hey the keybard in i don't know
