this is a very impromptu video and usually impromptu videos mean you get the most candid responses out of me things that i would typically be like no you can't say that tiff take that out of the script in candid videos we go deep we go all in and today i felt like that was really needed for this topic of is it worth getting into tech or staying in tech in 2024 and i mean this question can't become a surprise to any of you we see on the news on social media everywhere you turn it makes it feels as though tech is in such a terrible place if we're being totally candid it feels as though every day is your job on the line are you going to be part of a layoff you hear about someone who's part of a layoff is being part of this industry really what it used to be should we be part of this industry anymore are there better industries out there please tell me i'm not alone in having these thoughts and yes i am willing to admit i've had these thoughts as someone who's worked in tech for too long now i'm just kidding not too long but for a long time 7 years started my career really on the technical side as a software developer moved into various roles still very deep in the tech side i mean i'm taking machine learning course right now i often question is this the best industry to stay in long term so i thought today let's have a very candic conversation sitting down okay i'm i'm standing okay well i'm i'm standing but you get the point talking about is tech really what it used to be and where is it headed i hope this video will really help you if you are someone who's been having these thoughts i thought you know what i want to share a very candid video as to where my head is at and hope that it will help someone else with their journey all right on that note let's get to it you know the drill hit the subscribe button and well i guess let's just continue on let's continue talking point number one as to why i think a lot of us are having these thoughts right now is the obvious which is it feels like right now there are it doesn't feel like there are a lot of layoffs going on right now and just when you think you're getting through it there's another round of layoffs for a company and that alone can feel very devastating and with that becomes comes a lot of commotion and talk especially online on social media and others where they're just really bashing the tech industry where it's like why would you want to get into this industry i've had people who are studying computer science or in their fourth year reach out to me and be like tiff i don't know what to do is this a job for me anymore then you have ceo and presidents going online saying things like coding is going to become irrelevant it feels terrible honestly a lot of dayses like what am i doing am i going to be in demand in a few years i'm putting in all this work for what i told you this was going to be very candid you're getting all my thoughts right now and it's interesting because as someone who creates content around tech uh you know everything tech i always try and be positive and find the outlook on things and and and i i there is a silver lining in this video i promise you but i also think it's very important to be realistic so here are my thoughts around we're going to kind of break this video down in in a few sections into my thoughts the first is around layoffs is it worth getting into tech when there's so many layoffs happening i do believe it is if you are someone who is studying technology studying computer science or maybe you're on the business side there is still a lot of job postings there's still a lot of opportunity what is happening and why we are seeing this is it's more so with big tech so that's the first thing i've done a few videos on layoffs in particular so i'm not going to dive into that area today i'll link them down below so the next thing that's being pretty big or heavy on my mind is around ai which is kind of ironic considering i'm going to school for that right now which feels very strange to say the opposite but i thought it was a great way to educate myself as to where this tech is at where it is going go back to school i think with ai it is going to have a very big impact on many rules lots that we have yet to see and then there always comes the question well tiff with so many different roles especially when i'm learning coding or other sk any skill nowadays writing it feels like it's like ai can do that so why do i even bother but it's one of those things that if we don't learn the foundations if you don't learn the basics you're always going to rely on technology and ai and people who did take the time to learn those f fundamental basics and foundations are going to be ahead or more knowledgeable than you even if it comes down to understanding how to best prompt different tools when you are coding so i think it's absolutely essential that we still take a step back learn the basics even with everything going on now and although tech is in a very strange place right now where it feels not like the cool sexy industry that it used to be it still is but it's not like 2020 was a prime year for tech i mean everyone under the sun could get hired in it it was just like amazing now it's like kind of like yeah but there's a lot of layoffs going going on is it that cool is it that great still is and i do think it will get back there here is why here is why you have watched this video up until this point i promise you which is where i see it going and why i truly believe tech is here not only to stay but the tech industry will continue to boom it will make a big comeback and roles will continue to grow which is this i sat down i'll insert a clip here actually i while we see tech as this specific industry or this specific field i don't know if our kids are going to be like oh this is tech like i think all jobs are just going to have a technical aspect to them yes sat down in new york with a ux researcher who used to work at google and she was part of a big layoff and one of the things that she said to me was we talk about tech like it's its own industry because it is but every industry is tech now and that really stood out to me when you really stop and think about it fashion e-commerce that's all tech now when we think sports online gaming any industry you can think of tech has such a big role within that and in those industries with that technology you need experts for the tech you need product managers you need developers you need qa all of those roles you still need and i think we as a culture society have gone so caught up with big tech in particular being like the google the facebooks all of that that we forget tech now is every industry it touches every industry and it really is at the backbone the heart of every industry so if you are someone who's interested in getting into tech stop worrying about what the news is saying or what social media is saying a lot of these headlines are for clicks they're for uh clickbait or these what is it like media frenzies different things like that at the end of the day there is so much opportunity especially if you want to even expand into one of these specific areas i mentioned like sports or fashion or whatnot so i just really wanted to make this video because the amount of messages i get where it's from brilliant people like yourselves maybe even you who was watching this is someone who sent me a message saying i'm nervous i don't think i should get into tech anymore that yes you should because tech is literally everywhere and it's continuing to be more and more ingrained in our everyday lives in every single industry and if you are someone who is interested in building uh working in tech then yes it is still for you it's not going anywhere it's if anything it's opposite it will continue to become more and more prominent especially as ai continues to really dominate feel like i need to get a drink of water after that uh oh i got water one sec got a little bit of water perfect it could have been like a little water flow i love flow it's not an ad but i wish it was cuz flow is such good water by the way total side note here but we like side notes we live for side notes on this channel anyways all right so i wanted to have this very unfiltered conversation as friend to friend as just we are very close in this community and share with you my thoughts around is it worth getting into tech in 2024 it absolutely is there is so much opportunity and potential to grow your career and the reasons i listed is why i'm curious to hear your thoughts though have you had some of the feelings i've listed at the beginning of this video around self-doubt uncertainty questioning if it's even worth getting in this industry anymore leave down in the comments and also leave down in the comments if you agree or disagree with me it's totally fine to disagree with me but more so than ever i
