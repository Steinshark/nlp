over the course of my career shooting documentary photos and video i've taken camera gear into some seriously rough environments from deserts to jungles to the tops of mountains and over the years i figured out what i can trust to keep working and what falls apart as soon as you take it out of the studio i'm just getting ready to head out for a long shoot in the middle of the forests of northern british columbia and so it seemed like the perfect time to talk about what gear i trust to get the job done in this video i'm going to get into the cameras tripods lights bags audio all the key things i'm taking with me for the next four months in the elements by the end of this video i'm sure you'll pick up a few new ideas for what works and what doesn't in remote and difficult locations and right at the end i'm going to share one of the most unusual things i take on the road something i never really hear people talking about on youtube but that's bailed me out of more than one tight spot so let's get into it [music] hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsyth and on this channel i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer if you're into that kind of thing make sure to hit that subscribe button because i've got new videos coming out every week okay right off the bat i just want to say that this isn't a video about budget filmmaking gear most of this stuff is on the higher end of price when it comes to run and gun shooting though it's still they're cheap when it comes to hollywood standards and it's taken me about 10 years to get all this stuff together i definitely didn't start with all this gear and i still managed to make things work so please don't think that you can't get out there and shoot in nature without spending tens of thousands of dollars start with what you can afford and grow over time and my philosophy is to never ever buy on credit but if you're looking to invest in some professional grade stuff that can take a beating here's what's worked for me first let's talk about the cameras because you're obviously not shooting anything without a camera maybe one day someone is going to make a cinema camera that's also weatherproof but i kind of doubt it i shoot with sony cameras just because i always have and right now i'm using an fx9 as a main camera and an fx3 as my b cam there's nothing particularly rugged about these cameras compared to other brands but i will say that i have not treated these cameras gently they just seem to keep working the only real modification i've made to the fx9 is to replace the stock's sony handle with this metal one from wooden camera just because it's a little more solid feeling but also because in the past i trashed an fs7 when moisture got into the handle basically i was filming in a hazmat suit in africa and sweating like crazy and every time i carried the camera by the top handle sweat was just pouring out my sleeve and onto the handle the handle is connected electronically to the rest of the camera and after about a week of this the camera shorted out i've had it in three different repair shops trying to figure out the problem but it seems like no matter what they do it keeps having power issues so i'm hoping that by getting rid of the handle on the fx9 i'm removing one more point of vulnerability on top of that i have these rain covers for each camera this one by portabrace is specifically for the fx9 and it fits pretty well any rain cover makes the camera quite a bit harder to use but if it starts raining and you have to make the choice about whether or not to film definitely use the rain cover they're not a hundred percent waterproof they're not rubber or anything i'd say actually they're more like rain jackets eventually they'll soak through but they should keep you going for quite a few hours if you don't feel like spending 300 for a rain cover i used an ordinary backpack cover like the ones with the elastic ring around them that stretch around your bag i'll find an example of what i'm talking about on amazon and link to in the description it's not quite as perfect of a fit but it will definitely keep the camera dry and i still carry some of these things with me the elastic will wrap around the back of the camera and unless there's a crazy strong wind it should stay on the problem is that the lens is still sticking out from the front and once the front element gets wet it can be really hard to dry it off the look of a few raindrops can add to the mood of a shot but pretty quickly it gets streaky and blurry and hard to see anything and trying to find something dry to wipe it off with can be next to impossible when it's pouring so instead i use a matte box with a french flag or an eyebrow or whatever you feel like calling it the lens hoods that come with the lenses are okay but a flag that sticks out six inches will obviously do a much better job a flag will also be handy when shooting in super bright overhead light because if the sun hits your lens at a certain angle it can totally wash out the colors so they're useful in a bunch of different ways i use this one from polarpro it's called the basecamp and i got it because it's really light and also because it was on sale it's an added bonus that i can put filters into it i have some variable nds and some missed filters that i use i'm not a big fan of the proprietary filter size here and i'd much prefer a system where i could use filters from any brand i wanted but for the price and weight it's a pretty good deal and beyond just keeping rain off the lens when you're constantly putting cameras on car seats or on the ground like i do being able to shut the flag to protect your lens is really great as well while we're talking about lenses i don't use anything different when i'm in a tough environment i own two fuji mk cinema zooms a bunch of sigma primes a 70-200 and 100 millimeter macro i don't really change this setup from job to job though if weight is an issue i might leave a few behind the only big thing i think makes lenses more vulnerable than others is when they telescope in and out when you zoom like most 2470s or 24-105s do that's where a lot of dust and stand or whatever can get inside but there's really not much you can do about that other than try and buy lenses where all the movement happens internally for me gear is meant to be used though and just get the lenses that make sense for your budget and use them i made a whole video about zooms versus primes as well that i'll link to somewhere up there that you might want to check out as well i support my whole setup on what i think is the world's greatest tripod for documentary filmmakers which is the sackler flowtech but i think they call it the active now i use the 100 millimeter ball version but the 75 millimeter version is a bit cheaper and will work for most cameras as well this thing is really expensive at about five thousand dollars when you buy it with a head but man is it worth it the flow tech is all carbon so it's as light as any tripod i've ever used while still being really strong you can submerge it in water wash it with a garden hose and mine even got shot in mexico twice and kept working most cinema tripods weigh two or three times as much and there's just no way you'd want to carry one of those up a mountain or through the rainforest having the ability to get a tripod into a remote area and get some stable shots can help up your production value a lot and it's light enough to just lash it to the side of your backpack and go i finally had to send mine in for servicing after four years of absolute abuse so i don't have it with me but i can't recommend these tripods enough save up for one and you'll probably never need to have another one for the rest of your career i made an entire video about the flow tech and i'll also link to that [music] okay so that's the camera system but what about lights if i'm in a really remote area and weight is a problem lights might be the first thing to be ditched it's great to have a big light and a four foot softbox for your interviews but they definitely won't hold up well in a windstorm and i don't think my aperture 300d would last long in the rain more likely i'll bring these one by one panels made by westcott these were some of the first lights i bought and they just keep working the panels themselves are waterproof and you can power them with the same v-mount batteries i run the camera off of and i can fit two of them plus all their accessories into a single backpack now they're only one by one and even with the softbox attachment you're never going to get the same sort of soft light that you would from a big light dome or something but when shooting in harsh environments it's always going to require some trade-offs and at least with these you can have some sort of lighting which is always better than nothing ideally i do the really important sit-down interviews before or after and then leave the big lights behind and just use these in the field you can roll them up you can gaff tape them to the ceiling um they're magnetic so you can stick in the fridges or heating ducts and they're just really easy to get into all sorts of different places these ones are about a thousand dollars a light or you can buy them in a set of two and there are definitely cheaper panels out there but i use these because of the build quality i beat the hell out of these things and leave them out in all sorts of bad weather and they just keep working so for me it's totally worth it some of the knockoff brands might cost a quarter of the price but if they go down on you in the middle of a big shoot it's a problem plus i hate the idea of creating mountains of e-waste because i had to buy new lights every year buy nights or buy twice and if you can swing it these ones are nice for sure they also come in 2x1 and 3x1 in all sorts of different sizes but i find these ones are easy to carry and do a pretty good all-around job in tough conditions i also have a couple of these westcott light tubes that can be really handy as well they run on batteries or wall power so you can put them on a gorillapod and just add a little bit of extra pop to a scene there are cheaper versions of these like young noah makes one that i think is popular but i don't think they have the build quality to take the kind of beating i put on my stuff those might be great for a studio environment but for me the wescotts are worth it because of how solid they are both ends are capped in metal and i've dropped these multiple times and they just never quit on me and as always the ultimate piece of lighting diffusion is the humble shower curtain if you can't really bring lights at all tape one of these over a window or hang it from a tree and boom you've got a big soft source they're super cheap they weigh nothing and i always try to keep one around you can buy the expensive silks instead but for me this works just as well and costs about 90 percent less [music] okay so let's quickly talk about audio next i use the sennheiser g3 lab mics and these things are just tanks i'm pretty sure they upgraded to the g4 quite a while ago but i've had the same set since 2015 and no matter what i do it will not break you can spend a lot more for a set of electrosonics or something and those are great but for me these are just such a great value that work no matter what if you think your character is going to get absolutely soaking wet a pro tip is to pop them inside a condom it might seem a bit weird but they'll stretch around the mics and keep them dry and they won't make noise like a ziploc bag might keep a couple with your mics and you never know when they might save you finally what do i carry all this stuff in well for getting from point a to point b pelican cases are amazing they're bomb proof and you can run over them with the truck and they won't break i have a couple of them and i love them but they're also very heavy and impossible to carry on rough terrain so once you get out of the city they kind of need to stay in the car for my actual shooting bags i use the f-stop system pretty much exclusively i got introduced to them a few years ago and i've been using them ever since they're built more like hiking packs than camera bags which means they're really tough and good for carrying heavy loads i have a few f-stop bags but i think their 50 liter tilopa is the best all-round bag out there and with the rain cover they make it can handle a lot of weather they work with these little padded boxes called icus that you can swap in and out depending on how much stuff you need to carry like you could carry a small icu for a single zoom and a primer tube plus some spare batteries and then pack a tent and sleeping bag in the top of the bag or a big icu and bring six lenses a bunch of batteries and a drone it's really versatile system and i can't recommend it enough i also made another video about why i think f-stop bags are the best out there which should pop up there as well and lastly if you're going to work in a really rough environment make sure you bring tools to keep it all running at a bare minimum bring a multi-tool and some lens tissues but if possible i try to bring my full pouch with allen keys a blower paintbrush and other little bits that make keeping the camera working a lot easier i also made a video about how to put together the ultimate tool pouch for filmmakers so check that one out as well i seriously better be on my game with these links in post i feel like this is a new record oh yeah and before i go i wanted to share one of the more unusual things that i pack with me that i don't really hear people talk about too much if you've ever been anywhere near a professional film set you'll know that there are sandbags everywhere they're super handy and they're used for everything from keeping light stand stable to counter balancing mic booms but if you're shooting documentaries especially ones in hard to get to areas a sandbag is the last thing you want to lug around the solution is so simple i have no idea why more people aren't talking about these things water bags i don't even know how i heard about these but they're made by wescott the same company that makes a lot of the other lighting gear i use basically it's a tough cordura bag with this water bladder inside that you can fill up and empty wherever you are i filled these things up in public bathrooms with garden hoses and rivers lakes waterfalls pretty much any source of water you can think of then you use these built-in hooks and straps to hang it off whatever you need to anchor it to and you're done if you still need more weight fill it all the way up if you need less pour some out when the seam is done and you're tearing down dump the water out and shove it in your bag it's such a simple solution to a problem i run to a lot as a documentary filmmaker and i love things that solve problems without being overly complicated i keep two of these things in my traveling kit and whenever i break them out directors love it and most people have never seen them before alright i'm going to call it there i think i could probably come up with at least another 10 minutes of stuff i like to use in harsh environments but i want to keep this video to a reasonable length with those things i can run a pretty complex shoot in some seriously difficult locations and if you're thinking about getting into doc shooting that involves a lot of travel or maybe adventure related stuff i think you'd be very happy with this setup and as always this is just what works for me and you should absolutely start small and work your way up if you have other things that you like that i didn't mention let me know in the comments that's it for today i hope you found that video helpful and if you did think about subscribing i'll have more videos like this every week and it really helps the channel maybe check out this other video i mentioned about the sackler flow tech it really is the best running gun tripod out there in my opinion see yah [music] [applause]
