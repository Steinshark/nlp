we've all done it you go on your favorite store or pc part picker select all the most expensive items in the drop downs then you gaze at it longingly for a bit wipe the drool off your desk and go back to grinding fletching levels in runescape because fantasy time is officially over well not for the engineers at hp they took it one step further and they actually built the dream machine and thanks to their co-sponsorship of this video with intel we get to see what happens when you actually press bye well the first thing that happens is your credit card spontaneously combusts because each of the four gpus in this thing costs as much as a top of the line gaming pc alone then the next thing that happens is you get to go faster than you've ever gone before we're gonna crack it open in a little bit but we're gonna start by absolutely annihilating every rendering benchmark we have ever done starting of course with the one and only a blender don't blink because you might miss this start the render focus on and it's done that was a sub nine second classroom render and that was without the files cached let's do it again four two seconds we're gonna start measuring in frames per second not seconds per frame that's not even long enough for me to see the usage show up on the gpus is it not even kicking all of these on we need to do a longer render oh hold on this one's running on cpu i think that's still really impressive this is it'll do gooseberry in under three minutes on this cpu wow that's what 56 cores will do for you all that'll cost you is a measly ah yes 350 watts of cpu power consumption this is my first hands-on with intel xeon scalable 3400 series chips and i gotta say i'm liking what i see so far i was pretty thrown off when i found out that the 56 core has a base clock of just 1.9 gigahertz but the all core boost in this hp machine is over 2.4 which means she fast they are all working okay that explains why it is so flipping fast but see this there's a delay in the time that it takes for the gpus to actually start working and fans kick in and it's done i realize you might not have a lot of context for these scores we're getting so do yourself a favor go to the blender website download them and run them on your computer that should give you some idea how absolutely wild this is all right blender man let's go oh my god this one's done already 15 seconds we barely even managed to load the gpus for those of you who are not that familiar with blender what we're doing is we're rendering photorealistic images here and the problem is that these are industry standard benchmarks that everyone knows and this machine is running them so fast that it doesn't even really get a chance to start working it just spools up the assets rips through the render and then it's immediately over there's more overhead here than actual work being done of course you might think a few seconds here or there on your output is not going to make that big of a difference i mean you got to run and get coffee or use the bathroom once in a while anyway but the big difference here is that while you are working on a scene or working on a model you can just move it around and see it at basically full quality in just a few seconds look at it go is that incredible or what okay let's do uh rtx oh here they all go man just keeping these gpus fed is quite the task for our poor cpu here once again it's only reporting usage for gpu2 but once again i am pretty sure that all the gpus are loaded here yes they are hot damn this thing is drawing over 1200 watts on the gpu's alone this thing does 1500 watts of power consumption i was barely breaking a sweat like it's making noise don't get me wrong but not a lot but again to give you guys some idea how impressive this is bone stock with only four gpus we are still in the top 50 here now the key night among you are probably thinking i'm sorry 240 90s is just as fast as your four a6 thousands what's up with that rtx 4090s or gaming cards are designed to run as fast as possible driver certification and other features be damned whereas rtx a series cards workstation cards are all about stability and they come with a lot more vram so that you can load them up with much larger scenes much larger workloads and they can operate on the whole thing while it's sitting in ram which isn't to say that they can't game play some halo infinite on a how much is this thing worth like 40 grand we apparently don't even know the price well the gpus are five grand each so more than 20. interesting even though there's no envy link connectors we can totally select all four of them okay we'll do that later though would you believe this machine is in the same family as the 69 gaming pc so 10 years from now no for real think about it when these are being offloaded by the ball or businesses architectural firms or resource exploration companies when they are offloading these things this could be your gaming pc you would take out three of the gpus or you would you know pick up a cheap second-hand gpu to throw into it for gaming because this is not the best for gaming in summary sli hasn't been worked on in a long time by game developers or nvidia this isn't really a surprise but this was working yeah oh it actually like made a difference with the sli like oh it improved things seriously yeah like were you getting like hundreds of fps or like yeah yeah there was there was a noticeable difference in fps well i don't know what to tell you because she is sure as shoot broken now enough about gaming though look at these spec view perf results this machine is at or near the top of the charts in every possible category cpu power gpu power this thing is god at all let's take a closer look at what's going on inside oh no first outside almost all mesh front two five and a quarter inch bays along with a slimline optical these are deceptive they are not for your cd rider okay these are actually so you can put up to eight hot swappable nvme drives in here so like with the highest cap nvme drives these days that would be like 250 terabytes of nvme storage dual front usbc's dual front usba's headphone microphone combo jack and sd card reader let's turn this baby around and have a look from the oh actually the back soon but oh that makes sense nope you are not allowed to open it up while it's on i mean if i had the kind of optimized airflow path that this thing has i probably wouldn't like that either we will finish up with the outside then we will open it up single 120 millimeter fan for exhaust my goodness this is hot she's hot wow then we've got our three gpus down here our rear motherboard eye over here so a bunch more usb 3 10 gig ethernet absolutely love it is that a management port that's awesome you could totally remotely like upgrade the bios or whatever that's great for your it department we've got dual power inputs they can either operate in aggregate mode to a total of 2250 watts or in redundant mode where they will do up to 1450. so i guess we need aggregate mode for this configuration with the four a6000s this thing's freaking ridiculous so 16 monitors anyone i have never seen anything like this before look at the freaking size of this power supply it uses a blower cooler air intakes on both sides there you go then exhaust out the back wow that's enough i want to see i'm sorry this is cool got a nice little map of where everything is inside including the order in which you need to populate your dim slots seems to be done yelling at me now all we need to do is figure out how oh nice little pad to keep the gpu in place nice little shroud to make sure that the gpu is drawing air from the right place where that place is not entirely clear but that's okay we'll figure that out later you can tell hp had so much pcie connectivity they didn't know what to do with it all the cpu supports up to 112 pcie gen 5 lanes and we're using 32 of them for these top two slots right here these two down here running at gen 4 by 16 and then the motherboard is just littered in more pcie connectivity we've got two by four nvme connectors up here so presumably those are to handle the optional hotspot bays that can hello somehow go over there and then we've got another one over here labeled network that's either going to be for well some kind of network interface you add at the back though i don't see where it goes or it could be for the optional thunderbolt add-in card oh you know what i bet the network one goes here whoa personality slot i've met some people who could use one of those okay personality slot i have no idea what's in these each of them is pcie gen 4x8 so there's another 16 lanes but what they do is a mystery okay hold on so it looks like it's kind of a two-handed operation whoa shut up dual loaded onto these carrier boards looks like they can do up to 110 millimeter m.2 drives but it's pre-loaded with your standard 80 millimeter drives there's a couple one terabyte m.2s don't mind if i do that one's a little bent um whoops it's not because of me do i do that oh i did that no nevermind it's flat okay okay well i can't say that i'm the biggest fan in general of proprietary carrier boards from a technician standpoint if jeanette in accounting or bob from shipping needs a new drive or they you know need more storage or whatever else being in and out like that instead of having to rip out a bunch of gpus and get at m.2s that are under it yeah i'm liking it and cooling wise what are we looking at here got a 92 millimeter intake here that's blowing across our top gpu which has this back mounted oh and front mounted intake that cools these then we've got another 120 no that's a 92 and then we've got what appears to be another 120 down here in the bottom to take care of our cpu our other gpus and then is this for okay what are you doing what is with all these shrouds good gravy well that tall tower cooler explains how we were able to do a sustained 250 watts on the cpu and then we've got a total of 128 gigs of ram in here but this cpu will support up to two terabytes two more 80 millimeter fans oh these are blowing directly down on the ram they're blowing up from the ram of trays interesting oh wow the intake comes in here okay then this grabs it then it goes through this shroud over to here and then this is grabbing air from over here or something and it's blowing it out and then this exhaust is taking it away they do not want any hot air from anything else making its way into anything in this system no screws required do i just pull it out surely there's a oh hello oh yeah wow completely tool-less gpu removal and that's secure enough for shipping i guess that's what this rear support bracket and then these same pads that we saw on the top are going to do for you keep these babies secure and shipping i mean it got here in one piece of course now that you've seen all the hardware i'm sure you guys are wondering well can it go even faster the answer is yes all we need to do is go into performance options and instead of performance mode we want rack mode you ready for this go go go go go go you can tell there's performance in there so much performance hold on we're still adding more performance oh wow okay yep i can see why this is rack mode and not sitting next to your desk in an office mode let's see if we can beat those scores from last time the gpus are absolutely pegged at 300 watts now and the cpu sitting at 210. only a marginal score increase looks like our gpus weren't limited in any way by our system fans but what i suspect is that our cpu is going to be able to turbo a little bit higher oh that's a new whoa shut up 375 watts did we touch 375 before that is definitely normal that's normal yes okay no this is working as intended we're getting 2.6 2.7 gigahertz now instead of 2.4 and change all right then power consumption doesn't change i guess it's just overcoming thermal limitations because look at this our cpu package isn't going above 55 degrees we touched a hundred before this difference in clock speed netted us about 4 000 more points in cinebench meaning the more cooling you can throw at the xeon 3400 series processors the better off you're going to be especially if you've got a 56 core one unlike previous z8 workstations the z8 fury g5 only supports a single cpu but when that cpu is the w9 3495x arguably the best workstation cpu on the market kind of makes sense eight channel ddr5 memory support turbo boosts up to 4.7 gigahertz 56 cores and the results speak for themselves that's 62 000 points in cinebench r23 can dance all day it's no wonder apple's only giving you like 800 for a mac pro trade in these days of course we've only scratched the surface of what a machine like this can do these are used for everything from game design to ai and data science research to 3d rendering which of course we've talked about but architectural design engineering video editing you name it it can handle it the one exception would be gaming while you could spend 10 times as much as you did on your gaming pc you really don't have to because it's not for gaming until 10 years from now thanks again to intel and hp for sponsoring this video it was a genuine pleasure to get my hands on the absolute best of the best dream machine tier pc and we have to send this back yeah all right well i guess that's all the playing i get to i'm gonna run this one more time this is like my favorite game c boxes fill up very fast whoa
