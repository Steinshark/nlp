hi hello i recently graduated from college with a computer science degree that's why that's why that's why but i'm kind of unemployed there's a lot of reasons for it you know the job market went to a complete dumpster fire for tech and then honestly it's also a skill issue my resume could probably be better i should probably be networking more but one of the main issues behind it in all honesty is my technical skills so ideally i want to be a software engineer but whenever you interview for these types jobs you have to do a lot of technical interviews so you can prove that you know what you're doing and these interviews are not that easy unless you're like a 500 iq 5ad genius gigachad you're going to find these interviews really difficult if you don't prepare and study because a lot of times they're quizzing you on something called data structures and algorithms this is cancer this this is so much cancer that i can feel the tumors growing on my back because it's what you need to write really efficient and optimized programs but the real reason why they interview this is because everyone one else is doing it like this since to be fair it's a pretty effective way of filtering out a lot of applicants and getting the best talent although there's probably better ways of doing it depending on the position you apply for but that's a whole different conversation but the way you study these types of interview questions for the most part is mainly on a website called le code i've made some videos on it you want to check it out and see what they're like feel free this website is kind of like the gym for software engineers since we use it to work out our problem solving skills and our data structures and algorithm skills here's the problem for me i get distracted a lot and i also like to procrastinate a lot a lot of times i don't want to do these questions because these questions are really boring and the technical concepts to understand these questions put me to and this is the main reason why i feel my technical skills aren't that good since if they were you know i'd kind of have a job now i've done my fair share of these practice questions and i've also done some technical interviews with some companies one of my worst interviews was at netflix where i completely f it up i blinked out so hard and if you want to hear how that went let me know anyways since i get distracted a lot i was thinking if only there was somebody that knew how to program and had extra time on their hands and could make me a program to force me to do practice interview questions against my will and make me want to [music] kill now i know what some of you guys are thinking shouldn't you just spend this time you know doing interview questions instead of making a program to make you do interiew riew questions anyways okay here's the plan i'm going to make a browser extension which basically prevents me from accessing any type of website until i solve a randomly assigned le code problem seems like an easy project to do i've never made a browser extension before but it shouldn't be that bad it probably won't even take that long let me just google how to make an extension and look at that documentation all this is going to be easy peasy looks like i have to use html css and javascript no frameworks looks like we have to go a little lower level lower leveling your hands don't look like this while you're eating your lunch must be a liberal [ __ ] must be a [ __ ] boy i'll just do these tutorials and then we'll see what happens okay the classic hello world create a manifest.json now i need an icon and create a hello.html file sp p oh that's it okay well i just made my first extension that was actually really easy time to do the actual tutorials oh this is pretty cool oh this is how they modify pages okay we got to use the dom that's not surprising what the [ __ ] okay just finished the first one on to the next ones oh i'm making something productive i'm going to need this later i just made a css video and i don't know what the i'm looking at okay i just finished i'm not going to do this last tutorial it's time to make the greatest extension the world has ever seen to help all the people that are unemployed like me to help all those people that got embarrassed in technical interviews and the interviewer was just like it's okay man it happens to everybody but they're just being nice to all those people all right let's get started just finished setting it up time to program the actual [music] thing i never snitch on you d okay if i did this correctly it should just work yes yes yes no no no i've been trying to fix this bug for like 1 to two hours trying to figure out why this [ __ ] keeps happening why i keep getting redirected and do you want to know what the issue was do you want to know what the problem was this is my choice i pick this i don't even need to be doing this i should just be studying interview problems but i wanted to be h i wanted to make a funny extension ha the same f okay now it works and i'm going to prove it to you guys by doing this watch this if it doesn't work then i guess this is the end of my youtube please work please work oh thank god now that the whole redirecting works now i got to figure out how to do the whole random problem so i'm going to need a website that has all the recommended interview problems you should practice and then i can go on from there i wonder if anyone's actually made that hey everyone welcome back and let's write some more neat code what the [ __ ] did you hear that i've solved a lot of leak code problems hey guys i'm still unemployed so let's solve another leak code problem and eventually got an offer from google i made some free updates to my site n code. which if you're new it's basically a site i created to help people prepare for coding interviews for free i i love you n code i love you so much so i did some mining off camera and check it out i got it working yay whoa whoa whoa whoa what do you mean you did some mining off camera what did you do how did we go from here to here what happened what did yeah so i kind of forgot to record this part but this is basically what i did so the whole reason why i wanted a website that had interview problems is because i wanted to use a web scraper a web scraper is basically just a bot that extracts data and content from a website so you can use it for your own purposes and i decided to use ni's website i used his website to create a web scraping bot and all this bot does is it's going to look at all the problems on his website so it's going to extract the name of the problem and then the link to the problem and then from there i save that information into a json file and from there i can use that file to just generate a randomly code problem this was also my first time making a web scraping bot and let me tell you it probably would have been faster if i just wrote each of these problems out by hand instead of making this bot but in the words of michael reeves that's how you turn a 5-hour task into a a 1 and 1/2 month task because i'm a programmer and that's what we do all right so this extension is almost done it's just missing one more core feature currently the extension doesn't know if you solve the problem and this basically means you're stuck in endless torture you're never going to be able to access any website forever so i need to figure out how to program something to let the extension know that you actually solve the problem i'll come back whenever i figure that out i figured it out for you it only took a second but it's took me a couple hours to figure this out let me show you what i did so here we are on this leak code problem right as you can see i have the solution coded up because i'm such a genius i totally didn't copy and paste any code and before i submit this solution let me open up my dev tools and enter the network panel and now let me submit the solution you see that right there you see where it says check oh would you look at that it has all the information about if you solve the problem it has the language you use the status it has everything w so knowing this i wrote some code to grab that information and now i can just do a simple check if you actually solv the problem and if you did solve it i can just remove the redirect rule and now you're free for the day i took off your parental controls you can now access any website you can watch some youtube videos you know you could just waste your life anyways check it out if works yeah all right this extension is done i don't think there's anything left to do what it's just an ordinary krabby oh my goodness squid okay i just finished styling it this this extension is done for now there's still a lot i have to work on but it's it's done it's time to finally publish it on the chrome web store so all you guys can use it get your six-digit jobs and get yourself a nice little lambo oh wait they have to review this i mean that makes sense i hope they accept this name well hopefully this gets accepted by the time this is posted if you guys want to work on the code or just want to see it fix my spaghetti code i'll leave the repo in the description and you guys can mess around with it do whatever you want make it better and maybe we can make it from a meme to an actual useful extension i don't know that'd be funny but that's everything for meme um don't do drugs stick to le code and see you guys thank youing kit [music] 43
