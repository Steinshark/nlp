i did actually want to look at this because this is kind of wild one of my favorite iterations on webdev in general has been htm x htm x has been one of the greatest little tools for building uh sites of all time it is absolutely one of my favorites dude people got to people got to do something about these reddit mods because they are they're out of control can we all agree for a second you are out of control deleting the htm x account from reddit webdev hdmx the actual foundation of webdev got banned off of webdev the reason why i i i cannot stand reddit is that this can exist right uh i was having fun all right let's see what he got banned for here we go anyone heard of htm x is that is that really it he seems to have some kind of delusion about web servers returning html and browsers rendering content without first going through a j on stage is that even possible doubtful like look at this it's clear that everybody who's commenting here likes htm x 4 ines or htm x oh no this is so great this is so great this is so great this is so great four inches of fury i know the name the name of these people it is so good like but the but the thing that i i don't really get tell i appreciate what hmx is but it's not for me it sucks all the fun out of web dev for me it's a different way to think i already need to learn the new react meta frameworks the fastest runtimes the newest database services the rising omms the hottest ui libraries i don't have ch time to change the way i think of building ui keep a full-time job and still build and learn in my free time html feels more tedious than web components to me sorry but i'm sure net guys will consider it can we all just pour one out for this guy because i can't tell if this is satire or not but a lot of people feel this you know what i mean a lot a lot of people genuinely feel this in a real sense that there is so much change constantly like imagine like if you are a react person and you want to do web stuff and now they're just dropping this entire new way of doing things with like server components and all of that and now like not only do you have to learn react you have to learn meta frameworks you have to learn how to do serverless server lless comes with its own set of challenges right you have to think differently about your web server it's just simply different and you're just concerned yeah you may need to build bubble swort in css like it's getting so much harder these days like back in my day web de was simple we had like an endpoint i had asked for some data i would put that data on the screen like that's it jquery s yeah i know yeah uh no need to learn om if you're raw dog squeal see i'm a big fan of the raw dogging of the squeal you know what i mean um but either way like this is a real cry that a lot of people have honestly if you are feeling completely completely overwhelmed first off i'm sorry i'm sorry that web dev has gotten to the point where they think every last person should have this much knowledge which is it's it's just like unfair for you to be asked to know all these things and to know them well there's a whole problem that exists where if you use the same tool over and over again you get really fast at it and so when there's like a small additive change or even a larger medium-size additive change to that tool or that tool set you as the person who who's done it a bunch can easily make that adaptation but those who are just coming in those changes or larger changes or further abstractions just make it everything feel increasingly hard or increasingly harder and so i genuinely feel bad uh i think uh hdmx is honestly one of the few breasts of fresh air we've had in a while in the web development world absolutely love it absolutely love it it's too bad that we have people like this that don't have any sort of joke you know like a permanently banned seems a little heavy you know maybe they say no self-promotion and if that's the case i get it but maybe because it's also htm x you could go okay hey good joke we're going to give you a temporary slap on on the wrist but hey don't do it again it's just like if if react posts one of their articles should react be in trouble or do they they just have a larger crowd so people just go and post it for them reddit is serious business it's serious okay if you're going to take these if you're going to read memes online you better come in with a serious attitude for these memes uh yeah reaction banned yeah for real uh htx is a fine replacement for jquery tell me you know nothing jon snow without telling me you know nothing i discovered uh your stream last week and i've been binging your videos oh nice hx plus rust people love hx plus rust i like hx plus go plus temple i think that's a really great mix honestly it's a really good mix when you can just come in here and you can just you can just do things like oopsies why why am i lagging what what the heck was that what the what the hell was even that it's not supposed to go to that one it's supposed to go to this one but to be able to do something like this and go feels really really good right this feels good i know i should have just used harpoon i actually have it already harpooned uh i don't know why i didn't uh but this feels really really good love this okay i love it anyways hey sorry b sorry ht max appreciate you hope hopefully you get unbanned and if you don't well honestly you probably you probably lost nothing real talk you probably you you literally probably lost nothing the htm xygen
