this is the fastest cpu on the planet it costs eight thousand dollars has 64 cores and 128 threads 128 lanes of pci express gen 4 and runs on amd's latest seven nanometer zen 3 architecture that's the same one powering their top of the line 5000 series ryzen gaming cpus its code name is epic milan and we have two of them thanks to our buddy wendell how's it going we're at level one text let's take them for a spin cause i'll wait are they ever fast you know what else is fast the way i segue to my sponsor honey honey is the free to use shopping tool that helps search for some of the best promo codes on loads of your favorite sites get it today at joinhoney.com ltt hey this is the top of the line l's and g's the epic 7763 that i'm holding in my head yeah it may only run at a mere 2.45 gigahertz base 3.5 gigahertz boost but don't let that fool you this ain't no civic okay this is the hummer with the cummins swap all right these things are huge i can't get over it why do they have to make them so big it's not a measuring contest just never gets old you know i think the only way to get a bigger one is to buy one on ltteststore.com oh yeah by the way we're gonna have epic threadripper shaped ones coming soon probably in a few months now of course yoda would happily remind all of us that size not important performance is what matters and when it comes to performance this is pretty much the finest display of kicking someone while they're down that i think i have ever seen and i don't even feel bad here's the thing intel's latest and greatest 10 nanometer ice lake xeons they've got some platform advantages particularly when they're paired with intel's optane memory but for purely cpu-bound applications i mean they're not even competitive with amd's last generation epic roam chips price for price let alone the new ones because here's the thing amd comes in with more cores more gigahertz more cash and literally double the pci express lanes per socket yet amd still prices their top dog cheaper than intel's top dog and you might think well at eight thousand dollars a chip 200 bucks that's a that's a rounding error right but if you're buying a thousand of them at a time like intel thinks you are sorry intel not good enough for you i guess that works out to a quarter million dollars not to mention that if you're an enterprise or a data center that's upgrading your systems from say last gen on intel you're going to need a whole new motherboard which for servers generally means an entirely new system complete with financing and warranty about the warranty like if something goes wrong either with the hardware or software amd by contrast allows you to simply swap out the cpu update your bios preferably in the other order and you're good to go they've actually been using the exact same socket for their server platforms ever since the original epic launch back in 2017 and this intercompatibility is fantastic you know how i know because this is the exact same motherboard that we used to build our pc mac pro killer with our last gen epic something to note before we go any farther is that server components are generally designed to be run in an extremely high airflow environment so this cooling if that doesn't look suitable for a nearly 300 watt cpu that's because it's not we need to get to get a fan on there let's just throw our m.2 in here this is by the way the greatest thing ever this little tool-less m.2 retention mechanism absolutely love it they should all have that this supreme x 3090 is so hilarious it's so big we've never even tried to integrate it into an actual build it's test bench use only now you might notice that i'm installing it in one of the bottom pci express slots normally i would say don't do that but epic has so many pci express lanes that every one of these 16x slots all the m.2s all of it is just running full fat pcie gen 4 with all the lanes so it just doesn't matter okay okay i shouldn't quite say it doesn't matter there are situations where the lanes might need to be reallocated and they're the different chiplets and where they're attached to the io die and all that but mostly it's fine oh there it goes 128 threads guys this is cinebench r23 this isn't the like weak easy one now the reason that it was so easy tm for amd to maintain compatibility across generations is that under the hood the layout of their milan cpus is nearly identical to their older rom predecessors but that's not to say that amd didn't change anything like other zen3 cpus each of the eight chiplets here which each contains eight cores gets a full 32 megs of cash that is completely accessible to all eight of the cores rather than being split into 16 megs and 16 megs that means more efficient use of resources and lower latency they've also increased the speed of the infinity fabric links within the cpu and they've made a ton of other under the hood architectural changes that have allowed amd to hit a surprising 19 average ipc uplift that means that clock for clock this thing is almost 20 faster oh and they upped the maximum tdp for many of their chips including the 7763 to allow up to 280 watts per socket i mean that is how you get stuff like this happening look where it sits relative to anything else in the database 61 000 what so while the cpu is running a heavy benchmark like this it's self reporting a peak of around 277 278 watts of power what that means is that according to wendell from level 1 techs this tie-in board we have here is actually a bit on the conservative side for power delivery the daytona reference chassis that we've got back here can actually do closer to 285 200 290 watts per socket with some power tweaks which actually sounds a lot like amd has some overclocking headroom here you can even tweak some i o settings like disabling pci express gen 4 or lowering your memory speeds to give a bit more of the cpu's power budget to the cores themselves potentially improving performance but then again slowing down your pci express lanes or lowering your memory bandwidth can also hurt performance in other ways so it's going to depend on your application either way i cannot freaking wait to see what zen 3 based threadripper is going to be like especially with the core clocks and the power limits unlocked as we assume they'll be i suspect we're going to need some new motherboards with new power delivery for those now let's have some more fun last time around with our roam based 64 core epic blender was only able to use half of the cores per instance so we ran it twice with both of them running at the same time finishing in around a minute and 14 seconds this time around we are having no trouble utilizing the entire cpu and you can see i mean just look at this thing it is absolutely crushing this benchmark and the craziest part is check out these boost clocks we are seeing in excess of 2.8 gigahertz even as high as 3.1 gigahertz on some of these cores as it's running through this blender render and what's interesting is our temps are so well under control the maximum we've seen so far after about 10 minutes of cinebench running continuously and blender is around 70 degrees super reasonable the fans aren't even ramping up it's almost like having a gigantic cpu with the cores all spread out helps to get rid of the heat almost if you can't wait for the next threadripper and you decided you're crazy enough to use this as a workstation check this out i'm running this at half quality in the preview here this is an 8k timeline with multiple 8k clips obviously there's a bunch of lumetri color being applied to it look how smooth that is it's butter smooth can we make it all the way to full man that scrubbing is still extremely responsive naturally our next order of business is to play video games on it we got uh apex legends running at a cool 144 fps average that sounds not too bad maxed out at 4k i don't have any ammo that's okay it's not about being good at the game it's about having a good computer to run the game right so we got f1 2020 going here and what i did is i reset the hardware info clock speed logger so i want to see just how high these cores will get this is a game that unlike apex legends it can actually make use of heavily heavily multi-core cpus so we're gonna go ahead and uh okay there we go that's more like it now we're oh yeah we're driving now we're driving one percent lows at around 150 fps according to frame view over here so can you game on an epic server yes you can i need a break i'm broken once again the point is not how good i am at the game the point is this thing is sick oh i crashed so max we managed to hit 3.5 gigahertz in games and yes of course we're gonna play crisis three it is kind of amazing how good this game still looks is it not freaking crisis three even your hand model like looks really good yup it's amazing how well this game has aged it's it's running at about 60 fps at 4k you know this is a really quiet server i'm impressed oh you know i think it might be a little misleading all right here it goes 264 core epics cinebench r23 sorry it's like riley it's like 120 watts of fans yeah yeah it's really fast though what the hell holy crap oh okay let's you're just gonna tease me like it ran in 12 seconds i want to see task manager it takes longer to queue up the test than it takes to run the test hold on i'm not even going to be able to get it up in time dang it 91 000 that's weak it should be able to do like 110 really yeah oh all right new attempt wendell sent us over a couple tuning parameters here we go 98 623 that's not quite the 100k plus that wendell managed to get on his own with more tinkering and more tuning but i think it goes to show a couple of things number one is these things are so fast they can tear through anything not made for gaming who cares they're gonna game pretty good and number two is that once you get to this level of hardware it's not just plug and play ladies and gentlemen you actually have to know what the freak you're doing can you imagine running like 16 quad-core virtualized gaming stations off of one of these like uh maybe in our land center get subscribed to make sure you don't miss that and while you're down there let us know if you have any other cool ideas for a project we could use one of these bad boys for just like i'm going to let you know what you could use our sponsor for ting mobile sponsor today's video and they want you to hear their message over the sound of
