hey just keep calm and say no to coding challenges okay so this i feel like this article is going to be a spicy one because if i am if i you know i'm just looking at it from just because i forgot to turn off alerts alerts all right just looking at it from the name it makes me think that this person's going to recommend you to take an interview and when someone's like could you now please uh could you please call this little up for me and they're and their recommendation is gonna be this no all right here we go here we go hiring is broken oh man look at this there's so many good ones look at we can we got we got so many great pieces here okay let's see okay here we go keep calm and just say no to coding challenges all right all right do you resent wasting your time with coding challenges no keep calm and say that you have decided to stop doing them okay okay companies have their processes and deal breakers since the hiring process is a two-way street you are entitled to have your own deal breakers okay where are we going where are we going hey just let the band cook a little bit okay uh there's a completely underrated tool in job hunting no it's not an app and no it's not chat jeopardy here is the secret talk with the recruiter that makes the first phone call you know i'm not gonna lie to you the amount of emojis has already made me upset i'm a man who does not use emojis okay i don't i don't like it i know that you feel the urge to skip that part and talk as fast as possible to someone that understands that vim is better than emacs he's correct uh but skipping that urge is worth its weight in gold because you can use this opportunity for example avoid code challenges what you do is that you get to know each other and the company and then wait for that moment so that was in summary who we are as a company and what we are looking for do you have any questions and indeed you have questions hello yes can you describe your recruiting process which steps would i go through if everything works fine she'll be happy to oblige maybe you'll need to ask for more precise question uh or uh maybe you'll need to ask for more precision you mentioned there will be a technical evaluation how would that go is it more like a technical discussion or a coding challenge to do at home then you hear either we don't do coding challenges we have found they waste too much time for our candidates and there are other ways to evaluate their technical skills then all is fine you have uh you have avoided coding challenges or you hear yes indeed there will be a coding challenge that consists of this and this this is the crucial moment where you breathe and you say polite and calm uh and say or you stay polite and calm and say thank you for clarifying that well i have to be transparent with you i have bad experiences in the past with coding challenges and i've decided to stop accepting them just like that okay just so you know hey guess what everybody this person's just giving you the best way to get rejected from many many interviews you know so perhaps perhaps uh uh perhaps this person doesn't really need a job that much and therefore just can go like this oh what do you do oh you're like 93 of all companies and you do take a coding challenge look at that pinky laughs sorry i don't accept him um they leave a taste like a ashtray in my mouth so no thank you to both your job and your interview process i actually just spit on my screen that was disgusting perhaps this person is applying to a scrum lead role oh yeah okay then yeah you're right they probably don't need to do that um so so far without reading anything else my current take is that this is some of the worst advice i've ever heard real talk just just just hear me out for a second you literally have been told by every company that there is a secret handshake the secret handshake involves you knowing basic data structures and how to apply them so you can go and study for eight hours get good at basic data structures you can walk in who's do the secret handshake and get right inside the door or b you can just say no to most jobs out there is that unreasonable here's the deal i don't think coding interviews are the best way to to evalu uh validate a candidate's ability i'm on your team you should find good questions to ask daring your technical interview part and have them code up some various things whether that's integrating with apis handling many promises being able to work with async but choose something that's really really good because you know what that's going to give you a lot of insight into their abilities okay and guess what you the interviewer know that you get to go in with not knowledge right and yeah and you're right this person right here even they even went with take-home versus whiteboarding those are two very different things i'm actually i'm fine with both of them i don't like again i don't think there's any one way to interview good right i think that if you want to do this well you need to be able to have a live interview i want to see a take home and i want to see a technical collaboration i want to see all three of them because here's the deal someone that shines like wild on a take home may completely fail on uh on a whiteboard but then do pretty good on the technical collaboration kind of a higher level technical discussion guess what fine by me but here's the deal some people have like 16 kids and they don't have the time to just go dick around for eight hours on your sweet take home maybe they're too busy streaming on twitch and so guess what their take home is going to be as minimal effort as possible but then they're gonna get up and kick ass and take names on the whiteboard and do great on the technical collaboration guess what that's called learning like that's you're just giving them many opportunities to show you that they have the ability it's just nuts to me that you would that you would say no to this okay so this is my first kind of inkling right now okay i have three jobs two wives and seven children i don't have time for interview challenges sunglasses on uh anyways okay all right here we go worst sad looking up man face worst case scenario an uncomfortable conversation the conversation could become uncomfortable recruiting is a hard uh job to do well this is true very true and just like programming requires training and practice unfortunately too much people are doing recruitment without having been through enough recruiting training one dude was mad at me and told me how difficult programmers are etc really so let me get this straight you went to a company talked to a recruiter who told you the exact steps the company takes to validate candidates and you asked for individual and special treatment and his response was programmers are difficult this this does read okay i see what he's trying to say which i agree in some aspects with what he's trying to say but you gotta recognize asking a company to just take a completely one-off course for you and you alone is just kind of  right it is a two-way street okay all interviews are two-way streets and you have to meet in the middle and the reality is they're the one that are going to pay you so you often meet more on their side than your side okay really it's where the power is that you get to determine who's on what side like you can't you know like if a company tried to get me away from netflix i love my job i love what i do and i have time to do streaming on twitch so guess what if you're trying to hire me it's gonna be a hard sell it's just gonna be a hard sell you have to convince me to leave all these things and jeopardize my illustrious article reading twitch stream to take a risk on you right so like there has to be like the i feel like right now the pot like but i could get fired from netflix my twit you guys could quit watching my twitch stream and guess what also the power is gone from my side right like things can just change in a day in a like in literally a day they can completely change and i i have to reevaluate things right and guess what guess would be taking guess who would be taking up uh those technical interviews this guy yeah i get that there's definitely some emojis uh what what what what does this mean isn't that like a sports term is that a soccer call defensive violation i don't know what it is uh it's more like let's see i understand well no deal then canceled uh it's more likely though that the recruiter says something like well i can understand now from our side we have our processes so uh i guess it's a deal breaker exactly there you go that's expected and that's fine they have their company processes and rules you have uh you have starting today your candidate processing rules the first rule being that you don't go to coding challenges uh you don't do coding challenges this works good so i i'd say that this advice works way easier in an environment in which there's more roles and more desire than just than just like anyone that's available to fill them and they just want warm bodies that can kind of code and use chat jeopardy you know what i mean uh by failing early you have won something important you have one time and uh to find another company that wastes less of your time again i don't think it's wasting uh uh you have lost one lead where you may have invested 12 and uh or 24 hours in a coding challenge and i've personally heard about much more you wouldn't believe it so he say i think he's specifically saying take home is this about a take-home coding challenge during those 12 to 24 hours you can get in touch uh with way more than one company i may feel out of reach if let's see that may feel out of reach if that one company is the only one that replied after tons of cvs then you have another issue you need to become better at finding companies this is such a good take this is just such a good take you know what the real problem is real problems are uh you're just not very good at front of companies that's all the problem is okay maybe if you stopped uh stop doing uh whatever you're doing start doing it differently that's a topic for another day but that starts with actually understanding how hiring works from multiple points of view which uh was the subject of my last article that's the scenario doesn't sound let's see that scenario doesn't sound too bad for me but there is more ear what's the let's see the best recruiters want to understand your concerns does it sound too could be does it sound too good to be true no not at all that's just the way it works for the best recruiters your interests and theirs are actually quite well aligned because they are of course interested in convincing you or convincing not only you but the candidates after you to work with them the best way to do that is to actually shape a candidate's experience uh people let's see hold on actually shape a candidate experience people will want to go through i i know what he's trying to say yeah nobody is perfect so she might have accepted uh their uh see from their hierarchies that there must be a coding challenge thing they swear to her it will only take uh up to four hours now obviously the guy who tried it was the guy who designed the coding challenge so he knew exactly what to do and did uh indeed complete it in less than four hours if you tell her that in your experience and in the experience of your friends the kind of coding challenge takes anywhere between 8 to 55 hours to actually do she will listen carefully and she will talk about it internally alas it's likely to uh that her hiring manager will not listen because many of those alas don't respect recruitment hmm [music] thank you babe what was that oh thank you love you what was that no thank you love you bye uh okay beautiful wife gave me a nice delicious lunch she made this last night it's very good all right something that developers who struggle to get a job don't realize is that the reverse is also true companies struggle to hire developers not top companies like forum but really at the average company developer positions stay vacant for many months if the hiring manager one month after you spoke out realized that the position is not being filled and asks what can be done about it the recruiter will bring the candidate pain point to the table once again maybe another developer was brave enough to do the same thing as you explained to her politely why he doesn't like and doesn't uh do coding challenges anymore he would have given other arguments and she will use that ammunition to shape things up because really it's in everyone's best interests so okay so there's a huge problem with this there's a huge problem with this entire statement here uh type one in the chat if you're looking for a job right now goodbye it's a lot of ones right that's a lot of ones now out of all the people that typed one and you would like a job i want you to type 69 if you're willing to just completely avoid a company based on a take-home are you willing to say no to jobs based on take home all right so there's a lot of people so there's a lot of people that are willing to say no i feel like there's might be a miscommunication we'll try this again we're going to try this again we're going to try it again okay type zero in the chat if you're looking for a job but you're willing to say no to a take home okay real talk there's a lot of people that are willing to do it because here's the thing is that no matter how you feel there's someone who wants it more you know what i mean there's somebody who always wants it more than you make a poll we'll make a poll let's make a poll and i think that's the hard part here which is you're not just trying to get the job you're also getting you're also competing against other people uh let's see here we go uh who are you question mark nice typing me uh not looking for a job looking and will do coding challenge we'll do coding looking and won't do coding challenge um retired i don't program there you go i'm pretty sure that's like everything but again this is not this is not it though right because guess what good companies do the same thing you're saying no not to just shitty companies there's not some equation that exists out there that's like shitty companies do x and non-shitty companies do why netflix does a take home i don't think netflix is a shitty company at all uh just this week i did a virtual whiteboard encoding uh with a startup normally i would decline but i like them and and i don't like my current job oh that's tough so like here's the thing i think that what what this says to me is that when you're in a good position it's easy to say no right we can all say no when we want to exactly but when you don't have a choice or you're under pressure saying no changes and so this whole idea that you can just uniformly say no and you don't have to consider it it just feels a bit like a miss do you know what i mean like a lot of you know i i personally i do what it takes to provide for my family and if i need to know that secret handshake i'm gonna do that secret handshake i much much prefer a take-home versus a whiteboard yeah i think take-homes you can show better example of yourself but it also is a function of time it can be a lot harder and so you know what my take is that it's it's totally a scale of what i want if i if you're trying to get me away from netflix right now then yes absolutely you're not i'm gonna say hey you can try to like you can ask me to to leave but you're gonna have to give me a good reason too and i will shape the interview much different but if i'm like looking for a job and i really really want a change which this has happened in the past and hell yeah i'm gonna do a coding interview right uh apparently do you think a lot of people with imposter syndrome are scared of coding tests and uh will rationalize why they are bad i do think this does happen i think there's a huge reason why people don't like coding tests um one i think uh that people just have general anxiety especially live uh and we don't get enough social interaction in our culture uh this tech revolution makes parasocial relationships completely more predominant than social relationships so i think in general people just have a harder time connecting with other people and i think that that's one of the largest drivers why live coding challenges are so difficult uh and i'm not trying to be mean about it i just think it's i just think it's i just think it's real that it's hard right it's a lot harder if you're completely out of practice talking with people you don't really know it's hard to talk with people you don't really know and then to be able to do the skill you've been doing for hours every single week on a whiteboard it's very very hard give a choice between a take-home and a live coding i think this is good at netflix we do both um because we we don't like to weigh one more than the other you know what i mean if you do lights out on the live and you just do okay on the take home there's still something to believe that you have it right yeah small coding challenges are great i agree with that right and you want to make the take home great hey the name is the prime gen don't put the part where i do anything flip
