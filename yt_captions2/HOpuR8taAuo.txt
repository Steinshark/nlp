ladies and gentlemen in today's video i am going to play every advanced chessbot on chess.com and try to beat them as fast as possible there are 20 of these bots i have made videos in the past where i play against the beginner and the intermediate bonds on chess.com and there are 15 of them on today's video there's 20. so we're gonna try to do this as fast as we possibly can the only thing is that i'm going to try to switch the colors every single game uh first up is antonio and uh here we go uh the timer begins i'm going to start with pawn to e4 i'm gonna try to talk to you through all the moves and hopefully this inspires you in some of your own games um okay we have a petrov defense which is already fascinating antonio i don't know which country he's from but uh there's an antonio irl who's what is what is d5 that's a very weird move i'm gonna pin the knight to the king here uh i think antonio's just given me a pawn which is very nice um i'm gonna block with the bishop i'm gonna develop my own bishop we're gonna castle we're just the pawn up so uh we took advantage in the in the early opening of uh of our opponent playing inaccurately this move is probably setting up an attack on our queen okay now we can always dip out i'm building up a very solid structure i'm very happy to trade the queens i really don't mind uh whatever it takes i'm gonna kind of try to gallop forward i like that trade as well that pawn might be a little weak we should we should protect it let's also start targeting some pawns over there uh we are now pinning the knight to the uh rook over here we're also trying to pin the bishop it's a little difficult for him to move so it takes and bishop b5 you cannot move the bishop you can't move either of the rooks either which is kind of okay that's just a big blunder that doesn't change the status quo whatsoever everything is rock solid here and we're gonna simplify this very easily we're just going to add as much pressure to that as we possibly can ah oh that was a slip uh luckily we're still winning pawn to e6 i managed to bounce back not happy about that but okay now we're gonna wedge this in and hopefully antonio resigns at some point soon because i'm bored um rook uh here we're threatening check we're threatening to take the bishop and yeah that should be game over i can even sack my rook to promote if this i have check which is nice thank you thank you pre-move this just in case and uh easy win all right he's also pre-moving but i'm the one with more pieces so come on antonio anytime now buddy bring it in are you going check check with a sack if i have to i'm not i'm out of respect for antonio i'm not gonna make a second queen although actually that's probably the fastest way to win so actually i think i will be making a second queen sorry antonio you kind of did it to yourself dude all right mate is coming soon my god there it is he's still thinking he he he wasn't sure if he was getting mated uh one hilarious thing about wendy is i don't know why her rating is this what does that even mean i saw this that doesn't even make sense what what chess.com is not certain of her rating 1500 question mark exclaim like chess.com how do you not know the rating of one of your bots uh okay anyway i'm playing like this i'm gonna take if i get attacked uh this is a weird move block i mean maybe queen b5 is the idea i'm gonna take knight c6 that targets the pawn in the center but not right away oh that is a good move wow sophisticated bot pinning my knight i thought maybe you wouldn't know that move uh uh that's a move if this i can't take the bishop who is this why is this oh my god this bot is ridiculous um bishop d6 i i just really need to castle that would be that would be really nice if i can castle please um but i wait a minute i'm i'm wait i'm i have to move my what is this this is insane if i if i went there i was losing material is this even a real 1500 bot spot is ridiculous okay i'm gonna trade the bishop so i don't lose anything now i'm gonna put my knight on g6 like this is under fire that's what the heck what what am i even playing against what is this concoction this is nuts this bot is so strong all right knight e5 uh let's put the pawn on a6 we have a nice little brick wall here and we're just gonna have to grind this bot down in an end game let's infiltrate with our rook uh let's team them up so they defend each other and now let's play f6 my knight is really strong so i have a really good night in this position uh i expect maybe this okay that's not a good move because now my my king can get active and uh the bot is not actually doing herself any favors by playing so passively gonna take a little bit of space and um probably at some point i can play uh like i can play the king e3 is coming i mean these bots are just like they're they're actually resilient at this level which is just unnerving i'm gonna go g5 maybe i won't like maybe i shouldn't play like this at all this is this is ridiculous i i like i don't even have an advantage against the bot i have a really bad feeling i'm gonna lose to one of these in this video um okay knight b4 hits both i mean what am i gonna have to win like a rook end game this is this is crazy yeah literally i have to create a weakness and win it while my i put it as this is nuts this is completely ridiculous okay oh my god what thank god okay rook takes d3 should be thank you all right that's a winning king and pawn end game uh i don't even know what that was that that was not an intermediate bot i mean that wasn't even an advanced bot as far as i'm concerned i don't know that was crazy it's about to draw this end game too in fact oh my god is it actually like holding a draw here or is it going to like throw what what wait this is can i can what is happening i like i i i'm still winning but oh my god that was terrifying okay this is officially a win yo that that i don't know what that was i don't know who this bot is that that didn't feel too good whatever whatever that just i don't know i don't know i was weird this bot is not 1500. no wonder it's its thing was like that we're seven minutes into speed run it took me four and a half minutes to even beat that bot all right let's play queen d3 um we're gonna try to beat the bot with the manhattan gambit i feel like maybe these bots we we we shouldn't even play this aggressively against because i i i'm i'm under the suspicion that um i don't know because they're they're they're all different types of like programs and you know maybe maybe like one is programmed not to self-destruct as fast as the other i have a chance i can give a check he says are you trying to trick me no i'm just trying to take your soul no trickery here knight f3 yeah i don't know like do i play aggressive do i play positional i mean like in which style should i be playing against uh against these bots like i have bishop g5 coming i'm really not sure i'm i'm pinning this what that's a terrible mistake because okay so i just played some absolute murderer bots and now i'm playing you know pierre who is doing his best but struggling but they probably defend very well that's the one thing about these stupid bots is like you cannot just completely slaughter them and they just lose like you you actually have to put them away which uh which is very annoying actually okay i'm gonna prevent the king from castling oh my god i just said right like if you oh my god three check oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god this is terrifying uh i have this check i mean i of course i'm winning but like i have this check and i guess i'm just gonna block the bishop's view oh my goodness this is nuts queen d7 of course i'm completely winning like i'm just gonna win the pawns and uh okay i have a check and i'm gonna take this pawn and that pawn is gonna probably become a queen and i just need to make sure my king stays safe but yeah this is still like awful i mean the fact that it's even gone this long is just like painful threatening the rook writing this and it's like never over i mean like it's gonna keep checking me right it's like it's gonna like now my king is safe and this pawn is safe so i'm totally fine okay i made a i made a promotion i under promoted let's trade and let's push yeah of course i'm completely winning but like i mean these bonds don't just hang a mate so because they don't hang a mate they never really resign and it makes it there's no check right none of this works so i'm gonna make a queen it's like really hard to actually beat them okay we're bringing the queen back we'll take over here i think it's going to run forward because it's mathematically oh okay it's mathematically the best way to survive check check made all right that's three down in 10 minutes i mean i i'd love to pick up the pace but uh i'm kind of terrified all right this time let's play a modern defense g6 bishop g7 uh pawn to d6 a6 we're gonna play next like this and i i'm gonna play uh okay that's a very weird move i don't know what i've never seen that move in my life you can't even take with the queen now d5 is probably fine for me i'm gonna try to lock the center here computers generally will do very dumb things if you if you lock the center generally i don't know about mr pablo here apparently i played pablo once in the past i i don't actually have this in my memory i hope pablo doesn't do this oh my god it is pablo trying to i'm gonna close the position that's the way you got to beat these stupid stupid stupid bots close the position make them self-destruct and now we're gonna start our own something something over there although i really have no idea how good this is it's probably not very good at all let's attack the pawn uh that's free right i mean there's check but yeah so it looks like he kind of self-destructed he doesn't really know what he's doing anymore now i'm just gonna advance uh i don't actually know if i'm like winning at all uh but uh it looks good he might play h4 h5 but i have bishop here so i did i did a nice job here i kind of controlled the bot and and now i'm marching in and again it's gonna not self-destruct but i don't think in this case it really has much of a choice uh i mean i am knocking on the door and i am i i i'm going to be led into the position for sure time to get in with the knight i have some queen a2 but this is very good as well uh knight c4 hits the queen this is hit everything is hit and now you have to lose this that was a that was uh okay he is officially completely self-destructing which i like check we're gonna win the queen and now it should be pretty straightforward uh check check and clean that was a good win actually i'm i i i i don't hate that i i will happily take wins like that uh throughout let's play pawn to d4 what is he gonna play let's play a trumpowski i don't mind that i mean okay knight d2 and and let's build the pyramid or we'll take the center if allowed okay we were not allowed so let's build the pyramid and let's play bishop d3 and now i'm gonna go for the stonewall structure so this bishop is now expendable uh i guess you can take now and i think what i will do is i will just win the battle for the center and put my knight on e5 that this this is fine it's all kind of normal um i don't really okay i'm not really again it's a bot so remember like it's it's gonna be a genius a little bit like you have to give it a little credit um i'm just gonna attack i'm threatening bishop h7 greek gift and knight g5 oh my god that's a good move oh this is gonna be a long game oh and i immediately blundered this oh no he saw it oh my goodness if i take there's like f4 i mean this is actually kind of terrifying uh queen h5 is okay luckily joel blunders back what what is that is he gonna go here or something no none of that works get get that out of here let's take on h4 this is like insane i mean what i i don't actually have any attack though he's he's completely safe i think um okay maybe we come back and we try to like just attack him anyway he's trying to attack me by the way i don't think he he really respects what's going on here rook h7 right okay he let me do this i don't know if this is any good again he's a bot so this all might be part of his master plan okay i think i'm getting in there it is yeah it was uh it was a little scary for a moment but now it's queen and pawns versus two rooks normally two rooks can fight against the queen uh but in this case i think i have way too much okay that's not mate um i think i have too much activity i have uh i'm gonna give another a check and push and and i think i should be because i have so much power here yeah and i'm gonna just check by the way almost blundered like a oh my god i almost blundered that that could have been a disaster but luckily i have check check and uh i'm winning the rook i'll check i'm gonna yeah i was that was oh my goodness all right isabel i have played isabelle before according to chess.com uh let's play a dutch defense against isabel and let's play okay she's playing like the most principled approach we have this um wow that is i that is like a top computer move like the fact that the bot is playing knight h3 nobody plays knight h3 but it's a bot so remember it's going to play like the top engine move because that's what it is um wow okay let's go knight c6 [music] blunder by the way oh my god i think it can trap my knight oh my god i think it can go here i think it's missing it but it can play pawn to e3 oh this is bad oh my god i can't play risky openings against these bots i just straight up can't because um because they're programmed to play like like literal stockfish like the first x amount of moves or something this is uh this is insane so i just have to like keep the tension until it makes a mistake okay let's play rook c8 i mean we have to do something we can't just fall over and die i mean humanity is relying on us here uh yeah and it's just gonna keep making accurate moves oh my god this is nuts this is not this is terrifying stuff this is a big threat now if i can get did i just hang wait but there's this okay maybe maybe it was all part of my master plan uh take i might be i take ah i can take the rook but i think i should take the bishop actually because now maybe i have rook c2 but i'm not i'm not thrilled about these developments oh it blundered finally b5 okay now it's a fork uh it didn't actually solve any of the bots problems that because i have this oh yes wow that was terrifying for a moment i mean that was i felt my life flashed before my eyes okay no more dodge defense we're learning the hard way um oh no my pawn will it will it hang that yes yes now i'm hitting it all right all right all right all right all right all right you're so tough you're so that was very embarrassing i tried to catch it with a pre-move it did not work again let's not forget the bot doesn't actually want to lose so um just gonna have to pre-move the rest of the game like this and check check check mate boom obliterated destroyed trash l plus ratio all right uh now we're playing arthur from wales or there is a whale just kidding arthritis i don't know anything about you um let's play the b3 sicilian okay he responds with what that's not a move what is that what i was so disturbed by the move i didn't even know how to react to it okay what what is arthur doing what is this oh my god uh i'm extremely disturbed this move is actually terrible it does nothing um in between move but yeah that was just a terrible move what i just played again the these bots they're annoying because they play badly but at any moment they just play like five top engine moves in a row and then all of a sudden your knight is trapped in the center of the board like it was against uh like it was against isabel i can take and i think i have knight c6 i can take and i have this fork so i'm gonna be winning this unless the knight is getting trapped which would be really stupid i have massive uh ptsd from the last game btsd is no laughing matter um i do not uh i did not say that lightly um let's go here i'm just trying to take back with the knight and i'm gonna try to trade bishops let's see do you think the bot is gonna repeat moves with me okay it doesn't which i suppose i welcome but i'm still not like thrilled about my position now that's under attack is the bot gonna follow it up with this no it doesn't i don't really know what this does though because this is this is a nightmare i mean we might be here for like two hours this is a this is very stressful like the bots are playing at a ridiculous level okay the queen is hanging takes takes knight takes i'm only upon up which is like a good amount of material but like not if you're playing a bot you know what i mean maybe you don't know what i mean it's okay you don't have to know what i mean queen e7 i'm just trying to trade the queens the bot doesn't want to trade queens with me um i mean like i'm winning but it's it it it's it's anything but over let's play rookie two maybe that might have been a blunder that might have been can i take and then and then take and then i take the and then i have check i get queen d6 i think it's winning i think this is a winning move yes because now i give you a check i pre-move this and then i take your rook oh that was smooth oh that was smooth all right now we're winning here we go three move free move pre move pre move pre move pre-move pre-move remove free move wait i don't want to prove that remove this though nope f6 is gonna get played nice i'll remove this and uh that's it my opponent's gonna run out of moves we are going to win this is terrifying and i don't resign bm and bots yes i will take that too thank you very much just have to make sure i don't stalemate okay well that's definitely not a stalemate and that's mate on g7 all right we managed to defeat arthur let's keep it moving now we are playing jonas who is from germany an old man well he's not old he's just got a beard and is bald he plays the bird opening and whatever on earth this is so what we've learned thus far is uh that the bots they they do their thing they are not to be deterred so this time i'm gonna play the hippo let's see how effective the hippo is i don't know what that move does is he gonna go here next okay again okay what's up thank you for being 24 minutes into the speed run by the way if you're watching and listening you are appreciated this is a very flexible setup i have not committed anything anywhere all right now we're trying to do this and then take this pawn he allows it gonna move there we're gonna take he can take this but i think his center pawn is definitely more significant he's also just not acknowledging my queen which is just disrespectful uh queen goes back to b7 i can on pass on i guess i will why not show him a few uh tricks of the trade i'm gonna control the b file here he can't he attacks my pawn which is disrespectful i will counter-attack by attacking his pawn and defending my own and now i'm gonna play this move c5 and try to get my knight into the middle now i think it's good time to castle and then we're slowly gonna you know we're gonna get the horses out and we're gonna be in good shape i think let's take he's gonna take i'm gonna play knight c5 and i and and i'm happy i think we did a nice job look at this look at that pin action uh i'll grab the rook why not grab the bishop next grab the knight we got a lot of pins i got that pin i got that pin jonas is in serious trouble here um and i got look at that i mean too much pressure you just can't deal with all of this just queen c5 that was a terrible move by the way that was so stupid because now he can move his knight it's okay oh okay uh he's uh he's uh what's the word that i'm looking for he's not bad jonas he's definitely not bad resourceful resourceful old man but i'm still winning sorry jonas oh my god go here it was a good fight but unfortunately jonas i am better i am faster i am stronger all right now let's slide over he's kind of making this easy for me the resistance being put up isn't that big so he's gotta go to the back rank i'm not even gonna take and that's made it that's mate he moves out of the way but i'm gonna make a rook that's made as well jonas gg i'm just better than you no problem isla uh e4 isla and e4 sound kind of similar uh let's play the alapin sicilian of course they're gonna play mainline right okay e6 is not uh he's six is i could just take let's take let's take and let's play like a symmetrical structure let's pin the knight nothing nothing crazy i'm gonna take on c5 so the bishop has to move a second time now i'm gonna play rookie one and uh and then life is good pin the knight got two pins here still nothing special but sliding out of the way i could have taken on c6 maybe that's a bad move okay that's that's not a good move that's definitely over committing oh i'm gonna jump into the middle i think i can now start taking advantage of my opponent's lack of development um and yeah i think this is just not what bots but that might have been the best move by the way which is like the funniest part all right i'm gonna grab the bishop and and i i should be hit the rook okay the rook is just being given to me so let me uh trade a few pieces and uh it's very strange bots are so weird trading the queens is not the not the best way to play the speed run um trading the queens is definitely the wrong way to play the speed run because again in the speedrun you're not trying to win an end game you're trying to win as fast as possible uh and i am not doing that right now in fact if anything i'm like sabotaging my winning chances um i'm of course still winning but it like let's play before this is under attack i'm gonna rotate the rook around and try to win the pawn okay the bot doesn't let me do that see like like they're good defenders i mean you can't just this bot is defending it's a bot damn it like you know uh let's go here i guess i have to give up this and i have to okay but this should be winning for me because i have d6 check okay when the pawn when it starts just like throwing away away random pawns like this it's that's when it's officially kind of lost its mind um okay so here that's the end of the game let's take with check uh give another check that was a terrible move there was no need to do that okay let's push and that should be the end it's gonna move this must be winning right i think it is check can't take with the king i go here you have to get my pawn i get both of yours i win yeah let's go there push this is just winning this is a winning king and pawn end game i have two pawns but it's winning even with one because my king is on the right kind of uh side control let's go here bring the king and of course this is technically not the fastest way but i'm gonna i don't know where the king is going so i'm just trying to pre-move okay nice all right uh that was lorenzo is the tenth bot i gotta play i got 10 more bots this is so nuts um french defense let's play a french against lorenzo he's'00 okay he's playing a very closed position he's playing queenie too so um we're gonna keep the tension i i don't see a reason to take him i'd rather he takes me okay it's a very close position so now it's gonna come down to controlling not just controlling but also just like advancing on this side of the board like a6 and castling there is very bad yeah it's bad because i already made it very clear like this is where i would like to attack so i'm gonna play knight b6 and just go uh did he just get his night trapped this is an'00 level bot what i'm just up at night i don't understand what now i i have mentioned that like it's gonna fight back i guess that that what now i'm gonna trade everything huh what is this what does it do is lorenzo's just dead lost what is he doing okay yeah he can pin me but like i can unpin myself right like yeah i'm what that was hard what is he doing what is he doing maybe some of the bots are like having bad days like i don't know maybe maybe the bots are sentient of course it's not the best way to play again you don't have to trade the queens but this is one of the easiest ways to win in chess just remove your opponent's counter play from existence and uh that's what i'm doing right now i'm gonna play rookie in the spacex again i'm not taking i'm trying to keep a nice solid pawn wall intact i'm gonna go here in bishop basics he's gonna take take and play rook f5 yeah take take rook f5 or that now we're going to trade the bishop uh that's really bad because now i have rookie one check he didn't want to get hit with rook a1 check and uh this is gg gonna sack his rook i think that was an awful game i mean he was completely lost in 10 moves wally i'm waiting for the soviet name you know i'm waiting to play victor all right wally let's play a queen's gambit let's play a catalan let's play a catalan with g3 bishop g2 yeah this will win it back we're not worried what that you just gave me the pawn back you gave me both what the'00 elobots are worse than the i could have went back to e5 uh they're worse than the uh what the queen d4 is there bishop b1 i don't understand i'm just this is a fantastic position why did he take my i mean i pre-moved it but i didn't know he was gonna do that okay well i'm just completely winning now i just have a huge advantage i mean i have i have the catalan bishop and i have an extra pawn so i'm not even gonna trade i'm just gonna take the whole center wow wow you think wally's gonna play f4 which is the best move and he did not f4 was you had to control me from getting to my desired square um again it's not over uh after that move it might be especially if he takes this and hangs a fork he did not but i'm two pawns up and you know i got no plans of losing them rook c4 maybe but again you see the bot is good at finding these like random like this garbage like finding these infiltrations like i'm trying to simplify yeah i mean of course if you trade all the pieces with me i'm gonna win now i can just advance i can push my biggest asset i can put my king on h1 yep i expect rook f2 because like i said these bots they they love to my rook is hanging don't hang your rook it hits the knight i'm ready to push i'm ready to go let's go let's get you out of the way uh queen that's a pin that looks very unpleasant uh i mean a queen trade must win me the game so i'm gonna do it rook d8 and we don't have to trade the rooks but we're winning because we're also gonna get that okay he just gives me the knight now we are going to yep just bring the king king has to stay close to the pawn we will walk around we will eat this i don't think there's a stalemate he said isn't that fun wally if this is fun for you you must like colonoscopies like i don't know what to tell you now i don't know which of these moves is going to be made this looks it looks like that one i think wally's just into weird stuff julia all right from the netherlands another what why is why do these bots play the bird all right we're playing kind of a sicilian um okay julia puts her queen on f3 for some reason julie is an'00 bot that puts her queen on f3 that's cool we're just gonna be solid we're gonna develop like normal yeah that's that's the issue with the way i played this and i i have to remember is julie gonna find this move that's definitely the best move the best move it's the best move because i kind of didn't develop in the most accurate way and uh okay let's just castle let's survive the opening okay now now you can take this probably now the bot is trying to go back oh my oh my god i'm kind of terrified is gonna go to d3 and try to mate me okay luckily i'm good enough to see that and i'm gonna try to win this pawn that a bot just keeps leaving there uh rook b8 b5 bishop b7 i want to create counter play on the queen side like this while i still can while i'm still surviving this position i like this i i think i think the bot has kind of gone awry uh if you will um and maybe i can rotate around like this again it's like it it really just is never too late to lose all your pieces yeah knight e4 and the knight is coming to f6 i think i'm gonna have to get rid of my light squared bishop i really don't want to but like we have a huge battle right now for this pawn if i can win the pawn i'm gonna win the game c4 looks really nice now as a result of the departure of the queen i'm gonna put some more pressure here i'm not like completely thrilled with this in fact i might not even be thrilled with this at all oh my god uh yeah yeah i i oh wow okay i have to take a moment here uh i am really not sure what the best move is let's do this take take like that huh knight takes e5 bishop takes i have queen c5 i feel like i'm gonna blunder something like i feel like i'm a moment away from losing all my pieces like did i hang this oh my god oh my god ah do i have to take this do i have queen a7 well then they take my rook no but then i can take on d4 oh guys this is so scary oh my god wait i just i just described this i have rook takes maybe or bishop takes or rook takes or bishops okay i'm gonna take like this ah this is terrifying is there pawn to c3 no no i don't have rook d7 what no no no no no rook d7 bishop d yeah i'm losing this is insane i'm just straight up losing the game rook takes rook takes here what i'm gonna have to replay this game what is this and the bot is not gonna blunder now right i don't i i i what i can't win i mean i i i can't win this game what the f what the hell was that what how did i nah that's crazy i [laughter] i don't even know what just happened how did i lose to an'00 bot like that that was that that was insane why do they all do this guys this is i we are 40 minutes into a video i was not expecting to lose to one of these bots i mean again it's like stockfish the first half of the game right like it i i can't feel too bad but like at the same time what was that what was that i had a completely fine position and then i just like threw the game i mean it's the bot is still playing completely horribly against me like it's it's not even this isn't even normal what it's doing i i don't know i i oh my god okay i'm i'm gutted i just lost to an'00 baht everything i know about chess just out the window i'm not even playing well now okay position is very closed i i mean like i think i'm attacking but the last time i thought i was attacking i promptly lost the game so uh-huh i want to go knight d5 i think this like after this i i think i think i'm happy okay that's just a fork but i did not expect that come on oh my god is the queen trapped no there's queen b5 oh this is this bot is like my worst nightmare i mean what what is even going on i lost the pawn there was a pawn there now that the bot took my pawn what are you this is nuts what why is it playing perfectly after playing like a 200 the whole game how am i losing how but what i have to beat it with black i mean i can't just switch colors right like what oh what is this what what is what what now i was trying to lose on purpose what what is happening what was that why did it play g4 this is insane i i don't even know guys i mean i i i what is this this is some sick prank it's like no but not i mean i was playing like a 200. why is it playing like this what is going on i'm like i feel like chess.com staff is like watching me play the bots or something and and they're playing with the levels i i this is uh this is completely sick like how did this bot just play like 3 000 level chess i i i don't know this does not feel good let me tell you right now i oh no but i mean this is crazy like why is it playing like a 100 now it's just trading all the pieces in a completely losing end game oh guys i i that was i don't know what that was that was uh something else i'm gonna take the pawn okay play h2 i'm gonna play g3 play uh here here knight f2 and i hope i never ever ever see this bot ever again in my life this is what i just went through this traumatic i i don't even know what what just happened to me that was insane like i speechless completely speech like i i i don't know what to say oh my god get that bot away from me as fast i'm gonna call the cops i mean really that was okay this is miguel who uh is 1900. now i just don't trust any of these bots like that was i want owen too i lost two games that wasn't even like a that wasn't even an exaggeration i'm playing in london now all right this is a mainline london i'm gonna play bishop b5 uh queen b3 here is a good move looking to trade the queens yep and now i get this kind of nice and pleasant structure on the queen side um you can this looks really stupid but it's not yeah the point is you're trying to kind of get the the king to come a bit closer um i'll play bishop e5 i would like to be taken like this so i can bring in my knight yeah now i will finally go back because black made a couple of weakening moves okay now black doesn't even want my bishop well i can't decide what they want this is my idea uh that's a move i guess yeah take on c5 and play b4 okay it's a very equal position i think but now that's under attack so it might not be equal for much longer yeah i have one upon so now i have an advantage but if i learned anything from the last game is that literally that means absolutely nothing that was the most soul-sucking matchup i've i've like ever had in my life i mean this bot is 1900 and he's just losing like he's losing like a 1900 you know he's just like worse and i'm pressuring him and he's losing like a normal 1900. i i don't know what went wrong with that last one that was and i'm still gonna talk about it i mean that was sick and i'm not gonna edit it out because i have more respect on that for my audience you know not a like a healthy amount of respect um okay every pawn is being targeted which means that they will all soon perish i have this if you take i have bishop d5 which is a fork uh you might not have an option that's any better than that but uh i have rook f5 which is a nice move if you take i will take your rook and uh yeah there's a lot of pressure here so i have bishop takes d5 as an idea just play g5 bring the king up i mean i am in no rush whatsoever i don't know what this is doing like there is no benefit to play the way i'm playing uh let's play rook rook d4 controlling this is a nice trick maybe take b4 check if this b4 i really shouldn't play for tactics against the bots oh and i messed up because my rook is hanging oh my god oh my god why couldn't i have just kept it simple okay i'm gonna get four pawns i might still be okay but what the hell is wrong with me i'm gonna be made into a highlight reel again i might still be fine because i have so many pawns but i did not want it to come to this this is crazy g6 check g5 look at i mean look at this stupid column i have oh i think i'm gonna lose i think i'm gonna lose i i just cannot see myself surviving i i just really i cannot this is making me completely sick maybe i'm still fine i have f6 okay now i think i'm in better shape my pawns are flying down the board like to e7 maybe what the what is happening oh my god g7 e7 something has to be winning e7 and then i have bishop to e4 bishop c6 is mate okay i have bishop f5 check and kick the king out e7 maybe g7 and bishop g c hmm where's the win where is the win bishop bishop here bishop here take g8 that should be it that should be it please for the love of god oh my god oh my goodness there's king y8 my god there's king e8 i'm not sure this is a win the question is does my opponent have enough time to set up a drawing mechanism i think they do i think the bot knows how to draw this does the bot know how to draw this position it has to put its king there and and not allow me to come forward it's doing it the wrong way right now does the bot know how to draw this position because right now it's not doing it the right way right now i still have a winning chance i'm gonna rotate my bishop like this i think the bot doesn't know the draw yeah now i can play b6 and king b5 and and i should be winning oh god this is too stressful this is this is not this is not this this this was more fun it it it it used to be a bit fun it's not fun anymore what what is that okay oh my gosh what a video what a video i am absolutely exhausted tremendous let's let's tone it down javier xavier i'm gonna play a queen's gambit whoa he's playing a blackmart demer okay now the good news for me is the blackmart demer is uh is like a refuted opening i mean if i if i do this the right way then yeah you take and go queen g4 this is what you have to know and after queen g4 uh uh you can just take and you should just be winning like c6 is a little passive but you know you should be fine you can trade a couple of pieces and yeah this is this is good i'm rock solid i am two pawns up i believe in myself and this could be stockfish komodo all put together i still think i'm gonna survive i have a very good structure everything is defending everything i am not scared officially gotham is not scared should i be scared probably but uh i'm not let's trade we're just trading everything that's all we're doing all right we are we are not interested in any stupid stuff we're trading this bishop as well everything is getting traded and then we're gonna put our knight directly in the center of the board like this and now we will never lose the rook can't even get in b6 c5 dark squared structure life is good put the rook on the open file nice and clean technique no stupid stuff all right no stupid stuff advance exactly how however we want we could do it exactly and however we would like easy all right easy second rank with the rook nice and active i can already begin expanding because i know that in the long run that is where the game will be decided let's play knight d3 he's gonna take we're gonna take that's it it's just rooks now it's it's also a third extra pun we're just going to come right back rook end game up this many pawns you got no shot no shot rook d4 f5 on the way another free pawn this was a 1900 bot and uh he got slaughtered so this just goes to show you i mean these bots are all over the place with these skill levels and now we're just gonna push i mean i can do whatever i want it's gonna go here i'm gonna get a rook trade i'm gonna put the rook behind the pawn uh yeah you're gonna have to go back to the first rank buddy i'm really sorry gg oops i don't care so what stupid i'm so mad at these bots man this has been a terrible experience oh my god i hope i don't still make can you imagine that would be so cool it's not possible because the rook cannot wait the pawn can always move all right that was the first good game in like 20 minutes all right olga self-taught i that's great great to hear that olga self taught uh oh great love that we we we we love that yeah we love so are they just programming these bots to lose on purpose now like is that is that what this is this is like a stupid england gambit is what it is knight d5 like we're already completely winning but you know now bishop f4 maybe hopefully no not blundered bishop d6 mate wow threatening checkmate incredible all right we are we are totally winning this is a already off to uh off to a great start i love this i need more bots to play exactly like this and and the rest of the speed run will be very easy let's bring the knight back oh i'm getting like some carpal tunnel i mean this is uh this has been a very stressful hour um why why did the ball play like this now there's so much pressure on my shoulders i'm just gonna launch i'm gonna launch into the position over here just i mean i gotta win the game on every side of the board let's just get the bishop out of here so go away f5 march it down f6 this is just all right all right let's begin the cleanup process can't get too cocky though you get too cocky against this bottle of a sudden you lose to the'00 like that's just how it works these bots are just so stupid like that everything about them the way they play does this make any sense at all but that is the beauty of the speed run rook f6 just gonna bring the rook i'm not even gonna you can't move any pieces thank you uh no tactics olga is a self-programmed bot all that means is that if you get into a tactical shootout there's no mate by the way if you get into a tactical slugfest with the spot you're gonna lose like that's what they mean when shells.com is like oh yeah this bot is self-taught it's like it's like what what they're trying to tell you is if you get deep into the end game with this bot or something like it's gonna beat you which is you know like right now i think it's gonna start playing like stockfish and i gotta be really really really careful like i have three pieces for the rook which is winning against any human being on planet earth i'm not completely convinced i'm gonna be able to win this against this bot i'm gonna try and i'm probably winning because i have moves like queen d6 and i'm getting in all my pieces thank god all right wonderful but uh terrifying and also like you can hang a draw here i'm gonna take the rook it's gonna take the rook fake queen c6 thank you thank you what a relief um i'm not even i'm not even sure this is a relief by the way let's go here that's a relief okay oh god oh god oh god terrifying just absolutely terrifying stuff all right luckily my my king covers this and uh that is safe you can go here i will just take i will take that we're gonna win we are gonna win we're gonna win this one we're getting there uh h4 just gonna push i gotta get rid of my blockade i'm gonna push my pawns there's nothing you can do you push your pawn i take you put you push upon it that's it there it is now we are winning i am not worried no stalemate that's check you're gonna take my bishop outstanding there it is no i do not want to play again as a matter of fact i am down to the final row my friends it is lee i want to play the karo khan haven't played this the whole time she said playing against the caro can be frustrating that's great did not ask okay let's take let's see how much theory the bot knows i'm playing bishop f5 knight g3 bishop g6 is a main line uh that is a move i'm really annoyed actually that it's playing this line because uh what okay that's definitely not the move i don't know why the bot did that but what you just lost the knight why is the bot acting like that was just normal it's just it just gave me a full piece no questions asked i'm just gonna castle and i'm winning the only thing that the bot can do now is maybe like uh get a big attack while my king yeah you see like while my king is in the center but i'm just gonna trade pieces like i i am terrified i mean make no mistake i am absolutely mortified of these bots like it's gonna go e6 or queen g5 or whatever um yeah i mean i i can't i mean i can barely move a piece okay 97. i mean i am up at night like let's not get it twisted but i am kind of terrified as well okay let me take and i'm gonna play knight d5 to block and i think after c4 i'm gonna try to kick the queen out do i allow a trade of queens that would i allow do i allow queen c6 i don't actually think i have much of an alternative oh my god this is disgusting like this the the it's not even gonna take i don't think okay it does take just take now it's going to take this what's this what is this what is this what is this i have to seize back the initiative i have to go knight 92 check and uh and and like knight c5 i mean it's insane it got three pawns back it was never supposed to get three pawns back never in a million years should the bot have gotten three pounds back like its sacrifice was so bad it was not a good sacrifice at all and yet here we are with me pleading for my life my knight is like almost trapped i don't even know i i don't even know okay i'm gonna try to advance my pawn i i oh i am completely i am completely speechless um the night end game is definitely winning so i'm going to of course it doesn't trade with me i guess we go here and try to play for rookie too that looks like it should be a bad move oh i will yes absolutely absolutely no questions asked you don't have to ask twice absolutely you don't have to ask all right this should be a winning end game if i can't win this uh yeah maybe maybe i don't deserve to win the speedrun i'm not even winning any speed run like this is king d5 this works oh my god oh oh this is scary oh this is scary oh i don't like this at all oh my god what have i done oh my god what have i done no no no no surely not surely not h525h46 h3 yes i can play here i can actually do this i think yes because i'm going to queen with check no oh no i forgot the other pawn could move oh no no no no no no no no no no i'm losing i'm losing i'm losing i'm losing i'm losing i'm losing i'm losing i'm losing i'm losing i'm losing i'm losing i'm losing oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no i lost up a full piece i lost the buffalo piece i did it again i i really hope this is not some sort of terminator because i am not in the mood for that again i am not in the mood for another terminator but i but i gotta get i got things to do i got dinner like when i booted this up i did not expect to sit here for like three hours beating these idiots like i i needed to i needed to finish i got a life to live i'm trapped in the bot simulation like this is this is this is sick guys i i i i don't feel good i don't feel good i don't know what's happening i'm not happy i'm trying to attack maybe that's the secret i don't know anything anymore i thought i knew i don't oh my god it's like so good it keeps finding the best defenses foreign plays like this you know what i'm just gonna come right out and say it no two thousand plays just like this just don't it's not that good knight d5 it's probably losing on the spot i don't even i don't even know anymore there should be four i mean this looks good for me this got to be good for me i mean stop it what even is this oh my god all right it has a check but but i'm running i'm not i'm not scared should i be probably should am i winning am i losing like what is going on rook c6 i can play i mean i'm getting both pieces right like it should be winning that has to be a win what rook c3 i like completely stopped trusting myself like i don't i don't trust myself to be able to make a single good move anymore bishop b2 check and then i take the rook it has to be winning i just go here like i don't see anything for my opponent oh dear god king c6 king c7 king c6 and king b7 and then i run i run here and i survive right all right well you know what i'm already here so so if if if this is not there's no more checks there's no more checks i think there's no more checks that's it and i'm winning the queen oh you messed up dude you messed up you messed up is what you did yup that's mate i was in check couldn't give the mate there it is check that's it oh we gonna yeah yeah yup yup let me get the queen yup yup oh yeah oh see this is exactly how it should have went down last time you trash bot you got lucky broken clock is right twice a day crazy oh this is one of the craziest videos i have recorded in a while no forks no forks no forks i'm not even gonna take back how about that i'm not even gonna take back go ahead do your worst and check check mate clown all right four more bots charles charles look i'm not gonna lie to you boss i'm gonna play the english against you because you're english but you getting smoke charles e3 nice and easy gonna play for d4 okay gonna play for d4 kind of symmetrical but if he takes i'm gonna take with a knight that's not a good move this allows me to get i think of a very pleasant position with just something like b3 yeah but now i have the whole center what i don't these bots are really funny they they do some like exceptionally dumb openings and then they play like 2700 level chess the rest of the game which is probably what's about to happen with this bot i mean this is oh my oh my it looks scary ah that's not a good move because now i can trade what if i take i get mated if i take he takes and then he takes so i have to go here and he's going to take my bishop i mean i mean i mean what can you do like what can you do really like i'm what even what even what even and now he's playing perfectly he heard me talking trash it's just gonna take on f3 now i mean this is just this is sick he's not even taking i'm offering my knight and he's not taking it guys i don't i don't i i don't know man i honestly i think this speedrun took like literal years of my life like i oh my god i could have taken maybe there's a tactic somewhere i'm missing something 100 i'm missing something i don't even think that's like the best move and yet i my confidence is gone like how do i even win i'm playing a bot he's cheating the bot is literally cheating oh that this might be this might be it this might be a hope for me i have this and if push i have made no it's not made what am i talking about it's not made at all king g7 i'm just uh i'm i'm just on some sort of drugs i guess take take all i can hope for now is to win the send game that is all i have going for me in life it's just this i think he just goes here maybe he's missing it because he's bought he's programmed like i i maybe i can survive but uh this is this is terrible oh my god this is terrible uh i'm gonna take he's gonna bring in his rook where do i move have i told you guys that this this is i think this this is the like my worst thing i've ever done um i feel awful i have derived a grand total of like negative joy doing this like my my week is worse as a result of this content knight c4 knight e3 i i i i am not happy i would just like you all to know i am i am protesting formally for doing this content um i can't even give the fork because i'm pinned jesus nobody forced me to do this content but you might as well have you know by the way this is this is not even over like i i i am talking as if i've won this game and i can like give a parting notice of some sort the game is not even finished he's gonna go here and uh and the game is and the game goes on i mean the game the game goes on oh lord okay um bishop d2 am i gonna have to checkmate with bishop in the night is that is that where we're headed i think i'm gonna have to checkmate with the bishop in a knight i might not even win the game just straight up like i wait a minute this is it's gonna be yet another one of those games where uh where i'm winning and and then i throw it take oh my god if i play 95 you can just take it right i've thrown the game all i can do is get into a race now this is in this is insane 95 and maybe or knight d4 but he can just take maybe bishop d6 is the only thing i have but now he just goes here wait but i can what is happening i think i'm losing i i must be lost like i i don't know i don't know how i don't know where i don't know is he gonna blunder a checkmate somehow he gave me his queen what what was that oh dude oh my god oh my i i i i i want to cry i don't even i don't even know what's happening i mean this is this is sick what what even is this man check what what is this man like okay oh thank you thank you buddy you didn't have to but thanks foreign fatima fatima guys i'm on my last legs here i i don't know i'm gonna play a queen's gambit accept it and god is gonna guide me the rest of the way that's all i can say i mean i i i really i i this is a sideline it's not the best because white can play knight c3 h3 and then can play bishop b5 which is as evident from the bots play it does not know also that is inaccurate because i can take and take on d4 i can do this and then after queen d4 i have bishop h2 so luckily the bot is not completely perfect but you know the damage has been done the bots have left a lasting imprint on my life so chess.com i hope you are happy you have permanently damaged me you have ruined my confidence completely and if that is what you you know design the bots to do then you have succeeded allow me to be the first to tell you um because uh because what i saw today i think no human should ever have to see by the way i i feel like i'm gonna lose like i'm gonna lose my queen or something i mean really this is like not even over i keep saying this in every single one of these bot games this is not over all of this all these games where you have some advantage like it's never over against these scumbags okay but i but i think i'm doing myself a favor here by just basically making it so that you know counter play is very difficult to create uh rook b8 i mean okay i'm giving up a seven but if uh if giving up a7 is what causes me to not win this game then maybe just really don't understand anything about chess uh rook d2 looks pretty convincing i also have this and rook b1 and i have mate so uh this looks pretty damn good to me queen takes d4 don't i have uh oh wait i've and it's never too late never too late to hang check mate i'm gonna play h6 i'm not hanging a mate hey yeah rugby three all right i hate these bots but i'm winning this game i'm gonna win because i'm gonna go here and then here and you can't stop me you do that that doesn't do any that does not prevent any of what i'm about to do oh there it is my friends been a long time coming but uh where is even the mate i mean this is so stupid there it is oh my gosh 117. 117 it says manuel is a romantic all right so manuel i'm married so that's not really gonna it's not really gonna work to your favor um i'm gonna play a vienna let's play vienna gambit does he know the best line of course he does because he's 2100 stockfish not going to miss that one shut up shut up manuel no one asked honestly nobody asked what if that's a stupid move manuel you had to go c5 is he gonna play f6 what doesn't know how to play against the vienna love that so you never worry about c4 because you have bishop f5 and that's that's a very comfortable square uh from there you can you can rotate over to h5 uh you can play moves like queen g4 you can play like knight g3 and i'm just gonna like i have four attacking pieces and uh okay that that's of course scumbag bot playing scumbag moves um let's just keep an eye on b7 yep now let's go back over here okay if the bot insists on trading queens there's really not much i can do but uh i i i i do not want to trade i would i would rather improve my position like this can i can i sack my rook queen f4 and queen six he's a romantic but you know queen g5 king h7 i have to do it i mean if i lose that'd be kind of nice sacked the rook against the bottom win that'd be nice right good content right there i have rook f3 here's g5 i can check him back to the h file rook f3 looks like it should win the game if not win then you know get close rook f4 is next oh i see oh i'm so nasty rook h4 look at this rook h4 only move queen f6 and rook back to g4 okay i'm just gonna i tried to flex it didn't it didn't quite work out how i wanted wow i sacked my rook to beat the 2100 elo bot that was nasty and now our final game against oscar you know what i'm playing white again you know what i have been here for an hour you have no idea what i've been through i'm playing white one more time and i'm doing it and we beating you idiots in 80 minutes i can't believe i lost three games that that that is those demons are not going to go away easily i mean really i am that sucked anyway we're playing this kind of edgy sicilian line uh what is bishop g4 that is that is a move for sure wow i'm gonna go here i'm gonna sack it's just bad i don't know why i did that that's that of course i'm playing 2100 but like what am i doing why why what are you trying to prove just win the game like a normal person no i mean seriously this is this is just this is just so careless this is gonna be a fourth loss i don't think i can i don't think i can save this position not against the not against the strong but and uh this bot is very different from the last one i mean this one this one is not just gonna get checkmated or so it seems that was so careless of me like i feel like i'm definitely gonna lose this game now bot is like kind of no it's just fine i'll do this but um is it gonna play king f8 or e4 i have queen b8 but it doesn't even do anything queen b8 oh he just moves no what ah and rook c7 back yeah yeah i'm gonna lose this game so stupid so careless like why are you sacrificing pawns to bots i mean seriously like please hang this doesn't even yeah before what are you trying to prove man like what what you're you're playing a literal robot like it's gonna always play the best move when it's winning i mean it's just so draw didn't think so um check i don't even know why i'm playing really i this was so stupid i should have just lied i should have just said there was no more bots that's what i should have done but i didn't could have been over in 80 minutes could have been an 80 minute calm little you know speed run 20 bots four minutes per including some losses now i gotta sit here now i gotta sit here and probably lose like five games to oscar which is probably i i can totally see that happening by the way y'all ready for this we about we about to lose all of our games to mr oscar over here that'll that'll that'll really be a nice way to end the video [music] uh okay i'm already a pawn down which is nice excellent great love to see that love to see oscar just hanging on to the pond like you know like it's nothing like it's completely normal to do that um did i just hang what do you want leave me alone leave me alone oh god that is literally the opposite that is the opposite of leaving me on you are not leaving me alone what why are you why did you do that you gave me the pawn okay stupid i'm playing so badly now i've basically like given up which i just really shouldn't do it i don't know why i'm ah it's a bad move that's a bad move wait a minute you can't play like this you can't play like this i might be a human and i might be tilted and you might be a bot but no you are not going to do this to me if you take i take you can't take f5 uh knight d4 no that's a bad move or is it what f4 no no queen f4 guys i'm so close i am so close to winning this game and saving humanity from these scumbags all right let's bring the rooks i have a perfect attacking position you're just giving this to me you are giving it to me i'm winning 100 knight f5 there it is i'm galloping into the position this has to be a winning position this has to be winning knight takes h6 knight takes h6 gotta be there rook takes oh my god there's bishop f3 i've hung bishop f3 i hung bishop f3 oh my god i hung bishop of three i hung bishop of three oh my god he did oh god oh oh king g1 there's this i'm gonna go back to f5 no how is that possible no how is that possible how is that possible and he survives that's not fair there's no way there's no way he can versus he'd be surviving this no no no no no no no no no no no i'm so close please don't do me like this he has check i have to block he's gonna take he's gonna play for jade he's gonna play review seven i'm gonna be sick there is there's no way right i mean come on do i have anything else i'm about to get checkmated on the back rank i have to go here he's going to check me force my knight back and then he's gonna take my rook and then he's gonna play rook to g8 check and i am going to lose this game this is so stupid queen g5 same exact thing oh my god come on this is like by far the most frustrating thing i've ever had to do i mean this is this is otherworldly i'm just completely lost now it's just over he's just gonna take my pawn i knew it i mean i i knew you know what i was supposed to play him with black i'm playing him with black this the this this is this is just oh this is so frustrating oh my god i'm not doing this with the master level bots honestly i thought that i was going to do this with the master level bots i'm not doing this with a master level bots this is infuriating this is this is just waiting to see what at which point the bot is going to actually play like a 2700 i'm not doing that i'm not i'm not i'm not playing the the waiting game of let let let's just play this dumbed down version of stockfish i'm not i'm not doing that nope i'm done guys after this game i'm going to go for the longest walk of my life i would like you all to know that i am in a terrible terrible mood and it's all because of this dumb speedrun speedrun ruined my day ruin my day i was having a good day and i sat down was like i'm gonna make a video decided it was gonna be this one shouldn't have done that should not have done that my friends and once again i am acting like i've won the game i have not won this game at all this is not even over i gotta stop acting like it's over this is exactly what i did in all the other games and then and then i i couldn't even win it i'm trying to win the pawn on b2 okay now i have a very strong long-term asset which i i like very much do you think the bot will blunder a one move tactic on g3 i got the answer to the question it wasn't the desirable answer but you know an answer is an answer what rook but what if i don't even want the rook ah what if i don't even want the ruger what if i want the pawn instead that looks pretty good though i gotta tell you that like winning that pawn looks pretty damn good to me i have lost a lot of chess games today but i am i'm pretty certain that winning that pawn is is an asset uh rookie eight am i gonna get mated what if i sack my rook oh this is exactly what last time this is i'm i'm getting myself into the exact same garbage i got myself last time which was i thought i was completely winning i was definitely completely winning and then i threw the game okay so it would be quite nice if we could avoid that this time around that would be that would be just great bishop c3 take take maybe move the knight yeah and maybe we can make a queen one day take take rook i think this works am i stupid we're about to find out uh kind of like yes but partially i have this oh that doesn't work this looks like it should be winning for me can i wait a minute can i take and then can i just take and push oh my god can i sack my queen and just that's pretty cool that's pretty cool sometimes you just gotta give yourself some props that was pretty cool all right i deserve that i think i can now end this video on a happy note knowing that i just played that that was pretty cool all right now i'm gonna get this pawn and i'm gonna go take a nap because i am tired this was not easy and oh do not do this ever really if i could give you any piece of life advice which i can't because i'm not qualified just don't do this this is extremely frustrating uh and again it's still not over so we are winning this is a winning end game because we just have a bishop and that's good enough to win a king and bond end game there it is five sack letting me 20 and 5. five losses crazy not even gonna make a second queen don't even want to just want this to be over one hour 30 minutes and 53 seconds to beat all of the advanced bots all i have to say at this point is i challenge any of my fellow streamers to do the same thing i want to see what hikara would score but i'm very curious oh teza is i bet you they can't even beat all the bots rosen and a kremling get out of here
