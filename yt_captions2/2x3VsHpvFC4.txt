- alex. - yeah, don't worry about it. - cool. - rog rig reboot is back, where all the coolest
kids in our community submit their crappy machines, so we can give them an ultimate upgrade courtesy of asus rog. and we almost have one of those cool kids, but instead we ended up with alex here. - rock, paper, scissor, shoot. i win. maybe not, i'm just a pro. - so, check it out. that is gonna be your new machine. and what are you gonna play on it? - roblox. (audience laughs) (upbeat music) - now, you fancy yourself
something of a rapper. can you do a little bit
of freestyle for us? - my name is alex, and i'm building a pc. i don't know how to rap. (audience laughs) in madison's rog rig reboot, she said something about. - originally, i wanted
to do what everyone did, which is a rap video. but then i realized i didn't wanna be the cringy person that did a rap video. - that's, what i did. and you know what, madison? i think, we'll and madison won. so she's right, but i'm right too. you know? - let's have a look at this machine. now, you claim that you've
been watching the channel for four or five years. which means--
- oh, i claim. - that you should have pretty much seen every previous rog rig reboot. which means that you should have a really good idea of
what's coming for you. does all that seem accurate? - that seems really accurate, actually. - okay. so in that case, have fun. - so, linus has left the
building, apparently. and i'm here, i'm your host today, right? okay, so i have a dell xps, something old. it's really old. it would freeze like constantly. i have a square monitor
and a rectangular monitor. the square one has like a huge
red line going through it. it's past its prime, definitely. - i'm impressed. you know what, everyone else claims that they've watched
previous rog rig reboots, but then they're surprised when i'm not actually that helpful. it seems like you were ready for it. okay, we do start with the motherboard. what can you tell me about this thing? - mom? i have never built a pc before, but i have put a hard drive
into the bad computer. so i guess that kinda
counts, but not really. - your timing for rog rig reboot was pretty freaking awesome, 'cause intel just launched their 12th gen alderlake platform, which means you are getting a shiny new maximus z690 formula board. this thing has all the bells and whistles. - the shine gives you actually fps. - ddr5. pci express gen five. you even get this thing,
look at this thing. you were gonna just take this out without even looking at it? - it's just a thing, it's a thing. - look at this m.2 carrier card. - oh. - you can put a pcie gen five m.2 in here. - is this really gonna be my computer? - put it over there. - yeah, what?
- what? - what is this unboxing job? - i put it upside down. that's how you do it, right? - where does the motherboard go? - mom? can you, i won the top of the box. good. - always hold the motherboard by things that are not the pcb. - maybe make it, do a little
back flip or something. okay that is to touch. - what part do you need next? - cpu. cpu core coursera makes cps
that's my one hint for you. - alder lake 2020. oh, is this a lake that like
you can't game at a lake. anyway. - you got this alex. that's the cooler. - what? no one. it's like, you know. - alex, this is serious. if you break these, the computer is dead. there is nothing i can do for you. this is very cool to look at. - so this is the 12th 900 k, okay. so top of the line tore i
nine. don't screw it up. - don't screw it.
- i'm serious. i cannot fix it for you. - circle, circle, circle, triangle. my friends accused me of being
shaped and i don't agree. that's good. - you should get a close up of this pro. - whoa. wow. i either broke it or did it correctly. i'm just gonna assume i broke it. so that line is, can
get me another computer. you, they sue us. you wouldn't get your video. - you did a great job the cpu is in. you can fit so much ram
in this bad boy, 128 gigs. we didn't get you 112 cows. - about to say, i was
about to say, how do we. - this is this. (indistinct chattering) - i'm already weeded in. so like. - did he just admit to the
consumption of drugs substances? do you want to talk about
how much you hate corsair that they gave you? - i know i didn't say anything
bad about corsair, corsair. they are the dominators. - that's your sixth lie today. you're not even from florida are you? (both laughing) - not right, you can see it. i can't see it. cause, and
also i didn't snap them in. - no, i don't think it's
installed correctly. so, you might want to get that. did i just manage to touch them anyway? let's not talk about that. there we go. - you play a lot of sports alex? - bullying.
- yeah. is that a sport in canada?
- no, we have ice bullying. it's called curling. - oh, that's what that is. - you got your cpu and
your random good job. - boom. - nope. - see, i told you you'd
correct me if i'm wrong. i have protection of the tech tip himself. oh, storage. - hey, i like it. - that is tiny actually. - i'm sure she said. - out here, here. oh wow that is a screwdriver. - with clicks. - it's like asmr. oh, canada they unscrew to the right. that's so crazy. (both laughing) - so what you wanna do that one again? - that's mental gymnastics. - this is canadian physics. i bet you a normal computer
is actually really good. and it just performs
crappy because you suck. - well, no. - all right. let's try and speed this up. get him outta here.
- chop, chop race car. - yeah.
- but in canada. - the headline is florida
man builds a computer. - wow. - why isn't this going in. - going ever going to finish screen this and look like you're not
making any progress at all, the screw lines up with
the screw hole alex. - yes. but like what is this going? is it, oh, i got it in. i got it in. - oh, good for you. can you please. - get this done i know. let's go. i'm jacked. just like this computer
case from asus rog. - and i've said many times
in the past that i feel like my audience is really a cut above the average youtube audience. - and linus tech tips.
i think that's so true. - i just don't really
have any evidence for it at this point. - have you met like a flat earth or they don't have any evidence? - so you're calling me a flat earth for thinking that you are. - am saying you have an
opinion that's wrong. i feel like this is definitely
not correct, but okay. whatever. and then you take the box off
like a true basketball player who has seven feet tall. - okay, you know you're never gonna be a pro basketball player, right? - yeah. i know. - oh my gosh he's trying to like wwe. - oh, this is something or other. - that's the real reason
we do these rg reboots. we need someone to come in and
make it look hard every once in a while. so people really appreciate
what we do around here. you can lay down so
much computer in there. - you can lay down so
much computer in there. - do you even listening to yourself. - what, who listens to themselves? (laughter) boom buy it. that is not even close to what is correct. oh, wow. - wow.
- and that was. - i'll tell you what, if you have this motherboard
in before my watch says 1:40, you can appear on tech linked. go. - okay. what is okay. let's just like that. - you actually did a great job
of screwing this motherboard. why are you coming over here? your mom's over there. - oh. - let's go. let's go. let's go let's go. let's go let's go. let's go let's go. let's go let's go. let's go, let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's. - my arms 're getting tired.
- okay. if the verge could build
a computer, i can right?. - this is a crucial 2.5
inch solid straight. this is so light. oh my god. is this a prank? it's like a prank show - and there's four terabytes of storage. - like someone's gonna. that is a lot of space. wow. okay. because, i'm so confused. this is the top. am i just, oh. - what year were you born? - all of them. - are you ever going to take
off this giant plastic shield thing? - my brain is ticking. like the app, the phone app tiktok. why is this not working? why is it? why does this? oh, it just doesn't come up. - the captive thumbscrew - boom. i did it. no, i didn't top 10 moments
where they celebrate too early. - yeah. like my kids did this i would be pretty disappointed. - aren't your kids like five. - yeah. - there's no way in the
one, jerry's no way. - look at this, it's lined up. - it's lined up perfectly
and it's not going in. i feel like this is set up. like i'm telling you the game show. person's gonna come out and be like, you're been pranked, you
know, go back to florida. this is the world power. - this is, wait, what am i doing? wait no. - you're doing better than madison. - thanks madison for doing worse than me. i appreciate it. it's not. - that seems fine. all right. i'm going to be so careful. - and this is no, this is great. this is. - what did i just do? - it's a triple aio. so triple 120 millimeter
fan scott rgb up there, but it's white to match the case. this is gonna be a sick looking build if you manage not to break it. the black and white color
scheme on this thing. it's going to look sharp. - this is good enough. i'm having time.
- ooh. - i should watch more games with nexus. - hi steve. - i actually don't know
where to go from here. - me neither. this is hopeless oh. - can i have a duct tape please. thanks. oh wait, these are rgp. wow. these are like our greatest fans. - alex, less talking more doing. how many times have you said that to him? i feel like it's amazing
that you've made it this far. guys can we get some
respect for alex's mom in the comments? okay. you've got some fans now. we are gonna want to mount
those fans to our radiator. - ah, like - these are 100 stops that
let's back up a little bit. no, not you. millimeters are a sensible
unit of measurement. - at least everybody has a foot. like nobody has a
centimeter on them, right? - you know what? i think this is the part where i just start doing things for him. i can't afford that much overtime. david be like, when's
the double time kicking? - i love no effort. - that's how we're doing
it because i'm picking up what's your mom's thrown down. what are you doing? stop. stop. stop casting from the top. - oh, from the top. that makes things easier. wow. - two, two clicks. there you go. use the knurling. knurling fast. - this. - oh my god. i have. - no clue what you're talking about. - please. hurry. my back hurts. - i'm sorry.
- no, it's fine. (indistinct chattering) just put the thing. - can you start pulling that back out? are we good? thank you alex. - oh, no problem. we only have' more. - 11 more, but yes, who's counting. - oh. (alex laughing) - what is the screwdriver from? did they just show you how to do this? - yes. - okay. can i just.
- what? - that's what i showed you. (audience laughing) - what? my brain just evolved like a pokemon. if only i was tall enough
to see it, but that's okay. i like this. it's already in, like, i don't
know what you want from me. i feel like this is like going
to a doctor and the doctor knows exactly what's wrong with you. he's just reading all my symptoms to me, straight from his head, like, and it takes too long. - it and gets paid by the minute, so. - you're getting paid by
the minute of sponsorships we do for asus rog rig reboot. only 21. - i'm convinced that asus
sponsors this anymore just to watch me suffer. - it's okay. they only get to see the 30
minute version of it don't they? - yeah. - condense suffering is what
they call it where i lived. i need the thing, right. - that thing.
- this thing? i don't know what these
are like, i don't know. what is there like a third
brand of cpu that i'm missing here, like why?
- oh god. that david, he just wants
to go home on time today. - thank you. (audience laughing) (soft music) - yep - okay, sure. you know what? i'm just going to do it. whatever,
unless i need the screws. - hmm. interesting. - interesting, interesting development. okay am i supposed to
put these in from the. - we put them in from the front.
i'm showing you what to do. - okay. - so you just find one and screw in. i believe in you. - i don't. - you got this? - i think i need the ratchet and clank or whatever it's called. isn't that like a movie or book? - yeah. it's a book by mark twain. - okay. thanks. - you take it. you do it. - it's fine. no, don't worry. i didn't touch anything. boom, boom, boom. perfect. - can you use the screwdriver please? we need to do some cable manners. - i said this is my least favorite part. i love this. - how about you help me by grabbing? you know what, why don't i just do the whole thing? why don't i do both sides? - no, that sounds like more
linus, less tech, tech, tech, tech. (upbeat techno music) - solve the mystery of which
of these plug into the thing you're holding. - into all these thing
i'm holding. all of them. - one, two, three, four, five, six. - ah. okay. is it?
it can't. no, it can't that's for what? can i phone a friend? - okay look away. see, look. what? so what did you do? - i plugged them all in. - well, you told me to look away, so i don't know what you want from me. - please just plug them in. please don't bend the pin. - no it's back.
- you just bent it. it was bent. it's fine. - no you, bent it. - no, it was bent like that. - no it was not. it's completely crooked. - yeah, right. you can put it back where it was. - exactly. but it was like crooked
the other direction. we need like a, like - a lazy susan. - lazy, lazy river. - okay. can you, the ai always over here. - well every time i move
around you like turn your hands so that i can't see it is. - look, it's'0 degrees fahrenheit. i'm even speaking freedom units for you. - it's okay. no, i get it now. that's great.
- okay. now we need to plug in this. the twist. - actually it's long.
so it has to go behind. has to go through the back. - my standards are getting real low. - no it's fine. i don't you're a real low is my three more computers that i have
that didn't make sense. don't don't put that. - you know, every time
you say don't put that in, they put it in, right? how's that for cable management there? - i can't see it. - well, another nice feature of this board is it has a crazy number of rgb headers. it's got an older style, 12 volt, one down at the bottom. then it has three more of the
five volt, addressable ones, two on the bottom. and then one at the top here, which makes the cable
arrangement kind of a trick. - the g-force rtx 3080. - can you just cut the power supply. - okay the power supply. - thank you. - now, unfortunately
your cable mob cables, didn't arrive in time for
us to do the build today. so we're going to swap them out for you, but you can still use this. - i get even more linus tech tips. smells like gaming. thanks asus. - do you have any idea how
many watts fit in there? - what don't have to wait. - this is your 15 minutes
of fame right now. and this is how you chose to use it. - b48. that sounds like an atari game. - get me the rest of the cables i need. - that was all of the cables. - could you maybe pick out
one that i actually need or two? - oh, like, do you just
want me to get oh, pcie. - help me alex. - this one, you need this one? - i don't know if that graphics
card has two eight pin power connectors or three. so i need you to find that out for me while i do all the work. - haystack is a tape that's taped. if i can not figure out
how to open up the box, i'm going to be so sad. what would i do? i have to return it and
email them to ask it. - it has three. there's a picture of it
on the outside of the box. - where did you see three? oh yeah. that's like an easter
egg, but it's not easter. it's like, when is this coming out? - here we go. okay. let's see how many of the
cables i can plug in while you work on that one as well? - oh, yes. - did you get it? - maybe. - it's not. - do i just push it in more? - i mean, you can try that. - but is that not gonna work? - i'm not gonna let you leave here without a working computer. it just might not be
this one. that's fine. it just might be a raspberry
pie. i might just keep the. - oh, i have one of those is great. i eat one every day for breakfast. my mom says it'll make me fat. - i think that's not a concern for you. - i do 10 pushups a day liners. - do you do 10 pushups a today? let's see it. those are good push ups actually, his form is actually excellent. he's slowing down though. (laughter) - this one right here. - yup. right there. - and where's this. so you're going to find the hd audio port. okay. which, oh, wow. that's weird, there's two
extra pins on the front audio, front panel audio header. then you got your hydro node
signal on the last two pins. why they didn't just do a
separate two pin header for that? i don't know. but hey, there you go. that's a feature that it has. we've got right angle usb 3s right here. these are one of the most
likely connectors to break. one of them is actually
a right angle as well. i could pull this off, but it's faster to just bend it a bit. hey, look at that. wow. you're actually doing
mostly really sort of, well, actually. - oh. - that's awesome. they're all in the wrong
spots, but they are on pins. - oh. well, you know, it's good enough. minus as on the left-hand side. - minus is on the right,
but otherwise yes, no, no. that's the right. i just
said, minus is on the right. i'm going to need a sata power
cable, sata, power cable, modular cable. good job. i'm gonna assume that you've know. this was the way.
- no, that is not. - yeah. these are sata to connect. - oh yeah. i know. i know that because i
installed that one hard drive two years ago. - are you at least going to impress me with your gaming skills? - i was like first killing fortnight, like two years ago. - like you got the first killer you were. - no i was the first kill. is a negative kt even impossible? - yes. man alex, we are close. so you can have any color
of say the cable you want. this is going to be the little
splash of color in the build. - i'll take this one. - you're gonna pick red? - okay. - i mean, anything's a good choice. except red. - i made a purple
powerpoint on my proposal is not a real color. and i got an a. - i guess that's the
kind of school you go to something indigo, violet, is it? - no it's okay. you can see purple. so it's a color, but like
the thing that there's no, like wavelength that's purple.. that was my point. - so it's basically what i just said. and you told me no. ready? - what are we doing over it? - are you ready. - for the gpu? - yes. - wow, how did i know? - well, there's only
like one component left. - oh. - how did you make such a mess over here? - this is the worst way. i
think i ever cut something ever. i don't want to rip this box. i normally rip boxes, but
i can't for this can i? listen, like these boxes
are childproof, okay. and i'm not saying i'm a child, but like, i think i'm going to be doing
some great mafia city on this, this gpu at that is if
it doesn't fall to table, why do we need scissors for this? (paper unwrapping) thank you. - please don't cut up the bag. there's a, oh, there's peels. - so many peels. let's get peeler. let's get peeling alex. - there's no more peels. is there on the bag?. - david meant you were so close because they're like everywhere on this thing, you can't touch it without
being so close to something to peel off of it. wait, have you not even one. - you were right. you were so right. there's so many on here. - i know i was right. i told you that was the
point of me telling you so that you would know after
i was done telling you. - i couldn't get this one off. so i'm just going to let you do it. - i'm flashing forward to prom night here. there's still more. - there's what? - i told you. the whole
thing is covered in peel. - i don't know how i was
like, so oblivious to this. i was just grabbing all of
the peels at the same time. is it really held on by
like just this seven pounds? no' liters my.. it's fine. it's i didn't hit it hard. is it like, am i just being dumb? oh, let me put it this way. - the way that i work
out is playing badminton. - it's like a water
bottle from ltt store.com you like open it up. - like a certain kind of seconds. i went back to my elementary school, okay. one of my teachers, what they said to me was thank
goodness you turned out okay. it's upside down again.. - this is not upside down. - oh no. you're right.
- yeah. - i want you to unbox
this and get it set up. - that's not a good idea. - this thing is sick. 2560 by 14, 40 got g sync
270 hertz refresh rate. if this doesn't turn you into
elite gamer, nothing can, - nothing can. - thanks asus.
- yeah. - here's your list.
- how do you do this? - hold this down.
- hold it down. - pull it like that.
- pull like that. - go like this.
- go like that. let's do it again.
and then it's upside down. no. - who cares?
you know what? i'm starting to think that
this whole learned helplessness thing from you is just to get other people to do things for you. you're enabling this.
(alex chuckles) he liked it no, i didn't
act like this with the box. - i don't want to break it. - and then i come in, i
come do the work for him. - okay, i'm trying now. - are you let's see it come on. let's go alex, if you drop this thing, i do not have another one for you. - that's why i'm doing it so slowly linus. oh geez no, it's too big. geez, rick, i don't watch that show. - you don't watch that show then. how did you know what i was talking about? - 'cause who else is named rick? - like short for richard? - do i take this? yeah, i take this off. otherwise i couldn't game on it. huh? - pretty much. - yeah. pretty much. let's go. a hard mousepad interests. - alex, i have a feeling that with you, everything is hard mode. all right. we've got an rg
strix impact to moonlight white. i am really liking the black
and white color scheme in this. - i am as well. it looks so sick. - so sick. keyboards using a suces, rog nx red switches. so basically these are just
like a light linear mechanical switch. - thanks asus. - what happened to the power cord? all right. wait, i asked you
to plug in the keyboard, alex. okay. are you ready? - no.
- no. that's the right answer? what that is? wow. okay. the front. - yeah. there's more rgb in
the it's got all the rgb. - that's interesting. that's super cool. - this is it. you officially have
the best gaming machine in your whole school. - probably. yeah, no, definitely. - for whatever reason,
asus sent over this. this is the rg strix xg 16. it
is a portable gaming monitor. - what? basically, it's a 144
hertz ips portable monitor that uses usb type c for both power. and for display in, you
can also use micro hdmi. i don't think it really
has anything to do with the rest of your machine,
but they did send it over. we've got one more surprise for you. - it's another surprise - here it is, your very own
custom laser etched side panel. i don't know why it says pastry. is it because you're a
flake has your fattening (upbeat techno music) - i'm experiencing fast mouse syndrome. it's amazing how smooth things are. just windows moving the mouse around. i noticed it. that's pretty interesting, thanks asus, - yeah, so basically
that's the refresh rate of your monitor. it's crazy responsive. - insane in the membrane. - yeah.
- yeah. - did you break the computer already alex? - wow. - wow.
- i have dreams about this. - wow, indeed. - i'm a gamer now. - what would you like to play? maybe something "city skylines." - boop, boop, boop. i played through the first,
like third of this game, like four times. and then i just always
restart there because i uninstall it 'cause i don't have enough
space on my computer. - that's your ally? - sorry. - so yeah, it feels good, right? - yeah, it feels great. i feel very rog rig reboot right now and i think that is very good. thanks ltt and asus rog
for the new computer. i really like it and i
really appreciate it. thank you so much. - all right. thanks for watching guys. this is rog rig reboot. we got two more coming for you this year. and if you're looking for
another video to watch, maybe check out one of our previous year.
