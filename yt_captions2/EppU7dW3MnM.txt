you're telling me that a char quarter will let you type so fast it's banned from typing competitions no way because when i saw this thing i mean i feel like i could see why it's super fast but i wasn't sure if it could actually be that fast you know because there's always like you know like i could see that you could get pretty fast but man okay maybe i should try to take like a week and get good at it you know what i mean maybe i should try that would you guys want to see me try to get like one week of trying to get good at this thing because i think i could go pretty fast if i just sat down and really ripped it you know what i mean i think i could get really fast if i if i got in there if i got this this ass in there no mercy no mercy asking i think i could get pretty fast all right anyways a new peripheral lets you keep typing without ever lifting a finger when it comes to gaming and typing competitions is it cheating interesting the chart recorder is a new kind of typing peripheral that promises to let people type at superhuman speed it's so fast that a website monkey type which lets users participate in typing challenges and maintains its own leaderboard automatically flakes charcoal or ceo as a cheater when he attempted to post his 500 word per minute score on the leaderboard no way oh my goodness i gotta try this okay that just got me a lot more excited as a i would put myself in a in a slim percentage of people as far as typing speed goes i would love i want to try this i want to try this now i got more excited uh it's a strange looking device the kind of thing keanu reeves would interface with in johnny mnemonic place your palms on the rest uh on the two black divots out of which rise nine different finger-sized joysticks these are' sticks moving every direction it's its website claims can hit every button you need on a regular keyboard chara quarter uh switches detect motion in three dimensions so users have access to over 300 unique inputs without their fingers breaking contact with the device it said the char recorder said it uh let's see users input words and commands by clicking switches in different directions shower quarter claims that once a user learns how to type with the machine they can achieve speeds impossible on coeritate keyboard most people type around 40 goodness gracious 40 words per minute with a skill type is hitting up to a hundred words per minute competition typers can be breaking into the 200. keane riley keen shark or by the way great name for a ceo could also be like a uh like a i wouldn't put them like as a main character and say like a kind of a cop show drama but definitely could be like a reoccurring character name right it has strong reoccurring character vibes maybe maybe even villain vibes i'm not sure you think main villain vibes i don't know about that main villain i'm doubt a doubt i'm pressing x hard right now but we'll see a char carter ceo posting tick tocks where he hit oh my goodness okay we gotta watch this here we go we gotta watch this this just seems too unreal thank you [music] [music] what what just happened there what okay um i mean maybe i want to try maybe i want to try the speeds are so fast that monkey type won't post a score according to discover a discord conversation between keen and monkey type developer mio the website only allows users to post score if they're typing on a traditional keyboard chara quarter uh can type individual letters but also has corded typing similar to stenography corded typing allows users to input several letters at the same time and have computer program generate the predicted word instead of typing h-e-l-l-o a char quarter typer mashes h-e-l and o and produces the uh produces the word with practice it's much faster okay yeah yeah according to mio the input method which predates the char recorder is strictly banned if you make an account and complete 15 time uh and you complete time 15 seconds and 60 second tests are likely the anti-cheat will pick it up they said on discord because the minimal time spacing between keystrokes and characters it's a different skill but it's very uncommon yeah so when someone drops like 300 plus in the lead board it's automatically removed i mean i get that i get what they're trying to say here i get that oh but that's so crazy how fast this is monkey type won't let keane or run up the leaderboard but he did win another typing competition using charrocord and hits 267 words per minute with 76 accuracy people accused him of cheating i get where they're coming from keane said in this video reply i agree that it's not fair but i don't think it's cheating this is a total keyboard replacement i haven't used a keyboard in over a year and i have no need to ever use one again very interesting 76 is pretty crap i agree with that 76 percent is is terrible i know very interesting though keane also claimed that he won several online gaming competitions using the char recorder which he says brings up an interesting ethical dilemma i'm not sure if there's restrictions on what keyboards you're allowed to use uh he said let's he said over a video uh playing super smash brothers ultimate on the nintendo switch using his chart recorder running through zim style adapter what do you think one in the chat if it's cheating two in the chat if it's not he won a super smash brothers tournament using it i would say for so so me personally when it comes to a tournament you have to put bounds and why i say this is that like imagine any sport right if you went into tennis and you just came in with a racket that was just gigantic like that that was like you know three feet long right you could reach shots that other people couldn't reach and you could be like well you know it's just you chose your little short racket okay i decided to go big racket style right you know what i mean like what is that um and are they considered macros when you mash a bunch of keys together or are they something different i'm not really sure anyways it's it's just it's very interesting i personally would say i agree with it being you can't do that i think it's not correct uh most esports tournaments do have uh strict peripheral rules fighting game tournaments evo rules for controllers or five pages long console players generally uh feel the same about mouse and keyboard and a game designed for controllers cheating uh no they get auto aim and everyone that's on mouse keyboard says auto aim cheats okay everybody knows that that is literally the new excuse leg is now number two auto aim is number one okay everybody knows that everybody knows that uh in a tick tock specifically about the issue keane was ambivalent i hadn't thought about this but i really think uh but it's really interesting keane said because i do have significant advantage over my opponents he then listed all the other places where char recorder will speed up your work and give you an advantage proving that keane is less interested in the ethic ethical questions and more interested in improving the world that shark order makes everything you normally do with the keyboard faster i would say this is just good marketing i think he just wants people to know that it's possible to be amazing right this this just seems like marketing and being like i i personally am not going to call in the question his ethics keen dubious ethical ceo classic ceo with their dubious ethics coming in proving that it's just like okay nice it's safe advice keane is experimenting with a modified version of the device that he thinks will even allow babies to type and communicate similarly to the way some babies communicate with sign language well there's nothing there okay the baby quarter uh you may susie co-workers with a weird monolith style trackball mouse rocking a strange peripheral claiming he's upped his efficiency in a ways you can't possibly imagine okay i'm already that guy uh but this is obviously for ergonomics but maybe maybe okay enough of this crap i should have said this a long time ago hey flip can you edit this part out flip flip flip i need you to go in here and i need you to edit all this crap out okay it makes no sense okay flip hey flip hey flip i need you to edit this to edit that last twitter section now flip then zoom into my face flip zoom in
