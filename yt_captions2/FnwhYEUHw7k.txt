today is a good day because i have everything i need 230 liters of liquid nitrogen this rotten apple this giant hunk of copper these tongs the one and only allen splay of galiber such current world record holder for 12 900k and 12 900 ks overclocking and of course this mad gas torch what are we going to be doing with them we're going to be overclocking why you ask i'm glad you did because it's the day of our lord june the 9th and we desire a 6.9 gigahertz cpu nice like this message from our sponsor ugreen make charging more convenient with you green's new 65 watt charger it's a three in one charger that has two usb c ports and a usb a port in a super compact form factor that fits in the palm of your hand get yours today using the link down below step one get liquid nitrogen from this through the phase separator into this it's freaking me out guys how do we tell how full it is we can't see a thing else with my hand it's very cold used by dude driving subaru stranger things how you doing there hosie boy the next step is obviously to play with it for a bit what is it a minus 195 degrees yeah the fact that it's still boiling around the apple means it's not quite frozen through yet right you got it drink your juice all right come on banana buddy okay ah you should probably put on some safety glasses you'd hardly even believe that was a tangerine once i guess we should get to work now huh watch out watch out oh wait it it broke through whoa our buckets leaking crap this is where it was sitting on the floor yeah the epoxy that's there i guess pros with that out of the way let's fill up a more reasonable sized container from ltestor.com and talk about why we want liquid nitrogen for overclocking at all see the thing about microprocessors is the faster you run them that is more gigahertz the more heat they generate and as they get hotter their internal resistance goes up generating you guessed it even more heat this creates a kind of hard barrier to how fast you can go that's why we don't have 10 gigahertz cpus today but what if you could remove all of that heat as efficiently as possible say take it down to greater than 170 degrees celsius well that's where this buddy comes in but it's not as simple as just taking your cpu plunking it into the motherboard and dumping liquid nitrogen on it for reasons that you might not necessarily think of it's not the liquid nitrogen that i'm putting on this board that has a chance to kill it it's actually the moisture in the air around us you see as that moisture contacts my cold board it's going to condensate or turn into liquid water which as you guys can imagine having sitting on a motherboard is a pretty bad time things like closed cell foam dielectric grease artist eraser and shop towels are great tools to keep air and therefore moisture away from your sensitive electronics however this particular board which was prepared by splave is using a technique that i haven't seen before it looks almost like a conformal coating what is this this is a liquid electrical tape oh i ruined too many clothes with vaseline okay fair enough now the keynote among our viewers have probably noticed that you didn't just blanket the whole board in electrical tape and in fact it seems to be built up in thicker layers in certain areas obviously you don't want any moisture in your vrms with the kind of current you're going to be running through there it would arc much more easily but can you explain the rationale behind why you might say coat the audio chipset but not coat the motherboard pch the motherboard pch is going to be pretty warm as it is and when i don't run a cooler on it to let it get warm so it kind of acts as a defroster in this area and then would that be the same thing for the bottom of the board here or yeah it won't really get this far but i heat backboard heater and the chipset and the vrm will keep it pretty defrosted printed circuit boards are made of copper and copper as you guys know is an excellent conductor of heat and also cold so if we put something really cold here it's conceivable that if we didn't have other heat sources on the board this entire thing would get really cold really fast that's a heater oh i see how fun is this this is a giant freaking centimeter thick thermal pad delicious and under it is what is this an eehot who makes this omore elmore is another famous overclocker and you guys are all you guys are all bitter enemies yeah so basically all i'm really looking at here is pretty much the same thing you'd find on your rear car window for defrosting it's just high resistance wires on a pcb so you just use a simple six pin pcie and then it basically just goes yup heat this boy up the next weapon in the extreme overclockers arsenal that i am familiar with is of course the pot now these can be designed for various substances dry ice liquid nitrogen liquid helium i would imagine you use pretty much the same design for helium and nitrogen and these are not just a hunk of copper they are specifically engineered to optimize the transfer of heat from your cpu to the liquid that is boiling within it now as you can imagine mounting one of these is not as simple as just you know putting a normal mounting bracket on it because you've been paying very close attention any brackets or metal pieces around the cpu are going to collect condensation so we actually use a very specific way of mounting these with extremely long posts on our thermal padded heated back here and all of our hardware way up here so that we can wrap it all up in shop towel and make sure that any condensation that does inevitably gather is going to be absorbed by that and that's it yeehaw i'm a professional overclocker right ladies and gentlemen well no actually isn't how it works see this probe right here this is a k-type probe plugs into one of these you don't just want the cpu running as cold as possible and managing the thermals of the chip are a huge part of the art science slash black magic that is extreme overclocking you see for example some chips or or even entire platforms might have a bug say for example where if they're too cold when you first try to boot them they won't turn on at all you've got to start them warm then cool them down or vice versa that means just as important as our application of cold is our application of heat we also need the knowledge any idiot could pour ln2 on a cpu and overclock higher than they would be able to on air or water cooling but to reach the absolute limits you've got to invest in both your own knowledge and personal experience something that can only be gained through countless hours spent on this stuff and in building connections none of those are things that you can buy for any amount of money but that doesn't mean it's a cheap hobby no one even with years decades of experience could hope to achieve a world record overclock without what we call a golden chip as we also learned in our intel fab tour every piece of silicon is a little bit different and not all have the same capabilities the one that i'm holding in my hand is the result of buying 100 of intel's 12 900 ks and taking only the top 10 of those with one of these you might have a chance but let me get this out of the way for you there is absolutely no money in extreme overclocking whatsoever very true and the folks who do dedicate their lives to it do it for the thrill of the hunt so with that in mind let's get the foreplay over with and overclock some cpus is this one gonna do 6.9 i know we can do it that's what a whole gigahertz lower than what you've done on these pretty up there still but it should be should be okay oh he's changing his tune already so now and now when he doesn't do it well i didn't say for sure actually you won that yeah oh really small world hilarious what's the safe voltage that i can actually i'll just guess well we'll just see what happens i'll just go got the defaults you have the rgb where you want it turbo performance yay we did it what i'm really curious about now is just how fast this will go with liquid nitrogen and just stock settings like xmp just enable the power limit to go as high as it wants the highest that i've ever seen on an intel cpu like this air cooled is about 28 29 000 in cinebench show negative temperatures zero zero degrees yes oh weird but it only drew 160 watts even though it was 4.9 all cores so that could be due to our colder temperature oh like it's that big because i would normally expect that to be like 300 and a bit watts do you want to try to go colder and see if we can get even less wattage well i want to open up xtu first and see what we can get sure it should be pretty happy at like 4-2 there we'll just take all of these to five and we need some more voltage or voltage offset let's do point one two sure i'm just guessing numbers that's all i do didn't blue screen wow you're a pro so ln2 is just like easy mode we're drawing 230 watts and i would expect this to normally be like 400 yeah all right we broke 30 000 points and sent a bench right there that's what faster than a threadripper 32 core yeah and we're only at minus 90. compared to that stupid chiller that we have oh my god all right let's just try six gigahertz there's no way this just does six gigahertz like that oh my god it's doing it how six gigahertz on all the p cores it's only 260 watts this is insane below your typical wattage at six gigahertz holy crap thirty two hundred thousand points and sent a bench just did it it's like the black hole yeah it's just completely black this can't read below minus forty degrees celsius is there any hot spots on the board it's having a lot of trouble with a thing that's exactly cold around here it's confused chipsets at 40 degrees ssd is at 47. well let's uh apply 6.4 and see if it crashes it's not fine i have more cpus we can use no way i just did 6.4 oh it didn't you could do one thing turn off c states and you could put it on fixed voltage or saying fix the voltage normally you have a vf curve so the more frequency that you want the more voltage it gives it we don't care about that at all we're just sticking one voltage because we're going for just the highest point on that vf curve that's the only one that we care about you wouldn't want to run your system like that the voltage kind of erodes away your silicon and uh it won't be very happy in a while but if you're just doing stuff like this it's totally fine it's about like one point four five sure one four five one five sure uh let's try six point three 6.3 gigahertz and that's just with me not even trying in xtu this is amazing 3500 points in cinebench oh my god we just beat a threadripper 3960x if i don't even need your help to get 6.9 that would be amazing i think i will will it do 6.5 is this going a lot better than i thought it would we freeze oh never mind all right well do you want to take over sure you can go further i'm going to set like a base core frequency of 55 uh like 42 on the e-course just give us some voltage so it's booting a little warmer and i'm going to turn c states off so it's always at its highest level okay there's water on top of the memory is that good yeah not optimal but i i think it'll be all right okay so what we're doing right now is retraining the memory apparently it isn't too happy when you're below 140 degrees celsius yeah so he just changed one setting incredibly slightly filled the pot dumped it down to what is this 193 degrees celsius then you just restart it and the memory retrains itself and apparently is fine afterwards it's fine okay 162. 1.62 volts what you told me to stop at 1.5 i didn't want you to beat me do you want to go for it sure go for it it's a six nine whoa six point nine yep we can see it in the thing let's open up task manager i'll just no task manager dad windows doesn't know what to do with any of this oh my god it's doing it i think the beginning is usually the hardest part so it should be all right and we're getting as warm as'8. boom holy crap we did it 6.9 get hurt cpu we did it nice that wasn't even hard that was easy sorry [laughter] do you want to do a base clock overclock oh sure six nine six yeah six nine six nine i'll go grab linus and this is where it goes awry you hear a little pop and thermal pace is gone [music] so we had a catastrophic failure there so i have to torch it up to around 150 it should come back it's it's just a black hole still what if you go like this ready watch my eyebrows do you see our i o is all oh jeez that can't be good why is it so wet i don't know have you used this stuff before linus no it's amazing i got what 6.3 gigahertz no problem it only drew like 240 watts too it's like within intel's tdp wow it's insane what are we at right now 6.9 4.2 it passed beautiful 36 000 that is absolute madness i have the scores right here like hold on a second so that's what you'd expect out of an epic server cpu with twice as many pores yeah literally double wow does that ever boil fast boy you must go through a crap ton of this stuff you want to hear under load it gets even lower i do we went through like this much just to run that one benchmark so what you're saying is that if i were to try and do this 24 7 it would cost an astronomical amount of money half a liter a run maybe now it seems that 12 900 ks just handles cold really well and you just freaking go for it if we could go colder it would be even better really can we do more on this chip yeah we can bump it up and see where it fails holy crap did we ever boil away a lot on that one was there more power we hit 38.5 k so the e cores juiced the score quite a bit 1 500 off the world record for a 164 core i9 so give it more i guess is pouring the ln2 considered a glamorous job or is that like the monkey's job we call it the ln2 bit but not when you're doing it at least not to my face right it's boiling so hard it's like slopping out of the thing here oh we hit a blue screen so why is it only the start that it doesn't like super cold i think it's kind of like when it's on it's not as cold oh because like the actual cpu isn't getting downward yeah because it's right running and making heat got some wattage in it when you find a golden chip i mean do you try and get as much juice out of it as soon as you can knowing that what you're doing to it is going to degrade it significantly as long as you're careful careful yeah this looks really careful you have until my dunk cpu hits room temperature to break a record ready go actually it's worse than that you have until my hand gets too cold to hold this all right i already failed you know who never fails our sponsor msi looking for a gpu for your next build guess what you can actually buy them now haha check out the msi rtx 3070 ti ventus 3x8 goc it's powered by nvidia's ampere architecture and has eight gigs of gddr6 memory with boost clocks up to'00 megahertz it's got three displayport 1.4 a ports and an hdmi 2.1 port plus three of their torx 3.0 fans coupled with a beefy heatsink to keep your temperatures low their zero frozer technology turns your fans off while the system is not under load and a custom brushed metal backplate helps provide a clean look on top of all that it has a three year warranty you can
