i need a new compute i want a new computer specifically i want this one the 16-inch m1 max macbook pro but there's a problem you see i live in finland and if i was to order this here in finland i would have to wait until the 31st of may and i'm a pretty impatient person and i'm not about to wait until the 31st of may so i saw that the closest place where this macbook pro is in stock is in france france so i guess there's only one thing to do [music] right over here [music] [music] welcome to paris okay so if you think i'm absolutely crazy that i'm in paris just to buy a laptop you'd be absolutely right by the way did i mention the laptop costs 3849 euros yeah so i'm in paris just to pay 3849 euros for a laptop but had i bought it in finland not only would i have had to wait literally two months to get it but if i buy it here it's actually a hundred euros cheaper than it would be in finland and i got my flight to paris for around 90 euros so in a way i got a free trip to france if i'm buying it here obviously with this hotel and food and everything is still going to be more expensive but i'd rather pay 100 euros for a flight than just paying more tax to buy the thing in finland and having to wait so yes i am a bit crazy but you must admit that these are some pretty decent reasons okay anyway now the plan is to go with some breakfast and then the laptop hunt will begin i really hope that i'm actually gonna get it here now yeah it will be pretty awkward if i don't actually manage to buy him [music] okay plan so i'm staying around the north of paris and the apple store where i reserved my macbook is not actually inside of paris it's in versailles because that was the only apple store where it was available in the whole of france and i'm only here for the weekend today saturday tomorrow sunday and on sunday the store will be closed and on monday i'll leave at like 6 a.m so i won't have time so i really hope i make it and by the way if you're wondering why i need a new macbook pro seeing as i've already got this m1 macbook air i'm going to explain that as well in in a moment i'm going to try to get the laptop first then then we're going to talk about it gonna take me an hour and 41 minutes that's quite a track [music] let the hunt begin [music] huh [music] ready for my second metro to go to versailles i think i definitely have the wrong ticket so i hope i don't get fined [music] okay i'm here much later than i should be but i still somehow have a 56 minute walk to where i need to go i didn't get fined though so that's positive i mean i could have paid for a bus to get there in 30 minutes but i'm not about to pay two euros or that that's the guy who just spent 3849 euros on a laptop i'm all about getting a good deal if something costs 2 euros but it's a bad deal i'm not going to do it but these new laptops with the m1 chips are such a great deal like people have been comparing this new 16 inch macbook pro the m1 max to the old 40 thousand dollar maxed out mac pro and it's been beating me i know this channel is growing so fast i really need to have the power and the productivity to be able to make these videos and produce my coding but i'm gonna make a full video on really the why of why i'm spending 4 000 euros on a laptop i'm in a parking place to figure out how to get out of here [music] [music] foreign [music] came all the way from finland to buy this because in finland they didn't have any really i would have had to wait until june together we made the trip from finland to france let's look at this have a nice day have a nice day bye i got it we got it okay it is time to unbox this thing this thing will actually help my workflow so much so much so essentially as i alluded to before the reason why i wanted this was because up until now i've been using my macbook air as this one the m1 macbook air 2020 model and a self-built desktop computer which i was basically using for all my heavy tasks like editing these videos or actually mainly editing these videos and then for everything else including all my programming stuff i was doing on my laptop but then it got to the point especially when this channel started growing you go to the point where i really wanted to have everything on one computer specifically a laptop and specifically a macbook because i much prefer the mac operating system without further ado let's just uh let's just unbox this thing basically i'm not always at home where my pc computer sits so whenever i was around and i still wanted to get these videos now i would have to edit them on my macbook and for video editing that m1 macbook air just really wasn't quite good like you could do it but it wasn't quite it wasn't quite there and then some of my asses like some of the b-roll that i use for my videos i needed to have them in two computers and like all of that just became really difficult there's a beast and there's a bunch of other reasons as well like for example i wanna switch to using final cut pro rather than premiere pro to edit these videos because first of all premiere pro is a lot more expensive because it's a monthly subscription like 50 pounds a month or something by paying and then whereas the final card pro which is only on my computers is only a one-time payment of like i think 250 pounds okay i know this isn't like the most cinematic unboxing you've ever seen my main computer for now and i do plan to sell my other ones entirely now well this thing is massive it's massive compared to my other macbook air macbook pro macbook air macbook pro but yeah i'm gonna make a full video around my impressions of this computer and whether it actually has ended up being the workhorse i want it to be in a couple of weeks from now so if you want to see that that video will be linked right up here once i've made it first thing that i want to do on my new computer is to build an app with it so that's what i'm going to be doing tomorrow and that video will be linked up here so if other of those interest you watch one of these videos next
