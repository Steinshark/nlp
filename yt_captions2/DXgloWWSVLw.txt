unlock your llm coding potential with star coder 2 remember that this was on february 28th 2024 so i haven't read this yet i know this came out just last week now check this out look at that date now do this uh nvidia hensen uh or there we go ca said you shouldn't learn to code look at when this was said about like four or five days before the blog post and then look what happened then then then look what happened they release a co-pilot for nvidia you want to think about that for a second i don't know looks like a coincidence you think it looks just like a classic coincidence they release something that helps people llm program while telling young kids not to learn how to program i don't know i don't know something smells i'm just saying it doesn't pass the smell test right now uh coding is essential in the digital age but it can also be tedious and timec consuming that's why many developers are looking for ways to automate and streamline their coding tasks with the help of large language models these models are trained on massive amounts of code from permissively licensed github repositories uh in this post we'll explore the latest advances in code llms with star coder 2 a community model that supports hundreds of programming languages and delivers best-in-class accuracy then we try to model using nvidia ai foundation models and endpoints h customize it with step-by-step instructions and deploying it to production star coder 2 built by big code in collaboration with nvidia is the most advanced code llm for developers hey really truly i mean for me it it just feels like whoever owns this conduit of producing code to produce a product whoever is going to be the first person that can figure out how to own that has potentially able to charge hundreds of dollars per engineer per month for every developer in the world he wants a monopoly and the thing is is with nvidia is what the one thing that nvidia has that other people don't have is that nvidia is the pickaxe imagine needing a subscription to do your job it's it's happening well i mean intellig intellig did this right intellig did this but intellig did this by providing a really amazing tool you know what i mean like i don't have a problem by the way big code is just a hilarious name big code just sounds like an evil corporation yeah you know it's big code always coming between me and all my subscriptions right subscription life like real talk like intell did this but they provided a really good tool to program java so did microsoft with vss enterprise and i actually i don't have a problem with paid for services for coding like that's not my problem my problem fundamentally comes just opposed with henson's arguments and what he's producing okay don't learn to code don't learn to code just learn to use ai by the way we produce both the pickaxe and we also produce the gold itself right we we we we want to own everything and you should listen to us like to me that is where the problems come okay star coder 2 demo is broken by typing i want to learn [laughter] zig got him zigg ju deposed mentioned hey dad i love you well hey thank you hey you can build applications quickly using models capabilities including code completion autofill advanced code summarization and relevant code snippets retrieval for using natural languages star coder family includes 3b 7b and 15b parameter models giving you the flexibility to pick one that fits your use case and meets your compute resources this post will focus on the 15b model the 15b model outperforms leading open code llms on popular programming benchmarks and delivers superior performance in its class for reference the accuracy of the original star coder is 30% what does this mean by the way i'm always so curious when they just throw out these numbers right the only we're back we're going to twitter again we're boy boys and girls we're going to twitter we're going right here let's go anyone do we got any good things nothing's good on here okay nothing's good on here i feel like they just pull these stats out of thin air what i mean by that is that first off even when you accept some amount of code you have to then take that code and you inevitably change it i made the the sources has made it up i made it up like look at this it's even better look look at this look at this i got even better percentages now star coder 2 perform performance is great for enterprise applications as it delivers superior inference while optimizing cost in production i first off i don't even know like what does this even mean star toer 2 15b human ev valve percentage pass at one 40 some per pass at 10 60 some per small bar look it's like not as good even better single pass 10 passes it's a bar graph prime it means it's true i'm so stupid this is straight up 69% too nice graphs data synergy big code with context length of 16,000 tokens star coder models can handle a large a longer code base and elaborate coding instructions get a better understanding of code structure and provide improved code documentation trained responsibility restrained responsibly and available to all these models are trained with responsibly sourced co data i mean they're literally selling us like starbucks coffee here what is this free range code is this grass-fed is this vegan vegan code and dude invid is literally the starbucks of llms this is what i feel like i'm taking crazy pills uh one trillion tokens on permissively licensed data from github this includes 600 programming languages git commits github issues and jupyter notebooks man damn they even got the jupiter notebooks the model is completely transparent throughout the process including sourcing process procing and translation additional additionally individuals can exclude their code from uh being used by the model actually okay so that is at least a better take can we all agree that this is at least a better take right here here cruel free javascript impossible cles you know what cles coming in clut right here cles exclude opting out is a better take uh opting in would be the best but opting out at least they you know because then anyone that complains hey you're stealing my stuff they're like ah just opt out you licensed it you licensed it so i could take it why didn't you just make it opt out right co-pilot is also opt out i'm curious how these things actually work like how do you so my limited knowledge of how general like perceptrons work i i only understand them in the in perspective of ll or of uh mlps because that's the only thing i've ever handcrafted was mlps and so i know you back propop in uh errors into like the links between the uh perceptrons and so my question becomes how does that like how do you take something out hey lor you just dropped by well hey like how how would you like so i'm not i don't know how an llm works in that sense and my knowledge only only works with uh mlps and so you can't just take out a data point you'd have to retrain it from scratch correct is now d that m that mit license with m llm clause uh i i'm i i don't understand from that level because i mean i have handrolled my own mlps my own many layered uh mlps four layered ones i've done my own rbfs and f like i've done an okay amount 10 years ago they mean they don't collect your stuff for training well that would be post but they said to opt out right so that means once it's used it's already used it's in the network you can't just undo it right okay so it's already been trained in you can't untrain it but you can say no further use of mine later on which okay rbf resting face no surprisingly not resting face it actually stands for radial basis function a super cool model by the way if you've never used an rbf mlp it's actually super cool how it basically works which i think is super super super clever um is effectively you have a bunch of uh gan functions that do normal distributions right so like you have these normal distributions and you link a whole bunch of these together right and you can interp you can interpolate between the graph really really easily because then you allow for all these normal distributions to describe your your function right and so then you keep on doing that and you keep on you create more and more of these little uh uh perceptrons each as a radial basis function and it gets really really tight fit to any curve right so no matter what the curve is like a six layer uh rosen brock function can be pretty decently um uh fitted even by an rbf with significantly less with sign yeah tight dude it's a tight fit it's really great for interpolation impossible to use for extrapolation so what's and the cool part about them is that they only do uh what's it called you have your inputs right you have your inputs whatever your inputs are right and they all go to there's just it's it's a single hidden layer uh network right right which makes it super cool a single layer a hidden network is like is pretty dang cool because then it can go it's it's like super fast to train and super fast to get out an answer because you don't actually need like a whole bunch of you know you don't need a whole bunch of stuff it doesn't have to pass through a massive thing but again it's it's great at like you know predicting a point on a graph right it's not it's it's not used like this stuff right this stuff is massively more complex and i have no idea i i i i don't i've never studied it i have no idea how it works so i just i i'm literally dumbfounded by how magical it feels uh star coder 2 is offered as part of nvidia ai foundation models and endpoints providing uh access to a curated set of community and nvidia built generative ai models to experience customize and deploy in enterprise applications let's see i use rbs to interpolate temperatures uh data on a 2d plane works great in approximation yeah it is it's super good for that kind of stuff cuz that's cuz temperatures are going to fit within well-known set so you're going to be able to easily interpolate that models are off offered in nemo format uh for easy customization with nvidia nemo and are optimized for performance with nvidia tensor r rtlm op okay so it's just like they really are nvidia is genuinely getting on both sides of this equation you know i'm i'm always a little surprised you can do this as a company like if you sell the pickaxe people generally think you're not the one mining right you know but but i mean it seems like not only are they the ones selling the pickaxes they're also selling they're also mining which seems like you know like it seems like any company trying to develop their own llm technology would want to use amd right like if they could when they can they would want to i don't know seems like a conflict of interest to me you can now experience star coder 2 directly in your browser from using a simple playground i i do want to use that can i use it right here i want to ask this zig question where's this zig question can someone link me how to use this anyone want to link me a good link on like which one to ask at coding questions for because i would love to yo dog can i not press back is like back not can can you please not do this can you like please not do this this is evil okay this right here is evil i keep clicking back and you will not let me go back okay i hate when websites do that okay so you can do you can do all this you can send all this good stuff i mean it's cool that it's so easy to do all this right it's actually shocking how easy it is and maybe i'll have to play with this because i think it'd be a lot of fun to play with this model and we will you know how we're making a um you know how we're making a tower defense we could try to make chat versus an llm like it it is real we could make chat versus an llm and i think this could go pretty well because we have the description right it's kind of exciting that is a must please i think it's going to be a lot of fun i think because and then the best part is is that at the end of it all when i'm done with building the tower defense we are going to do an llm showdown gemini will obviously quit because tower defenses are unsafe and potentially racist so gemini probably won't be able to play so they'll get the lowest score but co-pilot versus chad jiid versus star coder versus grock like which one is the truest llm to win the llm will win i don't know i actually don't know if they will like honestly i don't know it sounds super fun i think it's gonna be it's going to be a lot of fun your ai uh versus doug's ai oh my goodness we could get doug doug ai oo doug doug could have his own little ai come in against me i like it opi opti you're on to something let me first get there us versus doug doug chat which one is which one is clearly more of a bot your which one is more of a bot doug doug's chat or our chat and the only way to be able to see the live board is that you have to ssh into something it will it will it will greatly reduce the available amount of people that can even do it that's a tough matchup yeah it is a tough matchup i like where this is going this is all good stuff i mean i'm happy that the thing is is like so i have this weird conflict going on like i do like um ai i'm a big fan of ai with coding i think there's a lot of great things it can do i use co-pilot i use it all the time i think it's fantastic but i also see the inversion of it and i've talked a lot about this about like what i call the the inflection point of of senior plus+ versus the permanently junior and so that's what is really difficult is that i'm very worried about the permanent junior class that is developed by having these ais it's the same reason why i used to be able to memorize anyone phone number hearing it once and then when a phone came around i just have no idea how to memorize a phone number how much of your skills in programming will become atrophied or never non-existence to begin with versus me who at one point developed it and i have all of it and now i'm going to be able to run laps around you who have never developed it you know that's what i wor that's like what i worry about is that this permanent underclass of of the permanent junior that's going to be created and so i i'm not an anti i'm not an acceler aist i'm not a deceleration i'm a i hope this thing doesn't f us erist like that's it that's what i just don't i just want good stuff you know what i mean all right the market will decide everything the market will always decide everything um anyways but people are claiming that ai willl even seniors yeah people are stupid okay you got to remember like dude we're supposed to have hoverboards we're supposed to have flying cars hell we're supposed to have self-driving cars exclusively by now how many times have you heard self-driving cars i thought my kid my oldest would not learn how to drive i may be wrong on this one right like i'm not convinced that this is a real thing i i am convinced that we will have self-driving cars absolutely you'll be forgiven in the agi utopia like i just don't think that the agi utopia is going to happen for a long time in 30 years will things be vastly different absolutely will i be even be able to predict the min like will i even be able to predict what 30 years will look like absolutely not will i even be able to predict what 5 years is going to look like i won't be able to you know what i mean like i won't be able to predict any of it at all because it's just like every 10 years things are going to get vastly different everything's too volatile yeah like the only thing i really want to see going up is netflix ston okay so this isn't like i was i was hoping for more gains than this okay this is not this is this is not the gains i was hoping for okay in 30 years i'll be dead really you think in 30 years i'm hoping i won't be dead in 30 years hey the name is i don't want to die in 30 years oh gosh look at this i mentioned netflix once and we're already down i life and shambles i'm shambling i'm shambling right now right now completely shambled the name is i feel like i'm the only person with a reasonable ai take everyone why does everyone have to have the most extreme ai take in the universe okay stop having such extreme ai takes you're you're annoying you're stupid you're stupid stop stop a jen
