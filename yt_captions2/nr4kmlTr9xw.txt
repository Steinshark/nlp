as part of the renovation on our new house i added this workshop test bench area to the garage which has already come in handy when working on product reviews the problem is that the garages in canada and canada has winter meaning it has been so bloody cold that i can't do any workout here so hate the garage i hear you saying but that would be expensive and frankly too easy i got a reputation to uphold luckily i have a second problem because we often need to retest hardware months or even years after it first releases i have a warehouse full of things like random motherboards weird crypto mining power supplies and gpus if only i could take my two problems put them together somehow i bet you can see where this is going directly to this message from our sponsor zoho1 with zoho one there's no more worrying about using multiple platforms and software to manage your business zoho 1 provides you with a single unified platform that's both comprehensive and easy to use start your 30-day trial using the link down below since many of you don't even believe that canada is a real country the first thing we'll be doing is establishing that a i am in fact real and b it is indeed cold in here so i've got this fluke thermometer and a k-type probe that i'm going to be taping to the chair in my test bench corner where i'll sit and work on like notes for product reviews or most recently troubleshooting the random restarting issue that i've been having with the play button pc that's interesting it claims that it warmed up like three degrees since uh we first started taking the temperature but if i go like this you can see it's dropping rapidly it's just for me standing here well because it's not if i'm whooshing around the air you can see it's dropping yeah yeah it's about it's about nine degrees in here which is honestly not that cold until you consider what the temperature is outside it is five degrees outside the garage meaning that the delta between outside and inside is only about four to five degrees we had a cold snap recently where temperatures plunged below negative 10 degrees celsius meaning that it was well below zero in here and not only unpleasant for me but also for my electronics particularly in my laptop the liquid crystals in the display turns to more like gel crystals with extremely pronounced motion blur even just moving the mouse around it's kind of hilarious obviously in a perfect world i would heat the entire space but instead i'm going to be laser focused on the area right around this desk and that's for a couple of reasons one it's large with high ceilings meaning that a lot of the energy is going to be wasted heating up the areas that i don't even occupy two there is currently no heating system in here whatsoever meaning i would have to install something from scratch finally three this house was not designed for the garage to be heated and therefore the insulation in it is absolutely atrocious so enter my solution heavy curtains from amazon which i'm going to put up just around this corner in an attempt to kind of hold in some of the heat i don't know that this will work very well but what i do know is that i have a second k-type probe and we are going to take our temperature in two places at the chair which i showed you before and also kind of out here to see if we are actually able to maintain a temperature difference oh that's right the original plan was shower curtains because the plastic would keep the hot air from moving at all at risk of the air quality in there not being as good anyway the point is that they were too short they were only going to go to like here um well this seems fine right oh why would i take down this stuff yeah that's where i keep my chainsaw what it's safe oh my goodness you sound like people on twitter okay i post a picture of my garage and everyone's like well it is the chainsaw is going to follow you chainsaw's not going to fall on me look ah hold on wait for it ah chainsaw's not falling down don't worry it's fine yeah come on what the hell how are you supposed to get this stuff out of here get a knife ah but that's okay because i have a perfectly organized garage meaning that i can find something immediately no matter what it is go ahead brandon ask me to find anything here we go my jerry rig everything that oh well uh oh crap wait i actually know the answer to that [music] in my backpack upstairs that was a hard one because it wasn't actually in the garage we've got a couple of options here we can either go between this post and the wall or we can mount it to the front of the mezzanine here i guess i'm just not really gonna overthink this i'll just kind of go for it right yeah because that would keep it as close as possible nope new plan things are about to get janky i'm taking the l bracket off and i'm just gonna put it in the bottom like this yeah good thinking linus that'll get it as flush as possible what was i doing on the ladder before brandon this is way smarter there we go oh dang it dang it there we go oh dang it okay there we go there we go i guess i i need to put the curtain on it uh yeah this seems like a good idea hey brandon brandon make sure you're rolling if i die i've said it time and time again but you guys got to monetize that video that'll be my final gift to the company it's the right thing to do brandon i have found a small fly in the ointment uh my chainsaw appears to be in the way as does my leaf blower now i know what you're thinking brandon oh thank goodness he's going to take down that chainsaw but i've got another idea wait for it yes and after only minor trials and tribulations it's done not bad right swings open a little something like that and look it's even still compatible with my chainsaw storage now it's time for us to kick things up a notch and that is where this comes in we found this old mining frame kicking around from man that must have been like four years ago or something like that anyway from an old video we did and what i like about this one is that it seems like if we get a little creative we should be able to wall mount it because like i said i don't just want to throw heat into this area i want to throw heat at my chair so i'm kind of thinking like here or if i can swing it maybe even at an angle so it's blowing down this is a perfect time to take our before we are exactly not really it's probably because i'm close to it okay well we're at 9.3 and 9.4 degrees respectively inside the workshop and outside in the garage so what i'm going to do now is close it because i am expecting there to be a slight increase just from the approximately 200 watts coming from me and brandon combined plus actually this is probably another like 150 watts if we do see a change in temperature in the workshop compared to the rest of the garage while we're building up the mining rig that would suggest that the theory behind this is sound and i'm not just going to be trying to heat this entire space with a thousand or so watts which would like be negligible wouldn't work at all okay let's build a computer shall we brandon help me decide should i go with the firestarter 5000 or this unit from our reputable brand firestarter 5000. with the bitcoin logos on it sorry silverstone you're too reputable not enough fun now i'm sure the mining enthusiasts out there are going to be cringing at some of my hardware choices but let me tell you something efficiency in this case not actually necessarily a benefit if i have a less efficient power supply that just means i'm kicking out more heat oh i guess i should talk about the cards that we're going to be using these are all examples of gpus that we're not using right now but that i will almost certainly need at some point in the future so i've got i think this is a 2080 ti a 3080 now that the 40 series is out you're going to see a lot fewer 30 series cards in our projects and then i've actually got our matching pair of rtx 2080 supers which we might need if we ever wanted to do a retrospective on sli or something like that so in that case i will come up on my ladder rip the gpu off the wall and take it into the office for now it heats my garage i know that there are plenty of gamers out there that could be using these gpus right now but the problem for us is that the cost of like selling them and then reacquiring them at some point in the future when we need them is extremely high and it's super time consuming and so we've found it's better to just store them i put all the gpus on before plugging in all of these little pci express riser boards i mean yeah mining content so out of fashion now you guys might even forget these things basically what they are is little pci express to usb adapter so apparently usb has enough conductors for a pcie by one link so then that goes up to this little board here that accepts a 16x gpu mining is not particularly bandwidth intensive over the slot and then you power this little board with a six pin pcie connector unfortunately i screwed in all my gpus before installing these so now i get to do this the hard way i'm only going to plug in one of these gpus for now because even under the best circumstances this mining stuff tends to be a little bit flaky and the more gpus you run the more chance of encountering instability i do not want this thing to shut off because then i'll get cold oh my goodness this thing's heavy and oh wow this frame is just like ball mounting this is going to be a challenge but i have good news check this out there's now a difference of 0.3 degree freeze between in here and out there that means the theory is sound uh hold on a second can this thing even take a 120 volt input i can't remember shoot it can't and i just plugged everything in you know what screw it let's take lunch and it's done switching the power supply has another benefit there's actually one screw hole here that aligns with the psu so the whole rack is now self-contained all we need to do is see if it works this is going to be a lot of power i um hmm i have questions um nice uh okay we got display power usb we good to go whoa uh okay only one of these gpus is actually plugged into pcie so far and you might have noticed i'm plugged into the motherboard for graphics that's why we needed to use a g variant of amd's ryzen 3000 series so it's the 3400 g because we want all of our dedicated gpus dedicated to mining now windows isn't necessarily the best operating system for mining but um it's here how long does this benchmarking process take oh it was like 15 or 20 minutes per card oh my god what uh you know what no it's it's fine basically i what i had planned to do was plug them in one at a time instead we're just going to plug them all in and hope for the best and we'll let them all do their benchmarking thing we've got another video to shoot here today anyway so we'll go do that while we wait obviously we want more but two of them are actually mining already and we're sitting at about 975 watts not too bad but we still have some problems to solve like how to put the heat exactly where i'm going to be sitting the idea that i have in mind as you guys know i'm something of a ceiling and wall mounting enthusiast ah is i want it right here and then i want fans that are kind of blowing the heat down what do you think brandon genius or moronic okay these are at about' inches which is durable awesome all i have to do then is just drill some holes in the mining frame and put it right into the wall what could go wrong wait oh they're all mining now that explains why we're at 1200 watts man that kicks off a lot of heat exactly what we need all right let's shut it down and get it bolted to the wall i would never recommend drilling near working hardware components oh how did i just break oh the drill bit oh there's a hole nope got this oh yeah she bit she bit please tell me it instead did we get it oh yeah that's not going anywhere and after only minimal troubleshooting which involved enabling 4g decoding and changing all of our pcie slots to gen 2. we are up and running 1200 watts from the wall and i gotta tell you guys i can feel the heat now all we need to do is let it run for a while long story short it didn't our temperature delta is only about a degree and a half which if you guys remember is not that much different from just having a person in here working i think i know why though we've got our flir thermal camera going here and you can see that the warm zones around the mining rig are actually in completely the wrong spots a ton of our heat is kind of leaking away over here a ton of it's flying off over this way and we are sending some down but it's clear that the position of our fans is not ideal for blowing the heat down toward the user it's almost like thermal management is like a whole industry with engineers scientists but who needs engineering when you have l brackets here's what i'm thinking three l brackets on the wall i bend them in the vise and we blow the heat that way i had my lovely assistant help me bend these brackets good job uh sure how about here i mean at this point i feel like the ship has kind of sailed in terms of this looking decent i like how this video it's been started out like kind of done without now this i mean how does that look oh crap i just ripped the screw out of the wall all good i'll just make a new hole no one will ever know except all of you people watching and it appears that i've put holes in my wall for nothing the grand total difference in temperature between the curtained area and the outside is one degree at best oh zap to block but at least there's no bugs i mean is it even what about here like it feels warmer okay it is warmer it's like 12 and a half that close i think for v2 i just need to get it closer at the end of the day even if it's only a degree it's free real estate though right because we're making money mining nope we're actually losing a dollar a day but that's okay because as the key night among you might have noticed earlier in the video our ultimate plan is not to mine on it well the ultimate plan might to keep it at all if it's not actually going to hit the space but whatever the ultimate plan was to run folding at home we've got a great folding
