how's it going guys i have my christmas hat on and if i have my christmas hat on you know this is going to be a very serious video no not really it's not going to be that serious all i really wanted to say in this video is that there's a huge end of the year sale going on my website if you want to learn python from the basics all the way up to the more advanced concepts such as multiprocessing and asyn io i teach all of that through my courses and the courses are what allow me to teach for free on youtube and i also have three other courses the first one i absolutely recommend if you are learning python and it's one of your first languages i absolutely recommend you start there because having a solid foundation for python is incredibly important before you move on to learning data science or even how to build artificial intelligence the other courses are for more advanced programmers one covers type safety and the type safety course teaches you how to create a solid foundation that will help you prevent making fatal mistakes when you are writing code then i have another course that helps you learn how to analyze big data it covers numpy it covers matplot lib and of course it covers pandas using python with jupiter notebook and then finally i have a course that helps you build 30 cool projects that will help you master the python language so it's always good to have that practice because the more practice you have the easier it's going to be when you create your own projects someday anyway all of these courses are hosted through udemy and i told them to maximize the discount for the rest of the year so i hope you enjoy the discounts and it's important to mention that everything's backed by a 30-day money back guarantee so if you feel like i overmarking and that is that i'm quite aware that in some countries they will not allow you to purchase my course i believe one of these countries is russia and the other one is iran and i think there are a few more countries but if you cannot purchase my course and you actually want to purchase my course please send me an email i'm not going to charge you for it i would love to share with you a free link because i really believe that everyone should have the opportunity to learn python so that they can create a better life for themselves so if you're in difficulty or you're in one of those countries please send me an email telling me a bit about your story because of course i'm not just going to give it to people who say hey i'm a bit lazy i don't want to pay for your course but if you're an actual difficulty i absolutely want to help you out that's that's all i wanted to say and if you've made it this far through the video do let me in the do do let me do let me know in the comments section down below whether there are any videos you want me to make for 2024 i would love to get some recommendations because as a creator it does get quite difficult to keep up with new ideas all the time so if you have ideas please leave it in the comment section down below i will try to make some videos about that if it makes sense but otherwise with all that being said as always thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next video
