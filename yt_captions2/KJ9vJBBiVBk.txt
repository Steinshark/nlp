hi friends we are back today and this is a very 
exciting video why because we are going to play   around with chat gpt's gpt 40 i feel like as i'm 
saying that i had to think about am i saying that   correctly 40 it definitely doesn't roll off 
the tongue as builders i think most people who   are part of this community love building things 
whether you're an actual developer maybe you're   on the business side of tech it doesn't matter 
we like to learn about the latest technology and   build really cool things and that is what i want 
to do today i was really curious so i got here   my computer wasn't that heavy i don't know why 
i did that uh so i got here i went on chat gpt   and i saw i now have access to gpt 40 as i'm 
sure we all do and one thing that stood out to   me which we'll dive into shortly here is how 
it's supposed to have better capabilities in   understanding images so i thought what better 
than to take some screenshots of some really   interesting ui and see if it is able to take that 
image understand it and generate code through that   i thought that'd be pretty cool it's fullon i 
mean as expected with tailin but that's really   cool so that is what we are going to do today 
play around with it and see if we can get some   really good prompts for it hopefully when you 
watch this video it will spark some creativity   or some creative ideas as far as how you can build 
your next project or even just understand better   the capabilities of this new release i mean this 
is moving quickly and having an understanding of   its capabilities what's possible with it i think 
is honestly the best way the only way to stay up   to date with this moving to stay what is it to 
stay up to dat with it moving quickly you know   what i mean actually that brings up a really 
interesting uh thought that i had i'm going   on a little side tangent here i was at a tech 
conference the other week and the speaker for   the keynote was jensen the ceo and co-founder of 
nvidia i love nvidia i think it's an incredible   company and they're doing some really cool things 
over there now seeing jensen speak for me was   like seeing a celebrity speak in my opinion i 
just think he's really brilliant and delivers   really thoughtful speeches sometimes maybe a 
bit controversial but but that's another day   and one of the things he said was technology 
is moving at the speed of a train when you're   not on the train and you're watching how fast 
it's moving by it looks like it's impossible   to keep up to date with it's impossible to ever 
catch up but if you choose to get on that train   and be a part of seeing what's coming up testing 
out these innovations learning more about it you   realize the train isn't moving that fast i really 
liked that analogy because it does do a good job   of when you're not you know when you're pushing 
off learning something new or you're resenting   it it does feel as though things are moving 
so quickly but when you're being part of it   learning and growing with it you realize that it 
is possible to keep up with it not only keep up   with it but grow with it and that today is what 
we are going to do with chat gp40 it's going to   take me a while to get used to saying that all 
right let's go oh subscribe like leave in the   comments other videos you want me to cover all 
right now let's go go meeting to my my dining room all right so you can see here i'm in chat gpt 40 
and the first thing it gives us is some options   one to create a workout plan design a fun coding 
game plan a relaxing day and explain a nostalgia   to a kindergarten that's cool but you know what 
actually before we take a screenshot and see   how that works let's kind of just play around 
with this tool let's see what the suggestion of   playing a fun design a fun coding game brings 
up can you help me design a game concept all   right so now it's starting by prompting us 
more which is interesting usually it would   just put out the output the uh solution where 
in this it wants to know more let's do it in python now this is more chain prompting 
style where it's you know wanting to   have more of a conversation with you 
so they want to know target audience   game genre learning objectives 
target audience is um adults jean   you choose and it is for entertainment you pick 
everything else i mean obviously if you were   really doing this for a specific thing you'd want 
to get very particular but for this i want to see   what they have up their sleeve code quest that's 
cool an adventure puzzle game where players embark   on a thrilling journey through different words 
uh this is cool learning objectives game mechanic wow this is so cool if this will actually 
output the right code for us that's pretty   impressive sample level what do you 
think of this concept let's build it this is actually pretty impressive but will it build 
the game for me that's what i   was hoping for i mean i wasn't very 
clear about that but i just assumed can you build the game for me with 
python code it said python code though wow this is interesting so it's doing a a 
uh prototype and obviously i knew this was   a lot of work i'm a i'm a developer but 
the way they positioned it was a little   bit misleading where it was like build 
a interactive uh coding game i thought   that would mean the ai would build it for me so 
that's a little interesting oh i do like how they   said how to run it though and next steps okay so 
that's okay um let's go into repple it and see if   we can run it and then we will do the screenshot 
i'm going side i'm getting sidetracked here okay   so i just entered in the for loop here uh and you 
can see when we go to run it congratulations you   saw the this is actually really cool it's very 
creative okay so that was really cool actually   i'm i take back my my immediate thoughts around 
40 now what i did is i just took a photo as you   can see here of udem homepage ui i don't know 
why i said that so funny udem homepage ui and   i uploaded here so let's go ahead and say 
uh create use this image to create uh code   for me to read that will reproduce this i would 
like for you to use tailwind and you can choose   everything else that's a pretty vague prompt 
but let's just start with that and see how it goes okay so they're using tailwind css i like how it comments it out too 
like the hero section skill section tabs   da da da all right this is pretty cool this 
is from one screenshot i took i remember i   know i'm going to sound so old but i remember 
when i first was learning to code and we had   to create a to-do list with react and honestly i 
spent like a full week on that because you know   there was stack overflow but when you're 
just learning something new and this case   coding you don't really know how to google yet 
like the proper terms to google or whatnot and   now it completely tools like this have completely 
changed everything and i'm very interested to see   this next next generation of builders coders 
tinkers whatever you want to call it who are   using this technology it's so fascinating to me 
gone or the days or you're spending weeks on one   to-do list uh building it for the first time and 
feeling those pains it's really interesting all   right so and it does an explanation all right 
so i took that code from chat gpt and the tail   and css i inserted it into repple and this is 
pretty cool so you can see here literally just   copy and paste it ran let's expand this though 
this is so cool it's pretty much is it responsive   let's see can i do it and it is responsive 
how responsive is it though let's see that's   our old code behind there it's full on i mean as 
expected with tailin but that's really cool wow   obviously the images are broken do these work no 
but that could be the next step is prompting it   to get these tabs to work i'm sure that's pretty 
impressive i have to say the images obviously are   missing but otherwise it's pretty accurate that's 
really cool let's go back to chat gpt let's go here and look at this yeah i mean it's a bit 
different but it's very similar the future it's   here people all right quick recap i think this 
is really cool i'm going to change the way we   build how teams build build even just by these 
advancements and i truly believe that there are   a lot more exciting things coming with open ai 
that they're going to be releasing by the end of   this year for sure that some i think they're 
just holding back on i don't know why i just   have this sneaking suspicion it's really fun 
and this tech is moving quickly as i mentioned   but the key here is to be part of it to try it 
out through different tutorials like this just   get curious build things break things be part of 
what was it that jensen from nvidia said be on the   be someone who is on the train all right 
i hope you enjoyed this video make sure   to hit that subscribe button for more tech 
coding future tech all the good stuff and   leave in the comments any other videos 
you want me to make any topics you want   me to cover it's what i'm here for all 
right i'll see you soon thanks everyone
