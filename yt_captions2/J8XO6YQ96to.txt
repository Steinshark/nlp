i remember the days when i was in my coding 
bootcamp thinking i will never will i ever   get a job is this something i can ever 
achieve to becoming a software developer   going from this broke fashion 
student can i possibly become   something make something of myself in the 
tech industry this is something i think to   some degree a lot of us have had questions on if 
you are someone who's transferring into the tech   industry from another industry it can be very 
overwhelming where it's like i don't know where   to start i'm very confused is as possible and 
really questioning your decision to break into it   today i'm going to be sharing with you a 
bit about my story as to how i went from a   broke fashion student to becoming a six figure 
software developer before we get into it though   make sure to hit that subscribe button 
for more tech and coding related videos   give this video a thumbs up and as always leave 
in the comments other videos you want to see   if you've been on my channel for a while now 
you probably know to some degree in my story of   my background being in fashion transitioning into 
tech now this video isn't going to be me repeating   my story to you but i really wanted to highlight 
as i get asked a lot or get messages from people   that have self-doubt as to breaking into tech or 
if they are in a coding boot camp really can they   do it is it worth it and today i wanted to really 
talk to you about how i overcame those thoughts   and how i really made that transition growing 
up and even the first bit of my my 20s i thought   fashion was the only way to go for me i wanted to 
be part of something that was creative building   different things working in teams and to me that 
meant fashion mainly though because i didn't even   really understand what tech was or not what tech 
was but what the tech industry had to offer so i   just related that being creative working in teams 
well that meant fashion when in reality there's   so many other industries tech included that 
these traits apply to i remember when i started   self teaching and teaching myself how to code 
feeling almost very lost and overwhelmed as to   i feel like i got to a certain point through 
teaching by myself but i really need to get the   help and support of a community and for that 
reason is why i ended up going to a coding   bootcamp i knew i needed to have the structure 
have people i could communicate with and talk to   people who would support me and really be there 
for me along my journey now the next question   i get asked a lot is well how did you decide 
on what coding bootcamp to go to for me here's   how i made my decision i wanted to go to a coding 
bootcamp that supported me that i felt once i left   the coding bootcamp they would support me still in 
helping me find a job and also too was teaching me   the most up-to-date technologies now i'm not going 
to share with you necessarily what coding bootcamp   i went to because a lot of those things were 
not actually checked off when i left that coding   bootcamp but that brings me to i want to share 
with you a coding bootcamp that i if i was to   do it all over again i would go to which is coding 
dojo you know i had been a huge fan of coding dojo   for a while now actually last year i actually 
attended some of their classes because i really   wanted to get immersed into what they have to 
offer and i wanted to share with you some of the   reasons that coding dojo has stood out to me first 
is it's a three-stat curriculum which provides   graduates with a complete skill set you're not 
just focusing in on one area but you're really   leaving the program with a full stack of skills 
so it's one of the things that really stood out to   me about coding dojo is their lifetime support 
you know once you graduate they're there for   you helping you find a job but not just any job a 
better job than what you had before you went into   the program which i think is really huge and says 
a lot about the program i think one of the biggest   challenges about breaking into the tech industry 
if you want to become a software developer isn't   actually learning the code but landing your first 
job so the fact that they are supporting you and   being there for you during that time as well 
is key and on the note of jobs coding dojo has   over 8 000 students who have completed the boot 
camps and landed reputable and well paying jobs   in the tech industry so i always like to say let 
the numbers speak for themselves they also offer   a wide variety of courses you can specialize 
in i talk a lot about software development   because that's my career path but there also 
is options from data science cyber security   and uiux design i have linked them down in the 
description so make sure to go check them out okay now that i feel i've answered one of the most 
popular questions i ever get asked is what coding   bootcamp to go to i want to share a little bit 
about more my story so once i graduated from the   coding bootcamp it was this moment of fear of okay 
now what where do i go what do i do i'm all alone   and it just felt very overwhelming for me one of 
the next best steps was to find people to support   me and that's really why i created this channel 
is because i didn't feel like i had that support   and what i did though was i went on linkedin and 
just started reaching out to people and taking   people out for coffee as an introvert that is 
pretty terrifying but i knew there was no way it   was like a do or die situation and one thing that 
really surprised me was just how friendly people   were they were willing to connect willing to sit 
down and really be like let me pick their brains   which was so huge and one of the other things i 
think is really important to note is to not let   your ego get in the way you're breaking into a new 
industry yes maybe you have tons of experience in   another industry that can be applied to different 
degrees to this industry but don't let your ego   get in the way in thinking your first job you're 
going to land has to be you become the next ceo   or steve jobs be realistic where is your current 
skill set and what roles really reflect that and   that's something that i saw so many people let 
get in their way when applying to first jobs was   they turned down so many jobs because they 
thought oh well i'm better than this and   yes of course and know your self-worth but be 
realistic in that and for me that was realistic in   i took a job at a startup and was it my dream job 
was it my dream company no it really wasn't but   i knew what it would do is get me the experience 
to really elevate me and take me to my dream job   and then from there once i gained that experience 
it was so much easier to move to a job that was i   was passionate about and really wanted maybe more 
so than the initial job i guess what i'm trying to   say is it's easy to glamorize this tech industry 
and thinking you're going to be making six figures   right out the bat and everything's perfect and 
you hear those stories and that's not the case   is it possible of course it is it's it's more 
than possible it's very realistic but it's not   like your first job i think i was making oh i 
was making so little my first job it was just   ridiculous but it i paid the bills and i knew it 
was that step towards making those bigger numbers   making six figures and you just have to start 
somewhere another thing that really helped me   was having a mentor having someone that when i was 
building out projects or learning new things that   i could really confide in and talk to and for me 
how i did that was i found through a mutual friend   someone who was a software developer and was 
mentoring on the side and we met once a week   and this was a paid kind of meeting i did 
pay her to to teach me and to tutor me and   just continue evolving with my skill set even when 
i was working and i did this because i felt like   there was so much that i still needed to learn and 
grow in and having someone support me in that when   i wasn't getting that maybe at work was really 
really valuable to me now a lot of you might find   that in your first job which is amazing but for me 
it just wasn't there at the end of the day there   is no secret formula or magic formula you just 
need to work hard don't focus on what others have   or what others are doing focus on your end goal 
and also to realize that there might be different   kind of steps you have to pay take to get to your 
end goal the path isn't always perfectly straight   but you need to kind of adjust as things come and 
go i hope this was insightful to you sharing a bit   about my story and i really wanted to take this 
down to a very realistic step because a realistic   video because i think too often tech is glamorized 
and you know people say oh right when you get your   first job you'll be making six figures or high six 
figures and maybe for some people that's the case   which is amazing but i think for most people 
myself included it definitely is not the case   is it realistic in the future of course it is 
very quickly you will get there but you need to   kind of take a step back see where your skill set 
is and then adjust accordingly i'm curious to hear   your thoughts about this so leave them down in the 
comments i hope you found this video very valuable   uh just sharing my insights and experience
