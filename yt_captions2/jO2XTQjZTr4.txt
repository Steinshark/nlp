apparently cara's exct has some hot hot tea to serve us today if you don't remember anything about carter in the last little bit of time carter uh got caught pretty much playing playing both maker and taker they were going to people and emailing them about private equity that they could buy based on someone else's position and like and their ability to sell and then they're even telling the person like hey you could even probably ask for more so we're talking about the email was very very very naughty uh this te might be way too dank when your company tries to cancel you jerry telton on december 26 2023 so this is just like a couple weeks ago i sued ca for wrongful discharge retaliation breach of contract breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing defamation implied defamation false light publication of private facts and intentional infliction of emotional distress the last one's so good and worst of all i felt bad [laughter] afterwards i do like after all after all of this hits him with the emotional trauma right at the very end and then afterwards emotional trauma in violation of titles uh title 7 of the federal civil rights act of 1964 the california fair employment and housing act new york state and city human rights law as well as delaware and illinois law wow they got they got four states in there the suit comes from my response from firing late in 2022 two months after i wrote to ca's board of directors about serious systemic or systemic uh problems i've observed while working as the company's chief technology officer my suit is also named uh named cter ceo henry ward following the bizarre widely derided diet tribe he published on his personal medium account in october and then sent in mass email to carter customers my claims became public last friday friday after first being served privately to allow ca to request redactions of information it considered confidential they're going to real court emotional distress means that they uh that they were harassing the person as per legal definition oh damn okay okay intentional infliction of emotional distress means willing harassment okay so this isn't just like this isn't you hurt my feelings this is dang okay that's real law stuff okay wof got to get a lawyer in here and no it's like way way worse okay i didn't know this okay i didn't realize how i did not realize how bad this actually is let's keep on going cara has been in the news quite a bit lately following recent allegations that the company unethically misused confidential customer data to bolster its own trading revenue that's what i was mentioning a little bit earlier especially with the fact i think let's see let's see if any of them are having the the twitter tweet yeah because the big one was when if if you i you can check out the other video but the the big big one was when they said hey this person uh is uh required to sell at this certain price but i bet you could get them to go higher or the person is required to buy at this this uh minimum price but i bet you could go higher like giving the person that they're selling selling or uh buying from giving them like a like intentional inside baseball which is pretty crazy anyways w's reaction to the scandal was all too familiar first attempting to downplay the concerns then publicly attacking the person reporting them then rushing out to thought leadership puff piece that raised more questions than it answered before finally pulling a'0 announcing the company would exit the liquidity business entirely without ever explaining what had actually gone wrong or har carta would change its operation uh operating procedures moving forward oh i didn't realize that he announced that he was leaving the liquidity business altogether this is the ceo no not anymore because we have the data and if we are trading secondaries people will always worry that we are using the the data even if we are not that is so stupid yes you are i mean dude the email was clear that you were did you do you see this guy that's kind of wild that he's just like nah people will just think we're using it i feel like they're super scared that they're going to get uh catch some serious sec violation yes i would say so and so this okay so if going from that direction he's just trying to avoid all the sec problems uh but that's wild that is wild uh maybe maybe that's what they're going for so he has to obviously tow this line he could never say yes we were because then they would just get sued into oblivion so he could never say that so i i mean i understand the predicament he's in right uh but still it looked very fishy it looked very fishy all right anyways all right for customers it was confusing whirlwind of a week that broke trust and left many considering alternative vendors for shareholders including thousands of current and former cter employees it was like watching a force fire as much of the value of their stock pred uh predicated ated on ca's plans to become a nasdaq for private startups when up in smoke yeah i was about to say i was about to say this that has to be such a huge revenue line like it's a huge revenue line to like if you could make trades and you get to take some sort of you know some sort of slice of that trade especially since it's private equity it's super hard to trade that i bet you they were taking a percent of the trade and not just some $7 charge right i guarantee you there was no $7 charge on this one that it was probably more expensive anyways for me it was deja vu all over again 14 months ago i was c a cto well regarded praised by ward for a bleeding aarta blue what does that even mean oh then the color of our logo okay dude okay blue hair mentioned i swear even this article is trolling me even i'm working nights and weekends uh to take care of the people the products and the profits in that order blue called it shut up speaking of blue hair sh dang it for those that don't know i've lost a bet and i now have to get blue hair i lost the bet officially 10 minutes ago this is so effed up this is so effed up i've been in emotional distress this is emotional distress who am i suing all right anyway so it sounds like this guy on paper how he's saying himself he's really really great okay now whether he was or was not great we don't know but he is saying that the ceo was saying that he bled blue and he was taking care of the people then the product then the profits in that order okay uh but the more time i spent on ctis se suite the more concerned i became about the company's leadership after witnessing behavior that veered from bad for business to ethically questionable to potentially illegal i met privately with several other executives and board members when these meetings only increased my unease i sent a signed letter to the entire ca board and the company's general counsel so that they from the high from their higher vantage could assess the the merits of my concerns and decided what to do i not ward nor anyone else i reported in my letter was immediately suspended okay okay a major law firm investigated and i was questioned for eight hours by that team including former united states attorney general loretta lynch days after my interview on the on the friday before christmas i was fired for cause a week later ca sued me there's also a fundamental problem here with trying trying to be a third party that facilitates market on unregistered securities by definition that liquidity is supposed to be restricted and only access via direct investment without third party interest even just brokering it is in kind of a gray zone legally speaking i think yeah i'm no lawyer i don't know the i don't know the financial stuff i don't know the i don't know any of the the the the the the legal jargon and for what's uh for what's going on but it does sound it's sounds like you're in a very very difficult spot to whenever you want to become a broker you should just know that it's extremely difficult like that should be just like step one that's really really hard now that you're dealing with companies and private equity and very very rich people and vcs which are soulless like now you got an entire secondary thing that's really really hard like i have no idea if there's violations here or what the law would be but it is definitely it definitely doesn't look good um but i think the big thing we should look at here is that all these people came in and it sounds like a third party including this this person i know this i i know this person's name for some reason i've seen her name in the news recently i think she she might be one of the people is she suing trump one of the people i know she she has a big name for herself right and she looked at the case and they were questioned he was questioned for many hours and then cter then determined it was not only legal to to to fire him which is always hard to fire sea it's not as easy to fire sea as people think then they then they sued him they're lawsuit is a real whopper okay let's see their lawsuit yeah it looks i mean that's what it does look like it looks like a scapegoat to try to save their own skin but let's see what the let's see what the lawsuit is because this is pretty incredible here uh i joined ca in september 2018 the startup i' had co-founded and later shuttered had been an early customer and so was slack where i ran the machine learning service team for just under two years the technical challenges carter was facing when i interviewed were a far cry from the problems i had worked on during my phd at stanford classic stanford i swear everyone in the valley is like where'd you go to school stanford uh diversity everybody here works from stanford uh but what drew me to the company was the disproportionate impact such simple technology could have on so many people making employees owners giving them an economic stake in the value they create isn't a panacea for capitalism's uninternalized externalities well i don't even unintentional externalities okay that is this sentence this sentence is actually too hard for me to understand i can't i i literally can't understand this sentence and i don't think go pilot or uh chat gpt can help me here stop it's already dead but it's a but it's a damn good start and ca's platform has such potential to do good i do think it's i mean i do love this i do love ca's like mission which is to allow indiv idual to have ownership in private equities more easily like that is a very important thing like if you ever join a startup you should get equity if you're working at a startup realize that you shouldn't just be working for your paycheck you should be working for ownership in the company right because that is going to be that all your hard work and all the multiples of of income coming in should hopefully come partially to you in some percentage right like that is like it's a great great idea for a company now whether or not they lived up to it that's a different story but premise wise i i love it right i believe in carter's promise and its mission i believed in the systems and institutions responsible for governing the company we fundament let's see uh were fundamentally good and sound even if they and the people administering them were also fallible and imperfect well yes you always have to assume every person working anywhere is infallible and imperfect i mean it's this sounds like a great goal can we all agree this sounds like a good goal and we should all be pretty happy that something like this does work i should make a private stock market [laughter] app what's the key takeaway i should make a private equity app for trading uh i'm not sure i believe that anymore it's hard to keep believing that when you read about the sales representative who whipped his dick out at a company event what okay well i'm not allowed to look at the dick whip out event apparently the business insider has a dick whip out event which uh didn't you say you paid for media this is i i have to go get i have to go pay for i'm not going to start a membership right now business insider i'll have to buy business insider so we could see some delicious dick whip out let me just see the dick at the company event and was promoted a few weeks later oh my goodness tj the ex oh my goodness oh my goodness i can't have i can't do this dude that story is like straight out of erck bachman avat dude that's some avato energy right there that is avato energy when you read the text one manager sent uh to her mom about the an executive touching her under the table at a work dinner let alone claims that she uh was subsequently admonished for having her legs out and fired after she escalated to hr when you read that the head of corporate compliance was fired a week after she learned that the people team by the way anytime we should all know that anytime something sounds good it means it's bad right the the obviously the most chief case and point is the people's democratic republic of north korea i mean the more you have to say something is good the more it's like the worst it it it possibly is yeah the ministry of truth right whenever you have something like that it's just like ain't no way that's true ain't no way that's true capitalism makes no claim no don't even try this don't even start this we're not doing it we're not doing it democracy democracy who i forget who says this but democracy is uh is the people getting what they want and getting it hard something like that it's like oh is this what you want well we're going to give it to you good and hard that's democracy uh let's see the head of corporate compliance was fired a week after she learned that the people team had been instructed to stop logging complaints in the company's whistleblower platform i mean i don't know how much this is true but it's hard for me not to believe it and here's why i tend to believe this carta is like the vc's vcs right they manage all the money and whatever h for whatever reason it seems like the more power that accumulates the more like gross things happen in general and so it's not surprising that probably one of the most powerful companies in the valley is also filled with the largest degenerates of all time when the company claims uh it fired another female executive in part for taking unauthorized leave after she reported to the chief people officer by the way again chief people officer i would if i if i became ceo at a company that had a chief people officer my first act of business would be to fire chief people officer and completely dismantle the chief people hierarchy whatever that is i'm getting the hell we're getting rid of that uh that the ceo's gaslighting and abuse had shaken her so much she needed a day to collect herself and then a year later just a week before her state uh before state human rights bureau found that her firing was retaliatory and illegal sued her so carta is really messed up geez when a ceo has turned over no fewer than 11 seite executives in 5 years and settled at least three discrimination cases in the last year alone has the g to dismiss all the people trying to speak up as s uh sensationalized noise it's hard to believe believe that one board member willing to com uh comment on the record about the complaints would say only that it was not his place to question management wait hold on a board member i thought board member's entire purpose was to question management i thought that was like the board's job i thought that was like the whole checks and balances of having a board is that the board can reach in and help like offset you had one you have one job your one job is to speak and question management okay so i will say that there is one hard part about this i'm not saying any of these things are true or false but just because you get alleged does not necessarily mean you have done it and it's i think in our day and age it's very easy to consider someone guilty even when they haven't been found i'm not saying that he isn't guilty he's given me all the reasons to believe he is guilty how he talks how he sends tweets his like their clear'0s that they've made gives me high high high high belief that he's probably a pretty shitty dude but oh the following is actually worse okay cool that's good to know but i'm just saying always be careful just believing allegations alone we should always be willing for a court to decide and not just public opinion but this guy looks guilty af i'm just saying this guy looks guilty af okay uh uh and it's hard to believe that carter's response to my board letter in october 2022 uh trying desperately to signal my worry that the company's leadership was breaking the law and pursuing the uh and putting the business at risk would be to hire a forensic firm uh to recover a copy of my personal apple imessage history and uh publish private messages with enthusiastic uh enthusiastically consenting sexual and romantic partners that had nothing whatsoever to do with the [laughter] company you know that scene on on on uh on silic valley when when uh gosh i always forget his name uh this guy what's what's that guy's name that says this what's what's his name dude i know it every time i start no not jared jared is the one that does the  ross han oh yeah russ russ hanaman that's right russ hanaman russ hanaman dude this is like russ hanaman but like the negative version you see this this guy  published his messages oh my goodness and then use those this is so crazy because i feel like i've brought up the the show silicon valley like five times already it's it's it's like this thing is a part of the show and then those messages as pretext to falsely accuse me of harassment and discrimination it's all very hard to believe i don't know what it means to enthusiastically consenting and i'm not going to read it maybe they thought the show was a how-to guy they could have they could have the way i usually cope with awful things is humor but it's been tough to find the laugh in all of this even amongst the recent wit and witticisms of social med media is there some is there some is there some good is there a good good read who is jerry uh telton uh and why did carter ceo just email uh me to all over him i'm going to put press release into chat gpt to remove the noise and report back my findings not actually but i read as though he had a word count to hit i do like how this got no views because this is kind of wild that's pretty funny i can't even tell what's happening what is this seeing my private life deliberately twisted and thrust into the public sphere without consent of any of the people involved is hard enough to swallow but for a corporation to do it because i tried to blow the whistle yuck yeah i think it i mean i assume i assume that let's let's just i don't know if we have access to his letter to find out what they were breaking and all that i'm sure it's probably redacted af but if you write a letter privately to the board in the sea suite like hey these are laws we possibly are breaking and and the responses that you get fired it sounds like it sounds difficult and then to be like hit with sexual like i mean it all sounds really really bad at various times of my life i've been an expert in different things the discovery of tom petty and the heartbreakers organizational or the discog discography dude yes oh he he made a discography of tom petty the heartbreakers organizational management principles reverse jump marov chain monte carlo i understand most those words individually like irreversible jump i got that a monte carlo walk i know what that is a marov chain sort of i've heard that term but when you put them all together like that don't worry lithium you can you can you can hit on me all you want uh but nobody becomes an expert whis whistleblower this turns out to be a major point of contention we want people to speak up says the company handbook drafted by the expensive lawyers but as soon as someone does those same lawyers swoop it in and says but not like that so i have to ask what form of objection would have been acceptable should we should who should have come or who should it have come from how should it have been delivered in may 2019 henry messaged the company asking employees to come directly to him with problems instead of using the newly launched whistleblower platform henry's the ceo right that's not good that is enthusiastic consent that's not good right henry the ceo's asking you to sidestep the whistleblower platform that's like as sus as it gets at the leadership offsite in august 2022 he described his philosophy of manage management friction is failure henry proclaimed if you're arguing you're not doing your job that's why the board can't comment on any of this hr is there to protect the company this is very very true i i i fully agree with that a good h a good hr should try to be beneficial to the employee as much as they can but at the end of the day they are there to protect the company they're not there to protect you in another lawsuit filed against by a former executive henry said i didn't fire him because of his performance i fired him because he was complaining to the people he shouldn't be complaining to that could be fair so just just so you know that could be fair typically if you have a boss and you complain to him and things don't go well and you skip level you go to your boss's boss and complain about it sometimes you can find yourself getting into some hot water like i understand there are levels in which you're not supposed to do we have no light into this but given his past performance seems like uh he's probably not a good guy and probably fired him because he didn't uh he probably used the whistleblower platform instead of going straight to henry uh just a week ago in the latest carter scandal henry accused a prominent startup ceo of firebombing him for exposure after the founder posted evidence that c a misused customer data as far as i can tell the company's position is that nobody ever speaks up in the right way or as legitimate concerned wrongdoing isn't the gravest sin talking about it is dang finally when or when i finally decided that as a as a fiduciary i had no choice but to write to carter's board i hoped that my record of accomplishment and my commitment to the company would ensure i was taken seriously i joined uh as a director with a single direct report quite quite the director there uh been promoted three times in two years as uh to chief technology officer and then led in engineering through a period of unpre unprecedented growth to a team of more than 400 strong true to the company's mission i was an owner i had invested nearly my entire life savings exercising company stock options and the card of success was now my success oof why is the exercising options i i mean just a side side note financially what usually what this means so people that don't know anything about uh side noting or or what's going on here typically what happens when you're in a company um typically what what's going to happen is that you're awarded some amount of options let's just say you're opted 4,000 blue options right card of blue okay four 4,000 options now these are the right to buy a share of the stock they're not the stock itself just the right to purchase it all right we're changing the color i don't need you guys to bring up my hair color again this color is slightly blue which is not good uh anyways it's the right to buy an option at a price right so it's like being able to bite it you're you're buying the right your employment is buying the right to purchase a share say for $1 in the future so that means if the stock goes up to $100 you have made $99 profit i'm getting viewbotted people i'm getting viewbotted selling oh man selling bot program $100 code gl well i'm glad that you gave us your name tj oh tj come on tj don't tj  tj i'm trying to take a picture here last thing i need is you in the picture all right there we go here i'll just tag twitch back to sus user again that's pretty funny there you go okay hey let's get back to this because this is really good all right anyways okay so stock you have the right to buy so what this means is that when you want to sell your real stock unit remember an option is like kind of like an rc and rust right it's not the thing itself it's like a pointer to the thing so the option costs $1 your real stock costs x dollar right that's its value so long as your option costs less than long as the strike price costs less than the actual stock if you sell it you're going to get something like x - $1 or in this case $99 rust also has options okay interesting yeah yeah very interesting so you can also sell options but since this is a private equity often you can't sell options so now the reason why would you ever buy an option and just hold it like he said the reason why you'd want to do that is that when you get options let's say you get x options right let me make a prettier x let's say you get x options and they go up uh valuing from $40,000 to purchase to $100,000 all right that means you've made $660,000 now here's the problem this is called deferred income or w2 income w2 income at least in the united states is going to be your highest tax bracket usually so typically what people are going to typically what people will do is that while the company is valued at $40,000 they buy all those options and then hold on to those options so that this profit is not considered w2 income because they made $0 when they uh purchased all the shares instead of selling them so their profit was of course was equal to 0 they didn't make any money then it goes from a w2 income which could be taxed as high as what 39% to if you hold it for longer than a year long-term capital gains which is what 22% right now so this is also remember that thing how peter theel uh made a roth ira and it was worth billions of dollars and he had to pay no um no taxes how he did that effectively is he made a company company a right he made a company he owned 100% or whatever the percentage was right after owning 100% the company was valued at $1 it had nothing to it right it was valued at some really low amount of money he makes no money right at all he makes no money at all uh because he doesn't take any actual w2 income so he's eligible for uh he's eligible for a roth ira so he gets all of these options and purchase them purchases them all as stock and moves it into an ira so now he has 100% of $1 in the ira then i believe he starts palante here or whatever what whatever it is it's now worth billions of dollars doesn't pay any taxes roth ira and so this is how the dirty dirty uh vcs make a lot of money is that they go in here and they do this nice little trick make a company worth z take that zar and and put it into a roth ra because they only make capital gains they don't make w2 and yeah no truly that is so i i often don't like use the term rich get richer but this is actually rich just getting richer and by the way you're welcome for the discord message rothas are op but they're also very limited this is why people argue for a flat tax paying taxes does not equal virtue absolutely you're 100% correct but but this feels like cheating the system you know what i mean what like if i were to start a company that $1 is still worth $1 right can we all agree to that but if michael jordan decided to start a clothing company and valued it as $1 the the problem is is the intrinsic value of michael jordan is really really big the intrinsic value of me starting a company is really really small do you see the so okay sure mine wouldn't be $1 it might be $10,000 but just because i start a company doesn't mean it's going to be worth anything who is michael jordan only the most famous basketball player of all time right anyways let's keep on going so now you get the idea and you also get why someone would spend their life savings on exercising options because they want they believe the company is going to grow so much that it's better to pay long-term capital gains and foot the bill up front than it is to do the other one okay there we go i was an owner i had invested nearly my entire life savings exercising the company's stock options and card of success was now my success i had hired so many amazing senior leaders who were smarter and more experienced than i and were consistently garnered glowing performance reviews and stellar employee voice surveys results i was being paid $623,000 year-based salary and had a 3.9 million annual equity target what conceivable motivation could i have to put all of that at risk unless something was seriously wrong and if i a 40-year-old 6f foot2 sis white guy in a se suite with a stanford phd couldn't speak up who could plus i was writing a private letter to the board not calling reporters or threatening a lawsuit what was the company going to do pretend it was a mistake to have hired me in the first place say i was bad at my job nobody could stomach that much hypocrisy right stanford mentioned by the way weird flex 6'2 yeah he's tall does his height matter well typically height seems to be proportional with the the the level of authority you have if you look at like ceos the average ceo of larger companies tends to be tall yeah i'm i'm 5 foot 12 it's not a big deal but the average ceo is like 6'4 it's like this weird thing that happens what about dick size i don't know we're gonna have to ask the guy who whipped it out it's like this weird thing that correlates that you know like the average president's height right average uh president uh height six foot that's it oh joe biden's six foot dude he i knew he he had small energy he's always had that small he he has that 5 fo2 energy coming out out of him just like me i i knew it i knew it 5'2 just like me turns out some can and when powerful people attack your reputation the mud sticks no matter how uh no matter how mendacious i don't know what that word means i don't know what the word mendacious is not telling the truth lying mendacious i'm going to use that word mendacious no matter how mendacious prime j for president well i do have i do have 5'2 energy 6 feet is tall what are you talking about yeah it's not tall enough though then just say lying no you got to sound smarter than that those this is by the way this is totally chat gpt this is chat gpt if you're wondering when the word instead of lying the word mendacious gets used come on for those that know me well or have worked closely with me over the years laughed when they heard the uh the names henry was calling me but for many thousands who first exposured to me at c's lawsuit for hen or henry blog post his uh calam cames colies colies cames colum have scored also i don't know what that word means column the making uh the making of false and defamatory statements about someone in order to damage their reputation calam calamity calamity calamity caly i've never heard these words calumny ah i'm gonna make so much calumnies and it was tooo tough to blame folks for not tripping over themselves running uh running to my defense as the company continues its nuke from orbit legal strategy against anyone who dares raise ahead dang it's hard not to cheer when powerful hypocrites are finally called to account the ev the evangelical preacher caught embezzling funds the crypto billionaires ponzi scheme revealed but don't forget that shame is also one of the most pacious weapons of the shameless telling a female executive that she was like an she was like an alcoholic who needed to admit her problem and have full full scale recovery from being an  i mean that okay first off that's actually a hilarious that's a hilarious insult okay i'm not you know i can't say whether she was or was not an  but this is a this is one of the funniest ways i've ever heard someone ever call someone an you you have a drug problem except for the drug is [laughter] assholery i got to figure out a way to use that i got to figure out a way to use that somehow cuz that that is just incredible isn't the worst thing uh ever done in corporate america but the effect is still undeniable to break something just a little inside during a long coaching sessions with henry uh another seasoned executive wrote in her notes own it the problem is me what could i have done better months later i listened to her read back what she had written and start to cry damn damn this henry fella sounds sounds like his coaching sessions maybe we could get him on stream and he could coach me life nobody as lucky or as privileged as i uh has any business looking for sympathy but attempting to shame someone publicly for their safe legal and consensual private life is some dark  yeah people do kill themselves after all weird that almost feels like a weird tacid threat just saying that just that i mean i was like really on his side but it's just a it's a weird it's like a weird thread is type thing like that that one's weird okay that that's weird i just say i you know i don't know how to take like i am on your team this is some weird to do pro like posting someone's consensual relations where the other person is even like hell yeah that's weird herodes in the histor uh tells how solin advised uh crosis to count no man happy until the end is known so it's still too early for me to say for sure what i'll take away from this experience but there is one thing i'm certain of the only way any of this is going to stop is if we collectively decide that we are mad as hell and not going to take it anymore not going to take it or we're not going to take it is that what's going to happen here uh i always liked meline albright's quote about a special place in hell reserved for women who don't help other women but i think the proper focus should be on power not gender what is the point of acing influence in money and prestige if we don't use them to help people um in general i don't wish anybody a place in hell you have to be a real real real bad person for me i can't even imagine i really don't want to wish anybody a life in hell that seems just kind of strange uh the pro again the problem here is that i i generally dislike these raw raw statements right here where it's just like we need to do better it's just like yo i i'm not sure if i can really buy that we can do better in general i don't like it's never happened before every time someone tries to do something it almost gets immediately fraught with just massive fraud i don't want power he i think he's covering up his previous uh behavior personally but that doesn't excuse his bad behavior fair that could be very very fair uh statement we don't know we're only getting one side of the story of course and we know based on the things we've read before henry seems like a pretty crappy individual uh but still like these these kind of statements they don't mean anything because the pro here's the here's the big problem is one of my favorite people on earth used to say to me the thing that separates you from anybody else is time and circumstances and so this idea of judging somebody and like you know like oh you know you know like if i was in his position i would have done better it's just like would i have been better than henry like re real talk would i have been better than henry i would hope that i would have been better than henry i also did not live his life i also did not go through his circumstances i also didn't have his parents i didn't have his privilege i didn't have his rise to fame i didn't have his great idea for carta or whatever it was i didn't have all that stuff right so i don't know what kind of person i would have been yeah there but the grace of god i go i exactly like that's life and so like these these statements of oh you know if it was just me i would have done better it's just like if it was just you you probably would have been an too right you would have probably been an too and it's very easy to like that's why i just don't like these statements because they they mean nothing they're just platitudes of emptiness right they're just platitudes of you know you know why would we do all these things if we didn't help people well you know it's like gavin bsum when he's just like i can't stand the fact that there's somebody making the world a better place than me it's just like it's just like it's like the greatest state because that is the perfect summation by the way this is like the ninth time i've mentioned silicon valley it is literally the best summation of the valley everybody wants to make the world a better place as long as they're making it better than other people stop saying this isn't my job there's nothing i can do i don't know what i don't want to know it didn't happen to me it's n of my business mankind is your business the common welfare is your business the dealings of your trade are but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of your business i don't i actually don't know what this last sentence even means uh late in the summer of 2022 i asked a prominent silicon valley found founder an investor who had been a close to the company and knew something of the rampant dysfunction for advice if you pop up one by one they said henry can knock you down you have to stand together yet what is an ocean but a multitude of drops oh deep man oh so deep oh tell me more man bro stanford these stanford drops of wisdom a no pun intendent it has to start with you with one person deciding that enough is enough when uh you see something say something uh spend some not all but some of the social and professional capital that you have been working on so hard for so long to collect and stand up for someone who can't do it on their own in some sense i actually really do agree with this statement uh volunteer your time you you want to be a better person you want the world to be a better place stop waiting for the government to do something volunteer your time volunteer your money yeah everybody everybody likes to talk about how great they are until until you until you put their put put their time on the line oh i only volunteer like an hour and a half of my time like once a month and i begrudgingly do it true soci no that's the opposite of stop shady head stop baiting me it's the it's the opposite of true socialism it is individuals making charitable decisions upon themselves it's libert it's liberty it's right it's it's true virtuous liberty and that's what that's like that is the thing you want stop trying to bait me into a socialism chat i'm not going to do it not my backyard uh because uh let me tell you nobody can do it alone uh i don't know a lot of people have changed history just by themselves and then people catch on right i mean hell like real talk kl marks had like what four people at his funeral and now look at us we call capitalism capitalism capitalism wasn't called capitalis that is a marxist term for whatever we used to call it right like that's that's crazy one person can make a huge difference uh when you shrug and move on because you don't want to make wave some of the people you leave behind are drowning uh before i sent my letter to the full board at carta i met with barbara bran uh be bar be be be be marks mentioned let's go so communism god shut up the company's only independent director and the board's only woman we spoke for almost two hours and the last thing barbara did was tell me a story about a dispute she had worked at uh or she had at work years before okay i hate this music hold on dude this is stupid i don't know what has happened i'm on a weird playlist and it just is making me angry it's pronounced burn i like to call it baron i'm gonna call it baron okay i'm g to call baron let's see barb did tell uh let's see the last thing barbara did was tell me a story about a dispute she had at work years before where her employer sent expensive lawyers to intimidate her the only power they have she said is the power to make you afraid don't let them make you afraid you're real [laughter] be i'm tired disgusted outraged disappointed and incredulous but i refuse to be afraid seeing my good name smeared across the internet is painful and awful after all it is my name i cannot have another uh in my life but i have accepted that and if the last 5 years is going to mean anything it will have cost something don't let them make you afraid this is i mean this is it's good advice i mean the ending i i i do like i do like this part right here uh the only power they have is to make you afraid that's i mean technically not true some companies can sue you into oblivion they can also take away your livelihood um it's not just that they have the power to be afraid they have the power to drag you through and take all your money as well right because whether you like it or not if someone files a big heavy lawsuit against you you got to hire a lawyer this mentally can't build infrastructure we need more collective approach too to solve problems it's why we created a government uh for we can't do ourselves yeah exactly i mean this is why governments are good is those type those type of behaviors because we don't want private roads we don't want everyone building their own road just just be curvy all over the place be crazy h uh hop states every six months socialism shut up i agree in collective action in some sense but don't bait me into a conversation unless if you're government and samsung don't do that um isn't that what they do in south dakot well yeah i have my own road okay private roads are the best roads that is not true that is that is historically not true there are some nice roads there are a lot of crappy roads stop baiting the blue hair man plus private roads rarely get used so of course they're nicer they could just throw some asphalt down and six years later it's still just asphalt whereas public roads they get used like 900,000 times a day like it's just it's just not as simple okay there is no simple answer okay if anyone thinks there's a simple answer you're crazy anyways um this is wild i cannot believe ca what they're doing at least i cannot this story is hard for like if i accept everything this person says it sounds like it sounds like henry is like a sociopath that is willing to win at all costs the answer is use rust maybe so pretty wild i know stop talking about we're not talking about socialism shut up most ceos are social paaths dude most ceos are people who run companies that make very little to no money and and are completely normal people ceos don't need to be sociopaths this is just a don't don't don't buy into dumb cultural phrases okay there's plenty of normal people that run normal companies you've never heard of okay that you will never ever know about because there's there's literally millions upon millions of companies you just don't you'll never know about it we only hear about the unhinged degenerate ceos you never hear about the ceo that's just doing a pretty good job with its seven employees i'm just a pretty nice seven employee company and we are all super happy nobody cares and nobody's going to report on that company okay stop it is this mo miss monique yes this is employee with ceo with seven employees lol he still a ceo doesn't make him less of a ceo today we're reporting on a completely normal company ceo makes a normal salary and his employees are moderately happy they're not super happy because they're not making lots of money but they're also pretty happy because the work's nice but it's not super exciting uh they're just simply building out some cms software that's all there is to it okay bye now okay thank you for reading our article i have about 400,000 more those just like okay cool thank you for all that cool anyways the name is don't be like henry
