ladies and gentlemen the game of chess has not gotten an update in hundreds of years think about that for a second how many of you play video games video games get updates every couple of weeks some are good and some are terrible but imagine playing a board game on an 8x8 board with tiny little wooden pieces that the rules stay the same nothing changes until now you see it's currently early september 2023 and chestnut come has partnered with supercella creators of clash of clans and clash royale and chest.com has made a new type of chess it's called spell chess and it is exactly what it sounds like it is a chess game where you have multiple spells that you can detonate at various points that do things to the board and in this video i'm going to try it for the very first time and you can try it too by clicking the link in the description uh preferably after you watch this i have never played spell chess in my life honest to god i have no i barely know the rules so we are going to learn the rules together and you are going to watch me embarrass myself uh in the chess.com variants pool i have built this little overlay here because you know you you have the the chess set here um i have never played spell chess so we are going to learn and basically try to play spell chess uh live on stream all right i'm booting up a 10 minute game i don't think i need that much time um spell chess you have a a uh a green spell a jump spell which allows you to jump over a piece so for example if i use the green spell on this pawn right here i would be able to do this now i'm gonna play this move okay my opponent plays a bishop move and the free spell freezes something like this okay so what i'm gonna do now is i'm going to play i think i'm going to block my opponent's bishop that seems smart but a jump spell there would enable me to uh would enable me so if i if my opponent put it put a green thing on this they would be able to take that if they took this they could freeze this area of the board which is also possible um that is another way uh to to play um which is which is very scary which is very scary like if they took this they could put a blue spell right here and i would not be able to to move anything in that square so these are the two spells basically queen h5 okay wow um that move is trying to oh oh my opponent wants to put a spell on this they want to put a spell on that and then oh man so if i move my queen oh wow well that's very scary what if i move my queen here and then i counter freeze oh that's very interesting for example i don't even i don't even have to move my queen i guess but yeah let me move it oh no no no no no no i meant to put a spell no no no no i oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god they they just win the game now i i meant i was supposed to put the spell first oh you're supposed to put the spell first oh i'm just a regular check goes in three moves no the green thing here just wins my opponent could what wait what they could have am i crazy they could have just won the game wait wait i'm gonna do the same thing back to them well i'm also threatening this yeah but but now right now wait a minute so for example look this is what i meant i can put a thing here and then i can play queen takes rook look at that that's what they could have done to me so now i want to rook i snuck in there and and i'm cooking that's what i'm doing wow amazing um my opponent disconnected what is going on um so now now this resets right uh i'm assuming it resets for three moves spells recharge after a few moves so by putting a basically the something transparent right so i could take this and then what yeah okay so what if i put a blue here and i go boom so now that's check there's technically no it's not a check because i guess my opponent now should probably go here and counter freeze my queen that's what that's what they should do um but it seems like my opponent has disconnected so does that mean i have to sit here and wait eight minutes that would be really silly right so now i'm out of spells i i i i i am out of spells um i'm also overdoing the spells i don't i don't think i don't think wow um okay well well this is this is very silly if i actually have to sit here maybe we will just edit this video maybe i'll go for a walk and then i'm not gonna make you sit here for eight minutes but my opponent could have won the game right here my opponent could have put a green spell on this pawn and taken my king a green green spell allows something to be transparent basically um oh i won i won amazing yeah so like when my so what i tried to do is i i wanted to freeze like that and then i was gonna move my queen there but i guess i can't oh i i can i just can't move these pieces you can move into a freeze like that because this is not frozen interesting uh and my opponent could have won my opponent could have just went boink boink and one and one and won the game which i i i saw that i i saw that that was the the idea and then i wow okay that was really bad uh maybe we can do better next time let me refresh the lobby uh the variance lobby on shazam.com okay uh and now maybe i'll play a one five one five game okay spoke 92 one minute with five second bonus here we go pawn to e3 um all right they are thinking a lot to think about in this game pawn to e6 all right great uh so how about hmm what if i freeze uh this and then i play bishop here so i have a threat my threat with this move is to put a green spell on that pawn and then take the king now i think my opponent can counter freeze my bishop i think my opponent can freeze like this area or whatever that area and go there it's very interesting my uh what i i froze all these pieces so none of those pieces can move and if my opponent isn't careful it's gonna unfreeze you see that's what they did very good nice uh and now i think i'm gonna just develop my knight or maybe i'll threaten the bishop maybe maybe that's smart because there's now a threat to win the game here which i have to be very careful about uh yeah let's go here so the bishop is hanging and i am still threatening to do this and that um probably this is the best move by my opponent now now our friezas have to uh re-uh whatever i gotta read whatever so now i'm gonna go queen here and i'm setting up a win oh oh my goodness oh my goodness oh my goodness oh my gosh i complete whoa that's crazy yo now my opponent can probably take and freeze this oh yo this is crazy stuff here and wait this hasn't read this hasn't recharged yet right this hasn't recharged no so this would not be a good move what just happened that was insane all right i'm gonna take the rook i'm threatening to win again by the way i'm threatening to win so they've gotta they gotta address that okay they did um i'm gonna just go back and i guess my opponent's trying to bring in the queen oh man i don't know okay i'm just gonna take as many pieces as i can i guess this is trying to win the game if my opponent can make it that far so i got i got uh oh oh oh wait a minute wait wait wait wait wait wait i'm smart i'm wicked smart i'm gonna go here oh and i'm gonna win the queen look at that oh that's brilliant that's absolutely genius by me i counter froze the queen in danger oh oh yeah yeah yeah they were trying to win oh yes yes yes yes yes let me get that queen oh now i'm cooking now i'm cooking they got a little bit too aggressive with me watch this spell and boom oh i got him back with the rook trick it's a massive comeback for gotham chess oh this is sensational this is absolutely wicked stuff oh i'm just eating everybody i'm eating everybody can't stop me now can't stop me now okay now we need to protect ourselves or we could just keep eating let's just take everybody we're just up a ton of material up a ton of mood cereal we got all the spells in the world our king is safe can't get attacked on the diagonals um what does that even do i don't know here what are you gonna take and freeze me i'm gonna counter freeze you don't forget i'm gonna do the exact same thing i'm gonna do the exact same thing if you try to do this one second oh six okay terrific that's it i'm just taking all the pieces i am taking all this just like regular chests nothing different except you could spell and freeze and stuff the knight can't actually benefit from from any of that stuff though so um all right we give a check i probably should have frozen here oh yeah actually couldn't i have frozen this wouldn't that have been like an auto win oh that's funny i could have done that for sure let me see if i can get like a checkmate somehow a spell chess checkmate how do we do that um night wait freeze hear night check boom that's mate that's mate because anything that happens i take the king on the next move oh that's that's that's incredible stuff oh oh oh [laughter] whoops i got very excited damn wait no all right look that's unfortunate i forget i forgot he could freeze me all right i'm just taking the night then i'm just taking the night um tremendous let's go uh let's freeze this and rook boom easy oh wait they can counter freeze me again they can counter freeze me my opponent can go here freeze my rook oh my god come on now it's a double check i'm gonna castle wicked stuff this is absolutely nuts boom wait they can freeze me again oh and i have a limited amount of them too i can't even freeze anymore all right well that just means i'm gonna i'm gonna win at some point oh my goodness all right night takes that's that's my opponent said gg and uh well it's technically not over yet but the knights come in and i'm gonna checkmate them with a knight nice nice little night checkmate that was a fun game uh i hung my queen that was insane oh my goodness the game was like you know i i went for cheese clearly cheese doesn't work you know i i was trying to set up the green spell to do this now that didn't work at all and then oh my god i wow i gotta be careful man i gotta be careful you can't move the queen out there that's crazy that is absolutely nuts rook takes h5 i mean oh my goodness and then i wanna i think my opponent just panicked a little bit uh for not really for a good reason either um all right here's a game against the 1700. angel who seems like you know he knows what he's doing because his rating is very high plays e5 so we've learned that queen h5 is not possible um we've learned that queen h5 is not possible it can i go for cheese again cheese probably won't work right i don't think that's going to work so let's play uh let's play knight f3 all right we're gonna do this a bit differently i feel like my opponent knows some sort of openings which is really which is really bad uh pawn to c3 maybe or knight to c3 let's go pawn to c3 let's go pawn to c3 i feel like this is a smart move i i don't think the knights are worth as much in spell chess i think the threat of the diagonal attack is really powerful and the knights are sort of immune to this stuff why would you give me the what am i dumb it am i falling for something what that's just a free pawn and we we already learned that if this than this oh but they could freeze me but then i could counter freeze so if you go here wait wait a minute queen here frees this area threatening this i counter freeze and stop it but then there's this oh my god i might have just lost the game because when i have to take the queen they could do this oh my oh my god oh my god i think queen h4 might have been winning unless i'm pat we gotta analyze that i gotta get this stupid stupid ship out of here man this is like this is really stressful all right let's be safe let's just be safe this is not a threat they could take and freeze but i'm pretty sure that's that that's actually in the position by the way which is uh which is kind of crazy oh they're setting up this oh that's terrifying oh my goodness okay um bishop here wow yo this is this is a terrifying game i gotta get that bishop out of there because if the bishop takes and i get frozen i could be in serious trouble i really could be in some serious trouble i think queen h4 was winning but i'm i'm not sure so if i play knight d4 i'm gonna get counter frozen right i'm gonna get my knight counter frozen okay let's go here so i'm kicking out the bishop because i really don't like that it's facing my king and i'm trying to be as solid as possible i guess you could take me which is annoying but no no you can't because if you go here and you freeze my pawn i'll go here and freeze your queen so then you're gonna get cooked because the only thing preventing me from doing that and freezing the queen is getting my knight counter frozen and then i would lose my knight unless i guess i could create a second attack on the queen i don't know very complicated game very complicated but this would be a mistake because you would leave your bishop hanging and then i would go hear an attacker queen i think i don't know y'all i what what does that do i don't know what what can i can i castle is castling a good move am i are you not just giving me a bishop why would you do that why would you give me a bishop i mean i'm gonna it's a bishop right like what okay you go here you freeze but then i counter freeze right and my king is very incubated like my king cannot get attacked from any diagonal so you can't even create a second i don't know this is so trippy if black goes here yeah right i saw that but what if i move my rook and counter freeze your knight are you gonna go here that doesn't even do anything wait wait sorry what yeah like what if i go here and then rook f1 i don't you can't move the knight so that didn't work right that didn't work because now now i'm gonna have a really solid king and i'm gonna be up two pieces i think but i i swear i calculated a win for black earlier i'll show it to you guys this is this game is oh it's utterly ridiculous this is i gotta i gotta drink some kefir i've been drinking some probiotics not sponsored by the way but yeah you know you all need probiotics and stuff so the thing is on the next move my opponent would love to do some damage to my position but they can't because they can't get to my king i think with a very safe king life is pretty good and now now my opponent's going to be down to bishop and the knight which is a significant material disadvantage in regular chess but i think in spell chess also i mean it's uh it could it could it could be very bad here um anyway they're thinking so i'm gonna sit around and uh tell you that uh oh if you're lucky enough to watch this video by the way september 6th through 8th uh my book is currently 25 off on pre-orders at barnes and noble i'll put a link in the description i forgot to mention that in the intro but rook takes now i'm up two pieces anyway um you can you can go check it out i don't remember if there's a code i think there is but i'll put that in the description you might have to use the code but you can pre-order the book for uh nice little discount um okay so i can't freeze yet all right i can't freeze yet let's go so my opponent wants to open up the rook that's their idea so let's close that down i'm not allowing my opponents rook into the game i think this is a very smart move because it prevents the opponent's rook from getting into the game at all actually technically they could go here but then i would take technically they could put a spell on that okay i think two pieces up is uh definitely significant my friends by the way speaking of the book you know like while i while i have you here 14 000 pre-orders book still drops in a very long time so i am i am humbled absolutely humbled thank you so so much um can't i go here and then freeze like what if i froze this area and then played knight takes knight this is not nice they can't move any of the three pieces that could potentially fight back they could play bishop takes but then i'm just gonna move my knight so i am now up three pieces that was a very very very mean move you have to be very careful in spell chess when you initiate exchanges because um if you can't take back and you have nothing better like if you don't have any threat with any other piece once you start running out of pieces it's gonna get really really bad right my knight can't move but i can defend it you see that's sort of the plus i have moves like queen a4 i also have moves like rook takes rook i can actually put a spell and then take but let's go oh let's threaten checkmate i'm threatening checkmate rook takes rook is checkmate crazy move oh my goodness i guess it's technically not because if you could take take and then freeze my bishop there is this kind of there is this kind of moment but um oh they just took my rook oh that's clever stuff i gotta be careful now i gotta be careful okay oh i don't like that i don't like how open my king is now oh man i really don't like this actually oh that got scary in a heartbeat okay but they're out of spells they're out of spells i could use this as a moment to go queen a4 because i'm not out of spells is a very big moment they're out of spells i could play queen here set up that one of these two moves probably has to be played i could take that looks a little dicey i think i'm just gonna take this for now so they give me a check if i block they use oh they can't they actually can't use a spell they cannot use a spell because they're out of them ah look at that um but yeah what if i just i mean i could just come back right because they don't actually have my opponent doesn't actually have a spell yeah they normally they would use a spell and win but they can't so now i save the piece look at that now they could take and then freeze my king but if they do that i counter freeze the queen so they could take i would then freeze their queen and then i would take it on the next move so it's actually very smart see i used that because i saw that they had no spells left genius um all right terrific so what if we went all right no i should still hide my king i'm gonna hide my king but now my opponent's gonna like do this for example which is super annoying i should have i don't maybe i should have gone there oh man ah this is scary oh if this easy i think i can and then freeze maybe no that's not gonna work this is this is stressful yeah this is probably one of these moves is probably good oh i don't like this i don't like this oh there it is all right king here the queen is gonna follow me yeah i think i might just have to like run to e1 but friends this is scary y'all i don't like this i don't like this he keeps pursuing me i'm gonna have to go to e1 that's the only way that is the only way or i'm gonna have to get my king some help i don't think i have anything else because the threat of the well they only have one more spell left they only have one more spell which is very good i i i'm still looking at captures here i'm winning but it's it's a very very stressful one oh yeah yeah this is a lot of ways to lose right there's they keep setting up this threat on me and i thought i could freeze but then they would counter freeze my knight so i would set up an attack threatening the queen but then they would just counter freeze my knight and then it would be my move and i would have to stop mate which i don't like but i like that i'm up two minutes because that's that's gonna definitely come in handy and once i get rolling like once my attack happens um but that's silly right because is that silly are they trying to oh oh wait a minute did i just wait oh my gosh i can't move anything and if i freeze the bishop is gonna come and take um i think i've lost because the bishop is going to come defend the queen wow i wasn't worried about this because i thought i could just free well i have to freeze right because then they're threatening this so i'm gonna go here wow that is wicked that's so insane and now they're gonna play bishop there and i can't take i have to play king here am i losing is it a draw it's gonna be like queen h1 am i still winning this was not a smart move i just sort of panicked probably should have like move my pawn so they're obviously going to play bishop here right and now now it's my move and i i only have one move otherwise i mean i i i can't yeah i'm in check does it even let me move other stuff okay i have to go here but if this i put a spell on my king and i take the queen so my opponent's best move is probably just take the bishop i panicked that was not smart of me huh if i go there can they go there okay i think we don't really have a choice queen a4 so they have they have a freeze so my opponent has to stop that but could play rook takes bishop and then freeze my queen but i think if they do that i can then freeze their queen so if my opponent doesn't get out of check goes here and freezes my queen i feel like i can play night here and then counter freeze their queen so that that's still check i have no idea and if they go here i can just put a spell oh this is a headache y'all i don't i did not mean for this game to go 20 minutes but it's definitely a banger of a game it is definitely a banger of a game this is crazy stuff then i got a minute which is good they got a minute i thought i was losing but i just realized i could spell my way out of that position okay that's exactly what i predicted would happen um now if i go here and and i and i freeze these two pieces i'm probably in good shape right so let me freeze cancel no oh i see i can freeze their pieces doink and then i'll go there all right so it's still check and i'm threatening the queen and the bishop can't move i have to be winning i have to be winning i have to be winning also because you cannot block the check because if you block the check i put a spell and then i win so you have to move your king that's actually black has to move the king and at that point i say okay once i get rid of the queen i'm i'm winning gotta be winning yeah knight h4 seals the deal freeze those two pieces you can't actually block the check uh and now now now now that's it and without the queen ain't nobody cooking gotham it's just not happening um now it's kind of easy i guess i'll i'll come here and give a check i just have to like not hang any pieces this is not capturable and uh my opponent only has one freeze left which is good for me and then i'm just gonna take all the pawns because that's how you win or i'll go for the rook i will go for the rook uh check i think my opponent's gonna go here and freeze my queen but then i'm gonna go oh well then i will just yeah you're not gonna beat me with just the rook this was fun this was a crazy crazy game this was a crazy game wow and i won so i think i lost the game i'd like to analyze something there was a moment here i think my opponent could have gone freeze here queen here right so the threat of that move is this this i cannot put a spell and do that that's exactly what happened to us in game two we're learning it was just my third game but i'm learning okay so the threat is this this i can't address that i can't address it unless i freeze the queen right so i might have to move my king which is awful i mean that that is so bad my idea was what if i go night what if i freeze like what if i freeze the queen right like this and then i go night here and i'm threatening the queen and i can't move i thought i was a genius but then there's bishop takes and my opponent is threatening that and that how do i stop that they are threatening to put a spell i could take the queen they put a spell they win i could take the bishop they put a spell they win so the only move here as far as i can see is to play king here but if i go here queen c4 is this game over because spell oh my god am i nuts the thing is there's no engines either so my opponent could have played queen h4 and i think i would have already had to move my king because if they had frozen this area of the board i actually cannot stop that wow which is why it's just important to keep yeah i i should have just kicked the bishop out first before i took the pawn wow anyway that's spell chess i'm gonna play some more off stream um off stream i'm not even streaming uh offline uh because i need to practice a little bit tomorrow september 7th uh if you watch this on september 6th tomorrow september 7th 2023 uh 2 p.m eastern time 11 a.m pacific time there's gonna be a
