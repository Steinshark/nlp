so you want to start coding but you feel 
as though every time you start coding or   learning how to code you quickly find yourself 
losing motivation if this sounds familiar you are   not alone as someone who has been there there are 
different ways to really not only figure out how   to start coding but most importantly how to keep 
up with it today i'm going to be sharing with   you how to start coding in 2022 but also more 
importantly is how to keep up with it before we   get into it though make sure to hit that subscribe 
button for more tech and coding related content   shout out to some of these subscribers here you 
all are amazing okay let's just dive right into it one of the most common questions i get asked is 
i want to start coding but a i don't know where   to start and b how do i keep up with it a lot of 
times we start something new we are really excited   only to have that model that initial motivation 
be lost as time goes on this is totally normal i   want to start by saying that that when you are 
learning something new you are so excited at   first and over time that initial excitement can 
wear off it doesn't mean that the passion for it   isn't still there it means you are human and we 
just need to figure out ways to continue with it   getting through the hard parts my first tip for 
you is to set a goal why are you learning to code   is it for a career switch is it to get your first 
job is it because you want to start your own   company really have an understanding of why you 
want to learn to code this is so important because   it really will impact what programming language 
you learn first for example if you have a goal   of making this incredible app that you want to 
start a business with and you have to really   step back and think okay i want to make an 
application maybe i should learn swift or   ios development if you are someone who is looking 
for a job or a career switch the first thing you   should do is go online and see in your area job 
postings and what languages are they requiring   granted you don't need to know all the languages 
or all the technologies often times that are on a   job posting but very quickly you will see a trend 
as to what programming languages or frameworks are   more in demand than others step number two is once 
you have figured out what programming language   you want to learn first and you have figured out 
your i guess step number one was two steps to it   step a and step b figure out your goals for coding 
and then also to pick a programming language   the next step is you need to dive right in 
essentially my biggest piece of advice if   you are starting with a programming language is to 
read the documentation i know this sounds boring   and oftentimes more than not for me anyways i 
never read the documentation when i first started   and it kicked me in the butt later on but i can't 
stress enough start by reading the documentation   for example if you are learning python they have 
some great documentation they also have some great   suggestions on tutorials you can start with same 
with for example react i know they have different   tutorials on their website different kind of 
how-to's but it just gives you a really great   full understanding of what the language entails 
it's definitely not the most exciting thing to   have to start with reading documentation but 
it is the most important once you've read the   documentation move on to starting a tutorial 
there this is i would say where a lot of people   get really excited because you're actually 
starting to code which is pretty exciting   but i also think this is the tutorial cycle is 
where a lot of people end up falling off maybe you   get stuck on the tutorial there seems to be no one 
to help you it can be very confusing and strange   area to learn in when you are learning from home 
through a tutorial but you don't really have any   support my biggest piece of advice is find a 
platform that you are learning on or a course   that offers support so for myself what i 
did was i would take different udemy courses   there is an instructor max maximilian i forget 
his last name but i'll put it up here who teaches   incredible courses and what i love about it 
too is he actually responds to questions so   if i get stuck somewhere on his tutorial i would 
ask a question and with 24 hours he would have   a response if he didn't have a response someone 
from the community would have a response for me so   i think it's so important too that although 
there are tons of great free tutorials online   ensure that you are doing one that has support 
around it and then of course once you've built   a tutorial start branching out and building 
your own projects don't try and build the next   facebook as your first project although it can 
be easy to or tempting to want to do but start   small and when you think of something small go 
even smaller because it's always bigger than you   think it's going to be when it comes to projects 
and that kind of brings me to how to keep up with   coding how do you you know you're learning you're 
growing but oftentimes maybe you just get in the   slump where you don't want to continue or you 
feel like i'm never going to get it it's never   going to click and my biggest piece of advice for 
you on this one is when you are feeling that way   step away from the computer contrary to popular 
belief you know you think this is when i should   be forcing myself to learn how to code no if 
you're not feeling it walk away i think that   applies to pretty much even in so many areas of 
our life it means that we are feeling tired and   burnt out and we need a break always listen to 
your body and just be kind to yourself because   it doesn't mean just because you're stepping 
back doesn't mean you're not going to   pursue coding or continue to learn no it just 
means that you're being human and you need a break   for myself really another tip that helped me keep 
up with learning how to code is to have a plan so   a plan from literal i'm going to start by learning 
html and css to i'm going to learn javascript   react then node express backend whatever it 
may be but when i had a plan and a timeline   to go along with that plan it really helped me 
accountable another piece of advice that really   helped me when i was learning to code is to have 
a tutor and although this isn't necessarily a   free resource so i understand maybe not everyone 
can go about it this way but if you are able to   hire even a computer science student or 
a recent grad or someone in the industry   to sit down with you once a week and go through 
a project that you are building it will do so   it's so valuable it will hold you accountable 
you can come with specific questions and you   will grow really fast or faster that's how i found 
anyways and i literally just googled different uh   computer science uh tutors in my area hired 
one for you know it was very affordable   and we met in a coffee shop once a week and 
honestly this really transformed my learning   and made me be accountable however if the tutor is 
out of a question i would say even just by having   a friend or family member that can hold 
you accountable even if they aren't in tech   can go a really long way by just talking to 
someone about where you are at in your learnings   the most important thing though is to remember 
to be kind to yourself i think a lot of us put   this crazy pressure on ourselves to have it all 
figured out when we are learning how to code   it can be very overwhelming there seems to be so 
much to learn once you accept that you will never   learn it all and that's okay even to get a job 
they don't expect you to know it all it really   takes off that unnecessary pressure thank you
