you may have seen my recent video on gpt engineer which is a software tool that you can give a prompt and then it creates a full working application as a software engineer that's not concerning at all but there's something way more dangerous lurking that nobody seems to be aware of gpt engineer is in essence a software as a service as a service do you know what that means the cuts out of the bag pandora's box has been opened elvis has left the building because now somebody maybe even knew is going to decide to create a software as a service as a service as a service which itself is again a software as a service ultimately we're going to end up with an infinite number of azure services an infinite number of assets so to speak and when that happens we reach a point in time that's also called the according to my prediction this is going to happen one year before the singularity because always win you could read all about it in my upcoming book yeah it's always new now let me know in the comments when do you think the will happen or even better post a formula that given an assets predicts what the year is going to be i advocate for a full stop on all software developments involving otherwise we're all doomed
