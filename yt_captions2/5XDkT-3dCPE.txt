it's time to say goodbye to your terminal because i found a better one what i'm about to show you might just revolutionize the way you use your computer check this out just programmers we love the terminal or hate it depending on who you are it doesn't really matter because if we want to be great programmers we sort of have to use the terminal the thing with the terminal that's default on your mac or your windows is that it sort of still looks like 1985. that is why i was so excited when i found out about warp what warpies is essentially a terminal that is completely reimagined and finally brought into the 21st century and in this video i'm gonna show you what you can do with war and why i think that this is the future of terminals on our computers in general the funny thing is i mentioned warp in one of my previous videos about programming tools and i got so many emails from my affiliate link from people signing up and this affiliate link wasn't paid or any i think but i think i get some like swag or whatever if enough people sign up but i was like well they should really be paying me for talk about this because i want to talk about this thing anyway so i reached out to them and they were kind enough to sponsor this video right here for me to talk about warp in more detail and about how i personally use it so first let's take a step back like why are we even using the terminal in the first place like for example on your computer if you want to let's say open your code editor in a specific folder what you'll often see programmers doing is simply doing it via the terminal and you might think well isn't it just easier to just like click buttons on the gui here and in a lot of cases it can be but with a lot of things with programming the things we're doing are sort of repetitive in nature and there's a lot of these common tasks that we want to be doing we're doing them by clicking on the graphical user intervention on computer actually is a lot less efficient then on the flip side when it comes to using the programs that we actually write as programmers it's easier to just run them using the terminal by writing a single command rather than having to write a graphical user interface for every single one of our programs but unless you're super comfortable with the terminal an immediate problem you can see all these commands are like not very intuitive like what is it that you use ls or like cd and what does dot refer to the current folder and this is a very big hurdle for a lot of people using the terminal and starting user terminal and so that is the first thing where warp comes in if i close up our 1989 old terminal and open up warp this is what opens up so straight away you can see that this window looks a lot more interesting than our previous terminal and you can start writing these same terminal commands down here you can see that things start happening so if you type tab ls so the way it's going to start suggesting things to you we go ls okay we're in here we can go cd and then it's straight away gonna suggest the path to navigate to based on what you've done before so it's actually intelligent and i can just click the right arrow and it's gonna straight away input all of this in here now let's say i don't want to go that we're going to go this i can just go cd and then using the arrows i can flick through the different options so different pre-filled options from where i might want to cd into and i can see that it's already giving me the suggestion of going into cd slash programming because there's a column path that i've navigated into before so i can just click enter and now i'm in the programming folder and the other benefit we can do is if you just go back to our previous terminal like let's say i write something in here and like i noticed i make some like typo in here at some point in my command i can't actually just like use my cursor and then like edit stuff in the middle of the command i have the first like navigate there with my arrow keys which is really clunky so the another great thing with warp is that you can actually edit your commands as if you're using a modern code editor so i've accidentally mistyped programming and i want to go in the mid in the middle in here and edit it i can just use it with my mouse as if i'm using a code edit to go and put an a in there and then use the command now the other problem we had with our previous terminal that ain't no one got time to remember and memorize all these random bar like cd so with warp what you can do is use ai to give you these commands the way you do that is you can simply type hash and it's going to open up this ai command search let's say i have no idea how to create a file using the terminal so i can just tell the ai to give the command to me so basically you no longer have to go on google and like find the commands and etc because you can just literally ask warp and it's going to give you them to you i'm also going to use the ai to show related commands just it's going to give me some commands it's going to explain what they do so let's say we have something like this let's say we're using this and you can no longer remember what this command command does first of all you could just ask the ai like i think it's a charge ebt based window that you're gonna open up here or you can just hover over the command and it's going to give you like documentation for this command and it's going to explain to you what it does in other extremely common and useful things that you can do with the terminal in general is what's called piping so what piping means is that you take multiple terminal commands and you essentially like pipe them together to essentially create these like mini scripts for like common tasks that you are doing on your terminal like for example let's say we are in this folder and we've got our test.txt file that i've added a couple of words to first of all what's interesting that actually only just noticed is that when you ls inside of warp you can actually hover over these and then click on it and it's going to tell you about using command or click you can actually open the folder just like this which is also just very useful for anyway that's beside the point we have this script that you can use we can use cat to essentially print the contents of a file so let's say we go test dot txd what you can then do is using that output so the output of this command you can use that as input to a different command which for example is something called vc which stands for word count and then you can use a model file called w to count the words of essentially this thing in here so the contents of this file when you do that you see three and if i just open up this test file by command clicking which again you cannot do with a normal terminal will be warp you can you can see that there's three words in here right now and so this piped set of commands in here is something that you might imagine is going to be useful for you down the line and you might want to remember it but hey now i got time to try to remember like oh wc and then modify dash w like you don't want to be using your brain power to try to remember of this random command so there's a couple of things that you can do with work to make this a lot easier for you first of all how warp works is based on these blocks so what a block is is a command and the output of that command so for example here we have the ls command and the output is all of these folders in here this is one block that you can click on and you can navigate through using just your arrow keys and you can go back and there's all the other stuff and etc etc and then you can do a lot of stuff with this block so you can go to the right hand side here first of all you can ask warby islands actually see what happens and yeah what should i do next you're going to give me some suggestions and blah blah blah then another thing we're going to do is bookmark this block to quickly scroll through and the way this works is i say in up here let's say this block right here super important i'm going to bookmark it and then let's say this is another really important block as we use the terminal there's a lot of different blocks you might want to quickly navigate through this bookmarked blocks and you can do that by holding option and then using the arrow key so using option arrow keys you can just navigate through these bookmarked blocks so you can quickly go back to a previous block that you want to use again but these bookmarks will only be saved as long as you are using this current session of the terminal so when you close warp they're going to go away so there's another way of making this even more persistent the way you do that is by going through these three dots and there's a lot of different options that will open up and there's like so many cool things that i can't even go through in this video in here what i want to show you here is this thing called create permalink by the way this works first of all it's going to create this thing where you can create and copy a link to this block that then anyone can go in their browse and so whenever you have some useful typed commands that you maybe want to share to your friend or to your team you can easily just do that by using these links but then for yourself the way this is going to be useful is that when you now inside of warp you go up to blocks and view shared blocks you can see all of your shared blocks that you have used before so you can essentially start building up your own library of terminal command so once you find something useful once you never again have to try to remember it again so on the topic of terminal scripts the last thing i want to show you is something called workflows first of all you can click on command p to open up this command palette and then you can type workflows and what these workflows are are essentially predefined piped commands or predefined commands that the team of warp have like sourced for you for you to just take and use and let's say we go into for example git which is going to be the next topic we talk about in a second there's a lot of these things that you can use without having to again like go on google and figure out how to use these and things like this they're sorted based on category etc so searching search committed files and there's so many of these things that you can do and you can also create your own workflows and save them again so the ross broad use case for the terminal that i want to talk about is using something called git so version control essentially so for example right now i'm working on a startup with a co-founder of mine for something like this it's very crucial that we have an easy tool to use to control our versions and the most common tool for this is something called a git and now git is the kind of thing that has a lot of different terminal command now with warp you don't again have to do this work of going to london you just for example go into these workflows and find a ton of different commands that you can use change username of git okay interesting this straight away is something that i wish i knew how to do easily and again if you can't find a predefined workflow of what you're doing you can simply type hash and then ask ai okay okay how do i commit my changes using git just like this and it's going to give you okay git commit blah blah blah blah blah and let's say i don't quite understand what some of these modifiers are doing okay what is this dash m so i can just ask you to explain how this works and it's going to explain it to me just like this and it's okay the m option is used to specify command message blah blah blah blah blah this is so incredibly useful that i personally will be using this going forward and you can go to their website and for example for collaboration they're coming up with a ton of other features as well so very soon you can actually look at documentation just inside of your terminal you will be able to share terminals within your team which is again something that i'm definitely going to find very useful when i work on my starter with my co-founder as i was editing this video they've actually just announced their series b funding alongside a lot of these team and collaboration features so they have an updated website now with a lot of these features already live so i thought i'd just update you on that and the last thing which is the absolute best thing about warp that you will not believe check this out then go on to one palette themes open theme picker boom you can make your terminal pink that's just like like if none of this other stuff makes you want to use warp then like this this is the thing you can make your terminal pink like can you believe it it takes a real man to use a pink terminal god damn it you can also do a bunch of other stuff you can set custom key bindings you can change the look of your terminal prompt you can change fonts you can like customize the look of your terminal so it actually also looks like 21st century rather than freaking 1980 so i highly recommend you check out warp i hope you got some value out of this in terms of to just make your terminal great again or rather like make it great for the first time because it was never really great was it but obviously just knowing how to use the terminal is not enough to be a great programmer and in 2023 there's certain things that you want to consider if you're a beginner learning the code and i go through all of these things like things that you absolutely should know if you want to have a chance of learning the code in 2033 in this video so i highly recommend you watch this video right after this one because this video and knowing how to use the terminal combined with all of the right thing is about learning the code it's going to absolutely make you stand out in this day and age thank you for warp for sponsoring this video and making this video possible and i'll see you in the next one
