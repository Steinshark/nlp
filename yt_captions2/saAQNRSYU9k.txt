hi everyone about a year ago i did a series on creating a path editor in unity and i've now worked on a little father to turn it into a tool that's hopefully useful to some of you so in this video i'm just going to walk through quickly how it works okay so you can download this path creature folder from a link in the description and once that's in your project you can just add a new object to the scene and add the path crater component to that and you'll see this little path i'm hearing in the scene view now these blue dots are the control points which allow you to define the sort of curvature of the path and then the red dots are the anchor points which are the points that the path actually passes through and you can add more of these at the points by just shift left clicking anywhere in the scene and if you shift left click over an existing segment and it will just insert a pointer over there you can also of course delete these anchor points which is done by ctrl-clicking over them or command clicking if you're on mac now if you have a look at the path options over here you'll see we're currently in 3d space so if i rotate the view porsche around you'll see that this path has depth and we can move these points around in 3d space and if you just left click on it once you'll get a little move tool so you can position it at all more precisely if you need now if you're working on a 2d project you'll probably prefer to have this in 2d space this will just lock it to the xy plane as you can see can't move this on the z axis so everything we do is locked like so you can also lock it to the xz plane which is useful i guess if you're working on a top-down game now over here we also have these different control modes so currently that's set to aligned and these just determine the behavior of the control points so you can see if i grab one control point and move it around the other one is rotating with it to make sure that the join at the anchor point is smooth now can change that to mirrored which is basically the same thing except that the distance between the anchor point and the two control points is always constant or we can have it free which allows you to create these sharp corners or you can set it to automatic and here the control points disappear and you can just move the anchor points around and a cisco to automatically place the control points to try and make the path nice and smooth in this mode there is this control spacing slider which allows you to just adjust the look of the path a little bit now the next option here is closed path so this just allows you to toggle between a closed or open path and then you can also enable transforms which will just show this little move tool you can move the path around or if you select the rotate tool appear you can rotate the path and if you instead have the scale tool selected surprise surprise this will scale the path ok now i'll get to these remaining options in a little bit but i first want to show how you can get an object moving along this path so i'm going to create a new seat up script which i will call follower and then i'll open that up so first of all to get access to all of this path creation stuff getting to use the path creation namespace then you can have a public path creator which i'll call path creator and then let's have a public float speed for how fast the object is going to move along the path and i'll have a float distance traveled all right now in the update method we can say that distance traveled gets increased by the speed multiplied by time delta time each frame i'll then set the position of the object equal to path greater dot path dot get point at distance and pass in the distance traveled i'll then save this and go into unity and once this is finished compiling can go and add in some sort of object i'll just add in a cube and this is kind of big compared to the path so i'll just scale that down a bit and here i'm going to add the follower component so i need to drag in the path crater let me just name this in the scene here so it's nice path creator alright so if i now enter play mode we should see the cube moving along the path and i can of course increase the speed decrease the speed whatever now it's currently not rotating as it goes along the path so i can open to the script to change that i'll just say transform dot rotation is equal to path created a path dot get rotation at distance and once again us in the distance traveled safe then get back into unity and to play mode and in a moment when that finishes compiling you can see the object is now rotating along the path as well all right now to make this a little more interesting i'll go out of play mode and i'm just going to change the path to a 3d path so that i can just move some of these points up and down just get something a little cooler looking and now say i want the object not just to rotate along the path but to actually tilt as it goes around some of the bends so to control this i mean to open the normals options and when that section is open you can see the normals drawn in here along the path and so in this case of the object following the path these normals represent what the up direction is for the object at each point along the path so i want to rotate all of these that they were facing roughly upwards and then around some of the corners i want to manually edit them so that they're sort of facing a little inwards so i'll just click on this point for example i'm just going to move the viewport over here so we can see a little better and i'll go into rotate mode and when the normals are open you now get this tool to just adjust the normals how we like them so i can come here and make some adjustments wherever i want maybe i'll adjust here as well and just so we can see this a little better in the demonstration i'll do something weird like turn these around and now let's give that a go so i'll press play and you can see the object turning and twisting to match the normals there okay so that's how you can get an object moving along the path i don't need this object anymore though so i'm just going to delete that and also hide the normals now the next thing i want to talk about is a bit of a technical detail but when the path needs to be used like when we want to have an object moving along it it's converted from a bezier path to a vertex path and you can see this is just a bunch of points placed along the path and for the most part you can just leave this at its default settings you don't really need to go into this tab but if whatever reason you want to a decrease or increase the accuracy of the vertex path this is where you can do that all right going back into the bezier path tab i'm just going to reset this path to start afresh and i want to go over a few of the display options so first of all we can show the path bounds so if i just move this out you can see it's just that i can also show these segment bounds and address that looks the same but if i add in some new segments you can see we can see the bounding box for each of those and i find this can just be helpful if you're working in 3d space to get a better idea of the natural shape of the path all right apart from that i can also show or hide the anchor points and control points and you can choose whether or not you want the handles to have a constant size so if this is on in c this will all be the same size regardless of how fires in or out in these in these are display options only affect the current path crater that we have here but in the global display settings you can change things that will affect all of the path craters that you have so these are things like the shape of the anchors and controls and all of the colors as well so if you don't like a certain color you and just go ahead and change that okay that's pretty much all there is to it there are some other things you can do like generating a path from script but you can read about that in the documentation at the very last thing i'd like to demo is just this little road crater component i have i'm just going to reset the path here and add a road mesh crater alright so you can see i've got a bit of rodia i'm just going to turn this into a top-down path so that i can quickly add in some points here i'll set this to automatic perhaps for the moment and close the path all right and i want to add some height so i'm just going to set this to 3d space you can drag this up for example and if i go into the normals options and i'm in rotate mode i can then change the normal to adjust the angle of the road and i'll do that here as well in the road mesh settings here we can also change the thickness of the road as well as the width and if i come down to the texture tiling we can set how many times the text should be titled and so i can get more of these lines here now obviously this is pretty simple as far as road craters go but i thought this would be a nice little starting point all right that's all i have to show in this video the project is open source on github so you can just download it from there you can modify it however you want and hopefully you'll find it helpful thanks for watching cheers
