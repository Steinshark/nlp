i don't know what's worse being the sort of madman who specializes in voiding your customers warranties or enabling his reckless behavior the way that noctua has done here this small plastic spacer kit for their iconic brown coolers is not only 100 trust me bro guaranteed to get your rma rejected by amd but it also increases the chance that something will go wrong i mean who in their right mind would take a cooler this size and bolt it directly to the fragile dies that live under amd's protective heat spreader 20 20 degrees 20 degrees look that's impossible impossible to explain until i finish this segue to our sponsor mexico whether you're in need of webcams or accessories for your vr device mexico has a great selection of products to choose from you can learn more about them at the link in the video description [music] if it was anyone else i'm not even sure if i would believe this but after noctua explained it the whole thing kind of makes sense and it starts with the creatively named noctua nm amv15 offset am5 mounting bars you see the thing is when amd designed their am5 cpus they put the i o die in the middle and they put the actual compute dies the ccds down at the bottom of the ihs this puts the hot spots of ryzen 7000 cpus in a very unconventional place and you can see in noctua's illustration here how this hurts the performance of a typical cooler by having the hot spot down here you can see we are over utilizing the heat pipes on this side and under utilizing the ones over here that's where the offset bar comes into play watch this by simply shifting the mounting mechanism seven millimeters downward knock to assess they can drop the temperature on your cpu by up to three degrees this is because of two effects first it concentrates the pressure over those heat generating dies improving thermal transfer and second it means more effective heat distribution throughout the base of the cooler so you're making better use of all of your heat pipes rather than over saturating some and under utilizing others these results are really impressive and reinforce what we found in water cooling through the ages where we saw that from generation to generation the performance improvements were less about actually just building a better water block and more about tuning the water block better for modern processors so while ryzen 3000 and 5000 can benefit from this offset mount it's not to the same degree pun intended as ryzen 7000 because those ones have much thinner ihs's we'll be talking about that in a second in typical noctua fashion it'll be available affordably for all their desktop class coolers going back to 2005. but linus you might say up to three degrees is not almost 20 degrees what's the deal with the rest of that that is where this comes in these small plastic spacers allow noctua coolers to be mounted to d-litted cpus and they're the result of a collaboration with their bauer i mean it looks like the simplest thing in the world a little piece of plastic how could that drop you 15 degrees except the devil's in the details look how thick this is ah so i haven't played around with delighted ryzen 7000 yet but it seems that to maintain cooler compatibility with the lower profile lga socket compared to their last generation pin cpus amd made the ihs much thicker which is contributing to some of the thermal challenges that users are seeing the solution well if you hate having a warranty you can do this step one get your hands on a d-litted ryzen 7000 series processor given they developed the products collaboratively noctua recommends the one from roman sold under the thermal grizzly brand they've been doing a lot of that collab sort of stuff lately step two install a direct die mounting frame like this one again from thermal grizzly this isn't strictly necessary but it dramatically reduces the risk of accidentally cracking one of these delicate dies as you're tightening down your cooler i wouldn't even consider mounting a cooler direct eye these days without one of these frames next you're going to need some liquid metal thermal compound okay you don't actually need it but the issue is that the benefit of this modification with traditional thermal paste is very low only about two to four degrees this is because even though amd's ihs is too thick at least it's soldered so it's pretty fast at moving heat from the hottest parts of the dyes i mean it's right in the name right it's a heat spreader so if we use a traditional thermal compound right on these dies it can be somewhat overwhelmed by the concentration of these hot spots heat flux density is the term that noctua used but for all but the most technical of our viewers that's unlikely to mean anything so finally you'll need knock to his offset mount that i showed you guys before okay you don't need it but if you're going to avoid your warranty why settle for 10 to 17 degrees of improvement when you can have anywhere from 12 to 19. that is the cumulative benefit of all of these little changes though now that your warranty is void there are a couple of more things to consider die cracking that's less of a concern thanks to the contact frame but liquid metal on any one of these little surface mount components would be a big problem so i would suggest some nail polish or conformal coating or some protective covering for the ones that aren't already covered and here's the coolest part noctua isn't even forcing you to buy this spacer if you get your direct eye contact frame and all this stuff from other companies they will make literally nothing providing you the stl files of these spacers on printables.com but they're doing it anyway then all you need to do is source slightly longer screws and they're going to have the information about which screws you'll need on the printables page again this works with the vast majority of knoxville coolers since 2005 and is launching at the end of july but that doesn't mean that all cooling innovation is down to changing the position and avoiding your cpu warranty meet the next gen nhd15 it's got a whopping eight heat pipes now compared to six on the original and that's just the beginning the heat pipes are optimized for better performance you know optimizing wall thickness wick structure all that kind of stuff but the big one is this fan it's finally here after what is this eight long years of product development their new 140 millimeter fan and thanks to its incredible performance giving it up to three degrees better performance compared to their old one on a radiator they were able to increase the surface area of the fin stack here by 20 meaning that this should be good for anywhere in the neighborhood of about three to four degrees of improvement over the already legendary nhd 15. now of course that's on a 300 watt heat load so you better be running an intel cpu got him which is why noctua actually doesn't recommend buying this if you have a 65 watt cpu what they would recommend is that i do this segue to our sponsor thanks to switchpod for sponsoring this video are you a video creator looking to upgrade your on-the-go or
