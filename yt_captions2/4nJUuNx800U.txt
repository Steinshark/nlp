- it's rog rig reboot 2021, this time featuring an actual child. - yes. - you claimed to have
been watching my videos for five years, but i don't believe you. you would have been in
the womb at that point. of age or not, tucker's gonna
be building his very third, fourth pc? my expectations are extremely high. - what should i be doing with my hands? (upbeat electronic music) my current setup right now is an old dell. it's running an i5-8400, i believe, and a 1050 ti. it crashes and turns off and on randomly, sometimes crashes multiple
times in the same hour. i could have it be running a game that's too hard for it and i'll crash, or i could have a word
document open and it crashes. for my build, i'm hoping for something that's gonna help me do my projects and run everything i need it to do well. - do you want to see it? - yes. - then go ahead and pull it off. oh, like you mean it, tucker. - i tried. okay. - oh, dude. so you're a bit of an electronics wiz kid is my understanding. - oh yeah. i built an arcade machine. i built an electric skateboard that can go around 30 kilometers an hour. and i've been trying
to build a spot welder, but it's been going a
little rough. (chuckles) it exploded. (cameramen laugh) - i really appreciated
your application video where you actually soldered
the composite video input on one of those old clamshell dvd players so you could use it as a monitor. - my first idea was to
build a breadboard computer with little microprocessors, but i had an old laptop. and the screen was destroyed, so i got an old dvd player, and i managed to hack a
composite video signal into it. - so you could show it to me right now. - it's not here. - what is here is your brand new machine. do you recognize any of this stuff? what do we got here? - [tucker] that is expensive. - we've got your cpu right here, we've got your graphics
card, we've got your ssds. - yes, ssds.
- look at this. there's so many of them. i'm not gonna get away with
any of this with you, am i? - no. - all right, prove it. what do you start with? this one. really, the monitor? - oh, what? - it says proart on it right here. - wait, am i wrong? - now, tucker's not as
much of a hardcore gamer as even some of our previous contestants, perhaps 'cause his computer's
not really up to it, but he is an aspiring creative. so you do some video
editing. is that right? - yes. - what else do you get up to? - 3d modeling, and cad, and gaming. - you know, i do some modeling myself. (air whooshes) - i need a cpu. - you do. - i do. - if you find it, you can have it. - okay. i actually don't see it. and that's not it. it's not here. - oh man, this computer
isn't gonna work very well, tucker, because i'm taking away, oh. - [david] oh. (laughs) - that is a large cpu box. - that is a fast cpu. we're gonna be equipping proart z690 with intel's 12th gen alder lake 12900k. that's right, my friends,
eight performance cores, eight slightly less
performance cores, 24 threads. - this is like a piece of
architecture, this box. - it's kind of like computer porn. it's just computer porn, though, dad. it's not like, the other kind. the only weird thing is we're
all looking at it together. - this thing looks really cool. i'm gonna try to do this
without breaking anything. - [david] i think you've got this. - i'm not exactly sure
how to get it in there. and now i think i need to push this down, and then do this. oh. - whoa. - was that supposed to happen? - i don't know. depends. how much of a working
computer do you want, tucker? - okay, should i keep pushing this? - asus asked me to
mention a couple of things about this board, like its 16 plus one-phase power delivery, quadruple gen 4.0 m.2 drive support, and, of course, support for pcie gen 5.0 in the 16x slot up here, not to mention its ample io. we got 10-gig and 2.5-gig lan, dual thunderbolt ports, including
dual displayport inputs. so that means that you can actually take your dedicated graphics card, which is gonna be a pretty fast one, and you can inject displayport
into your thunderbolt output so you're not stuck with
onboard video for those. what the bananas? all of the usb ports are 10-gig ports. - [david] wow. - [linus] dang, this thing has everything. - didn't pcie gen 4.0 just come out, and now it's on 5.0? - now we're on 5.0. - interesting. - oh, terrible.
- oh no. - [linus] tucker. - i did it. - tucker, you really tucked that one up. - i think it's either
the memory or the cooler. - i actually probably wouldn't
install the cooler right now. that's a genuine tech tip. - would you know about being cool? - um. so you got some pretty nice memory.
- is four of them? - 16 gigs. so that is a total of 64 gigs of ddr5. - one of these sticks is
significantly more impressive than what's in my current computer. - [linus] literal garbage pc. - oh, it's like creaking. i
don't want to press too hard. (laughs) it's like creaking. i think i got it. - i think you got it too. so at that point, if i
say, "i believe in you," am i my saying i believe
that you won't fail, or i believe that you will? - i don't know. you're throwing my stickers. i need those. - oh, oh, it's awful. the entire community is so sad right now. - [tucker] yes. - you know what? i'm
just gonna double check. 'kay. yep, go for it. - you push on everything so hard. it definitely sounds like it's breaking. - you want me to show you broken? what's next? - i think i want to put the
motherboard into the case. - i want. you know, there's a little movie called "willy wonka & the chocolate factory." - i don't think putting
this in is gonna kill me. - you're gonna wanna put
your storage on first. - i'm used to a sata drive, so you don't put them on the motherboard. - we do have one of those. - [tucker] okay. - we have everything.
that's rog rig reboot. there's not even that much
rog going on in this one. what the heck? we got a proart motherboard, we've got a- - i need a screwdriver. - tuf. - lttstore.com? - yeah, it's the new ltt one.
- yeah. - it's a prototype. it's not quite right. all right, ignore that. there you go. so you put it that way. then you use this whenever
you don't need a ton of force. yeah. there you go.
- i know how screwdrivers work. - [linus] do you? - no. oh, i got it. i did it. i'm smart. - that's a lie.
- 'kay, now i gotta screw it. - you're not done yet. - i'm working on it, okay? - no, you're not working on anything. tucker, put that away. watch this. toolless. - oh.
- boom. - i don't even need the screws. - whoa, right? i bet you can do it one
hand. look at him and go. - i'm a professional. - p5 plus one-terabyte ssd installed. look at this kid showing off with his soldering skills. forgets to take the sticker off.
- wait. - do you like stickers
on your case, tucker? - i do. - here you go. enjoy. - oh, that is awful. - boom. we're gonna put all those
stickers on your case, tucker. well, this is great. - now i want to put this in there. - you know what i want to do? i want to take off these peels before they're hard to get it. - [tucker] i wanna do it. - too late. you started this. - okay. - you have no one to blame, but yourself. oh yeah. oh. wait, what? - this is a. very large case. - this is a mid tower. you're just a very small, young boy. - okay. (chuckles) oh, this is heavy. - yeah, i don't know it's that heavy. - is this one of the cases where you can just put this in? - mm-hmm. i mean, i would probably
get your mounting hardware somewhat ready first. i mean, you can-
- no, i don't think that matters. - okay, that is not on, though. let me at least help you. - okay. - okay. there.
- thank you. wonderful. these are
organized really nice. - yeah. phanteks does a great job of that. now, you mentioned that
you don't watch tiktok. i thought that's like your
whole generation's jam. - why would i watch tiktok when i can watch you build computers? - [david] you can't get a
second computer, tucker. - this is solid. - it is. it is a solid. it is neither a liquid nor
a gaseous power supply. - you just put the box
away. don't need the cables? - you don't because chase is going to get fancy cables.
- oh, right. - unless they're not here. in which case, yeah, we'll go get them. - i was trying to beat
your scoresaber score. - there's no way you're gonna
beat me in "beat saber." - i'm like within 100
ranks of you in canada, but i can't get any higher 'cause the computer, it doesn't do the do. - what do you think? has
tucker got what it takes? can he challenge these wrists? good luck, tucker. - keep in mind, i have not
used these controllers before. - uh-huh. (frantic electronic music) (controller thuds)
- oh. - oh, he hit the table. - yeah, we should probably, yeah, i think that's a
mulligan right there. (frantic electronic music) this is a really intense map. well, let's see if i can
get through this thing. i actually don't think i can. (frantic electronic music) all right. you still got a
bit to learn, grasshopper. - okay. i think i gave it my best shot, but i didn't really think i had any chance of beating linus at "beat saber." - get wrecked. what, you thought i was
gonna high five you? nobody high fives anymore.
- i know. - [david] no, they do! - what would you like to do? - i saw another ssd. i think i'm gonna try to put it in. - four terabytes. - i thought ssds this size
only went up to two terabytes. - no. i think we have like a
30-terabyte one coming in for our petabyte of flash
project that is coming up. get subscribed. you don't actually have to
do that, what you're doing. - i don't? - [linus] nope. - [tucker] oh, that's nice. - zero tools. - [david] then why are you here, linus? - ay. - all right, just two of these
screws has got to be lots. - unlike your current storage situation, this has no moving parts and, therefore. have you ever experienced high-resolution, high refresh rate gaming? - yes. - you were at ltx. - yeah. - so you actually know
how to build a computer because our expo taught you how. - yeah.
- the system works. - [tucker] it does work. - let's have a look at the cables that you'll be plugging into it. you ready? they match your hoodie. - [david] ooh. - this is for the motherboard, right? oh, it's flipping over. - [david] don't screw it up. - oh, i'm. - would you like some light? look at me being helpful
during an rog rig reboot? - [david] he must like you or something. - he's a kindred spirit. - i'm not different than you. - i said kindred spirit, did i not? now we've got all of this
stuff dealt with in here. let's get this radiator mounted here. - here.
- oh. where are your fans at, tucker? there. ow. oh crap. now this is a really cool aio cooler. not only does it have a screen on it, it comes with some of the
finest fans on the market, the nf-f12 industrialppc 2,000 rpm. so what's the first game
you're gonna play on this rig? - [tucker] definitely "half life: alyx." - have you tried to play
it on your current rig? the frame rate is not
good for motion sickness. - that makes sense. on a 1050, that would not
be a great experience. how close did you get to upchucking? you know what, tucker? i think this might be the
fastest rog rig reboot build that we've done yet. but can you stop that? - i wanna plug it in. - what about, tucker, what i want? what did you do with the rest of my pci express cables here? - they're up. - oh. rtx 3080, 10 gigs ram. you will not be doing any mining, as much as he might be a minor. - ah.
- yeah. - i'm gonna drop this. - you know how hard these
are to get? my precious. - this is massive. botch this peel. - yeah, you botched all that was well. that happened really fast. - [tucker] oh my gosh. - i thought you were a nice
kid, not a brutal monster. - i don't think anything you're
saying is at all relevant. - what are you doing, tucker? - [david] taking this out. - do you need a
screwdriver? i do have one. - no. - you got a bit of a
compatibility crisscross, so you've got to make sure that you put it in at just the right angle. - [david] what? - [linus] i mean, that's not
how i would have done it. now they're gonna cross. - [tucker] oh, i'm not doing that, then. - you don't want to cross your streams, wire streams.
- i feel like that was a reference,
but i don't understand. - you need to use the sarah
butt patented technique. so we're just gonna kinda- - it's awful. oh my.
- we'll kind of give it- - ah. oh.
- kind of bend it a little. - when he was reefing
on the graphics card, it did not look good. - no.
- yeah, it should be fine. okay. there you go. - i found more stickers. - oh, excellent. okay. - i'm putting it here. - nice. who needs airflow anyway? steve from gamers nexus dislikes this. - [tucker] that is awful. - oh, nice. good find. whoa, magnets. not my finest cable management ever, but it's what you're getting. oh, i scratched it. i'm gonna take 5% off the price of the computer for you, okay? - that really helps. - do you want to power
it on? do the honors? - yeah. - let's do it. oh, we didn't even talk
about your monitor yet. 1440p proart. so super color accurate. still 75 hz, though. so it's like that fine line between like, you know, creation-ready
monitor, but also gaming capable. how's that display looking, by the way? - [tucker] yeah, that's higher
resolution than a dvd player. - that is probably true,
actually. like 480i. - yeah.
- i think it actually is true. - all right, what do you think? is it gonna fire up for us, though? who plugged in an htmi cable? (sighs) this is what happens-
- linus. - when you let chase run the cables. - i told him displayport.
he didn't listen. - [david] oh, you got called out. - i want to catch it no look. really? oh my. well, that's a bad sign. it just powered off like that. - maybe it's from your
reefing on the graphics card. - maybe it's not a very attractive quality to play the blame game. okay, i do actually need
this to power on, though. - oh.
- yay! whoo. ah, yes, the big moment. cover your eyes. and there it is. - that is incredible. that's the most beautiful
computer i've ever seen. - i will always be watching you. we didn't even attempt to put
it in the center or anything. it's just there. you can't even see your
screen on your cpu cooler. i mean, who needs that anyway, right? go for it. do something. compute. (gun blasts) all right, show us how it's done. - i actually don't play
racing games either. i'm doing it. i'm driving. - yeah, you are. i mean. (energetic music) whee! it's good-looking, though, ay? - [tucker] yeah, it looks really good. - extreme preset baby. oh boy. - and i'm crashing.
- that's rough. but that's okay because you
are ahead of everyone else who submitted an entry for rog rig reboot. if you enjoyed this video, maybe check out one of our
previous rog rig reboots. and this is it. this is
where you say, "hi, mom." - hi, mom. thanks to ltt and asus
rog for the new rig.
