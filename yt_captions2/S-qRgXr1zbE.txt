ladies and gentlemen i am super excited to welcome you back to the chess world cup here in 2023 it is the round of 16 beginning today in the open section and it is the quarter final beginning on the women's section magnus carlson today was in vintage form straight sets spectacular chests from start to finish incredible decision making and he played a long time rival we're going to talk about that we're also going to talk about the continuing rise of indian chess they are breaking records every single day and it looks like mathematically it is all but likely that there will be at least one indian chess player in the candidates tournament of 2020 for the tournament that determines who plays for the world chess championship as the challenger my friends seven games today i've got for you here we go i'm gonna try to move as fast as possible magnus carlson kicking us off as always plays pawn to d4 against vasilovontic evancho over 50 years of age and also almost didn't play in this tournament because he is from ukraine and right now they're trying to keep as many people around as possible for obvious and unfortunate reasons uh but the players including magnus carlson submitted a petition to get evancho to come play and he does come play and they have a rivalry a historic rivalry with magnus this game be begins with a strange move order knight f3 on the second move e6 from ivanchuk is the move chosen and magnus plays a catalan uh the catalan is one of the most complex deep fascinating positional openings that exist and it is magnus carlson's secret weapon his win rate with it is absolutely ridiculous essentially white is happy to give up this pawn to get activity with this bishop we'll put the knight in the center and let's go from there evancho gives a check on b4 alright he plays bishop to b4 check this is one of the trendy lines inducing white to block and then going back to e7 now you may ask why doesn't black just go there they can but that that you know the the way you play it is you induce the fact that white has made this move and now probably has to move the bishop again so that it is not in the way of everything magnus plays bishop g2 and now evancho plays c6 he doesn't castle he plays the move pawn to c6 and magnus plays queen c2 okay and the idea of queen to c2 is to guard this pawn preemptively and delay castleing for a moment so knight bd7 ivankuk also not castling we have a little dance here now magnus does in fact move the bishop this knight could go here or here both sides not castling it's it's a it's a standoff and uh evanchuk finally decides to castle and magnus carlson does not castle plays the move h4 it seems like basically in every position nowadays you could play the move h4 h4 is a multi-faceted move first of all you are trying to potentially create an attack on black second of all uh you're just taking a bit of space your knight could always reroute you can always fight behind the pawn and also h5 is a massive overstep by black because it gives the g5 square to white which is very important as you try to launch this attack so h4 now ivankuk takes on c4 you'll notice if unchook is actually playing quite quickly he he is not thinking much he goes here and he plants his knight in the center of the board hitting magnus's bishop and magnus already thinking quite a lot and evanchook not afraid of magnus's pawn to h4 magnus plays bishop to g5 spends' minutes on that move magnus could have also brought the bishop again back to d2 but that's just terrible and uh you really don't want to do this i mean there's no need to damage the structure like this so magnus players bishop g5 and now vancou says all right you want to take my bishop take my bishop go ahead h6 ivanchuk still isn't thinking every move is coming instantly he's got a 27 minute lead magnus takes and now plays this move e4 now evancho can go there to attack the knight the queen he could go there to attack the center he could go there which is ugly but maybe and and evancho thinks no he doesn't he doesn't think ivankuk once again his 13th move now he hasn't thought hasn't spent any time at all and black's entire idea here is going to be to create counter play with the move e5 so magnus plays queen c3 ivanka plays e5 finally 10 minutes of thought that was the idea uh and the point is essentially as follows if white takes on e5 knight a4 comes and it's not easy to keep the spawn protected you play queen to d4 i go here you try to remove one of my knights let's say b3 rook d8 93 check you're gonna lose so e5 is a very dangerous move and for that reason magnus castles and you'll notice another 10 minutes have disappeared off the clock of magnus but he's still fine and the position is balanced e takes d4 queen takes d4 and now we want to place knight c5 attacking this pawn and this is the final piece of the puzzle if magnus plays a move like rookie one black will play rook to d8 queen will go here bishop will come to g4 black will double on the d file black will be better black just has an advantage black has more development and a target so knight c5 and what is magnus going to do now well it's gonna play a brilliant move magnus plays rook c1 he barely even thought about that move knight c5 rook c1 and at this moment everything changed the knight is hanging but the pawn was hanging but the point is if you take i will now go here i have induced you into taking my pawn magna said oh you want my pawn so bad so take it then you have to play defense then i will play offense then you will maybe counter-attack the queen i'm gonna play queen e3 i'm gonna apply pressure let's say you like develop bishop d7 i can take i can also play knight d2 i can wait i can wait and when i'm ready that's when i'll take and then i'm gonna have a three on two and i'm gonna maybe go here and there right and there and then my bishop and my queen are gonna put diagonal pressure and and that is the kind of catalan pressure right so rook c1 played yvonne chuck thinks for a bit plays knight a6 spends 14 minutes and retreats and now for the first time in this game evanchook is down on time yeah and he just retreated evancho had his moment confident chess up 30 minutes threatening magnus magnus said so do it then oh you wanna fight oh you want you wanna you wanna fight let's go let's fight what you gonna do and ivankuk said you know what you're right magnus said okay great i'm gonna develop my knight developed his bishop position is still equal but now bishop f1 evancho plays rook d8 magnus plays queen e3 and now magnus has done as much as he can with this rectangle now it's time to utilize the two things that have not yet been utilized a4 very interesting move ivanchok anticipating a5 and he can't play it himself because he hangs the knight plays knight c8 a little bit passive magnus takes a little bit more space suddenly suddenly time is ticking magnus is making maximum improvements this is typical magnus chess now a6 is possible maybe knight d6 knight b5 to take this evanchook thinks and takes on f3 decides i want to give this up to relinquish some of the pressure and then i'm going to play a6 and create a blockade bishop takes knight magnus takes evancho plays a6 so now magnus can't make any pawn progress and evancho is going to go knight d6 knight b5 now magnus realizes something rook a4 k4 is a fascinating move the idea of rook to a4 is that there was no other way to activate that rook you didn't really want to sidestep this way so we play rook a4 to team up with any of the pieces or on the open file as we please and and this is possible so the rook can come help and attack for instance something like rook to g4 what that was magnus's idea when he played in this position a4 magnus had foreseen that he's not just taking space on the queen side he's also making his opponent play passively and now rook a4 and there is an opportunity to rotate and attack because black has no pieces defending the king just pawns magnus has a bishop so that light score is weak but these squares could all be weak rook a4 e5 is unbelievable coordination pancho plays rookie 8. magnus opens the door opens the door here comes the rook to play defense or offense any way you want it rook g4 queen takes h6 is going to be on the way ifancha plays knight to d5 magnus rotates over to the queen side we can pressure the king we can pressure in the center we can also pressure the queen side now evancho dances out with the knight to a7 magnus plays bishop to d3 the idea of bishop d3 the idea of all of this was to bring the bishop this way the catalan bishop rotating around getting a new job in the same company and a higher pay bonus that is the idea and the knight cannot go there which means black is gonna have to play pawn to g6 which is going to run directly into h5 a move that was played unlike move nine everything in white's position works perfectly together bishop d3 now ivankuk in this position had to respect bishop to b1 my friends would you like to know something insane about this position on low depth the computer still thinks this is about equal on a high depth it's plus two and a half low depth stockfish which is not smart enough to to to run at such a high capacity on my on my browser here doesn't realize this is winning position for white it's a completely winning position everything magnus did from rook a4 to e5 to rotating the bishop everything he did was too sophisticated for this level of stockfish to even understand the deeper more powerful supercomputer realized he was doing all the right things and now evanchuk said i gotta play h5 i gotta play h5 because i'm gonna have to play g6 and i can't allow him to play h5 now magnus plays rookie one the rook has done its job now it's stronghold on the center magnus plays queen to c2 threatening a mate on h7 pawn to g6 now we create a threat that way the best move in this position was g4 but and and with the idea of absolutely bulldozing like this i think probably magnus didn't like something with the knight jumping into the middle potentially but it's still winning bishop 282 creates a threat on the pin queen g6 so black has to do this now magnus puts the knight on g5 from the very beginning from the very beginning i told y'all pawn to h4 because in many lines black is going to play h5 and my friends 20 moves later seeing the attack was on the way of unchuk played h5 and magnus played knight g5 justifying the move h4 do you understand how incredible this is rook f8 playing defense now the e pawn is the juggernaut supported by the knight the rook and the bishop from a distance f6 and now we have just pried the king's defenses away h5 f6 that's a soft spot bishop back to b1 the bishop moved to be won a few moves ago now it moves to a2 then it goes back to b1 as we've made another weakness incredible play magnus utilizing everybody everybody in magnus's position working together on all sides of the board f5 yet another weakness created now we go to exploit the dark squares in the position rook to d5 the bishop comes back to hit rook c5 queen e3 knight d5 and the dance ends as magnus plays b4 and the rook is just trapped ivanchuk is going to have to lose some material he loses a pawn in the center he tries to create a little bit of counter play but now two pawns down he just resigns he resigns in this position why does he resign simple and straightforward the threat rook a2 rook d2 rook d7 black is helpless black wants to play knight d6 to hit the queen but if they do that queen d4 check so black plays king to g8 knight f7 stops knight d6 rook a2 rook d2 rook d7 and push you you can't you can't take on h4 because knight h6 jack also e7 magnus carlson wins the game without a single inaccuracy not an inaccuracy chess.com evaluated him at 3600 elo in this game not even a brilliant move no brilliances didn't do anything brilliant just played a catalan to the to the center sacrificed the pawn to push his opponent backwards coordinated his army with moves like rook to a4 and e5 undeveloped his catalan bishop to be one my friends every pawn in magnus's position compliments the bishop six dark squared pawns fighting on the dark squared complex while the light squared bishop from a distance snipes the territory of black's king weakening the pawns forcing black to push all the pawns forward forcing black spawns to move forward and magnus wins a perfect game and sets himself up for a fantastic quarter-final against none other and potentially ukesh and the winner of wang hao vs gukesh wang hao chinese grandmaster legend of the game playing dukesh who is trying to get to number seven in the world he's already the top 10 the number one in india this game got to this position after 11 moves a very balanced queen's gambit decline this is called the hanging pawn structure c and d versus e and b white tries to blockade tries to trade pieces and black is going to try to create dynamic play giving up the bishop for the knight to give a weakness centralizing the knight playing c5 wang hao strikes back queenie queen to a3 take take we have a queen trade very complex middle game but it's wang hao who's calling the shots now we move to a more drawish position e4 c4 nobody can probably win this game but the pawn marches to c3 and gukash is knocking on the door and a couple moves later he's really knocking f5 he's not going for a draw knight to e6 rook to d7 avoiding a trait of rooks breaking open the center and here comes his rook and wang hao was trying too hard i think to just calm the position down left himself with one minute on the clock swarmed h3 take take and the pawn was the hero rook c1 check knight takes f2 and wang hao resigned as he lost his bishop the pawn was promoting and he could have played on here but it's a completely lost end game in fact this is even better you induce the king into the fork ukash defeats wang hao with black putting him in fantastic position he now just has to not lose with white we see in this game what sometimes happens when you try to not lose with white you play a little bit too solidly this was a a complex but opposite colored bishop position but gukesh had the passer he invested in that c pawn and that c pawn did wonders and it seemed like wang hao was just trying a little bit too hard to be solid go cash never in in any doubt from start to finish called his shots and if he defeats wang hao and and magnus defeats of anchor they play in the quarterfinals that is going to be sensational with this win gukesh is now the seventh highest rated chess player in the world he just passed wesley so and anish giri 17 years of age if gukesh gains 20 more rating points which is a lot he's number two number three in the world two years ago gukesh was twenty five hundred twenty twenty six hundred twenty five hundred he was like the four five hundredth ranked player he's number seven in two years unbelievable stuff oh but the women's side was also crazy queen's gambit declined and i've got a couple more banger games uh after this one as well she did what's called the queen z gambit declined attack knight to a4 it's called minority attack three pawns versus four knight a4 knight c5 a4 advancing on the queen side pawn to a5 creating weaknesses on the dark squares she actually gave up a pawn count the pawns why does just purely down upon but is relying on the knights the knights and the pressure on the a and the b file knight to d3 she takes on b4 and she manages to cash out with this incredible position long-term pressure and you will notice that white has a cluster of five versus the split two and three that's always going to be beneficial for white white also has a dominant knight versus that bishop the bishop has no targets but the computer could draw this end game rook back to b1 black plays g5 black actually should probably play h5 this is considered an advantageous end game approach g5 allows you to potentially be restricted it's probably still a draw but here come the kings and the pawns hg rook h1 and it is white asking the questions can black actually make a draw only one side is playing for a win here and that side is playing white and you may ask yourself what just happened king g7 rook h5 why did black not play king to g6 96 why did black not play king to f6 rook h6 rook d6 and probably thought that she was going to lose the pawn anyway but for some reason paulina sees a ghost and decides you know what i'm gonna lose my pawn anyway i better get counter play but she's just a pawn down now she must have thought she was losing the pawn regardless and this my friends is a very instructive end game if you don't know how to win this end game you have to get the end games master class available on my website chesley this is what we call a rook and pawn end game versus rook and the way you win this with white is you have to cut off the enemy king from as much of the board as possible rook to e5 and when the pawn is going this is the long side and this is the short side and black's king has to be over here to succeed in playing short side defense or black has to play the filler or position defense and black right now is completely cut off so white is able to simply advance the pawn king d7 ponto d6 and what you are going to do in this position is called build a bridge first you boot the king away even further then you escort the pawn to the seventh rank and in this position you do what's called build the bridge why you want to go here you want to go here you want to go here and then in this position you want to block the check rook 2 f4 sets that up build the bridge there we go king c6 or king e6 it doesn't really matter rook c4 king c7 d8 she wins very instructive endgame win she is now a draw or a win away from making it to the semi-finals of the world cup and we had yet another decisive result in the game between tanjong yi and bella this one was a queen's gambit declined as well dc kind of like a catalan-esque position and this game was wild e5 tantrungi took the center gambiting a pawn knight d6 broke into black's position black's king in dire straits knight to f5 king 2 f8 we have a position where where black's king is on a fade the pawn is on d6 if black is unable to deal with this pawn black is going to lose knight to d5 take take and white continues to apply pressure queen c2 we don't have a repetition of moves bishop takes we go to a queen and rook end game that pawn is surviving uh-oh uh oh that pawn is gonna survive and now black is in trouble but still potentially holding on and now rooks takes e6 rook e6 is a ridiculous move the idea is if pawn takes check and the king has to go here and you go here here and here and here and here rook takes e6 the bulldozer but black still has h5 that is the only move to potentially not lose black must have been stunned by this move tried to play passive defense but white continued to hammer and that d-pawn is surviving and that deep on is going to be the hero black tries to get back queen f1 queen h1 counter play but the queen's sacrifice with the tempo to promote and tanjongi of china sacrifices her rookie yet again with the hope of fg and a ladder mate with rook 28 a fantastic game a very very fun game those were the two decisive results in the quarterfinals uh of the women's side uh the open section was incredibly decisive we had yet another indian matchup remember four of the 16 players are from india niels grandilius from sweden played knight takes an h4 in the opening versus arjun eric icy who actually went for a french defense uh i believe grand delius placed some frenches himself this game was actually kind of a boring one um queenless game rookless game as well that was a fun sequence but a bunch of nothing and white essentially has a three on three and black has a four on two pawns that's it arjun brings his king to the center and grendelius plays bishop d3 arjun plays b6 now we have g3 knight c4 and a couple moves later they trade a couple of pawns now arjun has actually outmaneuvered eric uh grandelius already this trade stripping this down from four on three to a three on two benefits black because black has a past pawn that's that's actually a major reason these pawns could be a little bit weak so in the search to be too solid like we saw wang hao there these some of these kind of like end game style middle-like positions of just rooks knights and pawns rooks knights bishops they're tough to play right they are tough to play like you try to play g5 you try to instigate now you know we got a little bit of imbalance here position is still equal make no mistake position is likely still equal grandelius looking for some counter play but here comes here comes arjun walking his king to the center oh looking for a trade you don't want to take just so you understand you don't want to take you don't you definitely don't want to give black two pass pawns you don't want to do that then it goes passive now b4 from grandelius c3 and grandilius gives up the the pawn and i guess his idea might have been 96 but this this is probably just losing you you probably cannot play like this computer thinks maybe you can but grandilias reconsiders and wins the e6 pawn but again it's just going to be a matter of the pawn the take take take and the night i mean the night the night is not going and eric i see rook and king versus king and king knight is a draw but now when there's one more pawn on the board you see the eval plummet off a cliff it's because black is just winning the knight is trapped rook to g7 and black traps the knight on the edge of the board and arjun every guy see wins with black just like gukesh one with black so now tomorrow they have white in a in in a situation where they don't even have to win this is a massive result for both of them two more games for you leniere dominguez perez versus uh alexis serrana this was a sicilian defense it was a four night sicilian where serana gave up the dark squared bishop early created an isolated pawn position to play actively but from the early opening uh we got to this position where white has two bishops versus bishop knight and potential pressure on the queen side and a very strong queen and things went wrong very quickly for serana who in this position lashed out with this move b5 b5 removing the pawn from being a weakness and potentially doing something over here but lanier played queen e5 and this this this engine doesn't even realize this is completely lost for black very tough to make a move here h5 is on the way various attacks on black's position are on the way rook e3 rook d1 black played bishop takes c2 but just rookie three and and the queen is this regarding the knight if the queen goes to d2 there's h6 black is like on the verge of getting mated so queen c5 walking into a fork voluntarily to try to defend this end game but lanier kicks out the pieces rook c5 what a move rook c5 disconnecting the queen from the knight you can't take because you walk into this rook c5 the knight drops back a fork a trade of queens infiltration on the seventh rank and leniere making it look easy splitting blacks pawns up and serana just resigns because he's gonna lose his pawns and he's going to just be down uh rook for a knight and a pawn or two in an end game leniere dominguez perez on the verge of a world cup quarterfinal he we've been sleeping on the dope that's literally his name sick nickname by the way like lebron james le dope i got one more for you we haven't even covered these guys games ninjat abbasov the last player from the home country azerbaijan remaining versus salam salah the arabic falcon that is his legal name salam salah not arabic falcon he's from the uae nijada knocked out uh anish giri in this game we had a london and salam has just been quietly cooking a london where white tried to expand on the queen side very early we got a we got a knight versus bishop situation let's keep in mind we've seen a lot of these dynamics we've seen knight be better than the bishop we've seen the bishop be better than the night a4 a5 look at this look at the boss of just putting every one of his pawns on a dark square so black's bishop just can't do anything black's bishop is blocked in by his own pawns position is still equal but it's white who is trying to cause problems but salem shuts it down he locks the position up you would be probably asking yourself how did somebody lose this position well there's ways to lose in chess i mean you would find a way to lose this with wider with black and don't get offended that i say that that's just a joke okay i'm kidding i'm not trying to put anybody down i've seen comments before i've even gotten emails people have written viewer emails like you should stop saying stuff like that like oh you you know you are gonna lose it if you're watching this video right now and i say you would lose this with white or with black first of all what are you even doing playing in the world cup if you're watching this right now second of all i'm kidding yeah cool i would lose this with white and with black not against you but okay g5 take take trading the rooks and queen d1 nothing nope just nobody can win this right what's gonna happen isn't the shot gonna find a way to over press let's do a6 all right it's queen the knight there's nothing here it's just a dead draw dead draw nobody can win deadlock position king f2 bishop d5 h4 all right fine h kicks him out he just lost the pawn what is he doing wait a minute wait a minute a boss of might have just broken through there in this position salem had to play this he had to kick the queen out before it was too late this was the setup if salem played bishop f7 and bishop to g6 that would have held everything and then after h4 you can take and knight h5 is nothing but salem mistimed his kicking out of the queen and traded the wrong pawns he thought he was creating counter play but unfortunately despite the counter play that he was creating it was actually white who was suddenly going on the offensive it was still a draw according to the computer but this is a very complicated position now and in this position the a pawn fell now it's really tough for black to defend but black has a c pawn so we get into a pawn race c2 but but you had to play c2 right away because after queen g6 king h8 if queen c2 there is this you stop the pawn and you threatened various mates right queen g2 is made but the way this happened a boss of managed to escape with the king and he's up too many pieces queen e5 check salem resigns he resigns because for example he can just queen can't take and there's no checks to the white king unbelievable hometown hero from azerbaijan defeats salaam saleh with white it's much better to win with black because when you play white you could control the game you could kill off all the pieces so tomorrow magnus is gonna look to put away ivanchuk i and gukesh are going to look to stabilize a boss of is gonna try not to lose with black and linear dominguez paris is going to try to put away alexis rana as well on the women's side salimova has a lead tanjong yi has a lead world cup 2023 a lot of fun magnus one's a brilliant one i'll see you tomorrow get out of here
