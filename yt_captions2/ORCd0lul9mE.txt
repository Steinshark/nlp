okay so if you're watching this video i'm guessing that you are someone who really wants to learn the code you have probably seen the potential that learning this skill can have for you maybe you want to build a better life for yourself maybe you're just excited about problem solving and like the creative aspect of coding but you are coming in the realization that learning the code is just really hard but like i'm not gonna sit here and tell you that it's going to be easy i'm not going to sit here and tell you that you're not gonna go through hours and hours of agony of literally wanting to smash your keyboard because of some dumb error that you can't figure out how to do but you are willing to put in the hard work if you are willing to do exactly the things that i lay out in this video i promise you that you will succeed because almost no one is willing to do it so if you're one of the people who is you can get there from the days that i started writing code for the first time it took me only four months to get my first job as a full stack developer at a big company in london and i know now you're saying that well didn't you just say that it's not easy but you did it in four months yeah i said it's not easy i didn't say that it cannot be far so that is why precisely in this video i want to tell you exactly what you should focus on if you want to get a job as fast as possible learn to code is hard learn to code fast and getting a job fast or even harder but if you are willing to do that if you are willing to put in the hard work here's exactly how you go about it before we get started i'd like to announce that i'm going to be doing my first ever q a stream hooray hooray on 8th of december this is gonna be your chance to finally ask me all the questions you have whether it's about programming or life or whatever else really and so there's gonna be a link down below in the description it's going to be hosting a platform called super peer so make sure you go sign up for it right now so that you don't miss when the stream goes live because there's gonna be some pretty exciting things announced on that live stream step one you need to pick an area of programming to focus on and i'm going to just cut the fluff here and just tell you exactly what you should in 2022 and 2023 which is web development first is the most common area of programming so it has the most opportunity it's the easiest area of programming to run really fast now if you have a particular interest for some field like mobile development you should absolutely pursue whatever area that you want all of these areas of programming and tech can give you an amazing life and amazing career but whatever you choose if you want to get a job as fast as possible what i would do is just pick one and just stick to it don't do what i did and spend like one month learning python scripting in two months doing like full stop web development and then go back to python for months and then go into ai like when i did my learning to go journey throughout like a gap year that i was doing last year in finland i already had a job offer in my bag and i talked more about how that happened in this video right here if you are interested so i was already at the point where i didn't have to optimize for getting a job as fast as possible and i was able to spend the year to explore many different areas like exploring many different areas gonna be wonderful but if specifically you just need a job as fast as possible that's not the way to go step number two is to do an online boot camp tons of these out there people always ask me what is the best course to take and stuff like that but here's the thing about courses none of them are really special in any way just choose a teacher that using has an engaging style and just stick to one program but i know that even though i said that you will still ask me like why i exactly recommend so here are two options for a free option you really cannot go wrong with the odin project i did around half of this during my own journey before i moved on to all the resources it's really detailed really high quality considering it's free is absolutely fantastic and you can totally learn the code for completely free like i did this myself now that i can afford it i have started to see the value of also investing money into patreonistic materials because they can be higher quality because when someone's getting paid for them they're just willing to put in more effort so if you are willing to invest for a paid option my recommendation is zero to mastery's web developer bootcamp or one of their other bootcamp times if you're going for a different area due to mastery are my favorite coding course platform that i still use this day it's really nothing it's like 40 bucks a month or something like that you get access to like i think 30 different courses or something like that i've done a bunch of them myself they're extremely high quality and they're very beginning friendly and explain in a way that even like a literal dumbass can understand them so that's why i really love them and that's why i keep recommending them to you guys because i think they're really great and that's why i also choose to be affiliated with them so there is a 10 discount code down below in the description so yeah if you use that i also obviously benefit as well but as i said i generally use this myself so after you finish that and you religiously build all the projects that they ask you to do you can now move on to step three which is to build two to three impressive portfolio projects but i hear you asking what makes a good and impressive portfolio project anyway well conveniently i made a full video on the top principles that you need to implement in your project and you you can watch that video right here but in summary your project should showcase number one a range of skills and to make sure you do this i recommend you simply build a few crud applications of some software use the front end and the back end you implement user authentication you connect the database and ideally interact with some sort of api the reason you want these features in particular is because they are essentially the building blocks of any large software system and something like that you'll just need to know in any kind of job on top of that you want to build something unique or at least your own version of something that already exists and ideally you want your project to be very easily understandable by anyone in just a glance and to have a very clean ui because if your project looks messy literally a recruiter will assume that the code is just as messy after that it is time to start applying whether it's applying for jobs or for freelance positions or whatever you're doing on this stage there are two sort of divergent divergent paths that you can take there's big companies and there's small companies but bigger companies your focus should entirely be on learning data structures and algorithms and then just grind lead code like an absolute animal until you can basically solve at least the medium level lead code question that's what i see that's what seems to be the level that junior level interviews are at by the way if you don't know what data structures are and what algorithms are you want like a like a very dumb explanation of what they are actually made these two explanations that have been really popular on my channel that you might want to check out so when it comes to resources to properly learning the instructions and algorithms there's tools that are currently my favorite ones first is the algorithm specialization from coursera this is like reasonably hard course or if you are sort of mathsy and you don't mind the course being very challenging and some like very theoretical as well uh this is probably the one that i would choose i enjoyed it but it probably goes deeper than you would need to know so the other option is again zero to masteries master decoding interview bookam i think it's a first ever data structures and algorithms program that i did myself personally if you used what are the courses from the previous step with the same subscription you also get access to this one but if you are applying for smaller companies you want to emphasize simply just being really good at a specific language slash tech stack because from my understanding these types of companies because they hire less based on potential and more based on already like actual skill it's less likely that they will have lead call style interviews and more likely that they will have like a take-home coding tiles or something like that because they just want to see what you can do now which also means that the job is probably going to be it's gonna probably gonna have higher expectations and probably going to be a bit more challenging but also you're going to learn more again from what i know but you do also get paid less which you know depends on what you're optimizing for so in terms of how long this is actually going to take that is going to entirely depend on how much time and effort you are willing to invest in learning every single day my mindset is always to work as hard as possible at the start because with almost anything once you get your food in the door everything becomes so much easier and i know that not everyone thinks in this way and if you want to be like whoa work life balance all of that like sure that's fine you you can do what you want but just realize that the less you're willing to learn and the more you want to focus on like life and getting drunk or whatever then the slower it's going to happen i did this in four months it wasn't easy but it was because doing that for months i was really every single day i was coding for like hours and if you want me to make a full video or like how many hours i was coding every day like how i manage my time and all of that i can do that let me know down below like i understand work-life balance is important but the truth is that if you really want success in the beginning so when you're just getting started like getting this whole machine of learning to code like off the ground you are going to probably have to go through a period of a lot less work-life balance that you might actually want to be listening to a lot of successful entrepreneurs recently because like i'm now sort of an entrepreneur with this youtube channel and i want to be an entrepreneur when it comes to building my own software and all of that and what all of them say at the end of the day they really value workload palace but it's always like you need to earn the right to enjoy work-life balance but if you want to achieve something extraordinary really fast or at all really you're going to have to put in extraordinary effort so that's why i always emphasize just enjoy the process of coding like get to the point where you can really just love putting in the hard work and you need to start like enjoying the feeling of doing the hard things i work extremely hard a full-time job i'm building my projects and i'm making like two videos a week on this channel but i guarantee you i have more fulfillment in my life than a lot of people who basically don't do anything useful i'm so glad i found this thing with coding and now it is youtube that i can literally just enjoy like love the process of putting in like super hard work every single day i'm sure like in the moment you might not feel like you're enjoying it but it's like the point is the fulfillment that you get at the end of it when you get something really hard done and in the evening like 8pm even though like last night i didn't feel like continuing to work on my personal website that i'm building right now i'm like upgrading my personal website i didn't feel like doing it but i did it anyway for like two hours and i felt so good afterwards like that is the thing that keeps me going and like you could just get to that point like i promise you you will eventually get there so i want you to listen to this if you're just put in enough effort you're just not absolutely suck you will win by default because no one else does that and i know this can all sound like a very harsh truth or like like controversial but i really hope that hearing this helps someone so if you want a more detailed account of basically everything that i just said i actually made a skillshare class that you can watch completely free by clicking the link down below in the description so essentially you can watch that video for like all the details of everything that i know and especially the first section i think is going to be really valuable to you because it includes a lot of stuff that you probably don't even realize are important to consider in the first place with that again make sure to also sign up down below to my free q a live stream that i'm doing on super peer just be excited to fail fail a lot break things and enjoy the journey i'll see you next time bye foreign
