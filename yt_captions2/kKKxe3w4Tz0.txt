ladies and gentlemen have any of you ever played a chess game that left you really mad have you ever broken something after playing a chess game i'm talking about a computer monitor keyboard maybe a mouse maybe a microphone i don't know maybe a squash racket the game that i'm gonna show you today got me so mad that i smashed my squash racket into a wall and broke the string just kidding i actually broke that earlier today when i crushed one of my best friends in squash i just wanted to flex on you the game that i'm going to be showing you today is a sensational battle of two 400 elo players and it was sent in to me by a gentleman named deepon d-pawn is very brave for sending me this game uh and although i did not break my squash racket after watching it i left a lot i also cried and screamed and vomited and a lot of different emotions that chess makes you experience i'm actually already very upset by the second move of this game because deepon plays the ready or maybe deepon doesn't know any openings and he's just playing knight f3 g3 but the ready is a is a hyper modern opening where you try to control the center from a distance and you very rarely put pawns directly there this is terrible chess for beginners look i don't mean to tell you all to play the exact same way you gotta try to put at least one and if not one then two and if not two then three pawns in the center because that's the way chess is supposed to be played i really like the way anwar from kazakhstan plays this uh putting pawns in the center like this uh and uh by the way if you're confused why 400 rated players get the grand master title it's because i do what i want if i want them to be grand masters for the duration of the video then they are going to be grand masters for the duration of the video make it into a gotham video i mean i've got 1500 of them some of you watching have probably been in a gotham video if you have let me know in the comments d3 this is called the king's indian attack and it should not be played by somebody who is 400 let me explain this to you of 400 playing the king's indian attack is the equivalent of giving a new driver a person that just passed their license exam a very very sophisticated formula one race car that driver is either gonna drive that car at 15 miles an hour 15 kilometers an hour or is going to crash it into a wall there is no in between black plays bishop before check now i don't like the move bishop b4 check but it's not for any reason you would think i just don't recommend moving your bishop so far into the open where it can be attacked by enemy pawns like if your opponent can easily block the check and block your bishop out like this this is just pleasant for white there's no need to do this especially because after white offers you a trait of bishops you go back why it's like seeing the supermarket is that an american term supermarket like the place you buy fruits vegetables firearms i look uh bishop back to d6 uh i don't know if that's a uniquely american thing um but uh i guess they're called grocery stores markets bodegas i don't know what they're called in other parts of the world in any case it's like you see it across the street and you take the long way like you go around the block i don't know anyway white now plays the move b3 the move b3 and the move g3 are something that we call fiance because you moved upon up one square and then the bishop goes behind the pawn the white bishop cannot go behind the pawn because you just moved it here so i don't think this is a fiancate though i think this is a 400 rated player moving one of their flank pawns one square it's not called a fan kettle but you see how fascinating chess is anyway knight c6 knight c3 the players develop and in this position of course white should be playing the move castles this is why i don't recommend beginners play the ready because they have no idea what they're doing they don't know why they played certain moves on to d4 if you were gonna play pawn to d3 on the third move of the game and then on the eighth move of the game you were gonna decide that the pawn actually belongs on d4 i have a suggestion why don't you move it there on the first move of the game and save everybody a whole lot of waiting ah what do you think i don't know it's just my idea i'm just the internet's chess teacher here's just the 400. the move d4 is not a bad move it's just a waste of time a little bit anyway black plays a5 because you know blacks 400 like you know you leave a 400 unattended for 15 seconds they move a flank pawn two squares there's nothing wrong with this move for a 400 like as long as nobody's gotten projectile diarrhea i i am more than satisfied with the level of play it's a very close position how do you know that because neither side has traded any pieces and still eight pawns are on the board which means both sides have a very very healthy setup of pieces in close positions you're looking at peace maneuvers peace exchanges and pawn breaks white does not have a whole lot of pawn breaks black has a nice way here of activating this bishop which means the move queen e2 is very inaccurate because it walks directly into this i've also just realized that i have no evaluation part why didn't any of you tell me i'm just kidding i know i'm not live streaming i prefer it that way i prefer youtube videos don't tell my live streaming audience i said that you are much better than they are all right now look friends we've made it 10 moves white still hasn't castled um you may be wondering uh will white castle in this game the answer that question is a resounding no if white had an option to castle and white had an option to castle and white had an option to castle and then white had yet another option to castle white's not castling okay that's just what we're getting d-pawn has not studied my videos closely enough plays the ready doesn't listen doesn't castle not only does he do that black wanders into the position attacking the pawn and c2 and he is so selfish he does the exact same thing back to his opponent oh well you want to move your night out to the edge of the board i will do the same except you didn't castle so you lose a pawn and you lose a rook now you can't castle and you're down a broken upon because you didn't move your king out of the center of the board and because you are just disrespectful you just don't acknowledge what your opponents are doing think about this my friends my beginner just friends watching this what is chess i'm not trying to ask a philosophical or complicated question what is chess it is a one v one at times it could be played in teams but for the most part 1v1 board game played on an 8x8 grid where you have 16 pieces that all have a bunch of different moves it's a 1v1 game there is a one on the other side you wouldn't play a shooting game by walking out into the middle of the field and just firing away which is exactly how you beginners play the game of chess you wander out into the field in the open just shoot right that's not how fps games work your opponent is trying to get your pawn you should defend okay fine point mate now since you saw your opponent wander over here you are like a cranky toddler you're like [music] so you take the bishop too even though that doesn't make any sense because you're down a rook in a pawn you have a finite amount of pieces remaining why would you trade them for your opponent's pieces and therefore nuke your counter play but that's fine queen takes d6 white plays knight e5 i don't hate this move i hate you for losing a rook in a ponzy pawn but other than that fine black plays bishop basics excellent move excellent move oh my goodness i cannot stress it enough god bless you spending 14 seconds on that move this is a fantastic move at any given moment in a chess game this is exactly how you're supposed to think in a game of chess okay your opponent makes a move you're supposed to ask is there a threat you look around the knight can go to a bunch of different squares but there is no threat even though this opened and this opened there is no threat then you have to go through a checklist checks captures attacks is there any way to attack the opponent's king no is there any way to capture something yes and yes are they good moves no can i attack anything in the position yes i can attack the queen because it's the most powerful beast you should start with the most powerful piece bishop to a6 is it a bad move does it improve my position and attack the piece at the same time yes you should play the move bishop a6 pawn to e4 if you are wondering whether or not white completely ignored his opponent's threat for a second time the answer to your question is yes but you know that every single good how to lose a chess playlist game starts exactly like this with a player basically losing all of his pieces and then the chest gods guiding him either to his very uneventful death or to a comeback you will also notice that white spent a grand total of three seconds on this move i actually think it's a little bit more than that i think they're playing five a ten second with a 10 minute with five seconds bonus so let's do some mathematics that means 7 16 plus 5 is 721 that means a person spend eight seconds on hanging their queen now listen let's do a little bit of math okay what is seven times sixty or twenty right 420 plus 24. 444 444 seconds on the clock and you spent eight of them what is eight divided by 444 that is approximately 1.8 percent of your total remaining time you spent on hanging your most powerful piece on the board i mean this is just disgusting this is i should pick this up and call 9-1-1 that wouldn't do anything because if d-pawn's in india i think they would just look at me like i'm crazy anyway this is all to say that white lost the queen and then upon and then another pawn and then his knight and then his pawn and then another pawn and then he took a rook but [music] black is probably not going to win this game i mean like you're not an idiot i mean okay maybe you are i'm talking to a lot of you right now maybe some of you are idiots i mean statistically speaking some of you are probably idiots uh you just you know i just i hope you're not um i'm an idiot uh look you're not an idiot you are watching this video you like black didn't just win this game right like james bond doesn't just stop the villain and then the movie's over in 15 minutes now they gotta prolong it for two and a half hours somehow some way something happens in this game if we like an instant replay of the last few moves uh this move opened up the queen and white did nothing about that pawn white could take here but then white actually loses this and i don't even think white saw that knight here attacks the queen the queen of course takes and now white does this setting up a discovered attack by the way there's checkmate in this position always look for checks always look for checks sometimes you might checkmate somebody by accident this is exactly why you have to always look for checks but b5 is played in this game knight b2 is a clean loss of a knight now the defended just get to the king you gotta just get to the king here and okay black loses the rook but and great find by deepon now deep on to his credit in this position could have just resigned but you know what deepon knew deepon knew that deep down it well no pun intended deep on knew that deep down uh if he saved this game he might make it into one of my youtube videos but he's right he's right black is up 16 points of material that is nearly half of a starting value of a chess position which is 39. rook takes a1 knight takes pawn black just wants to take all the pawns i don't hate that i don't hate that from being honest queen f3 is now mating too queen f3 is now not mating two but you're gonna win the rook instead of that we have queen g3 i mean white literally has no pieces remaining it's just game over uh the way you win this with black the easiest way to win it by far is to sack the queen for the rook win upon maybe sack the queen for the rook promote a queen laddermate because the rook is the only problem right there is a unit in which something like this happens okay bishop takes rook takes back rank mate you will notice and you should notice as a beginner whether or not your opponent's king is on a back rank and has no way to escape it has not made what's called a fort it cannot get out so there are still ways to save a position when you have something like a rook on the board the bishop is not going to save a damn thing rook c1 is played black has now won every single one of white's pawns queen h5 check king c2 queen c5 and i would not even hesitate i would just sack the queen for the rook just do it it's not the right move it's not the best move but now white will never save this position now black kind of did the same thing by just losing the queen in one move black move the queen around like 30 times and then just left it there okay i mean this is the equivalent of owning a ferrari driving it through a town all over and leaving it unlocked with the key inside just in a random street corner black lost the queen but still maintains a seven pawn advantage that's a lot of pawns what black should do now is push the pawns for some reason black decides to push the h pawn don't hate it pushes it to h3 don't hate it rook h5 a4 knight g4 knight f2 gg bishop f4 the knight gets out of the way like now you're two squares away from queening life is good now knight f2 check okay i kinda hate that like you could have just went h2 you can't take the knight because of this and if this check queen so rook g5 knight f2 the knight bounces around to e4 by the way there was a fork in this position but we don't need a fork and and slack is probably going to lose one of the other pawn okay bishop c7 now black is only a five pawns but at least a4 is coming down the board yeah you just you can't stop both pawns rook takes h3 there we go bishop e5 and we have arrived at the faded moment of the game you see this bar and in this position after being up let's just back this up a little bit don't go anywhere after being up a resounding 16 points of material losing the queen for free being up seven pawns being up six pawns black against all odds manages to absolutely forget about their king and blunders checkmate in one move why why would you move your king for what black does it again it's mate instead of that white was so afraid of getting checked that white does this how now it's really over cause yeah ain't be in a king and a rook and a knight and three pawns with just the rook you had your chance and now it's over king e3 now white has stepped into an x-ray okay yes still can't take the knight rook h4 gg rook here rook f5 check all right the king runs forward it's okay fine it's still winning anyway shape or okay surely not right i mean surely not black gonna lose the game but there's no way uh all right there there was rook g4 there all right then now then here comes the night oh it's mate he hung mate again the night was covering made but now now now it's made now it's made all right let's play mate okay it's fine knight g4 good and let's let's go to e3 let's let's defend our pawn okay fine you want to repeat moves no problem let's give a check let's yup oh suddenly your knight can't defend this you gotta hope for a fork okay so you hung your knight that's you're losing now you hung your knight that's gg that's game game no no oh god but there's no way white knows how to checkmate with the king of the rook right oh my god how does white know how to checkmate with the king okay yeah you had you had to go here right well there's not gonna know how to do it ah at least black has that on his side i mean why does it have gone he's 400 he has absolutely no idea how to checkmate i mean he's getting close but he's not gonna he's not gonna actually figure out he doesn't know how to do it yes oh this is just a waste of he doesn't know it's a drive they've repeated moves right they've and white white one this position why why my friends how do y'all manage to do this how did he he's got a king left and some some friends he had mate on the board and black jews couldn't come up with a winning strategy and there was mate and then there wasn't and then there was and and then he he still hung every piece and and he hung his rook and then he hung mate but i see why i i asked you a few smash things after chess games get out of here
