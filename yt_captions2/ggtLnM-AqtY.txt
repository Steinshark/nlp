that's for alerts already turned it off i already turned off alerts so guess what soccer 2022 annual rust survey results of course released in 2023 that's just what happens in fact apparently it was released eight months and seven days after 2022 which i think makes sense because the survey probably happened in early 2023 right uh i would assume anyways hello rust stations for the sixth year in a row the rust project conducted a survey on the rust programming language with the participation from project maintainers contributors and those generally interested in the future of rust this edition of the annual rust uh state of rust survey open for submissions on december 5th and ran until december 22nd first i would like to thank you for your patience on these long delayed results we hope to identify a more ex expedient and sustainable process going forward so the results come out more quickly and have an even more actionable insights for the community the goal of this survey is to always give our wider community a chance to express their opinions about the language we all love and help shape its future we're grateful to the those of you who took the time to share your voice on the state of rust last year before diving into the few insights uh we would like to thank everyone okay this is a lot of thanking uh involved in creating the rust of the state of rust survey uh with special acknowledgment to the translators who worked uh work allowed us to offer the survey in english simplified chinese traditional chinese french german japanese korean portuguese russian spanish and ukrainian let's go that's a lot of languages that's a lot of languages that's a true example of how long it takes to compile rust even compiling thoughts about rust takes a long time uh in 2022 we had uh we had 9433 total surveyed uh completions uh and an increased survey completion rate of 82 versus 67 2021 okay so people are more likely to fill out the rust survey while the goal is always total survey completion for all participants the survey requires time and energy and focus and we consider this fatigue quite high and we're pleased by the increase yeah we also saw a significant increase in the number of people viewing but not participating in the survey from 16 457 views in 2021 to 25 581. okay a lot more you know the funny thing is i never even heard about this survey i think they have a little bit of a maybe like of a marketing problem because i feel like i feel like you know you should be able to get a lot of views in here uh while this is likely due to a number of different factors we feel this information speaks to the rising interest in rust and the growing general audience following its evolution in 2022 the survey had 11 482 responses which is slightly decreased a slight decrease of 6.4 percent from 2021. it's kind of a i mean these two things are kind of funny can we just at least agree that these two sentences when put together is moderately funny we're growing everything's going good we're definitely going upwards but we did have a slight decrease in the amount of people actually doing the thing sorry that was just it's a funny it's a funny like take when put together um however there was let's see the number of respondents that answered all survey questions has increased year over year game in the metrics let's go we are interested to see this slight decrease it let's see we were interested to see the slight decrease in responses as this year's survey was much shorter than the previous years clearly survey length is not the only factor in driving participation correct these are facts community we are pleased to offer the survey in 11 languages more than ever before with the addition of uh ukrainian translator in 2022. i'm actually kind of surprised at how many languages they offered versus how many people actually uh you know participated in this because it seems like they they offered such intense complexity but it didn't seem like they got a lot of like bang for their buck for such for such complexity because 11 languages is really really hard right that means about a thousand people per language on average answered which just seems like that's that's like a lot of that's like a lot of effort right it's a lot of effort that try to find people to be able to translate that kind of stuff uh more than ever before uh with the addition of the ukrainian translator translation in 2022 77 of the response took this year's survey in english five percent uh chinese four percent in german uh and french two percent in japanese spanish and russian and one percent chinese traditional korean portuguese and ukrainian this is our lowest percentage of respondents taking the survey in english to date which is exciting indication of the growing global nature of our community uh the vast majority of respondents reported being uh most comfortable communicating on technical topics in english followed by chinese okay rusty users uh user respondents were asked which country they lived in top 13 countries represented the united states germany china united kingdom france canada russia japan uh netherlands sweden australia poland india nearly 70 72.5 percent of respondents elected to answer this question okay um we see global access to rust education has a critical goal for our community we are proud to say that rust was used all over the world in 2022. chinese the new international language absolutely uh that's what uh i guess is happening here seven percent uh while we see glo let's see juan rust usage uh more people are using rust than ever before over 90 of the survey respondents identify as rust users but why would you take a survey about the future of rust and don't don't worry i'm not i'm not actually addressing the real problems here i know uh or is it because the languages are now native to some that didn't have to do it in english yes that's what i'm saying i i understand the real problem with this data right when you offer something that someone is more comfortable in of course they're gonna take it uh would they've still been able to take the same survey regardless of the amount of language offerings i i totally understand that this is kind of a play on statistics right it's the problem with with statistics just in general which is that when you do something like that you can kind of make these inferences that don't actually exist and so that's why there's lies there's damned lies and there's statistics right that's why it exists that way all right rust usage uh this by the way i'm super over 90 of the survey response identified as rust users i'm not even sure what does that even mean and of those using rust uh 47 use it on a daily basis and increase of four percent from the previous year um i identify as a rust user okay uh 30 of rust user uh user respondents can write simple programs in rust 27 right production ready code 42 consider them productive using rust uh of the former rust users who completed the survey 30 set of difficulty as the primary reason for giving up well forty percent cited factors outside their control okay let's look at this uh as you let's see as you have indicated that you are no longer using rust why did you stop uh did not help achieve my goals missing language features missing libraries missing tools i'm surprised about missing libraries or tools rust generally is pretty good on the tool side of things and on the library side of things too difficult to learn that's not surprising community was off-putting a surprise by how small that is i prefer to use another language surprised uh by how small that is also that feels but i mean these these three feel like the big i guess you could say these four seem like the like the pretty big wins right here right because factors outside my control totally reasonable uh i mean me personally i realize that one thing i have to do is i have to delete every target folder inside of all my directories because i end up using like i like 300 gigs of my 500 gig disk space every single time is it most of my opera most of my computer's memory is devoted to rust builds it's that's annoying but either way these ones seem odd uh missing language features i can i guess i could kind of get that one because there's a lot of goofiness still around async and impulse stuff and blah blah blah blah similar 26 of those who did not identify as rust users cited the perception of difficulty as the primary reason for not having used it why would you not why would you fill out a survey for a language you don't use that okay i gotta like i would just like to talk to those people sit down why'd you do that uh let's see all right why don't you use rust it uh did not help me achieve my goals okay that's actually probably the most reasonable take missing language features again super bizarre if you don't even use rust how do you know they're missing right like how do you know that they're even that what missing library how do you even know those missing tools how are you coming up with these ideas too difficult to learn now that's pretty reasonable community was off-putting uh prefer to use another language factors outside my control so i mean i feel like these four are the big ones and it kind of is representing sort of some reason with some uh people uh watch twitch streams on the same reason why some people watch twitch streams and they don't uh that they don't like to watch oh they're aunties we got some aunties the community one is more realistic apart from a few people on github and the dumb right at the vast majority of rust community is very helpful and cool this is true like the tokyo guy is awesome i really like the tokyo guy uh i guess yeah that's true anytime i've interacted with non-foundation adjacent people they've been super cool so i guess maybe that's uh that uh so maybe that's that's probably a reasonable take then all right using uh rust usage at work the growing uh maturation of rust can be seen through the increased number of different organizations utilizing the language in 2022 in fact 29.7 percent of respondents stated that they use rust for the majority of their coding work at uh their workplace which is 51.8 increase compared to last year are you uh let's say are you using rust at work majority occasionally no okay i'm actually pretty surprised by how many people right here well i mean i guess i shouldn't be surprised by this these are people who are probably super likely to fill out the survey so that probably doesn't exist it's probably these two that are more interesting yes occasionally means that people are starting to adopt it in like a part-time role which maybe you can game those numbers as well right you can game those numbers because you're like i built a small cli in rust and you're like well it's for your company but did you need to do it that way is there a purpose no i like rust right like you're like oh okay i see because i mean i'm also building a cli thing people acting like 2 000 uh accompanied people is an insurmountable uh for a different language to overtake i know i know it's also to be completely fair these numbers are drops in the bucket but remember you're still filling out a survey so it's like what is the the point here all right there are uh numerous reasons why uh we are seeing an increase uh use of rust in professional environments top reason cited for using rust included the perceived ability to write bug-free software classic perceived ability [applause] i love that i just love the fact that you you know there's something to be said about how you feel about what you write you know what i mean there's something very very much to be said about that that if you feel like it's better not that it's it is better you'll be just more happy yeah i definitely it's it feels better this i more bug-free code russ has the highest feels great post compile it does yeah it does the placebo effect the placebo effect is a real thing suspicious quote i know 69 of security and safety guarantees yeah it's called the placebo effect i know it's called the placebo effect but it's just awesome it's awesome oh it's also called i like to call it the dx effect developer experience right uh developer experience is a placebo effect oh my goodness that is such a snarky tweet let's make it happen uh developer uh developer experience is just the placebo effect nice spell placebo correct it's it's placebo right play spell yeah yeah i always you know every time i look at that i'm like bam hot take not so hot yeah people are gonna get offended by it um you know someone's gonna be like how dare you uh anyways we are also pleased to find that 76 of respondents continue to use rust simply because they found it fun and enjoyable yeah i i would say that this is a great reason to use something you like to me this is a reason why you should use whatever it is if it's rust great do it if it's o camel if it's go whatever it is like this is the goal of you learning outside of work is that the language itself should not be the barrier or if the language itself is the barrier you're wishing to cross you know what i mean like it should be the thing that engages you keeps you going makes you excited to keep solving things respondents could select more than one option here so the numbers don't add up to 100 okay uh which of the following statements are reasons you use rust performance yeah we use for the one i'm doing and it's definitely performance and libraries uh control safety and security bug free software what is that what the hell is bug free software how is this a real thing do people realize that that bad logic still exists it's like like it's just straight lies what do you mean what do you mean it's bug free software what do you mean do people really think that all right dude hold on real talk do people actually think that you write big bug-free software when writing rust is this real there's a lot of yeses in here the fact that there's more than one yes that's what i tell my manager like you do know that it's memory safe now memory safe is different than bug free those are two very different terms uh you know i just want to throw i just want to throw you i just want to throw something out there um you know that it's you writing software right you know that you're writing it right remember all those times you just didn't do it right yeah it still happens in rust you know you still don't do it right memory safety was reported as the number one cause of bugs from microsoft and they're large code bases i thought it was memory safety was the number one reported cause of security issues not bugs jokes on you permission i don't write anything more i just researched it okay okay you win bug free because they don't test bug free because it's not in production got him it's definitely security issues you may be right you are a smart one i'm just a good looking one fair fair uh shutter i mean on the personal note i tend to get go the easiest correct uh it just feels like go is a super simple just a super simple uh thing to get correct you know what i mean well lithium lithium not at this moment hold on we're doing something lithium laughs what is this a stock a home syndrome right is this a direct measurement of stockholm syndrome i don't like to use capital letters come on bug-free software i'm pretty sure that's a direct measurement if i've ever seen it of stockholm syndrome i write bug-free software do you bug free all right a goal is great for building uh typesafe apis yeah it goes goes a good it goes a very simple language to get right i think that's one reason why people really like it you can iterate pretty fast python is the buggiest free ever yeah i write uh free bug oh yeah i free bugs all the time okay of those respondents that use rust uh 72 report that had helped their team achieve its goals and four percent increase from previous years nice and 75 percent have plans to continue using it on their teams in the future yeah i'll be using it for the next year at netflix but to like any language being applied in the workplace rust learning curve is an important consideration 39 of respondents using rust in a professional capacity reported the process as challenging and nine percent of the respondents said that adopting rust at work has slowed down their team interesting yeah because i think adopting russ for the wrong thing is most certainly a very great example right you can't just rust all the things uh but i do think that uh like the tool i'm building is a cli tool and it is using swc so i'm already getting like a really great well-tested uh javascript ast that's fast and i'm having to go over tens of thousands of files right and so instead of having to wait for multiple seconds we're waiting for like 10 milliseconds so it feels like the right abstraction right doesn't that feel like the right abstraction it feels like you know that feels good i feel like that's the right tool for the job don't use javascript use rust in this case feels good it's a developer tool that needs to probably be executed frequently and fast and so you want to be as small as possible so i feel good about that i feel really good about that uh however 60 of productive rust user uh users felt rust was worth the cost of adoption overall okay let's see what we got here which of the following statements apply to your experience using rust uh helped us to achieve our goals okay more people feel like that uh challenge is kind of going down i think there's been some good improvements in the rust language overall that probably helped this curve go down overall adopting rust has slowed down our team okay this has gone down probably just language familiarity is becoming a real thing using rust has been worth the cost of adoption interesting this is a very interesting take right here okay so i i feel i i feel like there's something here that needs to be understood that maybe it's hard to suss out uh we're likely to use rust again in the future also slightly down i wonder about this one is this it's absolute number of respondents yes it's absolute number of respondents because it's three thousand fifteen hundred four hundred whatever whatever that's about eleven thousand right uh and remember not everybody completed the survey eight thousand or nine thousand approximately completed the survey so not everyone may have got to this question but either way when i look at this i'm like okay there's something to be said about these two that makes it interesting because this overall adopting rust has slowed down our team is this huge drop related to this where people aren't adopting rust for new projects i'm or i'm having a hard time trying to understand why is this the case in this the case because if people vastly don't think that it's slowing them down anymore then why did why is the worth of adoption adoption not as worthy anymore because it looks like the numbers are fairly it looks like more people responded last year than this year in this category i don't know i'm having a hard time absolute numbers are very hard yeah yeah maybe that's my problems i'm looking at absolute numbers and you can't you can't make any sort of statistical understanding is that fair to say ghost hunting yeah i think zig has a potentially big future yeah yeah you know i think i think i think you're probably right uh i think i think you're probably right just the fact i'm looking at two different sets of absolute numbers makes this almost impossible to i mean i i it's interesting because it's year over year that's i think what they're trying to draw the correlation but maybe it's inappropriate to draw correlation at all is that fair to say because you're not getting the same people answering the same question one year later you're getting potentially whole new people answering the question which means that you're kind of getting effectively bad data okay so maybe that makes maybe that makes better sense is that this is bad data or it's bad to compare it this way because it doesn't make any sense you can't make that you can't make that uh uh distinction here right uh all right let's see supporting the future of rust the key goal of the state of uh of rust survey is to shed light on challenges concerns and priorities restations are currently sitting with of those respondents who share their main worries about the rust futures 26 have concerns that the developers and maintainers behind rust are not properly supported a decrease of more than 30 from the previous year's finding one area focus in that the future may see how the project in conjunction with rust foundation can continue to push those numbers towards zero 38 percent uh have concern about rust becoming too complex only a small number of respondents were concerned about documentation corporate oversight or speed of evolution 34 of respondents are not worried about the future of rust at all this year's surveys reflects 21 decrease in fears about rust usage in the industry okay that's cool uh faith and rust staying power in general utility is clearly growing and more people find rust in becoming lasting members of the community uh as always our we are grateful for your honest feedback okay very cool so i think one thing about it becoming too complex is a real is a real deal rust feature set is growing extremely fast and you know that's always there's always a problem with things growing fast no matter what it really is and i feel like that's there is something very interesting there and so maybe there is a problem there uh let's see not enough usage in the industry okay that's going down that's i mean that must mean a positive reflection uh right it's too much interest uh too much interest from big companies wait what i don't understand can someone explain what it means to have too much interest from big companies anyone want to help me understand what that means is it is this literally just corpo bad worry that big companies will move the language into bad directions focus on their goals okay oh i see i see i see i see i see i see okay okay okay that makes sense that that's actually a good that's that's a cool a cool way to look at it um yeah and too much interest from big companies okay not enough oss contributions that's going down doesn't uh let's see it doesn't add specific features i want you know rust doesn't evolve quickly enough in sustainability of the language superseded by an alternative that's high okay so that's reasonable i think that that's a good a good thing to be wait hold on no becomes too complex is the big one superseded by an alternative i think is a a very real deal um becomes or what should probably end up happening is that there's there's always like the hype curve right and so the usage of rust my guess will in the end go down because it's not it's not for everything i mean you can use it for everything but should you use it for everything becomes too complex this is a real fear good uh tools and docs not accessible enough i don't think their docs are that great uh you have this beautiful doc site and often it's just filled with a bunch of lsp definitions right it's just like your function looks like this and you're like that's not really helpful how do you use the thing is there any words involved in it and that's what a lot of libraries are uh governance does not scale to match the requirements but okay to be fair chat jeopardy has actually really improved that because chat jeopardy they get access to all the code and you can just ask chat jeopardy how to use it but it's still old it's two years out so any new libraries you can't do that with so i've actually found that to be really nice for uh language uh documentation gaps is just go use uh just go use chat jeopardy right it's been really good on that uh i'm not worried okay people oh it's going down weird so again this is absolute numbers you can't really you can't really say something they did have an increase in overall respondence finishing so there should be technically more requirements but it but in all of these fields last year was larger i guess one thing you could say is that the worries themselves have gone down is that fair to say if there's technically more finished respondents and more overall or slightly less total response uh people taking the survey but in general all the metrics have gone down is that a positive direction i'd say that's probably a positive direction the people who've responded did go down it went down by six percent yeah if it's fair to say or not yeah that's okay that's reasonable uh another round of thanks uh okay thank you everybody awesome this is very it is very interesting to look at rust um i think that this this is a very bizarre graph and i don't know how to take this one at all right i think this one there's something here that just seems so out of sync right it helped us achieve our goals challenge remains effectively neutral adoption of rust is not as good right it does not as good for our team using rust uh has been worth the adoption down we're likely to use rust again in the future also go slightly down slash neutral so like this graph to me this one is just a really interesting graph i'm not sure what to make of it you know what i mean like what do we make of it i don't know could just be statistical yeah you're probably right it could just be noise less hype overall maybe maybe that's good maybe that's healthy the name is the rustogen but it's not sponsored of course by the rust foundation just so you know i gotta go pee again
