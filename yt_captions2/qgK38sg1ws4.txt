you can do this this is my job do you have any idea do you have any idea how games were developed for google stadia because i don't but it has got to be totally different and i bet it's fascinating and if we don't learn about it now we may never get the opportunity the thing is for traditional consoles there's always some development hardware and documentation that goes missing and finds its way onto ebay even if it takes years but this time everything's in the cloud so next month when google presses that button it's gone or is it see the thing about rug pulling an entire industry of passionate creatives is that someone is going to end up salty enough to say screw it to your nda and talk to the press and we found one such someone we not only got our hands on extensive documentation and screen capture so that we can preserve this important little piece of gaming history but we also got a stadia development node a piece of hardware designed to play stadia cloud games but from right in front of you time really is a flat circle isn't it i had no idea that these things even existed but they do and we're going to be taking a close look you know what else exists this message from our sponsor hetzner hesner offers high performance cloud servers for a great price they now cover the east and west coast of the united states with their latest location in hillsboro oregon use the code ltt22 at the link below for 20 off thank you when you create a game particularly aaa assets are often version controlled by perforce and stored on a local server as well as on your own workstation as you develop team members submit their changes to the server and new builds get created for qa to test these builds are then loaded onto dev kits that will attempt to run them locally on pre-production hardware that's pretty much the workflow that we've shown before and the process with stadia game development was similar but with a key difference and that's that for most developers there is no local testing hardware at all instead you would have to submit your build and wait for it to transfer to google servers a process that could take up to 40 minutes for wait for it about two gigabytes of content for context a 60 gigabyte game should take just a few minutes to load onto a dead kit console as long as you've got good infrastructure talk about an efficiency nightmare there are workarounds if you're desperate someone can make a change in unity for example and then just try it on their development workstation to see if it works but to properly verify you need to run it on the same hardware that the user will have in a build package that's why in a typical studio most devs would have their own console or more than one console at their desk so they can quickly verify changes of course that version of things you know where stadia doesn't have local dead kits doesn't really jive with the existence of this does it ah well when these slow transfer speeds become an insurmountable problem for you you can actually reach out to google and request a local dev node like this one which is basically a stadia cloud server that sits right on your desk as far as our friend could tell they didn't just hand them out to anyone though you had to justify why you needed one and even once you were approved the experience wasn't exactly uh the white glove for example they asked google about providing controllers and the reply was a link to the product page where they could buy them for msrp nice so with all that work out of the way what exactly is it do you get in the mail on the surface it appears to be a stadia branded lenovo think station but maybe we're going to find something more interesting on the inside there we go a little dusty what are we looking at here well it isn't getting less standard looking i love that lenovo does their front i o on an actual hard pcb instead of with wires so that's pretty cool for cable management wow 64 gigs of ram that's a lot for a gaming pc i wonder if that's just lenovo's minimum spec mind you think they're ordering enough to customize the branding on the front oh that's apparently really easy to do modular even the cpu is only a six core meaning that this thing pedestrian spec other than you know obviously having a workstation class gpu in it and even this workstation gpu it's not exactly a powerful one not that we'll have any way of knowing that for sure because unfortunately we couldn't find any reference to the radeon pro v320 on amd's site whatsoever and in fact the only resource we could find was a tech power up page that had different specs listed than the card that we have the page says 16 gigs of ram but ours apparently only has eight so it's actually even worse than a basic v320 no it's not bad is our basic blank t-shirts ltdstore.com so if this thing isn't powerful then how could it be useful for development well it's because it's not for actually doing development like a console dev kit this station is for testing to see how your game is going to run stop for making the game so it makes sense that you would want a test node that isn't too powerful you'd want something that's as close to the servers that google is using to run the service as possible that way what the dev sees there at their station should be representative of the end user experience now obviously an army of lenovo think stations isn't exactly what google is using in their data centers they actually confirmed the hardware specs for stadia and we know that each of their servers can run four 1080p instances ours can only do one but it seems to be pretty close airing on the side of not as powerful our dev friend who sent us the node mentioned that with how well some games ran at 1080p through the cloud the data center nodes might actually have better gpus and i guess obviously the 4k nodes would be substantially better than this but we weren't able to get our hands on one of those stadia splash screen in the bios this is what happens this is it the fan gets louder okay fans ramping up and fits so much fan in this bad boy and that's actually as far as we're gonna get with the software if we connected this ethernet cable it might boot up but our kit would immediately phone home reporting a location that is hundreds or thousands of kilometers from where it's supposed to be and our friend would get a nasty letter in the mail from google's lawyers but that doesn't mean our adventure is over if we could plug it into a network and launch a game it might look a little something like this you launched the stadia partner portal on your pc and select a node from the pool it'll either be a remote one or your local one if you're so lucky once it's reserved you then create an instance of your game by selecting the application and which version of it you want to launch there's a one terabyte drive in our node so you can store plenty of iterations of your projects as long as you have the space you select which end point you want your instance to launch from and boom we're in at this point you're testing your game like you would on any other dev kit pretty cool but this local node actually still suffers from a problem that the main servers at google also have when you're testing unfinished software crashes and hangs are inevitable and they can sometimes be so bad that you need to restart your test console with stadia that takes at least 10 to 15 minutes for it to reboot and re-register itself with the back end i don't know when the last time you restarted your ps5 or your xbox was but i mean a minute maybe two minutes tops so it's easy to see why developers might want to avoid this sort of workflow considering how much time is potentially wasted at all these steps of the game creation process but somehow they were still doing it developing for stadia and everything seemed to be going pretty okay so why did google just kill this entire project the memes have certainly been fun but humor aside there are also legions of satisfied stadia customers and successful devs who were making money hand over fist at least once the payment model got changed from getting cash up front to a cut of the subscription revenue based on time played so there are people whose lives have been affected in a very negative way by ghoul's decision here like if you had a big chunk of the user base playing your game every day we're talking potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars a month without hard numbers we can't say exactly how many stadia users and stadia pro subscribers there were but a few rough internet put the peak at about 2 million and that sounds realistic given that anyone with a phone could install the free app however stadia pro was a monthly 10 subscription and the estimates seemed to vary for that one between 160 to'0 000 active users if we average to 170 that's 1.7 million dollars in revenue per month which is a lot of money but not nearly enough when you consider the overhead that it needs to support the stadia team at google was apparently hundreds of employees nearly 300 at its peak plus they needed to maintain hardware and programs for distributing it and infrastructure and obviously they needed to pay out a significant chunk of that revenue in shares to game developers but in spite of how obviously unsustainable all of that sounds now in the aftermath apparently at no point did anyone internally at google seem to acknowledge that stadia was on its deathbed despite all of the outside rumors it was seemingly business as usual right up until the very bitter end in february of 2021 google shut down their in-house dev studio but insisted that it was for the best so they could focus on the business side of things then in july they tried lowering their cut of the sales then in september they moved jack buser to google cloud's head of gaming solutions in november they cut the price of the hardware from 60 to 22 dollars as the program was now two years old cute and then in february of 2022 they said that everything was perfectly fine despite rumors of an internal stadia deprioritization right our inside source says that they and every other studio were being lied to just as much as we were and we have no way of knowing how high up the chain you actually needed to be to know what was going on when rumors popped up in the summer they emailed corporate the dev friend and they got a reassuring reply a couple of days before the announcement they actually got a new version of the sdk the software development kit that was pushed out to developers to work on stadia an industry colleague of our friends from another studio even flew from japan to san francisco to talk about the future of stadia with google the day before they shut it all down now luckily for the team we got this unit from the writing was on the wall and they had already pivoted to porting their game to other platforms as for others google's actually trying pretty hard to properly pay out studios fair shares almost like like a severance for a fired employee customers have already been refunded or are going to get refunds and google is isn't broke so hopefully the check's clear and that's all sorted out pretty quickly in fact it they've done such a good job of canning this thing that the person we spoke with only had good things to say about their experience dealing with google they all seem friendly they're nice to work with it almost has this like super weird mutual breakup vibe will anyone ever trust google if they try to re-enter the gaming space almost certainly not but there doesn't seem to be a lot of anger either with the entirety of what's referred to as the google graveyard being in plain view for anyone to see it's almost like everyone kind of knew this was coming but they were willing to take the bag of money for their work and see if who knows maybe this is one of those projects that stays hey maybe let's hear the game the name came from stay the uh not so much though maybe it will stay around in some form i have no evidence to support either of these theories but i think it's possible that google could sell the technology to an interested party and i also don't think it's impossible that stadia could reach surface as a business to business product say a mobile carrier wanted to introduce a cloud gaming service they could use white label stadia to spin it up extremely quickly until that happens though it's yet another line on killed by google.com which for those who are not in the know is an amazing site that chronicles all the products and services that google has launched ran sometimes for years and ultimately killed at least in this case unlike google play music which is still better than youtube music they have fully compensated their customers and seemingly partners but there is one more thing that i would like to see resolved that's the stadia controller while it can be used on your pc with a usbc cable i suspect that many gamers in 2022 and beyond are not going to want to deal with that and are going to end up junking them so google i'm asking you please either provide a fix or open up the firmware so that the community can work on getting it working wirelessly over bluetooth please and thank you and thank you for checking out
