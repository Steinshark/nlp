sager yes i'm very sorry for this move whoa it's not a draw what's happening it's me [laughter] no good luck all right it's very annoying why don't you just start with c5 i thought you'll go d4 maybe you'll go in some opening but once you play knight c3 i guess yeah it's very boring now i'm happy that it's boring position but still the problem is with you even boring you will make it exciting by the end of it [music] this maybe it's theory have to do the thing of the chess players st at the ceiling there there there there there yeah yeah yeah this is i'm [music] not was like wating i can tell you the theory if you don't remember it yeah knight c3 queen b3 e knight d5 bd5 e6 they're so smart they're such smart chess players but what about knight b6 here yeah that's what i was thinking i was like kn6 looks pretty reasonable but maybe doing anything to avoid being in a room now you'll be in a are an exlar maybe let's try it yeah i don't know what happens neither good luck thek lu who won sorry who won over there we're having some big games some big battles but it's not going my way it's a long mat you're you're like jokovic you you you dissect the information and then you oh my god it just got so much darker feel like all the light just left my soul [music] um i think that's okay chad that's not okay tell me society is so weird now all this chat this chat that take take take yeah i don't know what to do i also looked at this and thought okay let's go here i really don't want to play this move yeah it doesn't look in the spirit of the position but nope okay not at all yeah i just went for a simple and bad solution yes yes yes i am so here's a okay you have to stack your in the first no this is horrible yeah i played very very badly this game so far okay but uh it's like it's not over yeah are you motivating me yes i see you don't want like an opponent who's just sad the whole game and i feel i feel bad you know this sort of no i'm i'm i'm just lulling you in you know it's part of my strategy i just have to be careful of your tactics because they'll come at any point yeah the secret is like not to let me get anything tactical ever yes but i think no one is successful at that right it depends it's a terrible position oh my god and i can't like decide on what to do because the position is so bad very bad very okay i should maybe try and yeah it's good it's good keep thinking it builds my confidence very falsely yeah but not okay let's push the queen away i guess it should be fine unless i'm missing something obvious here it's pretty good big question of whether it was smart or not seems smart very positional yeah maybe there were other options as a kn g5 i have to do something soer you're making this very difficult for me let's take this [music] really what else who's coming i thought rook c8 yeah i also yeah once i realized i have queen d5 i this this this seemed okay ah this is what i hate playing me okay let's go back let's now really of course what come on this is like the beast coming alive i'm i'm like adiban but from a discount store discount i'm like adiban but yeah you're from okay but let's try it yeah like i'm not even taking that you're not taking that no let's see my goodness spend too much time whoa oh sorry no it's okay i don't like that move it's too late [music] you're psyching me out oh i lost my time oh what oh my goodness very there that i oh my gosh but you could no rook b8 that's why i hesitated no i just like go forward i fought back i'm i'm not totally unhappy i'm this this position might not be so bad hello it's me the person that just played that game uh with the white pizza some of you may know me uh some of you may not for those of you that may not know me and not know this channel my name is levy rosman also known as gotham chess and uh this was a chess game that i played when i traveled to toronto canada for the candidates tournament the most important tournament of 2024 uh and uh my opponent for this game and two previous games which uh i made a video about i might link them in the description as well my opponent was sagar sha from chz base india that incredible channel uh excellent chess journalist sagur is very strong he has two international he has two grandmaster norms and a peak rating of like 2460 very close to being grandmaster but it didn't stop me from beating him twice in blitz and getting really arrogant and this game is a little bit of uh you know trash talk gone wrong uh as you saw uh i was very confident because i had won the two previous games that we played and i was playing different openings i was in the zone and then i lost on time which was a rude awakening uh but i think this is a very instructive game so i'm going to show it to you in a little bit more detail so you know you were not confused about anything that's going on uh and then you'll your goal is to learn three things from this game okay that's the goal if you leave this video didn't learn three things you're a bozo so i opened with c4 the english opening boom you just learned that that's called the english knight f6 knight c3 and this opening is called the symmetrical english because very good it's symmetrical i played e3 here to try to build into the center with my queen's pawn he actually can copy me like if he really wants he can copy me the whole way uh but he doesn't sagur played g6 which is trying to fien ketto the bishop on the g7 square and um i also realized the board noises might be a little bit loud i do apologize for that and i played d4 he took i took and now rather than finishing his plan with bishop to g7 uh sager played the move d5 and he played that because if he did that for the beginners watching and the early intermediates if you have a chance to dominate your opponent's center and walk your pawns in safely against knights very often that's the best move especially when the knights cannot hang out in the center of the board okay so that would mean the knight has to go somewhere over here and there's a very good chance the knight will be trapped because it cannot re-enter because you defend the pawns so anytime you have an opportunity like that to seize the center march your pawns forward boot around the knights it's probably the best thing to do beginners miss this type of stuff a lot my opponent is not a beginner he's close though and he plays the move d5 i'm just kidding plays d5 so now i take he takes and here i did something stupid here i completely forgot uh the the the variation and yes chess at a high level you kind of have to memorize openings because we're all a bunch of nerds and try to prove that we have an intellectual advantage over our opponents when in reality we're just memorizing everything and we don't have to think i'm not projecting by the way that is actually what we are so here rather than trading and allowing my opponent to have a dominant queen which pressures the center pressures my knight and easily develops you really don't want to allow your opponent's queen into the center uh if you cannot attack it and i don't have a single way of attacking the queen this is just a trade so a queen in the center is quite good when it can't be attacked uh so i didn't want to do that but the best move here is queen b3 and the point of queen b3 is that i put pressure on this knight uh if he takes me i have a nice little trick i can play bishop c4 and i target the pawn on f7 which could potentially lead to a checkmate like if he tries to run away i can play here here at a very least i can win the night back and at the very most i probably just checkmate him in like 10 moves but queen b3 is the move and i forgot about that and i went here and my logic was well if bishop c4 he takes my knight i move the queen i'm so smart it's the same position it we we just reached it you see the most recent move we just reach it via a different move order i was like ah whatever bishop c4 i'm so smart and then he went here and i was like oh that's why i have to move the queen out first stupid right yes obviously that's why i had to move the queen out first because if i move the queen out night goes here i have d5 and i'm again i just told you this i just taught you this i told you you got to learn three things from this video you're learning anything pay attention stop looking at the sidebar stop being distracted stop doing chores watching me like well you put the phone up and you listen to the video and you shower like you can't even watch chess you got to look at the screen for a second all right pay attention you have a pawn in the center of the board that can walk forward and attack an opponent's knight safely it's probably the best move i messed up though right because now i cannot play d5 because i would lose my own bishop so i went here here and i all of a sudden i'm like oh boy oh this is really bad because my pawn is just a target i don't know how to to defend it now the computer just says give the pawn up gotham i really wish i had the computer on during the game because this is what i would have done and apparently you can even trade the queens and play this move threatening the bishop and a fork and then he would play bishop e5 and then i would attack his bishop and then he would move the bishop back here and okay i mean like this position i can work with but i play very passively and here i you know i i started defending my pawn and i'm i was very worried about the move bishop g4 bishop g4 doesn't work right now because of time to learn a second thing when your opponent pins your knight to your queen with their bishop if certain criteria are met you can counter them very swiftly and brutally number one the bishop has to be unguarded it's unguarded right now nobody's protecting it uh number two if you have a bishop pointing at the f7 square and it's only protected by the king condition met sometimes you can take on f7 with check and if they take back you have a knight jump which then checks the king and wins the bishop but certain criteria have to be met which i just read out to you and if you don't remember them just back the video up because that's how youtube works i would play knight to g5 safely and then i would play queen g4 the knight has to be able to move safely it it can move safely here is not safe because it gets taken then you lose the knight and you're probably going to lose a queen if you take so bishop b3 right i know that bishop g4 is possible and then when sager castled i was like well i can castle but then he has bishop g4 so let's play h3 and then he went after my bishop i castled and he took my bishop and i'm worse i have just i'm just worse here i mean like no matter what why am i worse he has the bishop pair bishop pair is advantageous like if i have nothing to show for the bishop pair if he just has two bishops he's better because the bishops are you know bishops are better than knights and um also i have what's called an isolated pawn it's a pawn that has no neighbors nothing on c and e everything in black's position has a neighbor all the pawns and if my opponent is able to block stuff like for instance uh here here here you know get like a position like like he's he's just much better he's going to target my knight he's targeting my pawn he's going to target like he's just blocking my pawn and he's not letting it go anywhere and i was thinking well this is really bad uh i'm much worse as you can see minus point you know minus point4 with white in 13 moves is very impressively terrible and i thought okay i'm i i got to you know i got to do something i did want to go back because if i go back to d1 i didn't know what my next move was and that's really what chest is all about he's going to move his rook to the center and if i play like knight g5 for example i mean he will attack my rook and then he will probably trade knights with me and then he's going to put the bishop on d5 and i'm i have a horrible position like i i don't know what i'm doing i can't move my bishop because it's protecting everything i can't move my knight i don't know um so i didn't do that and i said you know what i'm going to go forward and i thought he has to go knight to d5 in this position but he plays the top engine move i wasn't so sure about this move because it attacks my queen and potentially kind of like pinballs mch my you know like the pinball machine you bounce all over the place he pinballs the queen here and then you know but i thought well he's creating some weaknesses and you know knight d5 and then at this point like i already said if if i start making a lot of exchanges i'm just going to be much worse so i thought okay and as you heard from our banter he was like i need to stop you from getting to a tactical position cuz i really like tactical positions i'm always looking for counterattacks and interesting moves and that's when i found the move knight to g5 and now i'm back in the game i'm targeting the bishop and if he takes he will double isolate his pawns but i'm also targeting the knight so the bishop can't move if he takes me well we're trading but then i'm not going to have an isolated pawn anymore so he took and now it is extremely important look my move keeps the advantage the same this move triples the advantage for black why what is the the difference between these two captures if you've been paying attention it's time to learn a third thing are you ready isolated pawn i just told you this move improves my structure puts my pawns together and now my a pawn is isolated but it's a lot less easy to exploit and now these two pawns can actually march up together more on that later as you saw in the game uh he plays bishop to d5 but he makes a big mistake and suddenly i'm better and suddenly i take over now i was pretty pessimistic about my position most of the game um but i was like you know arrogant i won a few games i'm like oh oh you know it's in my favor i'm i'm going to be in completely good shape now the best move here for him is to just move bishop let's say to f5 get out of the way and now uh he will probably kick my knight out and then he will play like queen d7 say i play rook c1 he's going to go here connect his rooks that's what we call that so the rooks can work together like a battery pack and then they will you know go here but he went bishop d5 and he completely blundered c4 he what he blundered here is that he could play r c8 he thought he could play rook c8 i can't take the bishop because my queen is hanging while then it's really convenient i can take the bishop without hanging my queen and he missed that and at this point i was thinking oh i'm you know i'm definitely playing for a win bishop c6 and now a very important move i can't push this pawn because i hang my rook yeah i mean if if i play rook c1 in this position i i can do that but i was like momentum is on my side i got to sacrifice the rook i mean it's what i'm known for my rook is not doing a damn thing you know what his bishop is doing it is literally the backbone of the entire king's position if all the squares around the black king get weakened i'm going to have attacking chances and that is why the engine does not evaluate this position as better for black despite black being up two points that is because some you're about to learn a fourth thing a bonus thing can you believe it four things you're going to learn in this video pieces and chess have a relative value this is not really applicable for like a 900 elo player but it's something that you add to your toolbox and you'll keep in mind as you progress in chess pieces and chess have a relative value bishops are three and rooks are five but not all bishops and rooks are the same like this rook hasn't moved it's been 20 moves that rook just perished without even moving right the bishop for black was a three and a half point piece maybe a four-point piece and i mean the black bishop right now is just a regular you know but now my bishop i mean hello look at the real estate that it's going to scout out over there right it's a serious problem for him to deal with and so i didn't have to do that and now not only did i not have to do that um that was probably the wrong move because the best move here was to take this bishop allow him to save this bishop let's say to c3 take this pawn but i thought well he's just going to stop me yeah yeah yeah but the computer finds a way you know queen d7 queen b5 and basically the computer is like okay we trade and now i will join you know this pawn and once that pawn gets there black resids cu black will lose everything i wasn't thinking like that i was actually you know i did the and then i took the wrong bishop so i should have taken the bishop that probably would have led to the pass pawn and the computer finds some way to defend it like playing b6 trying to you know get rid of the pawn keep my pawns doubled important keeping them doubled and then saving the bishop uh by the way instructive kind of a fifth thing instead of giving me two pawns side by side you give me stacked pawns the alternative is giving me pawns that are side by side which is very very bad connected pawns like i just showed you improving white's pawn structure but i was hyperfixated on the dark squares so i made a mistake and now i was like okay i'm arrogant you know i'm going to i'm going to move my knight i'm going to play you know knight here bishop h6 checkmate i'm going to play bishop d2 bishop c3 checkmate sager is never going to see this coming i mean international master sch international flaster like i he's going to he's going to miss the checkmate then he played rook c8 and i was like do i play rook b1 to attack the pawn do i play rook c1 to support this pawn do i play knight e4 to begin my plan do i play knight f3 to begin my plan do i play bishop d2 bishop c3 like what do i do and i spent a lot of time and i played rook c1 which is you know a fine move uh the computer prefers i begin with the knight i also thought about queen h4 by the way which threatens mate but as it so happens this is a very powerful blockade it's not easy to break through it and how about this look let's say you calculate pawn to g4 pawn takes g4 queen h7 mate oh my god you're so smart you're so smart did you know that you're like a genius here's the thing in chess we got to pretend our opponents are not morons i know that's a hard thing to do but after g4 black would play rook takes c4 because every time you move something in chess the position changes laterally vertically diagonally right so i don't defend that pawn anymore now not only can i not take this pawn my pawn is going to get taken soon but by the bishop and then i'm going to lose my queen it's a tough position i didn't know what to do i spent a little bit too much time just from a practical standpoint also got excit it and spit on the microphone i um got you know two into the position i didn't know what to do i play rook c1 and now sager kicks out my knight and he kind of blocks his uh position and he plays e5 i thought e5 was a mistake it is a mistake and it's instructive it's a mistake that gives me quite a sizable advantage because now i have a pass pawn a moment ago i couldn't move my pawn forward now i think sager here just got caught up in the subreddit anarchy chest and he thought on pant was forced which i don't really blame him for but it's actually not that has not been put into law and i played queen b6 which is the best move i thought this was very instructive trying to trade the queens control the dark squares and then start pushing my pawns forward i thought well he's he's just you know he's toast takes takes plays a4 now i can begin uh moving into the position i thought you know a3 makes sense because i'm on a dark square so he can't target me with a light squared bishop and i thought all right easy peasy time to convert this position plays rook a8 my biggest advantage of the game finally i've earned my right to trash talk i just won two games the first game dominance the second game crazy back and forth this game was a defensive masterclass now look at me i'm pushing his is back he's going to go bishop d7 i'm going to go c5 c6 c7 c8 i'm already controlling the promotion square right everything is good he goes bishop d3 i'm like oh god all right let me kick him out now i'm like ah that's annoying now of course here i should play like c5 for some reason i don't because i have like two seconds on my clock so then i go here he comes here and i'm like a do i push do i go here and i make a move and i lose on time like i played this move and i straight up lost on time i had like four 4 seconds and uh i got humbled i was uh i was in a good position um when you have like less than three four every time we make a move we gained two seconds so it's not like we were playing some you know dirty flag thing but this is a very instructive position how you know white is down material white do down a knight for a rook straight up we both have six pawns but my pieces relatively dominate his rooks like he has nothing plays rook a6 i play c5 he cannot move a piece so this shows you the relative value of pieces and the fact that my bishop and my knight are probably four point pieces and you cannot really argue these are five-point rooks right so it's kind of interesting like chess is very instructive in that way it's a very instructive end game it's a shame i lost it on the clock i would have liked to convert this game and win a resounding dominant victory and go home to my hotel room in toronto and win absolutely nothing literally no prize whatsoever then share this game uh with all of you and try to feel good about myself to remind myself of all of my shortcomings not just as a chess player but also as a human being on planet earth as well as my insignificance in the overall general scheme of things in the universe and the history of time and on that existential note the series between myself and sagar sha ended two to one in his uh in my favor not in his favor he won this game but that doesn't mean that he gets uh uh and bonus for winning the whole thing uh next time we see each other we hope to play some more games let me know if you enjoy this irl content and uh i will uh be posting a lot more of it that's all i have for you today get out of here
