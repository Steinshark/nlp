a minimal esoteric programming language designed to make your brain hurt it's turning complete but not designed to build actual software it's more like a work of art that challenges the status quo it was created in 1993 by swiss physics student urban mueller it turns out it turns out brain is older than javascript i'm pretty sure of it where the goal was to create a language with the smallest possible compiler it was built for the amiga 2.0 up i will say that that is actually pretty cool that it represents the smallest compiler it's kind of a unique metric i i don't know there's something about that that's that's exciting you know what i mean it's just kind of exciting gradient system and the compiler weighs in at under 200 bytes a brain how does it work oh goodness how is this possible how can you create that it's even doing cis calls it's doing cis calls i don't even know i don't know what four minus bang b means but it's dual ciscoll you know what i mean this is it's incredible look at this how is maine right here oh my goodness maine's recursive oh what how's that i have never what a recursive mane what that can't be real that can't i must be misreading this i have to be misreading it oh my this program starts with a 30 000 by one-dimensional array all values are initialized to zero then it provides a movable pointer that you can manipulate with eight different commands use angle brackets to move the pointer left or right and buy one cell at a time then increment or decrement the value in a cell using plus or minus use a period to output the byte at the pointer's current location or use a comma to accept input and store it at the pointer's current location and finally use opening and closing brackets to create a loop notice how brain [ __ ] doesn't require silly things like variables functions and classes to get started with brain [ __ ] delete who needs those silly things like variables and in classes and all that let's go brain started with brain [ __ ] delete your operating system and install amiga os then create a file ending in dot bf which stands for brand any characters that are not the eight i mentioned previously will be ignored as a comment at this point we have an array with 30 000 8-bit numbers all set to zero to say hi mom we'll need to set each number to its corresponding ascii character we can increment the first cell then enter a loop with an opening bracket for each iteration of the loop will decrement that current cell by 5 then use an angle bracket to move one cell to the right we'll increment that cell by three then move back to the left and close the loop the loop will continue until the original cell goes back to zero at which point it will exit we now have a value of 103 at index one we can move i did not understand that okay i must have missed that it's this i somehow missed that this was a real thing how did this get 103 decrementing wraps oh my goodness oh they're 250 oh my goodness it's so brilliant no it's using zero falsy and wrapping a bite oh man oh man i i did not see that one coming i'm laughing like someone with smoking all his life oh my goodness increment it to 104 then use a period to output it that corresponds to the letter h and ascii we can increment it again to get 105 which corresponds to the letter i now we continue this process of manipulating memory like cavemen until we output all the characters that we need now to run your code use right click copy and paste it into one of the many online interpreters congratulations you just said hi to your mom and brain [ __ ] this has been brain [ __ ] in 100 seconds if you want to see more brain [ __ ] content on this channel make sure to hit the like button and subscribe thanks for watching and i will see you in what does that code do i'm way too lazy to type this in there's just no way i want to type that in but at the exact same time i kind of want to type that in oh no oh no what has happened to me oh no google lens yeah oh subscribe to fireship and it must be subscribed to fireship that's actually a pretty good that that could very well be it oh man subscribe to fireship people okay clearly a good move clearly a good move oh okay well that felt good that feels really good what benefit does this language even offer smallest compiler did you not recursive main function it doesn't have variables or classes you just got what you need which is a one-dimensional array of bytes i mean that's really all your program is anyways it's just a big ass array of bytes okay you're just putting all this meaning okay you're implicitly casting chars to things like not chars it's disgusting it says touring intended a big and infinitely long strip of paper or 30 000 bytes that's i mean that's probably infinity back in his day 30 000 bytes that's outstanding uh yeah i'm a huge i i think i think uh i think serverless brain is where it's at okay i really do think that that's where it's at perhaps one day if i have enough time we'll create our own javascript where you can output elements and you just have you have 30 000 dom nodes to use and you have to wiggle around and output them
