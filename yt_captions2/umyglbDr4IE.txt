- i'm here today at peacemaker filmworks who have worked on small
projects you might've heard of like deadpool 2 and the new ghostbusters. they're known for their crazy camera cars, but today their space is being used for possibly the craziest 3d
capture setup in the world. created by volumetric camera systems, we've got over two hundred cpu cores, one hundred terabytes of storage, and if you follow me in here, two hundred and thirty nine cameras, capturing a staggering
nine hundred and twenty k image thirty times a second. which begs the question, who needs to capture that much detail? oh yeah, it's neill freaking blomkamp, the director of district 9, elysium, and the film we're
looking at today, demonic. it dropped yesterday and the
way they use 3d capture in it is just mind bendingly cool. and, terrifying. and do you know what's also terrifying? this segue to our sponsor. thanks to origin pc for
sponsoring this video. origin pc's can be
customized with 11th gen intel core processors, and nvidia geforce rtx 30 series graphics with max-p design. backed by a 24/7 support team, check out origin pc at the link below. (upbeat music) this whole setup starts
with the yi camera. a 4k action camera
that's, well, inexpensive. volumetric camera systems or vcs would've obviously preferred
to have cinema cameras all around here but, when you have to buy two hundred
of something plus spares, it gets expensive fast and, it's not like these
are bad little cameras. each one has the sony imx377 sensor, the same one as in the google pixel and, when you have over two hundred of them pointed at a subject, you can get quite a bit
of detail out of it. each camera has custom firmware and an extra pin installed
in the usb cable, that allows for sync
across all of the cameras. this allows for the clocks to be synced between every single camera so, if i hit play on the
master camera right here which is conveniently marked
by not having a front plate, all two hundred and thirty nine cameras start recording and then, click it again and, they all turn off. the special thing about this rig though, is how all of that is turned into 3d data. this is accomplished
using feature detections, so, all of the tape in the background creates these sharp edges, so ai can go in and figure
out where each camera is compared to all of the
others in the scene. also every two cameras, so like these two right here, are used to create a stereo pair and using some complicated trigonometry, they're able to calculate the depth of anything in front of them. this is one of the keys to
why the vcs camera system is so sick. by using this depth data in post, they can just tell the software to discard everything behind the subject, removing the need for green screens and allowing for complete
three sixty capture of the subject. again, using a bunch of
complicated math and ai, nvidia is actually a sponsor of vcs and contributed a gv100 to help crunch those huge equations, they're able to create a
point cloud of the subject with all of the depth data. on it's own, this is really cool, it removes the need for a
bunch of post processing time because the animators
don't have to worry about things like cloth or hair physics, but, the huge advantage over motion capture is the ability to shoot
full color textures of the actors in full makeup and costume. this does have it's own
set of problems though. the large five meter ring of cameras surrounding me is great for filming larger action sequences but, when you consider each
one of these cameras has a wide angle one hundred
and fifty five degree lens, if you're standing even
a meter or two away, there won't be nearly
as much texture data, which is where the high
resolution array comes in. this was originally
made using a trampoline that was cut in half and
held together with zip ties but, they upgraded to this steel frame for shooting with neill. anyway, sequences will be planned out so that the actor can do
their larger movements in the large array and then
land in the high resolution array for parts that require more detail. obviously the camera
that is just a foot away from my face is going to be
getting a lot more detail than the ones further out. even that though isn't
quite enough detail for vcs, like, they are going up
against cinema cameras, so they're up scaling all of the footage from 4k to 8k for every single camera. they custom made an algorithm by capturing 4k footage on these cameras, down scaled it to 1080p, and then used the 4k
footage to train the ai for their best chance
at up scaling it to 8k. and with all that in place, it still isn't quite the level of detail that is needed for a full
blownsies hollywood film. unfortunately there isn't really any way around the detail at this point, but, that isn't really a problem. for demonic, they did a
lot less post processing than i expected, and left in a lot of the
artifacts that happen naturally and it really adds to
the horror of the film. it's super cool how neill and the crew even used stuff like the point cloud data to act as a transition between real life and the simulation parts of the movie. as you've probably guessed by now though, running over two hundred cameras at once uses a crap load of storage, like, this thing is creating
nine thousand five hundred gigapixels per second, and seven to fourteen
million polygons per frame. which translates into
about ten terabytes of data for every twenty minutes of shooting. the first day of shooting
on neill's movie, poor tobias and scott of vcs were here until six am grabbing the data with the two computers that they had, so, clearly an upgrade was needed. surrounding the camera way, we have twenty four
computers from oats studio. each one is equipped
with a ten core i7-6950x, nice, sixty four gigabytes of ram, and a gtx 1080 ti. they don't actually need the gpu's, but they certainly need
the cpu ram and i/o to copy the data from
each stand of cameras. sorting all two hundred plus video files was a huge problem for vcs, so they created their own custom program called clippy copy, named after everyone's favorite paperclip. that is based off of the robocopy api that automatically pulls and sorts the insane number of files that are made every time that they press play. once it gets to the post processing stage, they create a global
alignment of all the cameras. this is basically looking
at the features on the wall to figure out where each
camera is in 3d space. after that, they create a depth map of everything in the room using the stereo pairs and, from there, it's very simple to create a point cloud of the entire scene. every point in the cloud will give you not just the position in 3d space, but also the rgb data of every point. every three points in the point cloud is then poisson mapped to create polygons and, using some extra ai goodness, using the camera data, the textures are then improved again. after all that we get
what basically looks like the best video game character model ever. so, like right here we have a capture of tobias's nan just
chilling in unreal engine, and, i'm able to just
sort of float around her in, oh geez, unreal engine using wasd. it's just so cool. and she's just playing
back in real time in 3d, this is crazy. this processing obviously requires some balling computers that were provided by maingear in hp so, down here we actually have
two tiny backpack rigs rocking an rtx 2080. with all of that, the director
has an incredible amount of flexibility in post, so, they're able to pick camera angles, import the character into
any environment they want, and relight the scene to their liking. in order to relight the character though, there can't be any shadows which means they need a lot of light. and, they've got a lot of light. in our office we actually use
these same arri skypanels, we've got three of them, and each one will run
you about twenty grand, so, naturally you're using
twenty four of them here, but, even that was not enough light. while we were here today they actually installed
an additional eleven arri m40's which are an
additional forty grand each, so, unsurprisingly, they rented
the lights for this shoot. it's also insanely hot in here right now. probably can't tell
because my shirt's black, ittstore.com, but i'm drenched. you don't necessarily need
a balling studio setup like this though to do volumetric capture. since they're effectively
just action cameras on a stand, vcs can record anywhere and just, you know, footage
goes locally on the cameras and they have batteries built in. this way they can set up in say like, the jungle, at a farm, or at a trade show and capture jensen huang
and give us the data, allowing us to have a little 3d jensen wherever we want. for an extra portable setup, they created this little box that has an image sensor
in each one of these holes. and you can set up, say, five of them around the subject and
boom, you're good to go. there are additional applications outside of cinema 3d capture. one of their biggest funders
is actually epic games who hope to use this technology to do things like the
travis scott concert, but, without all the time and money required to 3d model the whole thing, like, he could just do a set
surrounded by these cameras and, bippity bop, he's
straight into fortnite. they're also looking into medical and military applications, so, say there's a world renowned surgeon who knows how to do a
really obscure knee surgery. that surgery can then be recorded in 3d and played back from any
angle for training purposes. future improvements are
planned for both hardware and software, so hopefully one day cinema grade 3d models can
be captured volumetrically. obviously getting better,
higher resolution cameras would allow for a better result, but as more ground truth data
is captured and imported, they can train ai algorithms to better interpret the footage, so, hopefully we'll be able
to get a similar level of fidelity to these two hundred cameras with just seventy or so. so huge shout out to tobias and scott for showing us their awesome tech, and neill blomkamp and chris harvey for sharing their incredible expertise. demonic is available now, so, check it out at the link below, and as you'd expect from
