ladies and gentlemen in today's video i am going to teach you something that may or may not change your life it will not just change your life it will also probably change the life of everybody that you play chess against in the future now this needs a little bit of backstory there is an individual in this world named volen jov that might not mean anything to you you may know this individual as witty alien witty alien is a chess content creator you might have seen witty alien uh on your shorts feed yelling things like brilliant among other things i saw witty alien on my shorts feed and witty alien has an opening that he likes to play called the alien gambit and that is the purpose of today's video i had no idea what the alien gambit was then i built a huge chess opening file on the alien gambit and in this video i'm going to give that to you then i'm going to play three games against my subscribers to show you how powerful this opening really is the alien gambit is unbelievable all right it starts after e4 c6 so you got to play e4 they got to play a caroan you're going to take the center and now you can play probably knight c3 or knight d2 technically it doesn't really matter i mean obviously you know if they don't follow what they're supposed to do you take the center you develop your bishops you play typical normal chess let's say you play knight here they take and now they play knight to f6 at this point there's two most common moves bishop here targeting your knight and knight to f6 targeting your knight they need to play knight to f6 targeting your knight offering a trade this is called the tart toow now if they play it like this you could probably still get away with this which i will show you later but the entire purpose of this opening is to put this knight on g5 and to sacrifice the knight that's what we are trying to do we're trying to sacrifice the knight force our opponent's king to move and then we start going after the king now the most common move in this position is them attacking your knight we will look at some alternatives later you sacrifice the knight and then you develop your knight you will notice i am not developing the bishop to c4 check i'm saving that i'm saving that move as a possibility this bishop also likes to come here quite frequently but in general this is white's plan bring the bishop out castle rook to e1 so when you castle your rook will come to the e file then knight to e5 and then you go on a big attack now here black's possibili in this position the most common move is this which is a that is this is the most common move in that position and after 95 check you straight up win the bishop back and you're completely winning so the most common move is a blunder that's how you know this opening is really potent at beginner level and then you just go here and and then you can play bishop c4 check you can play castle you just take take you are winning by a pawn black's king is extremely weak and the game will end very very soon i mean there's you you'll swarm the king with your bishop and like this and it's game over so it's insane that the most common move in this position is a blunder now there are two setups here that i want you to remember then i will show you the top computer way to play so you know you're playing a cheater or you know you know how to refute the alien gambit bishop out and not bishop out if they play bishop out the bishop becomes a target you play knight e5 check right away you don't do that otherwise knight e5 check right away against the bishop and then what you do is you play here you have to give the check if they go e6 now we play g4 so we're trying to get rid of the bishop's defending of the pawn right we play very aggressively we turn this bishop into a target right away if you're sitting there going i'm never going to memorize this don't worry the moves are in the description you can put it into an analysis board you'll be fine and there's lines like bishop e4 we take and we get this massive attack with g5 you can even sack your rook because if they take it you checkmate them if you get this you got to come back to this video and let me know because oh my goodness i mean i this opening is so venomous if they bring out the bishop you get the knight here you get the bishop out this move doesn't even matter against that what i like to do is i still like to go here and now we threaten a checkmate we threaten mate on f7 with the bishop they might block i've seen people play this by the way which is basically losing after queen d3 like you it's like almost impossible to stop and you just get this monstrous attack i mean it's so so so powerful remember the it's going to call it equal or slightly better for black like cuz it's stockfish okay you're going to see in the games that i play later it's a very difficult position to handle stockfish will sit there going it's minus point9 of course it is we're sacrificing a knight that's the whole point that's it's a gambit of course it's risky of course if black plays the top engine moves are going to be worse don't worry about that this is the point of playing a game but you want to have fun this is the type of stuff that you play so knight takes f7 king takes f7 if the bishop comes out knight e5 if the bishop comes out knight e5 now the bishop might not come out right there's bishop g4 there's all these different things but black could play solidly black could play e6 many people choose this turtle setup like this against that i like to put my bishop there so i no longer like to put the bishop on c4 because it's running into a brick wall it's very important to remember okay bishop c4 against the bishop against this cocoon setup we put the bishop on d3 and then this is what we try to do okay we play e6 bishop d3 or let's say knight bd7 bishop d3 e6 and this is our setup look i told you here here here the knight is going to e5 that's our idea a little bit later once we get that prepared that's what we're trying to accomplish rook f8 knight e5 check and now the most common thing is we're trying to get our queen there which the knight protects so the most common move in this position once we prepared with the rook and the pawn is to take like this they don't want to take like this and get forked you see they don't want to get forked so they're going to take like this and then they're going to put the knight here now you're completely winning now you play queen h5 check king to g8 and you rip open the black position with bishop takes h6 and that's it and then your rook comes up and over that is essentially the idea this is the ultimate alien gambit attack queen bishops rook coming up and over this rook coming up and over and again how did this happen right the mechanics of the position we openly admit we are giving up a knight in the first like five moves but our point is black black needs to play ultra passively and then walk the king to safety but that's very tough to do because even if you successfully achieve all of that we still have a roaring powerful initiative if they don't bring the bishop out you play bishop d3 then you castle and play rook e one it's a very simple plan if they play c5 you just stabilize your center you need the pawn simple c5 c3 c5 c3 and that's what you do and then you play knight e5 you find a way to bring the queen you find a way to bring the bishop that's what you do and that's how you play the alien gambit in about 7 minutes all right now obviously you need to build up experience obviously there are branches and different things that can happen the best way for black to play against the alien gambit is the immediate c5 but what i like to do against the immediate c5 is just play c3 i just said c5 c3 and there are many ideas like queen b3 check all right if they take i like to set a a trap bishop d3 this is a very tricky move so c5 c3 and then if they take here you win because you can win their queen bishop g6 and you take their queen whoops even better by the way is knight to e5 check uh and then if this you have bishop c4 and then if this you have mate so there's a lot of traps the best way for black to play is to play c5 knight c6 uh and then against bishop c3 to take and then to play bishop g4 queen b3 check go back with the bishop to e6 and then stabilize after that the chance of all of those moves happening in a game below the rating of 2,000 are zero unless you're playing a cheater unless you are playing somebody who got hit by an alien gambit and basically decided to memorize all the stockfish moves or is actively looking at stockfish while playing the game in my experience playing this in blitz everybody chooses ches a solid setup everybody chooses e6 nobody plays the top engine way they're just like all right you know i'm going to stabilize i'm going to go here i'm going to play e6 no i'm going to play e6 i'm going to play bishop d6 and this is what they do they play really solidly they go like this and then you just build up an attack you play queen f3 bishop f4 rook d1 queen g3 like this is what you do this is how my alien gambits frequently go i try to create some sort of attack sacrifice pieces in front of my opponent's king and that's that's the way i try to beat them all right i ran through that cuz i didn't want to make an hour video i'm now going to play three games i'm going to play a 1300 1500 and 2100 rated subscriber to see how they react when they face the alien gambit one last thing before i go all right we talked about this like you know if they don't play uh a carl khan you just need a different video you need to learn a different thing in e4 that's how chess opening works i recommend vienna i have a course on it it's wonderful knight c3 but if they play the caroan go give this opening a shot uh if they play bishop to f5 you can still do this and you can still go for the alien gambit example right now you're just playing an alien gambit that we saw already knight e5 bishop c4 and g4 so you're transposing you're taking a different route to the same destination uh but some people don't even let you get an alien gambit all right some people play bishop here and then they just ignore you so what i would do is this i would wait for this move and then take or you might never get that move so then just go for the pawn there's another fun way to win this position with bishop d3 take take and f7 cannot be protected so if the opponent doesn't kick you out great stockpile pressure onto the pawn and go win it but more often than not they're going to play h6 uh and uh that's when you'll sacrifice and you'll enter the alien gambit now here are some games all right it's game time we're going to play three subscribers super brave of them to volunteer for this uh the only prerequisite is that they play car con with black and preferably the tartic hour which you know they could play bishop f5 on move four but it's better if they play knight f6 and um their ratings are 1300 1500 and 2100 that's it that's all they know so we're going to see how they react all right we're playing knight g5 and now we're waiting this is of course by far the most popular move but some people might think okay i was going to say some people might think i don't want to do that because i'm falling into one of their traps okay my my opponent is just you know rattling off king takes playing very quickly now we'll see if they blunder this i hope not but it is like i said a very popular move given you're playing gotham chess and 2700 blah blah blah you might you know okay bishop c4 completely fine uh b e6 i don't know why i said bishop to c4 so knight e5 here is less strong knight e5 is good when there's a bishop on f5 against this i just like to play bishop to d3 it's probably the best move and then you just wait for black to try to get the king to safety this is a 1300 whose rapid rating i believe is like 1700 he a really good player uh and actually this whole lineup of players is really strong so if your opponents are frequently under this level uh you might not have a similar experience like you might just be destroying people but as you can see my opponent is choosing one of the most solid setups and just playing going in blind and c5 is a very good move by the way like i you know like i said in the beginning c5 makes a little bit less sense now uh it would have been better for my opponent to have that knight on c6 i'm going to play here cuz i do think it's important for me to have a pawn in the center rather than not having a pawn in the center like this doesn't change too much if anything this actually gives me some other opening lines but but this is fine meaning like opening lines like here uh so take take and now i don't think much has changed for me this is already a very fresh position uh bishop e7 okay i've never i've never seen this approach before i want to play rook e one i also want to play knight e5 straight away um i mean rook e1 and then knight e5 doesn't look too different i mean i just in general i like getting the rook in the game before i go to battle and then knight e5 will come next for me like i said totally new position i've never seen this before maybe maybe maybe rookie six by the way okay obviously not anymore it would have worked a move ago but but not uh not in this particular case so this still looks really strong uh the king will go back to g8 eight i don't necessarily have a checkmating attack in that position um you know i can play bishop f4 and just develop bring as many pieces as i can right now that kind of strikes me as nice i also like b3 bishop b2 so everything looks okay uh i don't know it all kind of looks okay what if i do something like this of course i'm i mean i'm probably losing the evaluation is probably in black's favor but we'll see if they can survive you know because at the end of the day this weak king is not something very simple to deal with but my opponent is playing great so far i think maybe a little passive but probably very good and i'm just going to bring every piece to the party and i'm going to rely on the fact that my opponent's got some pieces there on the back rank which are which are quite passive i i'm not rushing with this move because i don't see the followup like the king's going to go to g8 and be pretty comfortable but if i can see a followup in the future then you know i'm definitely going to go for it i i this that doesn't strike me as correct like i i almost don't even want to defend the pawn i almost want to play like rook c1 and just play super aggressive i need to revisit this uh doesn't seem like there's anything there so let's just yeah let's just bring as many pieces right i'm again i'm down a knight uh might as well be down another pawn get all my pieces in the game black is playing without two rooks and a bishop so yeah bishop c7 uh bishop d7 rather this is an interesting move knight e5 is an interesting move to try to maybe take the the this bishop right knight e5 to to remove the defense um d5 is potentially interesting just like opening up the center like crazy uh lining this guy up looks good i have a lot of lot of interesting moves here they're probably all pretty okay for black but uh you know we're still we're going to stay cautiously optimistic let's start with knight e5 king's going to go to g8 and then maybe maybe we can start a piece transfer over here maybe that's what we do oh black hasn't actually made a move yet okay there we go that's that's the move that we were in fact expecting um and maybe just queen queen e2 kind of loses this pawn which i i'm not like a huge fan of uh we could play knight c4 to try to confuse our opponent hoping for a mistake that seems a little bit cheesy all right let's let's apply pressure let's just improve the position defend this pawn we're looking at knight takes d7 but i'm not you know i'm not thrilled there is a way to blunder here you could blunder this and then after knight takes you know bishop takes i'm um i'm winning because i have so much pressure and i'm i have a tactical finish there yeah this i don't think this move is ever good i think you just remove too much defense from your position black's getting a bit lower on time as well but also black has to make a move like it's it's not that easy with this coming and they played rook d8 that is that is probably one of the better moves i got to say um i'm looking at like various you know bishop c7s in the future okay let's let's go queen f3 which is going all in going all in this is hanging taking it seems mildly deranged because it allows me to open up both my rooks i was expecting that move um knight c6 bishop c6 wins material so i have this if queen takes i can play bishop takes so my opponent might need to play pawn takes and then do i have rook e6 knight takes bishop takes king h7 queen d3 g6 let's just play it slowly let's just keep pushing the pieces in that way and waiting and waiting for our opportunity queen b2 i have d5 which is just again totally winning oh my goodness okay i'm going to take but that doesn't look that doesn't look good i'm going to open up the king i don't know oh that's a time trouble move yikes that'll do it that was a good effort though i mean all right now i'm going to play rook e6 because of this this and yeah unfortunately yeah this is a discover check and this is mate soon because you can't quite defend yourself can take yeah too much too much too much too much losing a queen is is definitely going to do it all right rook takes g7 but let's go back that was a really interesting game um where i think black despite playing a setup that i've never really seen before didn't yeah i mean this is super passive and annoying but it's it it a tough nut to crack i mean i could i have done anything better no i mean i played what i should have i i i got back to equality maybe my better chance here was knight takes bishop the computer says and then play like uh bishop c7 but i think what i did in the game was fine and then this was a little bit too much apparently rook up and rook over trying to lead the attack with the rook would have been slightly better but i went here and then already i'm fine the attack is paying off but i try to like add more pressure and you know as you can see you know like black has to defend perfectly for over 20 moves it's it's really not it's it's not an an easy task uh black has to play like bishop to e8 and just basically sit on the back rank waiting for you to make a mistake uh my opponent did make a mistake but they could have went here i would have opened up the king probably and you know there's uh there's a lot of interesting sacrifices here that can happen and you have all of these attacks and very dangerous position luckily my opponent just hung a queen under pressure but that was interesting i mean that was uh that that was just about one of the most solid approaches to this opening just kind of sit back and defend but white is having all the fun and as we can see the pressure really never stops so that was a good start we're going to see how a 1,500 rated player deals with the alien gambit this is a an advanced intermediate obviously like right right around that that level where you uh your openings are solid you've done your homework uh but now here comes the alien gambit to uh to bulldoze everything you've ever worked for my opponent does play h6 okay trying to remove my knight immediately and now they've paused which is very interesting that they're pausing now uh perhaps my opponent is like what is this hopefully they're not you know going to look anything up which might happen by the way like the thing is you might play some people in your games that uh that go and they they're like oh what is this and then you know if they start rattling off like all these top engine moves then that's you know it's a bad sign but this is this is very non-human i mean there's a reason this is the most popular move uh this is like the second most popular you know a lot of these lines like developing are very popular um c5 is a bit wild yeah i mean like knight fd7 does not look right um that does not look right at all although it does stop knight e5 i mean listen i'm very tempted to play this move right i mean that seems seems very natural uh now i expect e6 i would not expect knight e8 although who not kn e8 king e8 although who knows right like at the end of the day who who who knows how how people think and what they have in their heads i'm already looking at like knockout punches but even just castling looks completely reasonable yeah my opponent castles of course listen it's very rare but sometimes taking this could even work but this just it can't be right because you blocked your knight and your bishop so you undeveloped your king's knight which probably shouldn't work it's a it's got to be a rare move it's it's it's definitely not up there the other the other problem with that move is h5 now no longer has a defender right a lot of the defensive setups for black with the knight on f6 stop uh queen h5 at least for a little bit but this just looks rough and i mean the game plan is i wouldn't even be surprised if white do already maybe better um yeah i think i'm just going to go rook e one knight e5 looks okay also to take take play rook e one but i i want to bring as many pieces to the party first because this just doesn't strike me as as correct although you know black is a piece up like we can't forget we gave black a piece so i want to i want to play knight e5 but then you know they're going to maybe trade bishop would have been nice here knight e5 followed by knight g4 might be interesting to to force black backwards i don't know if i want to go here let's just go back to b3 i mean like i've never seen this setup before with the queen on f6 so i don't want to rush in because then maybe we will just get traded i i know i'm looking at this i'm i'm i'm looking at this now cuz i see the rug i see the possibilities that's got to be good for me right i think now now is probably the moment for this um now the king's going to go have going to have to back up and that might force some you know things to happen in the position i i i really like this kind of bind c4 will always kick the knight out of the center i really wish my bishop was over here but beggars can't be choosers we played the alien gambit maybe c4 to bring the bishop to c2 that looks really good that looks really good that might even trap the queen i'm not even sure where the queen's going to go because i think my opponent's going to go here to try to get the king to safety because you don't want to just go there right you you kind of want to but the queen's literally trapped after bishop c2 isn't the queen trapped queen's trapped queen has no moves oh my goodness and that right there is why you can't play like this because white will win in 15 moves i mean our attack is just too powerful you you you you can't waste so much time defending yourself with the extra piece cuz the extra piece is just not felt that's wild this a 1540 you know this is a really good player and and they didn't know how to react and and even if they did like even if after this game they go do their homework the pos you still got to play chess it's it's really it's a it's a really weird opening this this gambit it's so weird i it's a menace is what this gambit is yeah and my opponent takes it okay now you're up a queen i mean now now you know if if you can't convert this position i can't help you but now we we still have sacrificial ideas the queen could always zip around and black just can't move black just can't move any pieces it's it's a really tough opening uh yeah i mean we you know we can just go straight for the king we you know we just don't get back rank mated um this is check and now the queen takes the knight on the next move yeah wow thing here we take oh my goodness yeah total total swarm uh i wonder if we have a faster mate but let's just go here we'll take bishop g5 this was not accurate because i'm allowing king c7 but it's okay my queen and yeah my my queen and now two rooks c there and i'm removing the bishop i mean it's just it's it's just demolition it's like crazy how powerful this thing is let's take the rook with check i mouse slipped almost pre moove pre moove that wasn't quite a pre moove and my opponent just resigns yeah we could have played on but okay we we would have we would have gotten the job done so i've never actually seen this move and already all the advantage for black is gone when this is played um both are okay so i could have played bishop c4 or bishop uh d3 like keeping the bishop here for this diagonal is also very good and then i could have just played bishop d3 cast rook e one the same approach but it's very tough to resist this check although later i had to move my bishop and already at this point you know instead of knight e5 the computer just says wow the computer just says rook e four to try to play queen here and then get the rook to the f file so yeah i mean i i played the natural move and this is game over we just win in 15 moves i mean this this this opening is like unbelievably venomous and now we're going to um you know we're going to kick it up a notch to uh to 2100 for the last opponent okay now we're going to try to play against uh a 2100 rated player and we're going to see how it goes e4 uh i've specifically recruited subscribers that play the carocon and obviously knight c3 or knight d2 and tartic c but obviously if bishop f5 we can go for the same thing so i'm going to play knight g5 and nobody's been instructed how to play beyond knight g5 like my opponent could play h6 or they could just play solidly and uh i will have to demonstrate how to use the ideas of the opening so knight g5 on the board i think my opponent is currently coming to terms with whether or not they should play h6 of course people do know they will be in a youtube video unless they cheat and beat me okay so we are getting in fact an alien gambit uh of course i'm playing blitz not bullet not rapid uh so you know the dynamics of thinking in a blitz game are obviously especially with bonus time are very different than thinking in a game that has no bonus time you really don't want to go down this much time which is already an advantage if we were playing bullet we almost win on time at this point so the 2100 obviously knows not to play this move i expect this from a 2100 but i don't know yeah we we we've seen that move as well and now i've already shown there's bishop c4 and there's bishop d3 i'm going to play this bishop d3 setup with castle so my opponent has played a solid approach they're not getting uh the light squared bishop out but they're just going to try to protect their king c5 doesn't really do much in this case right we've we've basically seen all of this right and um we'll see if the 2100 rated player manages to survive the opening right like we're we're playing exactly as we should play we're being aggressive you know we're playing knight to e5 now king jade here is the best move so if the 2100 if we already know it the 2100 level that even in a blitz game they can survive and play correctly that's a lot of information wow and my opponent does they don't actually take that is uh that is very fascinating so now i'm going to have to start looking for uh you know various attacks because my opponent played the best way in fact the rook would even be better placed on this square uh on e8 is not so well placed because while it does defend the pawn it does not fight for this file but so right now if you plug this position into an engine black is better uh but uh that's not really how chess works you really you're not allowed to do that so my opponent targets my knight uh and at this point i'm on my own so i'm going to try to just build more pressure and build bring as many pieces to the party as possible we know that taking here is really nice for us because it removes the knight completely i expect my opponent to maybe try to get the bishop out uh but i don't know and i mean they could play c5 but then we will play c3 okay knight d5 is definitely a move that that we are accustomed to seeing although we're accustomed to seeing it in a slightly different way i wonder if it's already time can i already play bishop takes h6 it's it seems like i should be able to play this move but but let's just you know and now i'm threatening queen f7 and the position just looks overwhelmingly good for me queen g3 queen g4 and queen e4 teaming up on h7 so even though my opponent did everything correctly i already have a monster attack uh if my knight gets taken on e5 with the knight i will take with the pawn bish yeah bishop takes is what i was expecting and will take and now we are going to do this typical you know attacking mechanism and against this i was just going to go queen here which simultaneously attacks the knight and threatens mate and if this oh i missed that move actually they could play that uhoh oh the knight is defended oh i probably should have sacrificed my rook oh no oh no oh wow okay maybe i have queen g6 maybe it's not over wait a second this is crazy this is a very unexpected turn of events uh i was not trying to get a losing position oh my goodness this is not good let's go queen g6 check okay now we've got to be really careful let's go c4 and we just have to pretend like this was all part of the plan and we just have to play fast that was that was real bad uh all right let's take on h6 if queen g7 we have queen f4 now i feel like we should have a win here a queen g7 and then rook d1 maybe rook d1 first maybe okay we we definitely have a a better a better thing going than we just had a move ago but is it is it possible to win this position rook d1 rook d1 looks pretty good to me let's go rook d1 and black's king is stranded in the center that's that's a pretty devastating threat all right bishop d7 makes a lot of sense um we can try to get the king back to the f file we probably have at least a draw already but i i'm i'm a little bit hungry for more than a draw although that might be a little bit greedy by me oh rook e four looks good everything looks good queen g5 looks good so many different ideas in this position i just don't really want the king to escape that's the most important thing so let's play queen h4 check we're going to get get the king back and now maybe queen h7 and rook takes that looks convincing now we play rook takes and we got it done but it was a little messy in the end that's the that's the problem when you play 2100s they're pretty good at chess um i have to have a checkmate right um queen g7 and rook f7 is mate queen g7 seven also g4 is made with a pawn you got to mate with a pawn if possible wow that was really stressful and completely unnecessary so we were never totally lost we were totally lost when i blundered that that exact thing so bishop takes h6 was a bad move i had to i had to relax i needed to come back with the bishop but in reality that's what happens when the opponent plays all the best moves like that's that i mean that's basically how it goes our opponent actually played very very well and in this position okay this is where i could have played queen g3 to defend my knight and set up that attack so it would have been a bit more accurate for me instead of bishop f4 to play queen g3 however i blundered something very silly i blundered the fact that the knight is defending the queen so i just thought the knight couldn't move which that was terrible i mean that was really really bad in this position i can also play queen h5 which targets the knight but rather than getting all aggressive and sacrificial i i should have just went back and then the pressure would have kept building i would have probably gone here or there brought my rook i should have just relaxed so it's learning lesson you can't just go and sacrifice everything but even if you do and you make a slight inaccuracy the position's really tough to defend very tough position to defend like we see how right away i got back into the game now i'm winning right like in a in a matter of moves this attack on the king is really really strong so listen the alien gambit is a uh is a very very very fun and exciting opening you see how even 2100s despite playing maybe the best string of moves to defend themselves still find themselves under a tremendous amount of pressure uh and well anybody below that will will probably have a very fun time attacking their opponents so uh moves are there for you come back to this video as a reference and um i hope you enjoyed i'll see you in the next video get out of here
