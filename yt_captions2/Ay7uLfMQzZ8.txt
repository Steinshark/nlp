ladies and gentlemen today started out like any other tuesday i woke up i brushed my teeth i washed my face just kidding i played like seven games of bullet chest on my phone before i did any of that but then i finished all of that had a little breakfast walked the dog came to sit down right here and then i found a chess game and this chess game got me so disturbed that i knew there was only one thing to do and it was to set my computer on fire and pretend like i had never seen it once i finished doing that i went out bought this computer and now i'm here making a video for all of you and i will be sharing this chess game this chess game was sent into me by a subscriber from poland named voytech and voch played a chess game today that's what he did and before we jump into this chess game i'd like to thank the sponsor of today's video in cogni folks it's 2024 every single day the world gets more digital than ever before which is great for playing chess against your friend who's 10,000

protagonists are voch who was brave enough not just to participate in this game of chess but also then to send it into me vch is from poland and voc's opponent uh is from italy and is named galileo not actually uh but that person's real name was there and so i needed to put a different name and galileo as we know was a brilliant mind uh and uh you know white was brilliant uh in their own way so the game begins with knight to f3 but very quickly becomes a queen's pawn we do what what's called a transposition white could have started the game with d4 there was really no benefit starting the game with knight f3 uh it does prevent e5 but you can still go england gambit here so knight f3 d5 and we have the following two moves very solid queen pawn type of stuff and in this position by far the two most popular moves are the london system and the queen's gambit the third most popular move is probably g3 or e3 and white doesn't fact choose to play this move e3 a very solid system this is known as the collie system the bishop will go to d3 b3 bishop b2 and the coli system is actually named after the famous belgian chess player uh i think edgard kie he played this opening in you know the 19th century uh and maybe even'th century but i think it's 19th century it's just incredible you could make three moves back in the day and just be like that's my opening now uh nowadays you have to like lose your queen in three moves and say that's your opening so um voytech plays knight c6 which is a move that i don't hate but i have a problem with it and the problem that i have with it is the the d and c pawns go together and it's okay to play a move like c5 because even if white captures black will win this pawn back it's very difficult for white to actually hang on to it with moves like b4 because black will undermine with a5 and b6 so in general what i tell people is d and c pawns really should be standing out there together and you don't really want to block your uh your you know your bing it's fine if you're 794 it's fine i'm just happy you're developing your pieces and then we need to develop our light squired bishop and then we need to develop our dark squir bishop and then gotham will be happy and he will leave you alone white plays bishop d3 excellent now black plays b6 again don't hate it but kind of wish you would focus more on the center i guess black's idea is to play bishop to b7 which doesn't make a whole lot of sense because you blocked your bishop but whatever you know you're getting your bishop out i don't hate it and so black gets their bishop out or not black doesn't for some reason you know black again went here i thought to that i thought that's why you did it but fine okay e6 you can't really you can't decide which bishop you got two bishops you can't decide fine uh now white plays a3 very professional uh you know i would love to see white castling that's sort of the whole point of the opening or getting a night out or you know d and c pawns go together instead white clearly has strategy and this is a very common thing that newbies do they play h3 a3 they just play these moves to prevent knights and bishops from coming there you can do that there a very famous story of a chess grandmaster who uh had a book and i think it was called perfect your chess by andre vakin who wrote in the book i could be completely making this up but he wrote that his coach would find him fine him like take money from a child on top of getting paid hourly for the lesson if his student ever never made these moves unnecessarily so in this position galileo owes me 10 euro that's basically what i you know because there is no need to play you could argue this move is necessary to prevent that just don't just don't get the bish whatever anyway bishop d6 now again white developed the knight on the bishop now it's time to castle the king or it's time to finish up development it's not time to go bishop b5 that's not also how has white made seven moves in 10 seconds why are we booting up 10-minute games to make seven moves in 10 seconds like why are we trying to finish so fast there are very few things in life where finishing fast is a good thing a prostate exam might be one of the better things just get it you done boom hospital visit sooner the better hopefully you got good care and they didn't just you know throw you out of there charge you $9,000 like in the states so you don't need to play this fast you should you know you but okay fine bishop b5 you you know i get it the knight is not guarded and black plays bishop d7 you see and look at black voytech principled man spending 20 seconds on bishop d7 also not necessary by the way it was much easier to play that move in like two seconds but fine now rule that i always tell beginning players if you cannot explain why you are trading a bishop for a knight like if you can't say well i'm creating a weakness or i'm damaging the structure don't do it just don't do it there's no need to i mean you moved the bishop three times now now it's gone so three of your eight moves which is 37.2% you don't even have the bishop anymore you're just worse now now you should castle now it's high time no still no castling okay and knight in front of the se pawn violating some some of the stuff i like now black should probably castle i don't hate black's move black plays knight e4 don't hate that move um but again it's just better rule of them to castle the idea is just we're trying to trade some pieces and if knight takes then pawn takes and the knight is under attack now again white should see this move evaluate do i want to take or do i want to be taken should i castle what should i do i would still castle instead white plays knight c3 knight knight knight c3 takes e4 and two seconds cuz white white's just got a game plan every move in two seconds like i i'm late for a bus i got to i don't know why i started the game that could theoretically take 20 minutes i got to play as fast as possible okay take take uh knight goes back to d2 and i love it black castles we can already start to see the makings of some problems for white white's knight has been pushed backwards white traded their light squir bishop while having one two three four five pawns on dark squares and a dark squared bishop which is now walled in black has the bishop pair and they will stare at this position especially if this pawn disappears but still the best move for white is to castle or go trade the knight for the bishop just get rid of black's bishop pair uh white here plays a move that is dreadful and it is um it is a move that is played again you haven't castled and you're playing where your opponent is stronger white plays f3 once again in two seconds white is now losing white is losing because when you make a move like f3 you got to think about something you got to think about i'm moving a pawn to a light square i have another pawn on a light square right here are my dark squares weak and my king my king is in the center and this is the first thing you got to look at i got i got news for you that's both of those moves are really really bad news for white both uh you're not lost yet but you're really close now black takes on f3 voch is a very principled man and says you know what i will happily open up my bishop also a way you never ever play a move like f3 is my opponent has the bishops who prefers an open position who the guy with the bishops or the guy with one bishop the guy with the bishops this guy would love that so you never do this why would you like now black's bishop got stronger right so you're learning a lot we are teasing low elo chess but we're learning that like we're not supposed to do that okay we're not knight takes f3 now is black's final moment you got to sneak this move in it's not all checks are the same but that check is definitely really good because white has to move the king and if you have to move the king king's just stranded in the center and will never get the rook out so black is a lot better in this position but instead of that black plays rook e8 all the advantage is gone and now the best move for white is to play castle's king side for like the eighth time possible now and now white is only slightly worse and slightly worse at 780 means basically nothing but that doesn't happen and in this position galileo once again spends two seconds and plays c3 i mean galileo has an unprecedented pace that they play chess like so fast it it is it is really really admirable now again the best move is bishop g3 but the second best move which this move actually prepared in conjunction with the placement of the bishop this is an excellent move anytime your opponent has a king on the opposite side like this you got to open up the position e5 is a great move because black's position is more equipped to open up white has five out of seven pawns on dark squares and five out of six pieces on the home rank so you got to open up the position and now from bad to worse galileo spends one second on this move i wonder if we're going to have a single move in this game where galileo spends longer than two seconds i mean like we could probably go back and and look but you know two that was zero 2 2 one three yeah that's actually kind of nuts like i yeah e5 knight takes e5 and now that knight move used to protect h4 so now black is completely winning cuz after this what's going to happen is you're going to play bishop takes pawn takes and you're going to walk directly into a fork uh fork skewer and um yeah it's really really bad however voch misses that voch first takes the knight which you know i can't really blame voch like it was there i got it white takes back without even thinking and now you never ever ever in a million years trade the queens here ever unless it like wins you a rook you got to keep your queen on the board because your opponent is stuck on the back rank and if you just find this move by accident you're going to win the game why because your opponent's going to play a move like king f1 you're going to play rook e5 and then you're going to bring your other rook and rook f5 check and white just can't they just can't defend themselves because they haven't played well queen e1 trying to trade the queens you give a check if king e2 you can give another check like you're going to mate somebody by accident you're going to just give checks and then all of a sudden it's going to be checkmate like white's just going to run out of moves so you have to play queen h4 check you don't want to trade queens if the alternative is a big attack the attacking side does not want to trade queens so voytech trades queens white takes back and now a lot of the pressure has been relieved in the position and i don't think galileo is going to get checkmated any time soon but voch is still going to pick up some material voch has a lot more activity grabs the pawn on e5 king e2 again 1 second one second spent this whole game is a learning experience and voytech takes another pawn right he just he just got two pawns back like that there was no need for that now white in this position has a rook under attack and a pawn all right rook h2 defends the pawn and attacks the bishop rook rook g1 only attacks the bishop and stops guarding the pawn so naturally galileo plays the worst move in 2 seconds and loses a third pawn in a row one two three so from down upon galileo is now uh from down upon voc is now up two pawns and the way you win this with black is you get the rook in here now the real way you win this with black is you be a little bit patient with your trades but you know that if you trade everything you just win cuz you have on four pawns that's winning and you just try to get these pawns going you try to get those pawns going while protecting your king and disallowing you know any sneaky nonsense and attacks on your king so let's see bishop d2 all right bring the rook great i would uh play h5 to get the pawn rolling and also to make sure the king can't get mated king d3 don't hate bishop f5 check and now um yeah so galileo finally on moveed 20 settles down and spends 4 seconds on the move 20 moves in 31 seconds don't know why on earth this person plays 10 minute they're better off playing blitz or bullet rook e eight bishop f5 check and galileo decides why don't i lead the charge with my king and now the game is completely lost so you have walked the king basically into a mating net rook c5 completely prevents white from moving and rook d8 is m so at this point white would need to begin chucking pieces blundering and and and all this uh and losing pieces along this so king d4 um voy thinks for a little bit plays f6 at least the rook is now protected he's trying to play rook d8 check defend this and also make sure there's no back rank mate uh galileo plays king c4 and now officially for the first time in the entire game we have made on the board i don't know why we decided to go on this spiritual journey with our king to prevent the king from escaping black has the absolutely ruthless bishop c2 and this is a tactical motif known as weaving a mating net playing a quiet move that prevents the opponent's king from escaping and sort of sealing it into the position it's a very instructive move cuz a lot of you would play bishop e6 check rook e5 bishop5 and then you don't have a check anymore a lot of you would go check check check you're still winning but it's not a mate the best move is bishop c2 at which point there's threats like a5 b5 rookie4 etc however voch is human plays bishop e6 and now galileo has the option to run backwards to safety or walk the type rope to b4 which he plays in one move now it's m4 now the evaluation is a type of bmw okay when the evaluation of a chess game is a bmw it it's bad it's a it's very very very bad all right m4 is not good and um a5 check is just game over you give a pawn check you actually can give another pawn check and uh this is check and then this is is actually mate so you just get straight up brutally mated in the center of the board and that'll teach you to have every single one of your pieces on a dark square while the opponent has a light squared bishop nobody's paying attention to the light squares but that does not happen instead of that o i apologize instead of playing uh a5 check voy che plays this which is still winning especially considering galileo runs the king forward again again now the black king the white king is completely sealed but he runs all the way to a6 and the king wants to sneak in back here and my man voc has to find rook e7 that would prevent the king's infiltration and it would simultaneously threaten rook a4 and bishop c8 and you can't stop both there's just nothing you can do both of those are mates you can bribe your opponent you could hope they disconnect or they get on a plane but unfortunately instead of rook to e7 vyek continues chasing and galileo sneaks into b7 and now black is still completely winning but now you know it's not the end of the story vtech plays c5 so black is up three pawns all right black is up three pawns these pawns should start moving i would start trading rooks white plays b4 never letting up the most amount of time that galileo has spent thinking in this game is a whopping four seconds that takes skill all right bishop d5 check it's almost mate only one legal move but the king will survive the king is walking along the seventh rank going on a journey it's gone all the way around like that and we've survived now rook e six building a box king d7 5 seconds the longest amount of time it came on the 31st move white plays a black plays king f7 right everything is defending rook g3 how long not 11 seconds 11 seconds from galileo rook g3 with the idea of maybe doubling up that might be the idea bishop c6 the king is still on the back r voc in dire straits he cannot find a checkmate he doesn't quite understand that he's not supposed to deliver a checkmate anymore so he continues to try to bring his king but now he made his one one mistake it took 33 moves for black to really play a true genuine blunder not just like a missed opportunity he loses the pawn on g7 galileo clutches it out and gets in with the rook six seconds spent and now it's really game on because black is only up two pawns and they are split and he never got them going so he plays bishop to e4 defending his pawn galileo instead of maintaining the control of the position or bringing the ro or bringing the bishop he continues to battle with just one piece the black king goes to f7 the rook goes to d8 for some reason rook e7 check king to d6 rook e6 check king c7 and voch has a very big decision to make he begins repeating moves he says you know what i don't have a lot of time i got to cut my losses now galileo says no draw i don't want to draw i don't care if i'm losing rook takes d7 king takes d7 and now h5 that is a very clutch fine by voytech the bishop snipes the corner so it's just a matter of time if the pawn gets to h2 it's gg there are three moves to go will white stop him in time of course not 1 second spent on king d6 which is a move that literally makes negative sense negative sense the king cannot even get out of the position now black plays h4 black is now two squares away from the magic square you get to h2 you're getting to h1 you're going to promote you're going to win the game b takes c5 desperate times desperate measures takes back the king breaks out of his position all of a sudden voc realizes wait a minute i can't push my pawn because if i push my pawn is my rook trapped oh my goodness so after king c5 he plays rook a6 he escapes with the rook now white needs to bring the king back get to the bishop or bishop e1 to stop the pawn instead of that he plays bishop b4 which puts the bishop in a place where its head is in the king's butt and its butt is in the pawn's head it can't even do it is completely squished i don't know why on earth you would play bishop to b4 but now voc has to play h3 h3 and that's it it's a clear runway h3 he'll protect his bishop he will play h2 he's winning instead he gives a check he panics and he gives a check king to d4 but he defends the bishop and now that's it he's right there rook to g1 pawn to h3 voytech is clutching nobody can stop the pawn now rook g5 all he has to do is play h2 and h1 the bishop is protected by the pawn and is that's it it's perfect he made the comeback he did everything he was supposed to do but suddenly the brain short circuits and he plays [music] rook g6 would have been better rook h6 why would we go rook f6 why are we sandwiching our rook between two pieces for for for what now all of a sudden white can make it to h5 and maybe that was what vo was worried about but but but but voitek the the it's oh my gosh oh my gosh it everything he just played h3 why he didn't play h2 i will never know nobody will never know but all of a sudden galileo the genius rook h5 has stopped the pawn great move by voch to protect himself he's not giving up yet king g7 and now he's trying to play rook h6 bishop c3 rook h6 well timed king c5 check king c5 check look at that discovered attack from the bishop but the king is protecting take take and the bishop comes to stop the pawn oh my goodness now black is still winning black is still winning if he brings his king he begins bringing his king he is he is bringing his king he just needs to get out with the bishop and then come here white is too slow if white goes over here you play bishop f1 check you play king f3 king g2 and you're winning so king g4 galileo plays a4 still making every move in two seconds bishop to f1 can voytech do it we have a5 king f3 king c6 now he just needs to go here but okay first play perfect the perfect setup voytech is completely winning now king b6 voytec walked his king from f7 all the way all the way to f3 just to go backwards king g2 ended the it was over because black has the perfect defensive setup the bishop protects everybody instead voc goes backwards but guess what his position is so good he goes straight back to the g2 square he realizes what am i doing i'm going to end up in a gotham video he plays the king to g2 king to e5 and now he has to put one last finishing touch because he wasted time because he went wasted time whes king was able to get back in time right white's king was able to get back so now he has to play bishop here protect the pawn promote he doesn't now white takes and gets the f5 pawn and now it's a draw it's a draw because white has a pawn and the bishop will stop the pawn but at the cost of the bishop the black king will run back we will trade pawns and the game will end in a draw it was a crazy battle king to g3 e4 king e5 what he lost the pawn he lost the now vo has a chance to win but he bishop takes bo te is low on time oh my goodness it's a draw because if you take the pawn is the wrong color corner which is which which is high level stuff instead of that okay all right fine all right king v vo's got to run his oh my goodness voch anyway all of these heart attacks aside he finally sacrifices the bishop and this game is is a draw even though white is going to get over here black will just go the other way the king will take the pawn black will get to c6 there we go king c4 king c6 and voytech plays king b4 and and out of a panic because he didn't have a lot of time ran his king to the a4 square and now there's nothing there's nothing there's nothing that's he can't and he loses the game and galileo one and what he should have done is gone that way so that after king b6 king d5 king a6 he gets here and white cannot escape white cannot get out of the way of his own pawn and it's a draw and unfortunately voytec lost this game
