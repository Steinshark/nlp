ladies and gentlemen if you are fans of my content you know that i do not shy away from making videos about magnus carlson and you admit it do not shy away from enjoying and watching all those videos about magnus carlsen anything he does is fascinating well today actually yesterday he began his campaign for the pro chess league the pro chess league is an online four versus four global chess tournament now i have a team i haven't made an announcement on that yet but i will and there's a link in the description for more information about the protest league but magnus is playing for team canada because he's probably canadian at heart they have a monster team and yesterday the season began so magnus has to play boards one two three and four of the charlotte cobras they were playing against charlotte and disaster struck like magnus got in serious trouble and in today's video i'm going to show you what exactly happens when you get a completely winning against mag uh completely winning position against magnus carlson um it was shocking all right like going into it i thought canada was gonna absolutely steamroll charlotte and sometimes in these videos i make a recap just of magnus's game no all of these games are going to feature magnus sit down enjoy yourselves let's look at four magnus carlson games so game number one he's playing the board four for charlotte who is a grand master all right irina crush very very accomplished player and for some reason highlight moves are off uh board uh highlight moves uh tremendous okay so she began with d4 magnus played a king's indian defense you may notice they are playing 10 minute chess the protest league is a rapid event so 10 minute with two second bonus time and magnus played a very offbeat king's indian there are like 10 different ways to play here with black e5 and c5 are the two traditional approaches um there is also bishop g4 to try to take this drop this back play e5 there's many many ways to play he plays c6 which is not like it it's not the main thing um it's a very cagey setup okay and it has its pros and cons and so she castles and now he goes for e5 um now the traditional way to play the king's indian is to play d5 and close the center and then white attacks here and black attacks here but she played bishop e3 and magnus took on d4 so when you take on d4 and the king's indian the center is more open anytime a trade happens like this the center is open which means it's going to be harder to attack each other so magnus attacks the center now it's a very weird thing when you play magnus carls i mean i'm just telling you right now like i don't know if irina feels this way i'll tell you right now when you play a guy like magnus you're constantly like do i just trade all the pieces and try to make a draw like do i try to beat him because if i try to beat him lunging with a punch imma get you know knocked out i don't know like this is the stuff i struggle with so she takes she and magnus plays knight d5 okay trying to get her to do this so that he could grab the bishop the bishop is holding together the white position as you can see from the eval bar knight d5 cd5 and she plays a little too passively king h1 and she doesn't have to play king h1 um i don't really know what she has to play it's like a very equal position but it's very tense and after already this exchange of pieces uh and bishop d4 you can see that magnus is just playing normal moves and he still has eight minutes on the clock and she has four in fact you can kind of see from the last like several moves the time usage from this position down to trading basically everything irina spent half her time and magnus hasn't really thought a whole lot all right and you would think okay the pieces are just getting traded pawn takes pawn queen takes queen rook takes queen pawn takes queen and bishop e6 and uh yeah black is better uh black is better like how do you evaluate that black is better here well king safety is about the same but you talk about different pawn islands that's definitely a closer target than this pawn but even if we say these two pawns cancel out black just has more meaningful pressure on these two pawns and black has a much quicker kind of jumping into the opponent's position just the higher piece quality so she plays b3 he plays rook d2 in one second she goes here he moves the pawn out of the way so now the bishop can't even see the pawn the white bishop rook c1 rook c8 and he just plays a5 he just puts two pawns on dark squares and making it very difficult to move these pawns she plays h4 he brings the king up she plays e5 he comes back and immediately attacks the pawn that she just put there she goes to defend it he uses his c pawn as a weapon he plays c4 takes on b3 and now if she takes his rook i mean that looks all fine and dandy right apologies uh i think he has b2 here yes he has b2 so now this rook is hit and that rook is hit and uh black is just completely winning because for example if you play rook b1 here bishop c uh bishop c8 rook b2 just a4 and uh black is just dominating here here rook d3 rook a three you win this pawn bishop e6 um and i mean magnus just making it look relatively easy takes the pawn and i mean 20 seconds versus seven minutes it's tough i mean i get it listen i get it all right i understand the feeling and magnus uh against an extremely extremely extremely good opponent wins the first game spending you know three of his minutes just a compositional out maneuvering literally one borderline inaccurate move by irina and magnus just traded and traded and traded and was like all right now i just got to bring my bishop bring my rook bring my pawns and arena was in it but time management tough and uh he comes back he takes he's he's a very good player all right shocker um so in game number two you know magnus has to play i think magnus played brandon jacobson next uh brandon jacobson is uh i think the board uh three for charlotte in this match uh their boards two are daniel naradinski and a wonder liang magnus played d4 brandon played knight f6 and magnus played g3 so trying to play uh maybe a catalan but in a slightly different move order so brandon goes for a reverse london magnus now plays c4 knight c3 and in this position doesn't castle but rather blaze uh queen b3 and the reason he does this the reason you delay castling in this position is so the bishop can come back to f1 and you say levy why would the bishop want to come back to f1 because of queen b6 c5 queen a6 and in this position there is a very cool move bishop f1 it's such a scumbag move the point is that you set up an attack on the queen queen can't go anywhere so like if the bishop comes back e4 and yeah it's bad news it's completely losing position for black so black has to either shove the knight into the center or try to play b5 and already is like quite a bit worse here uh so yeah magnus uh magnus knows this and brandon goes back uh to c7 but now here comes the bishop f4 and knight d2 and the idea here is to play this move e4 so uh he's trying to attack the center we have g5 but now magnus e4 danger levels you take my bishop i'm gonna get your bishop bishop here and now jumping into the position very unpleasant stuff here for black if you avoid the trade like this uh then i just have a mega clamp i mean i can do whatever i want here you'll just never castle but if you take and god forbid you allow me to do this i still have a mega clamp so brandon has to take magnus doesn't even he doesn't h4 he's like i'll take that in a moment because most of the black pieces are on the back rank and you can see here the time once again g4 h5 sacrificing the pawn you can take my pawn because you're just gonna help me open up my rook and i'm gonna take this and bishop f5 bishop e4 not taking with the knight but rather the bishop uh castles takes takes long castles and uh one minute to four it's just gonna be tough it's gonna be very tough to defend this like incredibly unpleasant position brandon plays queen e6 looking for a queen trade magnus bravely grabs the pawn and allows the pawn to be taken because he's got knight c4 and remember magnus is a cerebral chess play that means the go right like i i could use whatever adjective i can describe him he's not gonna be like well i want to keep my queen on the board because if i keep my queen on the board maybe i checkmate the other guy no like if he has to trade the queens he will because just simple chess simple chess i'm just gonna grab nobody can defend the pawn come here i take the rook none of your pieces can fit when i get this i'm gonna get that and then probably i'll get this too so f4 sacrifice but now d5 and knight c4 rookie seven knight back to e5 i think magnus could have like again stockfish always shows that like you can play a bit more accurately but knight e5 attacks f7 and the reason uh there there were some tricks here for brandon to defend but it's borderline impossible to defend this position with 14 seconds on the clock and i'm not gonna sit here and be like well magnus could have been more accurate is he washed see like the difference between myself and like sports commentators on tv is that sports commentators are like paid haters some of them literally just spend their entire careers talking negatively about athletes in every segment hype magnus up you know what i mean like i'm not going to see him be like well you know magnus gave up a plus 1.5 advantage back to equality is he washed up that's not you know i i don't that i don't find any joy in that but uh yeah like that's that's what sports talk show is all about just basically talking about who's watched and who's not uh but uh yeah magnus gets the pawn down knight b5 and it i as you can see the game will be decided by this pawn and uh yeah the pawn queens now brandon here you know tremendously uh disrespectful behavior not resigning to the goat i'm just kidding uh he still has chances and never resign plus the pawn is uh still listen man maybe magnus accidentally allows promotion and you definitely should not resign in this position i would say don't resign at all but also don't resign when you have knights because you never know when your opponent will blunder everything but in this case it's not gonna work king e3 and uh what's funny is that king e3 and um brandon i guess resigned or lost on time here but he has a fork like the position here is completely winning i mean if magnus just plays rookie 4 first because the knights are stuck guarding each other you come here you sack the pawn never queens you promote what's funny is that after knight e2 king e3 you can actually make an argument that this position is playable for about 10 more moves uh just in case but no obviously it's completely lost 2-0 for magnus then you may ask yourself levy you told me in the beginning that magnus lost that well we're getting there all right literally we're getting there i'm not even like click baiting you the last game of this match magnus threw it all away for canada yeah but first daniel nerdinski now this doesn't match up you all show up for right this is a matchup y'all y'all really like to see uh d4 and now this time it's dania himself playing a king's indian defense uh magnus plays a line i really like he plays h3 bishop e3 uh which i believe is called the makagonov macaganov variation the point is that you stop this and you also prepare g4 like literally you prepare g4 um and you try to play 92 knight g3 g5 h4 h5 you go for this like massive attack black plays knight c5 a5 c6 probably we will be seeing all of those moves now we see knight c5 that defends the pawn now we see c6 point is that uh b4 here looks like it kicks the knight out of the way but there's tricks like this this so knight e2 again to try to go here and play g5 takes takes queen a5 and dania playing in a very deliberate and aggressive way but the way that this system works for white is because the center is completely locked it's impossible for black to do anything unless you do it on the queen side and if white does a good job monitoring that white just wins like literally white just wins that pawn is weak can be targeted from c4 or that diagonal uh not to mention you can completely clamp down on the king side so in all of these lines it's just a matter of time like i mean does black succeed on the queen side or does white succeed so queen d2 knight c3 b6 solid but here comes g5 and here comes c4 and i told you if it comes down to it and white clamps the black queen side it's going to be impossible so daniel tries to fight back with f6 magnus plays h4 why because he wants to do this not because he's creating an attack the queens are off the board it's to control the movement of the black pieces look at this bishop can can somebody find a way to get the bishop back into the game i'll tell you you gotta play freaking tetris back here all right bishop f8 bishop b7 bishop d8  and what happens when you get to c7 you move from one house four states over and you still got no windows i mean this bishop sucks bishop is trash all right that bishop is just not doing anything so it's a free roll basically there's rook f7 now knight e2 knight c3 you know daniel's doing his best gallops across the board and just king d2 now there goes the rerouting process so magnus hit the pause button here and went all right which of my pieces is worse than one of black's pieces this trade doesn't make any sense because after dc i actually get a home for my bishop i actually can create meaningful play so the dark squared bishop debate white has the better dark squared bishop but bishop h3 interesting idea here basically saying black's light squared bishop is a very important piece so let's trade it but i gotta tell you i gotta tell you dania actually has done a decent job here i mean he's not like hopelessly lost king e2 how is magnus gonna break through here yes black's bishop sucks but his position doesn't and like just because your position is better doesn't mean you're gonna win it's not like uh sports like in sports i guess i guess the analogy there is you might have a better team it doesn't mean you're gonna win the game like you still have to win you got to score more points in chess you gotta win material dip deliver checkmate right so bishop d8 i told you that reroute was happening knight goes back to a 65. i mean narrow this castle blockade like the rook on the seventh rank controls everything how do you attack this you're gonna play knight b5 good luck i'll take on e4 so rook a3 now a5 okay but a5 could be creating certain weaknesses how is magnus gonna exploit them f3 solid all right king e8 dania walking is king over but where where is it where's the how are you gonna break through here well in every position the peace trades that one side controls and pawn breaks basically can decide the game it's a pretty close position all right even though both sides only have six pawns pretty closed who controls the pawn breaks who controls the trades why and magnus maneuvers maneuvers maneuvers and trades why now f4 long time ago we decided that the dark squares were better off being held by white but not anymore because in this position magnus calculates an absolute butchering of the black position beginning with bishop takes knight a completely counter-intuitive and stupid looking move why would you play that we just talked about this now the bishop comes alive it does but not if you control the pace of the game f4 96 and the point is if you take hello and that pawn decides the game i'm threatening rook h8 king g7 rook h7 mate and i got news for you if you take rook h8 king g7 rook h7 king f6 and all i got to do is set this up somehow i have e5 like king d4 e5 but guess what i could play e5 even here that's me insane i mean dania did everything right in this game and magnus still breaks through in resounding fashion the pawn avalanche yeah there it goes and that's it and dania is a piece down and for a second game in a row magnus is uh just calmly converting an end game and i it took a little bit and on move 62 rook out for a very very fancy little finishing technique here rook f4 knight g6 so uh magnus just obliterating right 3-0 um some of these games were close for brief moments but magnus doing magnesian things all right so we go to the fourth and final round and magnus is playing a wonder liang cool was always a talented young american player now i believe he's in college doing things far more interesting than chess hopefully he you know gets a corporate job making a nice little quarter millie i don't i i don't actually know what a wonder is interested in um but uh he is in college and chess he's not trying to be like 2700 2800 but he's always been very very good now this is the last round and canada is up however canada is not a massive favorite on all the boards like charlotte's board four irina crush is higher rated and a favorite probably against jennifer yu who's the canadian board for close match brandon jacobson russ von priyotsu if i'm just saying names of people you don't know that's okay a lot of you are new to the chess world you don't know some of these people but magnus has to win so magnus plays a french all right magnus plays a french d4 d5 knight c3 knight f6 and this is known as the rubinstein variation of the french knight bd7 burn variation rubenstein variation uh knight f6 knight f3 and overall this is very hard to win with black very hard magnus has had success playing the french and blitz but i wonder just i mean has all his pieces out he has a three and three uh this is not a free pawn for black because bishop b5 is a discovered attack check on the king and even if you castle you're not gonna win this pawn i mean i'm just gonna go here here i'm gonna take on f6 and i'm gonna checkmate you both sides castle the bishop comes back and a wonder just has like a super super nonchalanten overall pretty solid position but like i said in the very beginning of this video if your goal for this game is not lose to magnus and let the team win it's very hard to play chess with a do not lose mentality it's hard like you you know like if a wonder was playing me in this position his mentality would be beat this clown but his mentality against the against magnus is not beat this clown no one's mentality when they play magnus is beat this clown it's don't freaking lose like it's like be solid do your best you know what i mean like there's a mentality difference it's like when you play someone 400 points higher rated than you your mentality is i just can't embarrass myself meanwhile magnus's mentality is i'll find a way to win i'm the goat while that got challenged in this game because i remember exactly where i was when the chess move heard around the world happened bishop g4 bishop e6 and in this position magnus played bishop takes a2 now for the chess historians you know the game fisher spassky bishop takes h2 when fisher got his bishop trapped in the corner and lost the first game of the world chess championship but in this position you cannot play the move b3 i mean that doesn't trap anything queen b3 bishop b3 so a wonder played the move b3 wait what magnus got his bishop trap but i don't understand he could just take he can you know why because if he takes with the queen here here and in a shocking turn of events white is winning completely first of all the bishop is trapped like that now there are some tricks here like you can play rook d8 and counter attack it's trapped rook a1 it's trapped so you can't do that right but what if you take with the bishop then i go here and somehow despite being defended you can't move you know why because white is going to go here or here or take queen e4 and mate and and it goes from bad to worse you know how an mma fights a guy gets hit false but he gets follow-up hit well it goes from bad to worse because it's plus five magnus doesn't just blunder b3 key blunders queen h7 queen h6 and rookie five oh my goodness he cannot take because this a wonder liang is about to win the game against magnus this is not what anyone expected canada was supposed to be a juggernaut they got magnus out there paying him well per match i mean he's down three minutes oh wonder liang is about to beat the goat king d7 the king is going for a run bishop b5 check king c7 the bishop is hanging the rook is hanging but now the rook is hanging here because the queen is actually defended so what do you do rook takes e8 magnus plays queen b5 rook takes king takes is plus four it's plus four now it's plus four if you take this pawn and okay black is gonna try to queen but you keep the queens on and you have queen f7 by the way bishop f7 rook b5 rook a5 like you can stop the pawn okay you just need to keep your nerves and keep the queen on queen f8 check king c7 now in this position you gotta like i said you got to be a little careful i'll wonder is like wait a minute if i take on f7 right now i win the queen here's the problem a4 if you rush and you take the pawns and you and you don't win this one you gotta stop my pawn somehow rook a5 but wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute we just wait a minute wait a minute we were like borderline checkmating the king now if a wonder here had played queen f6 a4 rookie one maybe he checked mates magnus but this is a scare a little scary right but he's got a queen king's open right queen a shade i mean so a wonder does what you know any normal person does he trades queens he's up a pawn and he's got a rook for a bishop folks i think you know where this is going i think you know where this is going i think you know how all these movies end bishop rook a5 bishop b3 oh wonder pushes here comes magnus though oh wonder gives a check king c6 f4 b5 g5 take take a wonder's gonna queen but magnus attacks his rook draw rook a5 oh that's rook a5 is probably a draw king b6 rook a probably a draw but our wonders like draw drawing who who drawing who rookie eight magnus is like well now i can push my pawns away too comes back wait a minute the bishop wait a minute how are you queening all your pawns are stuck you can get to g7 but no no no oh my goodness now the only move that might not lose right away is rook d1 cutting off the king and a wonder doesn't find it no the king is walking in i can't believe it he's gonna he's gonna save that it's check it's check oh my god and i wonder not only that he ends the game with less time it was four to 30 seconds four minutes to 30 seconds on the clock charlotte was about to pull off the upset of the season maybe even it's only see round one and magnus he wins a game he got absolutely no business winning the magnus carlson effect in full force in on full i was gutted i was watching a wonder fall apart emotionally on camera that might be an over exaggeration i'm going back to being a sports analyst now oh my god magnus goes 4-0 chess bros win eight and a half to seven and a half he got four out of there eight point eight and a half points i mean that's why he's that's why he's there man i mean it is so hard you gotta beat a 2800 level player like five times in the same game for him to underestimate and flat out just miss b3 but then to also miss rookie five i mean it's over i mean you might as well click the resign button no heartbreaking absolutely heartbreaking and it ain't over till it's over more info on the pro chess league uh in the description and uh my team the gotham knights uh we got hikaru we got a stack squad uh we're playing on thursday tomorrow the 16th february 16th so very fun a lot of good prizes and um yeah we'll see you there get out of here
