ladies and gentlemen magnus carlson is the best chess player on the planet and we know that but sometimes he has a funny way of reminding us in the most unexpected ways you see a couple of days ago on chess.com magnus won both the morning and the evening edition of the title tuesday chess tournament which is one of the strongest blitz events that uh happens on chesc on a weekly basis but in that title tuesday he defeated a 3,000 rated grandmaster in one of the most effortless displays of chess i have ever seen in my life and he did it while playing something super disrespectful and being down upon pawn since the third move of the game and i have a bonus for you he then proceeded to beat the same exact grandmaster in the evening in the same exact amount of time i mean you you literally cannot script this stuff and i really don't mean to pick on anybody but i'm going to show you both of these games because they are sensational also if you're watching this on november 9th 2023 a very very big and very special announcement we now have gotham merch the store launches tomorrow you can click the link in the description to get more information it's going to be just two or three days we

the merch only going to be out for like the next two or three days so if you have a friend that wants merch send it to them send them the link anyway appreciate you all very much if you missed the merch dr sorry there's plenty of other stuff to spend money on um here we go this was uh th this was awesome uh this what you're about to witness and the way magnus makes it look and by the way gregori aaden magnus's opponent is like a very very very good player and this is blitz and all that stuff and all those caveats uh greg he would he would crush me but uh but we we just got to look at this game anyway gregori started with g3 no g3 is just trying to go here um there is really no rhyme or reason to this move you can also begin with knight f3 the drawback of beginning with g3 is that black could take the whole center so bishop g2 and then d5 and then if you play knight f3 black will go here right so technically if you want to play that you should probably play knight f3 but magnus plays h5 magnus on move one plays h5 this is a 3,000 rated grand master this dude is like one of he's like 2680 fay you know top 50 in the world he's so so good and magnus then plays h4 he just gives the pawn away now if white takes like this magnus is a genius cu these pawns are doubled and isolated and we're going to win them no gregori takes with the night now you would think oh magnus is going to sack his rook right no no he just he just completely gives away a pawn magnus just gives away a pawn for nothing like you start to wonder like why does anybody play real chess at all just just play like this right and he's not even that much worse which is hilarious and he just takes the center right and then he he wants to take the entire center and he lost an ag pawn which is not even that bad i mean you get an active rook it might even be okay for black gregori plays d4 which according to stockfish is the top computer choice because after pawn takes you can very quickly get some development with your queen your knight your bishop and then you can castle and that's exactly what he does and then magnus plays knight c6 which of course you have to do right you know the guy develops his queen you have to develop your knight and then uh and then attack the queen now you can go here with white and you're kind of playing a scandinavian it's like this this take take and then the queen comes out uh but instead of that gori plays queen e3 check so he's trying to get magnus to put something in front of his king and magnus does that and now magnus wants to play d5 knight f six get this bishop out get the queen out castle keep in mind magnus is just down a full pawn like he just played in a uber disrespectful way anyway the got goes knight of five he's justifying all his play thus far he's just going forward he's attacking the pawn and he's doing this but the thing is when you play against magnus it's like it's never it it's never quite so clear because you would think well i'm attacking his bishop and then his pawn would check and suddenly magnus just plays d5 d5 is already a mini cold shower d5 is like i'm attacking your knight grab my bishop go ahead grab go ahead spend one two three four moves with your knight just to not have it anymore and by the way you can't even do this it looks like you can take this pawn with check and yet somehow in this knight is just trapped it it has no way to go now if you play queen c3 to defend it you only make things worse for yourself cuz you lose your queen which would be very bad so knight takes g7 check is is not possible so he takes the bishop and now magnus does this so magnus is still down a full pawn uh but he has some good development he's going to finish up with the bishop and the queen and castle he might play d4 might bring his knight like somehow see if you play like this you're an idiot he's 3260 playing like wow magnus played such an interesting gambit right and i mean how does how does he do this right like how why do his why do his positions get to look so good i feel like if i play like this against these gms i'm just going to get smoked why white plays queen g5 which by the way is also highly recommended by the computer queen g5 trying to go here and if black goes g6 for example then he slides in even closer and then this queen is very menacing it's it's poking around it's it's not a very pleasant position right yeah so apodan plays this and magnus just says take my pawn dude just straight up says take my pawn like go ahead i don't even want to defend it i don't want to go here i don't bishop f5 you want to take my pawn so bad so do it go ahead take my pawn and then magnus would have probably played rook h7 and then the queen would have gone to g5 and then magnus would have won queen d7 and castled and just said yeah i'm down two pawns but like good luck beating me rook g8 bishop h3 like if if if he castles this way i mean white is just going to lose like it that's the crazy thing i mean you took his pawn on the third move of the game and he's still going to find a way to checkmate you so having said that white probably has to castle queenside right mentally at this point aidon has prepared well i got a castle queen side also aid was like i got to go to gotham merge.com and then i got to sign up right i got to sign up for the for the merge drop cuz biden yeah anyway knight a3 and the advantage is gone for some reason the advantage is knight to a3 and why did he not go knight to c3 didn't want to get hit by d4 also he didn't want to get hit by this move at which point he can't even protect c2 it's completely ridiculous how good black's position is in nine moves it's been nine moves dude played h5 h4 the first two moves and he's winning almost on move nine ridiculous knight a3 queen d7 castles castles okay we have now played 11 moves each watch how fast and how brutal the rest of the game is magnus plays here he is still refusing to protect this pawn why because if the queen comes in queen's got no way out queen can't go out queen can only take the pawn this move traps the queen if you play queen e6 and that is over the queen of stuck the only thing that white can do here is try to attack f6 at which point you just seal that off and then you're going to win the bishop so that is crazy he just plays f6 can't take the pawn the pawn that you spent time going to get you see everything that that white does knight f5 oh i'm so sh nope can't take my pawn all i'm going to go get the pawn magnus like yeah take the pawn when you play magnus when you play hikaru you try to do things right like in a fight try to do things and play to your strengths and they just look at you like okay do your worst and you're like wait no seriously it's like if you tried to rob a store for legal reasons i do not condone this but you know you try to rob a story you're like put your hands up and give me you know you see that thing in the movies or something and they're just like okay shoot and you're like wait no no no i was it's not even a real gun i'm i'm not even it's a water gun it's a nerf gun i i just want the money i what i was was not that's an unexpected pl these guys are like yeah okay go take the go ahead i mean you wanted so so take it let's go take it stupid take the pond and you're like hey magnus is not that ser bro relax i mean we chilling right so apparently he was supposed to go queen f4 this would have been slightly better for aid and and if you chase the queen gets to a4 at which point it's avoiding danger more than anything else i mean you are not really creating any threats but instead of that aiden makes another queen move so he's played many queen moves already and now the queen gets hit with d4 which also opens the door for the black queen to go to d5 which it very quickly secures by playing bishop to e6 magnus has spent like no time keep in mind magnus is probably playing this game while like huge dj music is playing behind him and chat members are asking him questions about god knows what uh queen a4 queen d5 and uh it takes 15 moves magnus wins game is over 15 moves gg over because you cannot stop the rook and if you protect the rook boom the best move here according to the computer was to play queen back to b3 exactly where it just was lose the rook take with check and try to play this position and uh yeah biden after queen d5 just 15 moves dude started the game with h5 h4 down a full pawn played just a bunch of completely normal developing moves this was one of his nicer moves where he called the bluff on his opponent's play just gam just could his opponent have taken absolutely but he's scared it's a hesitancy in a fight you try to throw a jab the guy wallops you with a hook or a leg kick you're like all right you know what i'm not going to i'm good i'm not going to throw anything ever again i will never punch another person b3 and just top computer move top computer move by the way at this point magnus spends a minute and 10 seconds i think it's cuz maybe he was calculating something or he went to the bathroom like he did not actually spend a minute on this move bishop f5 white plays h4 trying to play bishop h3 and trade off and he just plays knight d5 you know why he plays knight d5 very simple because after takes takes it's made do you see the mate this is not mate by the way the knight blocks and the queen cannot take the queen you you you really don't want to do this actually because then you force yourself into a queen trade yeah so instead of all of that knight c3 queen is attacked queen a1 knight b1 is mate now and if you take very simple dc white resigns 21 moves magnus wins this is mate can't stop it play knight c4 i play takes takes queen b1 this dude is 3,000 aidon is one of the best grand masters in america right right now formerly from russia young col college sage 20-year-old guy i mean i mean like what i don't even know what i don't know what mistake he made like like magnus beats people you sit there you go what was his mistake i mean he was it this no computer didn't hate that move like what did he do he just what like where did he go wrong queen b yeah i guess queen e3 was inaccurate and then around here he probably should have blocked the attack once he lost control i mean my my guy might he just he just he what how did he even anyway i don't even know what to whatever yeah but magnus got him again magnus got a pon again in the evening and then he went you know i don't even feel bad i don't feel bad for abiden because this is how i feel when i play 3000 these dudes play h4 against me i'm like what i'm going to lose i mean there's nothing i'm it's an embarrassment i'm going to get embarrassed no matter what this dude magnus beat this man with h oh my god he just plays h4 like how how are you going to can you imagine being a p and you're like oh nice i got to focus i'm playing magnet again you know earlier it was bad this is later in the day this is like 6 hours later they both probably went and did things that chess players do i don't know sit and stare at a wall for like six i don't know what grand masters do and a biden plays b6 i love how biden spends 5 seconds on move one just being like do i really got to deal with this garbage and now magnus plays e4 just plays e4 like a normal game he plays e like can you imagine e4 b6 knight c3 bishop b7 it just ag i mean good lord oh my god and now he just acts like as if he didn't as if he didn't just play h4 on the first move of the game i mean anyway knight f6 and that's apparently a big mistake um the clock is not updating cu i don't know ch.com does that sometimes uh yeah in case it was in case i spoiled the result by the way uh knight f6 now e5 and um and and and normally this is trap by the way like actually h4 is a completely brilliant move because for example there are lines where let's say you know you play like e6 bishop d3 knight f6 and you cannot play e5 here you cannot play e5 because bishop takes well it turns out magnus carlson is a genius for playing h4 because now you can play e5 and bishop takes g2 is not a not not not not a trap knight e4 and oh my god it's happening again chesc y'all got a little bug here where the clock stays the same and the clock's not right e5 takes takes queen g4 i mean aiden lost this game in six six moves six moves he straight up just lost in six moves he was supposed to go knight d5 but when you disrupt the the communication of the black pieces the queen is going to g4 to attack this pawn and then defend this and when you go here it's actually even worse because normally you think white has to play defense but he's not going to he's going to take which you didn't think he was going to do and then play queen g4 which is a fork of a bishop and a very important pawn a pawn near the king the dark squares are looking really tasty aadan plays this magnus plays queen g7 and dude straight up just won a game in like eight moves i mean this is this is over it's not over here but it's over from the human standpoint of things uh aiden plays rook to f8 and now white just needs to play one of these two bishop moves which he does and the bishop either has to go back or the queen needs to slide out of the way the bishop does in fact go back but we don't need to rush exchanges here so we just play rook c1 hitting the bishop aidon plays bishop takes g5 and magnus does not take on g5 he doesn't take on g5 because this bishop will always be able to protect the pawns is that same clock glitch going to happen no it's back so rook takes c2 bishop to e7 and magnus just says you know what i could develop i could go for an attack or i can just take this pawn and and and i got really bad news for you um he's just going to bring the queen out or like move his knight and then just play h5 h6 h7 and h8 and there is absolutely nothing you can do black plays knight c6 magnus develops his knight and then in case that wasn't good enough he castles he castles despite playing h4 on the first move black is now two moves away from castling himself so he plays queen b7 and here yes white can play a3 rook e1 white can bring the queen back and try to push the h pawn but the best way to attack well let me ask you can you guess magnus carlson's moving this position can you think like the greatest chess player of all time white is winning white does the pawn up but what's the best move are you paying attention were you just like were you on the gotham merch website it's nothing much you just got to sign up it's coming out tomorrow um black wants to castle right and so when you're castled in chess and your pieces are all and ready to go you got to think how can i disrupt what my opponent wants the opponent wants the castle desperately because the king is stranded in the center and the way you prevent that is you go straight down the middle d5 use your pawns to attack d6 de all of this is opening up if black takes you bring in the knight with pressure on the bishop and the pawn and f6 and if black castles at this point you sack the rook to get the bishop so once all your pieces get in together tactics puzzle solving things they all start arising out of nowhere so d5 is what was played in this position aidon played this and magnus chopped it down that is a nice move he didn't have to do that he could have played his rook magnus takes on e6 sacrificing the rook completely why because in chess the two most important things are material and the safety of the king so when the rook gets taken if the rook doesn't get taken then a very calm rook d2 and now the k now the king's not going oh now the king ain't going anywhere king's not king staying right in the middle and we going to get the boys in there queen e4 queen c4 queen c6 knight g5 like everybody's going to come in we're not going to hang our queen i'm just saying that's the general idea and if this you play the zishan zuk before you take back the knight with the queen you play pawn that is so important and now the king has to move the king doesn't have to take the pawn but the king has to move and if the king has to move the king's not going to be able to castle the king does take the pawn magnus takes and now black would love to play rook d8 and get the king to safety rook d8 and get the king to safety you know what we're going to do to to stop get queen f5 and then the king's got to go right there and he can't move anymore and then we're going to break down his house we're going to break each window each window knight e5 rook e1 get on f7 get on this diagonal and we are going to win we're going to have knight e4 knight b5 all of this different stuff so instead of that aiden plays queen c6 rook d1 check and magnus says you know what knight d4 queen f5 is coming knight b5 is coming knight d5 is coming every everybody's coming queen g6 knight f5 boom knight e7 is a huge threat you move out of the way here comes queen e4 sniping the rook in the corner looks like black is completely defending himself it's an illusion knight to b5 knight to b5 threatens two things number one it threatens check maiden one that is mateen one because white's two snipers take away the king's escape squares the bishop is glued with nowhere to go the rook is just standing there like a lamp not doing anything and if black defense against maid well knight to d6 check and black resigned because after pawn takes knight takes queen b7 is checkmate unless you sack your queen at which point magnus would be able to in fact convert this position that is how magnus carlson defeated i'm very sorry to gregor aiden for having to feature him in two posterizing pieces of content you know like in basketball highlights when they dunk on another person the the person who gets dunked on gets credit for even playing defense by the way all right it's not just as simple as it is magnus played h5 h4 and then he played h4 and he won the he won this game in i'm not exaggerating eight moves only he can make it look this easy the first game he had to work i mean he did not get a winning position but how does he make it look so easy everything his opponent wants to do he allows to happen and then he's better and how quickly he just whoop queen d5 boom done in there get the bishop get the knight absolutely mummify the king game over two times in a total of like 40 moves but in reality he was winning these games within 15 moves eight moves in the second game just just crazy i i don't even i don't i don't know what to say i it's just really impressive it's really really impressive it's it's so fun to watch i i love watching it i mean there must be like a primal fear that gets struck into people when they get paired against magnus it it it's super cool super cool to see um listen that's all i have for you today magnus got like 20 out of 22 points he won the title tuesdays yada yada yada typical stuff you know uh and um yeah before you uh before this video ends and next up plays on youtube or you know you click on something in the sidebar um i'm really excited for this the i have never had gotham themed merch we did some stuff for the proess league and uh i think black and pink looks so cool i would even wear this outside and then people would go why are why do you have a hoodie of yourself and i'd be like cuz i'm in i'm narcissistic that's why super cool super cool um yeah that's all uh and um irl content coming soon going to see uh fans uh in florida going to see them in new jersey going to see them in london going to see them in toronto doing some fan book stuff uh that's going to be a lot of fun and if this video gets recommended to someone 2 years in the future and all of this already happened well then then hi thanks for watching you are appreciated all the same and hopefully there has not been an apocalypse and the world has not ended uh and if it has ended then hello you are probably one of the last remaining people on the planet that's i i what am i talking i'm gna go nap i get out of here
