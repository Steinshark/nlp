ladies and gentlemen in this video i'm very excited to share with you an update about the chess.com new bot named torch which was implemented a few months ago and up tod date has destroyed nearly everything in its path computer chess championship is going on right now and the botson chess.com are playing rapid chess against each other 10-minute chess an ai playing 10-minute will play better than any human probably taking months to play a game and that's why we're going to be covering many of torches games and how it defeated the strongest bots in the world like leela and stockfish and before we jump into the games today this is not a sponsored segment but it's october 1st so happy october uh there are three weeks remaining until this incredible book well it's incredible because i'm biased and i wrote it comes out uh many of you have pre-ordered it in fact 177,000 of you have pre-ordered it already some of you are getting a sign copy some regular just want to let you know this is

thank you all so so much for your support and for those of you waiting for it to come out for get it for christmas much love to you as well uh three weeks remaining i am so excited all right torch versus leela torch versus dragon torch versus ethereal not ethereum and torch versus stockfish four incredible games of chess showing you different amazing flavors textures techniques sounds like a gordon ramsey episode and i would know because i was in the season premiere of kitchen nightmares and i was called a food blogger if you don't know what i'm talking about go watch kitchen nightmares out on fox and hulu pawn to d4 pawn to d5 and to start out a video about ai chess we have a london system being played by torch now the way bots are playing against each other nowadays is they both play a pair of games against each other with white and black the same openings up until a certain point and some of you requested that i uh i tell you when that uh when the book ends and when the bots start thinking for themselves um so knight to f6 played by leela e3 bishop f5 so the bots have been pre-programmed to play a london versus a london torch turns it back into a queen's gambit c6 knight c3 and now plays queen b6 this is a bit of a provocative move by black and as you can see stockfish which is b stockfish right now is basically watching two of its friends play call of duty and is like laughing at them cuz it has a better kd um queen to d2 and now take take pawn to e6 and from this point forward the bots are on their own now already we have our first surprise of the game if i gave you this position and i quizzed you chess quiz what is the most natural move here for white most natural not asking you to attack anything some of you attacks most natural move is of course knight to f3 because you just develop a newcastle torch being rated 3,824 understanding chess better than we would if we lived in another thousand years place here the idea is that since white has two central pawns and black only has one i actually want to play e4 so before it castles it actually just goes f3 and e4 it doesn't even castle it doesn't castle it gets to invent its own rules and regulations and uh frameworks in chess because it senses that due to its space advantage and black's kind of scandinavian caroon pawn structure black doesn't have a lot of space space are squares that you control in your opponent's side of the board so knight bd7 and now rather than short castle or even long castle torch just goes g4 just g4 now g4 clearly has two ideas number one if your opponent castles they're going to castle directly into an onslaught so that would be nice number two you're actually just kind of threatening to attack these pieces it's sort of difficult to move the bishop and the knight any further backwards right now black has to decide what to do so leela plays queen a5 trying to simultaneously patrol this rank hit this diagonal and maybe free up something on the b file torch just doesn't give it doesn't give an f file just e4 g4 h4 let's take as much space as possible now pawn to h6 creating a getaway and bishop to b3 why i don't know i don't know i like i actually can't even explain it uh leela plays b5 and now given the fact that torch has pushed all of these pawns over here it obviously castle okay it it chooses not to castle into the direction there's no attack here for the record zero you block everything it castles after advancing its own pawns okay great then it slides the bishop to cover this diagonal and then it puts its knight on f4 to try to break up black structure at this point leela realizes it's in a bit of trouble because if bishop h7 i'm just going to keep attacking and then i'm going to go g6 as well so instead of that leela fires back take take cool common collected best move in the position torch has seven pawns a queen two rooks two bishops and a knight king to h1 take take c5 you know what the idea was you know what the idea of king to h1 was bishop g1 why we had to go there and not there i don't know queen b8 unpinning the bishop from from the queen and also trying to go here knight d5 i i don't care you could trap my bishop go ahead you want to trap my bishop trapped my bishop completely trapped the idea is knight e7 king e7 b bishop h2 the queen moves let's say i don't know to b6 and now the bishop can get away and so bishop d6 played and now f4 all of the pawns are going forward bishop c2 back pawn to e5 forking queen a8 the counter shot from the opposite corner of the board ai chess is ridiculous we get the bishop but we lose the knight now we trade the queens and now we try to break apart the structure the game has now transitioned from attacking chess into deep middle game and endgame chest we're going to grab that pawn on g6 and then we're going to anchor in the bishop on that square as well here couple of moves later pawn to g5 now pawn takes pawn takes this is the position all torch has here is a pawn majority and bishops the bishops are menacing they are light they are light speed right they can just go across the entire board and the knight is being controlled that's the most important thing about this position here a very nice idea tring off the rooks freeing up the mobility of these pawns now the rook can travel to the opposite side of the board whenever it wants hit this king the king is severely restricted and this king is completely safe because the bishop shields it that idiot bishop now at this point leela decides to give up this pawn the idea is that now the knight can hit the bishop and transfer into white's position rook a8 check forces the king up bishop h5 black comes in with rook d3 trying to get a fork the king escapes the rook pins the knight to the king now here comes pawn to f6 and torch is just too fast c3 take take stop the pawn while still applying pressure the bishop cuts off the rook's vision of the pawn but the idea is this and this so if pawn to c2 you're just going to take and then you're going to get the pawn bishop e7 and unfortunately my friends torch is simply too fast f8 queen forcing a removal over here and this pawn is going to be the hero that pawn is going to cut off all the king's oxygen rook c2 everything has been won king f5 rook f6 check no stalemate and there it is torch won this game in a just like from this position seemingly out of nowhere torch just said 92 and then it just brought all of these pawns like an avalanche and a few moves later it castled that way tucked its king on the opposite edge of the board put the bishop next to the king and just went for it all the pawns incredible absolutely amazing game here's a game that it played against dragon and this also was a london a slightly different one here torch actually played one of my course recommendations i have a course on the london and the chowski openings and against the move b6 i have this very fun line queen to f3 now here you will catch a lot of people pre-moving a lot of people will pre-move bishop to b7 and you will simply win the game shockingly that did not happen when the average elo of the players is 3800 but it could happen if it's 3,000 points lower than that so queen f3 is not as stupid as it looks the idea is to force black to block this diagonal and then quickly castle queen side so for example bishop b7 white can actually play d5 and also go here and then set this up and uh if you know if black is lazy and lac aasal you can play d5 very quickly and then get some sort of position where you have very good pressure it's actually very interesting line uh and i was very happy to see it being played in computer chess uh and right around bishop b4 and then a3 the bots left uh all previous territory black sends the bishop in to perish against the knight you will again notice that white develops in a way where the knight goes to e2 but this time it's because there's a queen on f3 this pawn blocks the bishop and basically white is arguing like my queen is in a stupid spot but it can quickly transfer to a use spot your bishop is now in a stupid spot and it can't transfer to a useful spot quickly so a3 take take and now both sides castle okay position obviously roughly equal the first thing the first alarm bell should now go off in your head opposite side castling probably is going to lead to attacking chess and when computers play attacking chess it's very fun it's like when highlevel athletes don't play it safe okay you know like uh in in in mixed martial arts for example i'm a big fan of mixed martial arts those of you that watch me enough uh know that um highle fighters sometimes try to just minimize their risk but sometimes they just go at it bishop to g5 clearly inducing this and now we're not going for a little you know oh i damaged their pawn structure i'm so clever no bishop g5 induced this h4 fishing pole fish hook when you have a rook and there's a castled king on the other side you can give up a piece to open up the file and now you're winning black can't go here black can't move the knight either black moves the knight it's actually m three by force queen h5 does lead to mate but it's not the fastest mate rook h8 is the fastest mate because it's a forcing move here queen h5 queen h7 so black can't take black can't take but what black can do is ignore black can just be like you're stupid i'm not taking that and now torch is like i'm not stupid you're stupid they argue like toddlers and now look at this repositioning we went bishop here induced this move got the h pawn there queen slides over now the bishop dances back to e5 pressure pressure pressure now my friends you've been watching and by the way you may wonder why the bot would put the king here it has a lot of options um but i guess it really didn't like that bishop d6 was going to happen so it was like i'm safe the the queen is guarding the night look you've been watching chess long enough how does white progress with the attack here how does white progress with the attack the attack needs a little bit of a tipping point we need a little bit more help rook h3 is not a crazy move but you got to move the queen somewhere to put the rook there uh knight e2 is a crazy move because while you do this you forget that your bishop has no escape and now you lose a piece and now you're no longer going to win because this bishop was integral to your attack so f4 f4 king h8 the rook comes to the f file the bishop slides backwards and knight e7 prevents white from any advancement into the position so white can now no longer play the move f5 so white's going to have to reposition and play the move g4 so uh torge plays f5 oh yeah you know a move is good when stockfish doesn't even realize it stockfish is sitting here recommending take be one preparation move no just f5 that's how you know you've messed up when a move that you are stop trying to prevent just calmly happens knight f5 queen f2 that was just a gluttonous pawn sacrifice now you have to live with the opening of the f file okay couple of moves ago the rook was dormant now a couple of moves ago there is no f pawn but that is not to black's benefit because it just opened the position for white queen f2 now the threat is here and here that's it the game is over you have to stop that if you don't stop pawn to g4 and then pawn to g5 you're going to lose because i'm going to get this too so black plays h5 but now take and now i take this pawn and now torch is making this expert transition from middle game attack to middle game long-term advantage pressure on this pawn very difficult if black goes g6 i'm not going anywhere i'm going g4 you take my bishop i take your knight okay you take this i'm going to get that and that and that so queen h6 and now not defending the pawn on e3 but g4 anyway take and now expert sliding the queen over the idea is very simple after take and take black's knight is hanging f7 is falling knight g3 is a fork but this is a major problem all right that's a major problem so pawn to g6 take take take take and now my friends torch realizes it is down upon but it is winning it's amazing why is it winning because of that bishop and that's that wall of pawns a long time ago on likee move four we made a move that forced black to commit to the attack on this diagonal black went d 5 we fast forward some 20 moves we fast forward an entire middle game and now we realize the bishop is completely sealed in and it is going to get beaten up and watch as torch literally wins every single pawn every pawn is hanging around every pawn is difficult to guard first things first we win e6 then we come back we're going to trade rooks and then we're going to win h5 while this bishop and these pawns are still standing here look at stockfish doesn't even realize how dire the position is yet for black white defends everything white plays rook e five threatening to transition into a winning king and pawn end game it's a very amazing move because after take take king e6 i would play h5 you take my pawn i can't just run but i play knight e3 you play king f6 i play knight g4 you stop the pawn my knight is going to get in and also i have h6 and then knight e5 because of the stupid bishop again so rook h2 h5 couple of moves later white wins that pawn couple of moves later black is going to win a pawn of their own but look at black's bishop that stupid bishop h6 rook c7 the pawns are going to fall why are the pawns falling because if you don't take the pawns i'm just going to make a queen so to create counterplay dragon gives up its pawns but torch literally wins every single pawn everything every single pawn is stopped this bishop plays absolutely no role in the game and slowly methodically torch marches forward advances all of its pieces that bishop literally was like just a a a pingpong ball this entire game and torch wins it in the center of the board look at the trajectory of that bishop that bishop went to b7 stood there for the whole game until it was attacked slid forward a square tucked itself away behind a bunch of pawns it literally did nothing tucked itself away all the pawns proceeded to parish when it was all already lost it it darted to the other end of the board for some reason to d1 like this and it ended the game on the other outskirts of the board spectating and doing absolutely nothing on the h5 square a move before checkmate i mean the bishop literally went here here here here here that's it that's all it did it did not participate and and tor did this in a very strategic and methodical manner now another game this time a sicilian defense this is against ethereal and like i said we will end with stockfish which is the best computer in the world um now this one was weird so this game had a very weird opening d4 bishop g4 pinning the knight we take on c5 black damages our structure by tripling our pawns now und doubling them and now we play a very interesting collinear move a move on the same line as another piece but instead of taking it we just sto we would like to get taken queen c8 knight g5 and now the bots are thinking on their own knight g5 of course threatening on f7 pawn uh knight to h6 defending we kick out the bishop and this is just a really obscure game how does torch handle a position that has no real structure all right h4 of course of course right rook pawn going to h5 opening up this of course we have to go h4 black plays queen c7 immediately trying to sneak into g3 now it plays rook b1 h4 and rook b1 two moves on opposite ends of the board forces black into a developing move now plays knight h3 undevelop and also hitting this knight and black takes ethereal says you know what i want to remove some of your control over there break uh bring your rook out so now you can't castle and now i'm going to undevelop you can win my pawn but i'm going to catch up in my development and then i'm going to go rook b8 queen g5 knight to h5 again looking to probably build up something solid in the center torch plays bishop e2 and slides the queen here to h6 it's still a really weird position it's like the sci are playing chess that doesn't make it's like uh when you have a fever dream you have one of those dreams like your motor skills don't make any sense like nothing makes sense just gibberish this is what this feels like like what is going on you know it's like a salvador del painting except it's uh it's a chess board e5 now we go here here we go here i guess to prevent knight to f4 okay this knight undeveloped trying to maybe go here and hit the queen the queen's got eyes here maybe queen c5 and queen in here now white plays bishop a3 with pressure on this diagonal black plays rook d7 making sure the knight is protected and now white just walks the king out probably clearing out some space probably trying to get the king to safety i want you to keep an eye on this king just keep an eye it just made one move black immediately plays f5 looking to put some pressure on this f file white plays bishop takes c7 the less pieces you have the less of a chance you have of of of trapping one of mine the other idea of this move is very sneaky obviously it's to liberate the knight but if let's say white plays king g2 black plays f4 and the queen is stuck so if you play g4 here i have like knight g8 and knight g3 and the queen is the queen's going to really struggle to move so bishop takes e7 rook takes e takes f5 rook queen to d7 because you can't take because you lose your knight so queen d7 what is it oh oh look at that look at that you can't take on g6 because then you would be losing your rook so seeing that that can't happen torch takes on g6 losing his rook wouldn't be a gotham video if a rook wasn't sacrificed the rook is completely hanging but that move removed the defense so queen h3 inviting in the queen for for t but queen takes h5 and immediate counter shot and black on move 26 of this game with the king stranded with four pawns missing no bishops and no knights castles oh yeah castles not only is the king safe now against checkmate the rook sees this queen h2 is here the rook can zip around this way this is not a pleasant position but torch is very happy because it forces the rooks in front of the pawn and now it plays c5 rook on the board queen on the board pawn is knocking on the door and it all it wants all torch wants is bishop here which wins the game it'll win the game so king g7 bishop c4 is now met with pawn to h6 kicking out the queen so torch adapts its strategy and plays pawn takes h7 check and now the king uses the pawn as an umbrella pawn if the king had taken bishop d3 king h8 leads to mate in several moves you would lose all your rooks so king h8 bishop d3 torches up a bishop and several pawns for a rook now i told you keep an eye on this king because now the game after rook g7 queen f6 queen takes g3 and king e3 quickly goes to an end game after a queen f4 check take take and now not this no that's not the objective the objective is to safeguard the king sandwiched between pawns the bishop will go there we will take that we will make a queen king d4 then king c4 bishop e4 pawn to c6 trying to make black choke on the pawn and then the king would walk forward it's just incredible stuff look at this the king goes behind the pawn the king gets safeguarded and then goes to d6 it went f2 i think it went to g2 g3 f4 e4 d4 c it just marches up the entire board the king has taken the pawn the king is now on b7 the pawn has a red carpet while this bishop is anchored guarding that forcing the king to be passive and here comes here come white's pawns bishop d5 rook to b6 of course if you trade off the rooks you're just in a winning end game now we go directly to a winning end game but let's not forget that white still has an active king that king is knocking on the door rook f8 check king takes a5 is coming and torch me methodically slowly forces black into total passivity and now dancing around the inevitable takes on a5 marches the king up the board two pawns is two pawns too many rook b6 i mean black could have taken on f5 it's still totally lost torch with a little bit of a sense of humor rook c6 pawn to a7 promotes and uh checkmates with a rook doesn't even need a queen it knows how to checkmate with a rook incredible stuff that king walk was amazing from a very obscure opening to marching the king in this very odd middle game first to f2 then we skipped g2 we just went straight to e3 d4 c4 look at this but just it just realized it can use its king it just it just walk the king to the other side of the board it's amazing amazing stuff uh we got to end with stockfish though we got to end with stockfish though uh big shout out by the way seriously i just looked down like everything in the in the room now has a book there's there's this book there's that piece of poster board those are a bunch of copies from the uk because they sent me 20 copies from the uk this is the uh english version uh i guess the uh the american version um and uh yeah just just check it out y'all get it for christmas ask your loved ones to get it for you for christmas christmas it's going to be a great time i i do appreciate all of you who have pre-ordered which is about 177,000 which is incredible in total across all places and all additions it's over 20,000 amazing now let's end with a bang stockfish plays a bon defense a slightly obscure bon all right this kind of slightly passive structure a4 preventing b5 bishop d3 let's see how torch handles this oh yes it's already getting spicy pawn to g4 negating the development of the bishop and pressuring the knight to go backwards knight b d7 g5 knight g8 would be brutal so h6 now we develop covering more light squares and we trade off black's light squared bishop why do we trade off black's light squared bishop because that bishop wants to participate that bishop is stuck look at this bishop look at all of these dark squared pawns that bishop is playing a very low role in this game it's going to be very tough to develop and then torch took this kn this was a crazy move i would i would never in a millionaires never in a million years would i play that move never that is an insane move to me you just told me you want to trade and put a knight on f5 why on earth would you do this you can't even win this pawn with queen d3 because black plays king f7 that's what happened in the game i would stop right here i would go why would i do that the rook is going to come here the knight's going to reroute torch is like okay show me show me okay you think the knight is going to reroute right look look you did everything you're even giving me this pawn because knight e5 knight f3 check guess what torch says okay i like free pawns stupid stockfish knight e5 check king slides to h1 and torch is like look stockfish you're just down a pawn you're just down a pawn i'm better here and what i'm going to do now is i'm going to remove this knight and i'm going to push at some point i'm going to play f4 guess what i got a rook coming from that angle rook a3 take take the knight's going to move you don't want to move the night i'm going to hit your queen you don't want to move the night now you got to move the knight because i sealed off everybody's defense get out of here nice now watch this knight e6 i'm giving up my knight for a pawn you can't take it though because then i would pin your knight to your queen stockfish is like you idiot what about queen g6 now if take then take we go to a rook and night end game tor like got no plans for an end game i gave up that pawn on e6 so that i had pressure on your pawns your backwards pawns which can't make any progress and i have a majority here and i have attacking possibilities we play pawn to f5 we bring our rook we reroute the knight again to that same e6 square rook to g3 knight to f8 rook d3 we're attacking those pawns those pawns are soft b3 and now stockfish can't handle this anymore stockfish is not very good at sitting around and getting toyed with it sacrifices a pawn for activity once again torch calls its bluff and now torch makes a gangster move remember colinear moves moves on the same diagonal this hits this and this so what do we do queen to c6 what a move idea very straightforward we want to eat all of these pawns one by one and we want to trade queens but on our terms and our next move is knight to d5 that's our next move rook d6 knight d5 we're in good shape rook c8 played now we trade but a massive difference see this this knight d5 does not prevent rook takes because there is no knight d7 actually i take that back it does prevent that because if you go here then there's knight c7 but for some reason torch forced it it its opponent to play rook c8 the only thing i can imagine is that now after this trade the rook is passive it forced stockfish i guess to get off the e file i guess that's it that's that's so wild but i i don't understand because now you can play c4 i don't i don't get it i tried to explain i don't even know i'm in awe just like you are look there's pawn to c4 you would think i was trying to prevent that but look at this rookie won and now watch how effortlessly torch beats stockfish in this end game it's it's just awesome knight e4 it just gets the pawns it starts bringing its king that knight on d6 defends absolutely everything let's trade some rooks i'm going to advance effortlessly pawns king another at kingwok very simple transition to an end game and there's bad manners coming up you ready watch this rook h7 b6 black attacks the rook oh i love this moment in this game of course any human being on the planet rook d7 that rook to d7 moving the rook literally anywhere on the board that doesn't lose a rook and torch ends the game by bad manners versus stockfish rook to e e7 check giving up the rook for no reason no reason at all but there is a reason you know what the reason is because after take take black's rook cannot stop both pawns at the same time it can't it has to be on the eighth rank it cannot stop one pawn from there and from there but it matters which pawn you push you have to stop rook e8 pawn to look at that that is just these bots have a sense of humor check check and now if king f2 that's probably the best move the bot likes king g2 even better rook e5 it makes a queen and unfortunately it's going to make a second one i wish should promote it to a rook and now the best mathematical technique possible deflects the king to the back rank queen c7 is made just awesome just like so effortless from like this position you know slightly better for white black is quite passive not down a pa and just just destroying in multiple ways endgame grinds this game like absurd king walks to the opposite edge of the board this game was amazing weird slightly weird opening monstrous attack transition to the end game winning all of its opponent's pawns and this this i mean this was just the terminator just one like the terminator just awesome awesome 3824 rated and rapid what more do you want you know what more i i you know i i don't know what more i'm going to go enjoy
