to be covered in this video i'm going to take you through the storyline of this unbelievable match played between oliver as a ferrugia and wesley so just a couple of days ago on chess.com it's the speed chess championship the way it works is the players have a certain amount of time to play five minute and one second bonus time then they play a certain amount of time of three minute and one second bonus time and then they end with bullet and at the end you tally up the score and the winner wins the match this match while i i'm not gonna spoil anything we start the match with oliver playing e4 and going into an italian and italian knight f6 d3 bishop e7 the chess is relatively insignificant ali reza take some space on the queen side chops off the knights chops off the bishop and confidently expands into his opponent's territory now wesley so is one of the best defensive chess players in the world not like defensive verbally he is a very very good defender he's very practical place pawn to f5 in this position mobilizing forces toward ali rez's king alireza plays a4 and then olly rosa plays a5 oliver is like bro you're giving me all the space on the queen side i might as well take it because if you chop chop you can't bring your knight out or your bishop and if you play f4 i just move my bishop back to d2 and let's not let's not pretend like we're actually gonna create some sort of attack here so instead of that wesley goes here plays rook at fate and ali russell keeps going alireza starting off this match by attacking his opponent plays c6 wesley chops plays d4 alright tense moment is this an asset or a liability for white is this an asset or a liability for white we have bishop before rook b8 take six now we have a position of knight versus bishop ali versus plan is something like this he wants to win the pawn he wants to rotate his knight somewhere over here maybe put the knight over here maybe create an attack on the light squares in the future wesley puts the rook on b5 and says young man why did you just give me this pawn and alibraza goes well because i'm gonna go here and then here look at me i'm so clever sacking the rook you take i take queen c6 knight e5 all right you can't take because your rook is hanging gothams nope wesley plays queen c3 queen c3 is what we call a cold shower which sometimes feels nice on a hot day but right now it's the middle of winter and all there is being forced to take a cold shower the point is that the queen hits this and this and the knight is still hanging which means white has to trade the queens white now has to get the knight out of danger and by the time that happens the pawn has arrived on c2 and you can go here to block out the bishop rook d8 to go rook to d1 bishop f6 stops the pawn to e7 rook d1 as well as this alireza loses now i told you i was going to show you eight games in this video that's one out of eight twelve and a half percent finished all right how was your attention span ali reza loses early in the match now alireza now has the black pieces he plays knight to f6 and he plays what's known as the king's indian defense one of the most aggressive openings in chess if you'd like to play for a win and create some imbalance pawn to e5 pawn takes d4 one of the lines rookie eight c6 d5 attacking the center of the board wesley takes once and then wesley castles now followers takes on c4 the bishop will take so oliver goes you're trying to target the center and then plays knight h5 targeting the center with the bishop and with the knight to go to f4 g3 now look at this bishop h3 all right oh my goodness every piece that alireza has is getting a turn rook is coming to the center every piece has gotten a turn knight f4 something might happen over here he's got a very nice position knight b5 bishop e5 every piece that alireza has is being utilized for the attack i mean the position does not get any better wesley is on the back foot but look at the time look at the time that ali raza has spent to get here that is you are not looking at that wrong it is eight seconds versus three minutes and 29. this is really really bad he has a lot less time than his opponent he has one second bonus time every time he makes a move but that's not very you know that's not very good now not he goes back and slowly wesley starts fighting back now he gets rid of his knight anyone's a pawn and in low time alirez goes here hanging this and this now all the rest is down three pawns and because he has six seconds on the clock he plays rook f8 loses his knight tries to take runs out of steam g4 and you can take with the bishop bishop d4 check is fatal and uh very unfortunate very unfortunate this is just the way it goes um other residents now lost two games we are now down 25 of the games of this video two out of eight oliver is losing two nothing we stay in the five minute segment oh looks like a couple of the moves are spoiled e45 we have another italian nothing crazy two top level grand masters going for another italian this time alireza plays bishop h4 reroute to the bishop and he still takes space on the queen side but he does it slightly differently and this time he plays for the center now my friends what you are about to witness you should never ever ever do at home okay there's like viewer discretion is advised you know like parental advisory for movies there's uh don't try this stunt at home what you are about to witness is the equivalent of um two grandmasters who have a caffeine high and are going to a rage room you know those rooms where they give you a hammer and allow you to smash things that is what you are about to witness knight takes in the center now ali rosa takes on e5 now pawn to d5 holding everything together in the position now knight to f5 i mean this is some this is some really wild stuff wesley has pushed all the pawns in front of his king his king is still in the center of the board don't play chess like this just don't do it and later in the video they get even goofier all right wesley has a very nice position though look at the evaluation that the computer is giving knight to e7 this clearly the wrong plan and this also the wrong plan and alireza is worse again knight d4 takes takes don't play chess like this pawn to h5 don't do this i'm telling you right now h5 is the top computer choice but you are not a computer you are not a 3050 raider player a 3108 rated player if you play like this you are going to get checkmated in 10 moves h5 is very simple trying to trap the bishop if you play f3 i take take and bishop takes d4 and if you're wondering why you can't play bishop takes e4 right now well it's very simple you can but this is not going anywhere and the point is after h5 white has to make a very big concession white goes here white sacrifices the pawn to try to save his bishop and my friends i think it's a familiar storyline for you wesley grabs all of alirez's pawns and uh ali rose has six seconds on the clock ali reza loses this game in this position he just resigns he's only down one pawn he has five pawns his opponent has six if you were my student and you resigned in this position with white i would slap you assuming you were an adult if you are a child i would tell your parents to slap you i do not condone violence unless absolutely necessary um ali reza lost every game that i've showed you thus far we are now 37.5 percent done with the games in this video oliver is a lost the five plus one section of this match seven to two he was down five games now you're a smart viewer about 90 percent of you probably understand that's not the end of the story ten percent of you are just watching passively in the background and not really paying attention much you smell uh the king goes to f7 and the five plus one segment ends with a seven to two score line we start three plus one blitz it is seven wins for it is seven points for wesley six wins two draws two points for ali reza one win two draws seven two down five down five is a lot reminds me of a certain world cup except one team didn't even make it to two knight f3 knight f6 and we have already seen this alireza is going for a king's indian defense knight a6 all right oliveras are going for a very cagey king's indian defense he's trying to keep as many pawns on the board as possible locking that center of the door uh the center of the door center of the board uh and he's uh he's gonna try to expand here and create a very traditional king's indian attack that is what a king's indian player likes pawn takes knight takes knight e4 alireza plays b6 knight c5 a5 creating this sort of wall a dark squared wall of pawns all right pressure here pressure here maybe the knight will jump into the center of the board keep in mind wesley is up five games how do you handle that how do you handle having a massive lead like do you step on the gas do you try to appease the opponent right waiting bishop d7 bishop b8 rerouting now the knight jumps into the middle of the board the position is very tense one improvement in this game is that alibress is not down a lot on time h4 takes bishop f2 bishop g6 king h7 king h2 queen e7 knight f5 all right both players had a minute on the clock there goes ali russell with pawn to h5 slides out of the way bishop takes bishop takes bishop takes h4 knight into d3 30 seconds per player a very big moment in this match because if ali reza loses he's going to be down six games and in all likelihood he's not making it into a gotham video and there is no greater honor in the world knight to f4 g3 knight back to g6 he chops this away and the position is about to start falling apart for white pawn takes f4 rook takes f4 bishop e5 he allows a check slides the king to safety knight e4 you may ask yourself why was this check not played because of queen h7 because at the end of everything at the end of everything there was a bishop hitting a rook to a king knight e4 alirez goes here wesley comes forward queen c2 check and my friends mate is actually on the board for white but you know who's getting mated first mr wesley queen d1 queen e2 king h1 queen e1 and now anywhere you move the king i take the roku check queen of three it's going to be made very shortly checkmate we have now concluded how many games four four out of nine four of nine games yeah oh it's about to get real wild it's about to get real wild i subtracted a game i've been calculating incorrectly but i was just doing that to keep your attention i thought there was eight games it's actually nine it's nine games which means my entire percentage of this entire video have been off because i've been calculating wow and i'm not even gonna edit that out i told you in the beginning of this video there was eight games i lied there's nine games why did i tell you there was eight games there's nine games and i've been calculating the fractions based on the eight games i'm having an existential crisis right now there's nine games surprise well this is awkward let's continue ali raza starts a comeback seven two down in the five plus one segment place pawn to e4 e5 this time we have a petrov defense by wesley d4 now what you're about to witness is disgusting once again i am going to compel you not to play chess like what i am about to show you knight takes e4 pawn takes e5 bishop goes to c5 bishop goes to c4 wait i'm sorry what is there not a direct threat on f2 yes knight takes f2 is allowed you know why what is worth more than a queen and a rook you you are worth more than a queen and a rook but also the king bishop takes f7 luring the king out if the king didn't take you would just save your queen now queen d5 check and you take the bishop and the knight takes on h1 and white is down a full rook now this knight sucks but you're still down a rook slow down a rook and and the position's equal but it's very very stressful position h6 and d6 black trying to fight back black trying to save the king get the pawns out of there knight d5 alibraza hits c7 knight c6 alireza plays e6 it looks like you can take them you get forked this would be really bad so you can't take so he goes king h7 and he hides the king but now they've also pushes the pawn knight c7 now they trade the queens and it gets the root back oh my goodness it's like an apocalypse the entire board now both guys have knights trapped on the end but this knight can get out and guess what it does it escapes but not for long not for long the night is trapped once again now we have long castle rook c7 bishop a7 b5 now the bishop comes to b6 and d4 because the white knighted of the black knight in the corner on nature one is not going anywhere and at the end of the day finally ali rosa takes and when all of this settles he is just up a pawn it's not one of these it's not one of these he is up the most powerful pawn of all the outside pass pawn on the outskirts of the board that can be escorted the knight the king could all push this pawn forward and it's going to be very difficult for black to defend it would be harder for black to defend if he had a knight but he doesn't he has the most powerful long-range weapon in the game with the exception of a queen rook a6 rook a1 a4 and a couple moves later a5 you will notice alireza is sacrificing everything he sacrifices all his pawns because the pawn is gonna go he's not scared of discovered check the pawn makes it to a7 but i got bad news for alireza that pawn's not going anywhere nobody can actually successfully escort the pawn and he didn't go here because of takes and it would be discovered check yeah and uh oliver is not gonna make his way through but they have seven seconds on the clock seven seconds on the clock anything can happen otherwise plays knight c7 all the rest of chase is the bishop he chases the bishop he chases the bishop he chases the bishop he threatens to push the pawn he also threatens to disconnect the bishop from the defense now the bishop goes here now alireza wins the pawn back now wesley plays rook a three and he's gonna stop the pawn but now rook d7 check and now knight b5 now the pawn is defended by the knight and the bishop is hit by the rook down the bishop doesn't move wesley could have moved the bishop let's say to c6 but then rook d6 wesley could have moved the bishop to f3 but then the rook would have been hanging so instead he makes it down to h3 alireza plays rook b8 rook g8 takes on g4 rook h4 is coming the pawn is unstoppable alireza wins again there is more three-minute chests to be played ali reza storms back in this segment from a 7-2 deficit he was down five games the match was all but over wesley tried to fight back wesley played a pierce defense he played rookie one rookie eight and he basically said i'm gonna mimic you i'm going to play symmetrically and ali raza took space ali raza took space away from wesley and then took space away from wesley that's just what he does he loves space bishop e3 c4 c5 maybe he takes maybe bishop b5 pressure you know here at the rook and the queen and so on but what did wesley do wesley prepared pawn to f5 so alireza is focused on this side and so wesley is focused on this side f3 f4 there we go bishop f6 alireza plays c4 i told you that he's all in he is all in c4 c5 wesley tries to trade the dark square bishop he's going to succeed c5 now oliver as it takes on passon takes and continues chugging forward 30 seconds on the clock he chomps in now here comes the queen forward here comes the knight forward here comes the rook taking the entire d file and alireza plays knight to b6 hitting the knight hitting the rook you have to take but then the pawn gets too a square closer to promotion knight c5 is a thing hitting the queen and the bishop rook d7 at any moment you want the queen also threatens the pawn and in this position after just playing knight to b6 material is equal time is basically equal and wesley so resigned wesley so started this match up by five games seven two it is now nine nine do the math the three-minute portion of this match ended 7-2 alireza these guys traded seven to two score lines in the blitz it could not have been more lopsided in either segment i'm not sure that has ever happened in the speeches championship where one person loses by five and then wins the next segment by five it is unheard of unheard of so what is the next segment they gotta play bullet they were trading blows this is one of the last several games that they were playing now they've only got a minute for the entire game you've got no time to think you're just playing fully on adrenaline long castles by wesley you know what that means that is a declaration of hostility that is a he has gotten nefarious intentions with ali reza's position ali resin plays a3 and b4 wesley plays bishop b6 and i got news for you one man has a faster attack in this position and his name is wesley so he immediately takes the pawn he plants the rook firmly on the g4 square exerting pressure on three sides pawn to g3 now the queen is sneaking in on the light squares it's like a trojan queen rook takes h4 now the queen is opened up now knight goes to g4 queen slides back to e7 who's gonna protect the spawn who's gonna protect the pawn is going to be the queen but here comes the rook king g2 full common collected wesley leaves the position the rook pins the queen to the king ali has a place here wesley doesn't even take the queen he goes here the point he can't take that's not going anywhere what an absolute slobber knocker of a game i'm pretty sure that's a term wesley so wins this game so fast and it all comes down to the final bullet game the final bullet game if ali reza wins this game there is a playoff if he doesn't it's all over the fortnite f6 bishop g7 bishop g2 castles castles c4 knight d7 alireza plays the king's indian defense he has played many king's indian defenses in this uh in this match h3 very tense wesley needs to appease alireza he cannot get into a barn burner of a bullet game with this guy pawn to c6 b3 alireza just like he's done so many times loves to push his pawns loves to push respawns f4 here comes the knight crisscross applesauce all over the board take stakes now while the rest is focusing on the queen side his queen comes in this queen slides out now he strikes in the center like this oh my goodness this is unbelievable they got' seconds on the clock how do you keep your nerves in this position bishop takes out five another bishop slides back to d7 so he can't be taken 14 seconds per player knight to e2 we have a queen trade now the knight drops back to leave that area keep pressuring the white position rook a3 giving white something to think about they're both at about 10 seconds knight e4 pawn to d5 holding together the center of the board takes takes now the bishop goes from the other angle that might have been a big mistake by wesley as the knight comes in as well wait a minute the rook is trapped the rook is trapped it has nowhere to move i'll leave us against the rook and then he keeps knocking on the door and here it comes knight d2 knight d2 the point is you are hitting the rook and this is under fire but after knight takes d2 you stop defending this bishop takes d4 this is hit you cannot move it you can take upon with check that's really not much of anything knight c4 there's still problems here ali reza wins the final most important game of the match and the players are all square they were all square after the three plus one it was nine to nine they split the bullet equally then they played a best of four playoff of bullet it was also tied so it went to an armageddon armageddon no bonus time one game decides the entire match the way armageddon works is as follows black can draw the game and win black can draw the game and win but black starts with less time how much time does black start with they bid they bid on it they say hey i want this amount of time to play black wesley so bid 3 minutes and 48 seconds he said i'll play black with 3 minutes and 48 seconds on the clock ali raza won the bid he said three minutes and 40 seconds so he bid eight seconds less so he wins the color that now can play for two results having two of the three possible results in your pocket and chess is huge but the drawback is you start the game with a minute and 20 seconds less and no bonus time it all comes down to this otherwise it can win this game otherwise it can draw this game wesley so has to win that's it this is how we break ties in chess bishop c4 you sacrifice a little bit of your time to get that extra result knight f6 bishop c5 we have another italian this time it is ali rez on the black side they played a lot of italians knight g4 and ali reza forced the trade and has this position he has kind of closed the gap a little bit on time not by a huge amount h3 very tense position now he's really close the time gap equal position less than a minute time advantage for white who started with a 80 second time advantage 97 take take how was how is wesley going to win this game 319 versus 238 dead equal position no bishops on the board how on earth can wesley win he's not going to win this ali reza is in great shape knight h7 queen d2 oh my goodness wesley hung upon oh my goodness that is absolutely unbelievable wesley was just shuffling back and forth preventing knight to g5 and he blunders a pawn on the edge of the board now he plays pawn to b3 baiting alireza in like this but he can absolutely do that he can then come back and go like this i mean he's just cleanly down upon instead ali raza comes back okay take take it's just a clean pawn down very tense game 202 versus 255 no bonus time knight f6 knight g6 now weston puts tonight on f5 and plays f4 wesley's going for it 143 228 about 40 seconds separate the player's ponto f4 pawn down can't you sit back oliver is way too fast win c6 king h2 the dog just growled in his sleep you guys can't see it but there's a doggy sleeping over here and he just growled in his sleep cutest thing in the world all of a sudden knight takes e4 ali reza just won a second pawn this is crazy ali russell won a second pawn but look at his time night queen goes to d4 the knight drops back to f6 and in this position wesley so trades the rooks and ali reza needs to go knight takes two pawns up mate is defended but instead he plays queenie eight anticipating knight takes h6 pawn takes h6 queen takes f6 and something like queen e7 but wesley sacrifices the knight like this knight takes g7 a devastating move for the black position who only has 50 seconds to figure it out if you play king takes g7 wesley follows up with the haymaker not knight not not any of this but b4 and the point is that pontus c5 runs into check which is now blocked and then queen f6 and queen g7 so all of a sudden alirez is in dire straits rook a2 played with 33 seconds on the clock but all of a sudden his position is falling apart wesley roars forward with the queen but here's the thing there's no bonus time there's no bonus time so not only is wesley winning on the board in all likelihood he's just going to get in alirez a desperate times call for desperate measures five seconds on the clock and move 40 king to f3 ends the match and wesley so wins it in armageddon one of the most insane matches i've ever seen it ended by the scoreline of 16 and a half to 15 and a half wesley led seven to two then it was nine to nine they traded seven to two in the blitz it was equal in the bullet it was equal in the playoffs and in the armageddon wesley actually blundered upon but it he just started an attack he said i am going to sit here and just go for it and go for it he did sometimes it's just fun to watch the titans play um i will make some more uh i will make some more of these as the speeches championship continues and obviously hopefully results in the hikaru magnus final till then that's all i got out of here
