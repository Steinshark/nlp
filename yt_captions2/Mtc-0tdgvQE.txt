i have never read this everybody tells me this is just the greatest story i have to understand what happened here this coconut right here apparently breaks the team fortress 2 game files i don't get it if deleted it breaks the game this is wild an image that is never used apparently this is not what i've heard it's never used if you delete that boom game breaks deep within the team fortress 2 game files exists a 20 a 256 a little two to the eight two to the a jpeg uh of a highly detailed coconut okay you know i'm not really into nfts but i feel one coming you know what i mean i'm gonna hop really quickly do a little salana or whatever it's called boom we're gonna make the coconut then you guys are gonna make me rich millions of bajillions of dollars okay and then i can spend it all on steak.com and become a gambling addict and then ruin my entire life what do you guys think about that i was thinking about like that's a good arc you know because everybody has to go everyone has to go out some way and i was thinking about taking a motorcycle and jumping off a jump without a landing that's kind of my thought would be like a way to go out uh ruin my life all that uh i highly detailed coconut over top a plain gray background this image isn't used anywhere in the game not as a texture or an item but deleting it will cause the game to stop working this i swear the amount of different things in my life that i have programmed like you know what when i see this i see a mirror that i that i look in that i look into there's a meme that's percolating inside of me you know the guy pointing at the mirror this is me this story is me in some weird way any programmer uh would know a best that code can be a total enigma at times the code even the code that appears to be most elegant on its face can fail to accomplish the most menial tasks oh man i really i i really gotta read that as well while in other cases incorporating a random arbitrary steps within code is seemingly required to make it run rendering even the most polished programmer stunned the valve a team's fortress 2 with no exception i still remember with falcore there is this part that was about uh so something to do with falcor falcor was a library for data fetching and caching on the client side in javascript and we did this one thing where if you were to make a request in some part of your game you request a tree of data or a forest of data and somewhere else you'd request another one later on but during that request this request had some subset of this request already in flight i would dedup it out of there so you wouldn't make multiple requests for the same set of data and i i thought okay this is easy this won't be hard turns out no it's super hard and uh not only is it super hard i thought i would write it well because the previous implementation was crap and my implementation became almost like line for line the same as their implementation and it was the greatest learning experience ever which is no matter how shitty the code looks i probably would have written the same thing because i'm a jackass too and that's just that it was the day i learned to love everybody's code fun fact uh there's a jpeg of a coconut i have no [ __ ] idea oh who put it here no i didn't want to click it i was just trying to highlight it uh but when i delete it the game wouldn't start words cannot describe this is just so good this is just so i did not know about this at all right uh let's see oh while the dev note isn't real uh being just a joke uh reddit comment from user uh bucket full of biscuits the uh the coconut jpeg as well as the stipulations that come from deleting it very much are okay that's really great even though it's not a legitimate dev note it is still true uh or it is true that it is still an unsolved mystery as to why the coconut is there and who put it there and it isn't too much a reach to assume that this left the developers quite puzzled upon discovering it that it could that it couldn't be deleted team fortress is two source code uh is a prime example of what programs called spaghetti code a term used to describe tangled source code that uh is difficult to maintain and unravel so you're telling me you can't even just search for the coconut you can't just like can you can't just like use telescope grep out the word coconut.jpg and boom it's just not even there this tangle can make it so deleting or altering uh any one thing within the spaghetti code will cause dozens of other seemingly unrelated of things throughout the code to break team fortress 2's case is on the most extreme side as deleting this coconut will cause the whole game to fail to even start this coconut literally holds the entire game together this one explanation could be that the coconut was used as a placeholder for another texture prior to the appropriate texture being made for the developer testing purposes but the reference made the uh to the coconut were never fully uh scrubbed from the spaghetti so it is it so its existence became integral to the game's function and startup deleting the coconut means the game returns a null if it checks for it resulting in a crash this is so good uh the source code for team fortress 2 leaked last year with hackers using it to push malware onto unsuspecting players computers and putting many online players at risk of cyber attacks with no chance of the game ever being ported to source 2. this means that it is quite unlikely that we'll ever see the source code released officially to the public at least until the servers go down so we may never know the true purpose that this coconut serves this article is not real how do you know it's not real i i know do we call bs i've heard this a million times is this actually bs or is it not where was the answer this article has been debunked as fake by the way why are you ruining this can we just can we just have something that's funny for the sake of it being funny why does it have to be fake why does my life have to suck i've heard about this and now i'm sad source trust me bro i know no we can't i just want a coconut to break a game nothing is real stuff like this happens all the time though it is it does happen all the time i think what makes this so real or at least so believable is that i have literally programmed the same thing i've had things in which are completely unrelated that aren't even needed that i somehow accidentally left in that when you delete it it breaks everything and you're just like why why would you do this when when did this become a problem it just didn't uh maybe it's something to do with the pack yeah i know there's there's some so you know if this is real there's some sort of like created string that gets generated that turns out to be this and then the coconut dll gets just explodiated doesn't matter if it's fake or not the issue exists and systems i know that's the thing is this is a real it's a real story we should all see or see ourselves in this story the coconut is a symbolism for use effect i was recently going back to my react roots in programming i swear i spend 30 minutes fixing a stupid use effect bug i swear there is nothing worse i was going back to my roots okay and this was just like last week i had to create an example for another team to use the library and so i was just like oh this will be easy i'll just use charts js and then charge js of course is an esm module so i couldn't use charge.js because that whole thing just completely fell apart and i hated my light so then the next thing i did was i had to use charts js the earlier version esm is like the single worst plague on mankind ever created and then finally when i got done doing that i'm like all right we got this we're looking good things are looking great use effect i spent so much time there but eventually i got it which was to use a used ref with a use effect all the iq all the iq esm is the savior the esm the name is use feltagen
