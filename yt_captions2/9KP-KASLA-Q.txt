we are entering a new era in the tech industry everything is changing it used to be the case that to become a software engineer earning 100 200k a year you needed an expensive computer science degree but not anymore we are entering the era of online education and there are tons of young programmers who are take 100k plus a year as a self-taught software engineer with no previous experience in coding how do i know this because i did it i learned to code all on my own online with no computer science degree and and no experience it's just 4 months and i got a job as a software engineer at a really large company and it changed my life now just because i got these results doesn't mean you will because the downside of online education is that there is a ton of crap out there i have gone through literally 40 plus different coding courses online and a lot of them are quite frankly a complete waste of time so let me go ahead and save you the hundreds of hours i have spent going through all these different options out there and give you the ones that actually work and in addition i will also distill these courses down into a few curated road maps based on the best coding courses i have personally tried that work for regular average people so all you have to do is pick a road map based on your budget and just blindly follow it like a robot and eventually you'll just learn the code so these are the criteria that we will use to evaluate these different courses number one comprehensiveness does it give you everything in one place two production value is the material high quality and something that's nice to look at three practice focus will it help you build real projects or is it more just theoretical fluff that's really difficult to understand number four teaching style is it easy to understand for beginners and lastly job hunt help will it help you with resumes linkedin strategies and interview skills so that you can actually take your coding skills and get an actual job so what we'll do now is compare different coding learning resource providers sl like course categories to see how they match up in these categories so we got our matrix in here no not that kind of matrix this kind of matrix and we will rank these different courses sl course providers in these different categories and if the category for that course is good we'll color the thing green if it is okay it's going to be yellow and if it's bad it's going to be red and the first one we'll be looking at is what you're watching right now is a free option uh called youtube so on youtube there are tons of different great and obviously not so great coding like course and tutorials and these kinds of things that you can watch uh but the first big downside of youtube is that it's not going to be very comprehensive or if it is you'll have to use a ton of time to find all the different pieces and this is actually a really big problem because like as a beginner like when i was a beginner i had no idea what i had to learn what to start with what i needed to learn next what were all the things i needed to know to land a job so youtube is i think a good platform to use to sort of plug in some holes or learn when you know a very specific thing you want to learn or to do some like very niche thing inside of perhaps one of your projects youtube is really great but it's not going to be very comprehensive and it's not very like feasible to use youtube as a full resource to learn the code so for comprehensiveness going to be red production value now this is going to depend so i'm just going to put yellow in here because if you're watching a really amazing youtuber like like me uh then the production quality is obviously going to be amazing practice um now again this is going to be highly dependant but youtube does have a lot of like very practical tutorials where you can just follow a tutorial and then practically build something but i'm also going to put yellow because it just really depends a lot teaching style again same thing is sort of going to depend and job hunts help i would actually put red because i haven't really found that much content on youtube like let me know down below if you have just like helping people build resumes linkedin like this channels to help you do this uh but again it's not going to be like very very comprehensive it's sort of like you need to find the right thing so if you're looking for a very specific thing on youtube you can find it so youtube like a great platform overall to learn specific things but as a full resource for me it never really worked that well the next one we'll go to is cs50 and these guys they have a lot of different courses they have the introductory computer science course they have the web development course they have the python course the ai course cs50 has a very very warm place in my heart for two reasons it was where i got my own excitement for programming and also it's where one of my earlier videos on this youtube channel took off because i actually made a review on their their computer science course as well as their web development course and those two videos were some of the videos that took my channel off in the beginning but generally i would say cs50 where it really excels is the production value and to the point where i literally when i'm getting inspiration for my own like premium uh course my paid program on like the production and how i want to teach programming like this is where i get my inspiration it is literally the highest quality programming course you will ever find out there and it's going to be the perfect place for you to start and they're completely free as well you can pay for there like some certificate but basically you also get a free certificate when you go through the program so absolutely no reason to pay for it still to this day probably my favorite courses i think everyone should do at least the computer science one it will just make you excited about programming uh it makes you literally want to nerd out learn about algorithms and freaking stuff like that so for teaching style and production value absolutely green if it could be more than green it would be practice also i would say green um but where it really falls short is in the comprehensiveness because zs50 what is designed to be is an introduction it's not designed to be the one path that like it gives you everything you need and things like this and especially for job hunting like that's not really what they're focused on which makes sense uh you you're not really going to get any of it out there so if you want to use these skills to get a job you'll need to either go through a very painful process to learn this through trial and error or go through a program that actually teaches this and we'll talk about that in a moment next what we will look at is uh the oin project now this is also something that i did in my journey of learning the cod online for free in 4 months uh which is the topic of my most popular youtube video is right there i didn't actually complete the entire one i completed like the first section of it i would say it's really good in terms of it is actually quite comprehensive it will teach you everything you need to know from zero to becoming a web developer uh but what i for short is sort of the opposite of cs50 i did not like the production value basically it does not have any production value at all because it's mostly a text based resource and that's also the reason why i wasn't really able to stick to it till the end because it was very very boring in the style it was it might be absolutely right for you but for me it really wasn't practice if has some of it um actually i would even say it might even be green because it has uh has a lot of projects in there so i do like it for that as well again teaching style nonexistent because there is no teaching it's just like articles uh job hunt help some of it at the end uh yeah we can say yellow we can say it gives there's like a small section at the end that teaches you about some of the basics about rums and like how to find companies to apply to so these are the free options so if you were to select a completely free path and you just don't have any money what i would do is just start with cs50 and then do the odin project just do the two of these things and at the end of it if you are able to go through the entire oding project which is a long process technically you'll have everything you need and at the end you'll just have to start applying you'll sort of have to figure out like how to apply for jobs like make your linkedin like sort of trial and error to figure out which resumes work like you won't really have any templates unless you can find them online and then plug in the holes with youtube so if there's anything specific you're looking for just search it up on youtube and look up a tutorial for it that is literally a free pa that you can do right now if you have zero money to your bank account and you want to learn the code you have absolutely no excuse you can just use these resources and learn the code now we'll move on to some like cheap options the first one is going to be corsera have a lot of love for corsera and we'll define that as less than $100 so corsera i feel like is a great platform again to learn like topics what i mean by topics is let's say you want to learn about especially computer science topics like you want to learn about the theory of programming languages you want to learn about computer architecture corera has some of the best courses for this purpose because and it makes sense because corera what it is is basically like online university level education so if you're looking to learn the types of things that you normally learn in university but you don't want to actually go to university or you don't want it so much that you're willing to pay like tuition and everything coera is the place to go one of my favorite computer science courses of all time is nand to tetes that's where i learned everything i know today about how computers work behind the scenes so what is ram how does a cpu work how is the entire computer architectured and actually this is something that is not the most important thing to learn but something that you should sort of like learn on the side at some point as a programmer because i feel like every now and then it really helps me to understand the underline details of how the computer that we are using the program actually works so these kind of courses are really good there is the learning to learn course which i think everyone should do and i'll list down a couple of other ones down below again if you want to learn a specific programming language there's going to be a specific programming language courses like c c++ and things like this if you look at this based on the framework comprehensiveness i would say not very uh well it could be comprehensive for if you want to learn a computer science again this is more of a computer science learning platform than a coding learning platform production value m it can be good but probably usually not it's more of like university lectur style if you like that then great i think just it's really boring often the teachers like basically like university professors like really old and just like very theoretical so i don't like the production value i don't like the teaching style either uh practice is often pretty good um but also they can be very theoretical so it sort of depends job hun help not really so okay so it looks pretty red it looks pretty bad for corera but it's because it's really meant for a different purpose it's meant to learn theoretical things like just learning things for the sake of like you just want to understand some specific topic around computers around some theoretical concepts um you might disagree about this but like that's what i'm giving to kera i would actually put okay i'll put production value to yellow so that we're not so looking so bad because this is not actually representative of how i feel about this next cheap category is going to be zero to mastery zero to masteries i think if you have some money to invest into yourself but not that much then zero master is probably the best bet because with one subscription you get access to like i think 40 plus courses and things like that i would say it's reasonably comprehensive uh production value wise i would say it's okay it's just like very simple like tutorial videos videos after videos things like this practice i think it's again okay all often it's just videos and there's like problems and things like this teaching style i think is really great i love the engaging style that's probably my favorite part about this platform um job hunt help again it it's okay some of the courses they include a lot of very useful tips on building rums and like things like this maybe not as comprehensive as i'd like but pretty good so overall a really great option if you don't have that much budget but you are willing to invest into something a bit more comprehensive and a bit more premium in terms of engaging style and things like this now if you're looking for a road map that is cheap so less than $100 because i think the subscription is like $30 with a couple of months maybe you'll go slightly above 100 but anyway in that range if you do zero to mastery web developer course zero to mastery react cost and zero to master dat struction algorithm ca so if you either flat broke or you just have a little bit of money these are going to be great options but the issue with a lot of these options is as you see most of them teach one part of programming really well but then you need to go and pick up another one and you need to like sort of stitch together this road map for yourself and you still need to figure out a lot of details at the end about how to actually turn these skills into an actual job because it would suck to spend like 6 months learning the code only for them at the end for you to have no idea how to actually like speak to recruiters how to get them to contact you and maybe you'll end up spending another 6 months just looking for a job so that is where these next more premium options really come in first is my baby my flagship program called python don't develop a boot camp so the way i made this is that the purpose of this one program is to take you completely from scratch to learning all the skills you need to in program you become a python developer and actually get a job as a junior developer but really it's more than a coding course like i didn't just want to make yet another coding course because what you get inside is a lot more than that first let's run through the core program in the first module we'll learn python programming fundamentals programming is really broken down to like five core fundamentals and if you do most of these fundamentals and you understand concept how they work what they mean why we use them you'll be so much more equipped to actually learn anything else around programming so this is why we spent a lot of time on this in the beginning and once you come out of this module you're ready to learn some of the more advanced topics but before that we also learn about some of the sort of mindsets and productivity hacks of programmers to like really master your learning process and make sure that during the process of learning the code you're like maximizing your chances of actually retaining the information that you're learning and then modle you'll see we move on to some of the more advanced topics like objectoriented programming after which we move on to web development where you learn everything about html css and javascript as well as d jango in the back end to like build literal full stack websites just inside of this one module everything you need for that after that we get into perhaps the most important part of your programming journey which is building projects so that you can take any project idea and build it into reality with a proven frame work and right now i'm also developing extra content inside of here where i literally walk you through multiple projects so you see exactly how i personally build projects and also most importantly what kinds of projects you need to be building to have the best chance of getting recruiters notice you and to see your resume as the kind of thing that wants them to give you a job and last but not least we learned the one thing that is missing from like all the other resources that i personally went through as a beginner which is actual job hunt health and this last module is really where a lot of the value of the price you're paying comes in i've personally worked for some pretty massive companies and if that doesn't convince you i've also personally helped people get hired i even did one-on-one coaching last year where i was charging thousands of dollars to teach this information just in this one module to my clients but now it's all inside of this one program so you don't have to pay thousands or even a th000 to get lifetime access to everything that is in there now as well as in the future and that is my promise to you lastly of course if you try it and you don't like it it within 14 days all you have to do is email me and with no questions asked i will give you all of your money back oh and one last thing just for those of you who watch this video i also have a little gift to add so you can use the code 40 courses for a sweet additional little discount at the checkout as well now this is still not enough and you want to not only have this full path in one place but also you want to have like one-onone mentoring as well as dedicated help at the end to actually get the job and to actually be part of a program that has direct connction to these employers and you're able to invest even more money there is also the course careers introduction to the software development program this one is even more premium prices i think it's like $800 and i'm affiliated with them so if you buy it i believe i get like 40 or 45% commission so basically you buy this one i get the same commission as the full price of my own program would be so i actually have no bias towards this one or the other one so which if you are willing to invest more money just choose whichever is the right for you the value that you get in this one that is more expensive and by the way this one is taught by tech with tim the youtuber with a million subscribers who's also my really good friend he's probably going to be moving out here to dubai with me which is going to be really exciting but the value you get in it is that they have direct connections to employees at the end it's literally purpose built to help every single person who signs up to get a job at the end for both of these now obviously i'm going to be biased for my own one and the reason i've developed the way that it is developed is specifically al so that it would be green in all of these categories and the same goes for c careers going to be green in comprehensive is great production value practice focused and obviously at these price points if these two were anything else i wouldn't really be recommending them anyway because at these price points you do expect to get like everything in one place and you do uh what you simply have to do is decide which one is better value for the price would you rather pay slightly less and not have these direct connections to employers at the end and be talk my me or would you rather pay slightly more to have these direct connections and this mentoring and all these other things around on top of just the pre-recorded videos and templates and other things like that so whichever one is more value to you i don't mind and also for these other ones like corsera 02 mastery i'm also affiliated with them so if you pick any other the paid options i i benefit regardless so like just pick whatever is the best for you that is the video i will leave all the links down below and with that i hope this was able to help you choose what is the right path for you and i'll see you in the next video
