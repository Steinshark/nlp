so today i have low level learning right here for sorry you're getting you're getting the shout out first because you're hanging out with a baby yeah i'm on daddy duty my wife ditched me sorry guys permanently we'll see what what'd you do she caught me code in c plus plus man i don't know what to tell you all right honestly an assembly guy at the altar and here we are okay i made a mistake you know you're breaking your vows okay yeah sorry you're supposed to live a chaste life of nothing but assembly and now look at you i thought it was based [ __ ] okay whatever it's not bass it's chased okay it's different um all right and then we also have with us dax commonly referred to as the dirk sir or andrew tate whatever one you want to go for we don't know yet um but uh so your thdrx which by the way i get wrong every single time no you got it wrong right there thdxr see i still can't even get it right okay so explain your name okay i just got i just wanted a random set of letters that i could get everywhere six letters have it everywhere so that's what i went with that is literally the coolest explanation ever i must say that that is fantastic no one will ever no one will ever be able to copy your name because nobody could literally spell your name it's honestly one of the best techniques i've ever seen in my lifetime it's kind of like rocks car 76 back when he was known as rockstar 76. all right hold on let me go in here i'm gonna put your guy's name thd xr there you go every time i read it i keep trying to like be like okay there's a meaning to this it's dax it's the dax it's the daxer it's everyone goes with the decks here which i guess works out yeah you didn't know that um let's say i tried to get it on only fans but it was already taken is this true oh yeah of course i got it registered everywhere never know what platform to move on to next so okay oh nice so someone else did the pretty much the exact same thing you kind of just make up a word and boom twitch staff did that too credite i did it i sort of accidentally did it as a kid i misspelled one of my favorite bad bad guys of all time turok 2 last leader primogen it doesn't have any but then unfortunately directly after that uh i think it's primo gen also became a uh furry and so i frequently get accused of being a furry at this current moment in my life i just for the record i am a fir i'm not a furry i am not a furry at all i don't know how this has happened okay i was here first i would just like to let you know the forage and no the person oh man [ __ ] i don't even know how this happened all right all right so all right good we got everyone introduced uh we got the about to go to the lawyers low-level learning and made up his name dax awesome so i guess what we're gonna do today is we're gonna do something a little bit fun so i made this last night in a fury so first off this is the ugly this is a back ends front end right here i would just like to let you know uh this is someone who doesn't make uis but oh i made it so that it would work well with chad do you not see how well this works with chad look at this i can go in here we can make chat a little bit bigger it just it is it's optimized for screen real estate okay wow yeah is that three percent though uh that is not three percent but are you ready for this are you ready for this i'm gonna press spacebar nano wow yeah yeah and watch this one hold on here we go here we go are you serious does this not work in firefox it might not work in firefox [music] i didn't try it in firefox why you gotta be like this why you gotta be like this i look at this i'm pressing the numbers just go just be who you need to be uh what a pain in actual ass uh here we go i wrote this code last night so let's see what happens here when i press this okay what key event did i get i got uh what are oh my goodness i hate the firefox i hate firefox so dang much key name what is what are you key name what are you key name is shift okay yes we know that it's shift we know that it's shift uh do we have the chrome editor on the list uh the chrome editor the chrome this this one right here the chrome debugger i can put it on there i mean i could i could do this all right so i'm gonna just close this down by the way that's t pope 2hpope and we're gonna open up chrome oh it's so bright there we go we're back in so i'm gonna press space i'm gonna press spacebar space bar and now we're going to press one of these letters oh my goodness are you effing kidding me i was just doing this did i not did i not move it over no i know i moved it over no are you serious serious i hate my life did you know that oh man nothing's happening i was just testing things damn it do i really have to you guys are live and i have to actually debunk this oh my goodness oh my goodness i i am so sorry just give me a second here why does this work on my other computer is this is this what is this it's the state of web dev man that's what it is it isn't key number deprecated or whatever oh is this one of those things again where it doesn't all right so there's this weird thing that happens i think i know what it is i think it's because i have a software remap going on that it struggles with with numbers uh oh and so we put the browser in a dock container no that's no no that's why am i why is it not showing up why am i so dumb can someone just tell me why i'm so dumb i cannot believe this is actually happening live on stream this was not supposed to be happening right now all right hold on we're just gonna go right here we're gonna refresh this and i'm gonna go spacebar clearly spacebar and then see it's only giving me shift and now it's giving me that oh what a piece of shift all right let's go back here why is it not giving me any numbers i have no idea we were trying to do you're pressing a number right now and it's not giving you do i have some sort of plugins vimeo or something yeah i was about to say do i have vimeon i have vimium on how much do you want to bet mother mother to this last week as well it is just the worst oh my goodness there it is oh my goodness this whole time it actually worked it was vimeo after you're done next there we go look at this okay and look at this boom boom boom boom boom do you see that put it anywhere we want put it anywhere we want boom put it anywhere we want look at that did i bake this am i a front-end developer you bet your sweet ass i am yeah oh my god that's your sweet theo get the [ __ ] out of here i'm working all right i did unfortunately though i will say that i did not make local cash so when i refresh this i actually completely erase it so i'm hoping this is gonna go off i'm hoping this is gonna go without a hitch yeah let's hope there's no uh no memory leak in this thing such that we crash chrome and then uh you know restart yeah that's so that's it's very possible all right let's go hell yeah brother okay sorry you guys ready to do this let's [ __ ] do it man all right i'm gonna put a little marker we're gonna start so this is how we're gonna do it uh this is how we're gonna do it i think this is a good way to do it which is we will take an editor and then we will try to see what we think about it and when we're done we'll probably let chat vote as well okay everyone fine with those rules that means chat you have a chance to try to determine what you think an editor is because you know here's the deal we may have one opinion about an editor you guys may have a different opinion and we kind of want to meet in the middle so that way when everybody looks at this editor list they think this is the worst editor list i've ever seen it meets nobody's needs because it is the average of everybody's and so that's kind of the goal here perfect it's a good one all right hold on one second there we go perfect all right democracy dies with editors all right so now that we have that done are you ready for the first one let's do it do it let's go all right first one of course is nano good new nano if you don't know anything about gnu nano it is an editor in which is more confusing to exit than vim there is several keystrokes one must successfully press in order to actually exit it really you know you think that it'd be that easy but every single time i try to follow it somehow i get confused because i've made a small amount of edits and then i have to try to save it but i don't want to save it i don't know how to exit and not save i do feel like though nano is one of those editors that's just always right where you need it you know what i mean like it's always there it's it's that friend that when your dog dies he's there for you and while that guy's kind of an [ __ ] you know he's there so i i don't think nano is who were dog water like chest insinuating but i agree that it is painful so i'm i'm lean and painful on this one just for me it's always there but that guy like he didn't pay the bill with the last time you guys went out for dinner so [ __ ] that guy but you know he's a nice guy painful i'm gonna say dog water because whenever i try whenever i use nano i just exit out and i install them no matter how temporary so i'm gonna say dog water i can't use it i try to use it just doesn't work for me first off i would just like to say low level uh your analogy was insane uh second off i would say i would agree though i would put it in the painful to dog water category because i literally will never use it yes just ever just at all for any reason like if i there is no there's nothing that i ever will do that doesn't i mean if there's vi i'd rather use vi yeah yeah exactly and self there's just no point all right chat right now one's in the chat if or type uh type what you want i'm just gonna first without doing a poll i'm just gonna see if there's an overwhelming one of these that just show up we're gonna go congress with a lot of painfuls but i mean i could be safe a lot of dog water a lot of dog water a lot of painful i went painful you went painful uh dax actually useful actually useful who wait what based there's no base editor okay wrong cure list it's a wrong tier list here all right so i think i think that we got a lot of dog waters and a lot of painful so we're gonna put their marking as somewhere between there let's go let's go with painful how do you think about that uh yeah start off gently all right painful oh i i'm so worried that i'm gonna get a little error in this program and we're gonna lose the whole thing oh i'm scared all right here we go next editor dreamweaver oh i gotta say i had a good time with dreamweaver back in the day i'm gonna say what the second was was dtc down to down to code yeah down the code you know i can see it i can do that i'm gonna put it all the way up there i'm gonna put all the way up at dtc really yeah i had a good time with dreamweaver yeah when did dreamweaver get canceled what did it do yeah what did it do on twitter it got drunk and it was tweeting some some you know erroneous [ __ ] no i thought didn't like then macromedia cancel dreamweaver like 10 years ago or am i just that out of the loop back room was it was adobe owned it at some point i think adobe bought it and put it into the grave pretty quickly so from that you probably should infer that i haven't used it in like 10 years although i think i did learn html in dreamweaver so it does yeah that special place in my heart so i i agree i will put it with down to code i know nothing about the quality of the editor but from just a pure nostalgia standpoint i'm team dtc all day etc's chat is who that's all they've been doing is all who um yeah because cat is 12 years old chad how does that feel 12 year old um i you know you know i i'm not gonna lie to you i think uh dreamweavers um i think it's a piece of [ __ ] i think you can go dog water level honestly um yeah yeah real time no this piece of [ __ ] and dreamweaver uh i didn't build this piece of [ __ ] in dreamweaver i built it neo vim okay that's why it's not very pretty all right it's got to be above nano though i mean come on i'm not gonna put this below nano that's just a great idea okay that's reasonable i i would agree this is not below nano okay nano can below dreamweaver if you know what i mean um chat what do you think right now chad give us a ranking because right now it's like it's sitting pretty firm i i would say that i would put it as if i have to also if you're born later than the 90s your opinion is invalid but continue it is a very 90s name we got a lot of dog waters a lot of some dtc's and some hoos and some painfuls a lot of dtc you know what since i i am uh the benevolent dictator right here you two both say down to code and i would say that due to chat's visceral reaction i think down to code is truly the place and the home for this this editor i like it let's go notepad oh notepad the original this is the windows 3.5 notepad so or windows 95 sorry no 95.95 be 14 years old at my house on a windows i think 2000 computer you bet your ass at the first line of c plus plus i ever wrote was a notepad actually useful 14 year old me all the way up to tippity top all right all right actually use no no no no no about that i used to mod age of empires and notepad that's that's all there you go okay okay so if i have to so what you're trying to say is that it was actually useful to you and you actually used it but you only because i was an idiot you know i could have installed something else but you didn't you chose not you didn't see a need to yeah that that piece of software is for idiots i i agree with that yeah uh i also used to mod games there's this game called slayer .net i think i think it literally was called slayer.net it was like uh it was like an early action it was like imagine diablo but way before diablo and uh you would run around and there's these levels that exist and what you could do is in the file it would actually just read it from your file system i would actually change what would be loaded at every place so i could walk on water where other people couldn't walk on water and it was kind of like i was a ba it was like i was a hacker but i wasn't a hacker yeah you know what i'm just realizing me and my buddy it did the same thing with nes roms back in the day we would literally open them a notepad and just change the text and obviously you had to make the changes you made the same length otherwise you'd mess up all the offsets of the rom but same thing we were making changes to the text in zelda roms back in the day too so i'm still team actually useful man that's where the og hacker in me came out was through notepad all right chat what do you think okay boomer get the [ __ ] out of here hey boomers are useful too zoomer we got a bunch of dog waters a who top dog actually lots of actually no way that it's above nano oh yeah oh 100 we got a lot of actually usefuls we actually got quite dramatically harder to type actually useful and there it is all right we're keeping it we're keeping it this is a beautiful one all right laplace lily i have no idea what this is yeah me either i've never really no idea who like i'm with chat right now i've literally never heard of this uh-oh yeah i don't know what happened but i pressed the wrong number and it put it all the way down here in the tiniest little thing so you know what this actually fits perfect the editor who is it i don't even know someone tweeted at me you should learn this editor when you say something like learn this editor you make me nervous because i'm like how much do i have to learn to type words and save them no it looks like it looks like vs code but like with a different color theme yeah that's a lot of these new editors they're all just vs code replicates replicas replica replicants replicates haven't you seen that like think about it zed fleet adam adam any of those on the list i didn't recognize any of those new ones how do you not know about fleet you get to send fleet picks all right let's just move on okay nobody cares about the blackie okay we don't even know how to say it all right nobody even knows how to say that word let alone how to use it what do you think about intellij dude i'm gonna put this in actually useful the hell that was java before intellij came out and the lj saved us back then first off you're missing something you don't don't you're dogging on netbeans with that okay netbeans made java pretty good i think i use netbeans for one day same i went to college and graduated college using exclusively netbeans well some of us didn't go to college prime how about that yeah who didn't go to college me really you didn't go to college no man i knew i was better than you i just like knew it from the from day one and it just is exposed now oh my god you are you found out couldn't hide it anyway i have i've never used intellij but the company that makes intellij i think also you makes the um the.net decompiler which is great for taking apart.net malware and it's awesome yeah exactly do you guys remember resharper do you use resharper back in the day yeah also but yeah fantastic brains made resharper yeah dude team of geniuses that was the only reason why visual studio was any good was three sharper it would rewrite like huge portions of your code and just made it better it was amazing oh my goodness um right now you know here's the deal i think that it's really oh my goodness i think it's really reasonable to say that intellij is down to code yep right like i'm not gonna it's not gonna be my first reach unless if it's java like if it's java i'm taking it i'm taking it out right away so it's actually hard is it does this mean it's actually useful or should we say which i mean which one is it is it actually useful here for me it's not that tools i'm talking about i'm talking about the idea of the tool like the suite the other tools that it that are associated with this for me it's ttc but that's just where i'm at okay i also don't code java or groovy in a long long time but when i did when i did a very special project at netflix called the great groovy upgrade with uh uh in the sky with diamonds i yes i named it after and a song to do lsd and uh it was a hell of a project but groovy or intellij is the only reason why i was able to do that project it saved us it saved us i'm personally i'm actually fine putting in the actually useful category oh yeah yeah let's do it hell yeah all right visual studio which by the way for those that don't know visual studio visual studio's logo is just the complete visual studio codes logo did you ever notice that i did not notice that wow today i learned yeah they also represent an infinity sign for how long it takes to load yeah uh concur so here are my here's my opinions on ide's as a whole i hate ides full stop visual studio i find very problematic because i've written a lot of c code in my day that's the name of my channel um visual studio makes it impossible to figure out where the hell the compiler is actually getting invoked and on top of that it costs like gigs of ram to do anything so for me this is an if i have to like it it allows me to do code in windows but i'll avoid it if i can figure out where the compiler chain is so for me i'm an if i have to on this one this one's tricky for me i uh i i did a lot of stuff in visual studio bought a c-sharp back in the day was it visual studio or was it visual studio express i started with the express and then moved on to the big leagues very soon after so i don't know i think i'm down to code i think especially back then like everything sucked and it was kind of good i'll keep putting down a code but what about today today we can't just run off see the thing is with dreamweaver you can kind of run off nostalgia yeah yeah that's true but this thing's not nostalgia it's actively used today unironically yeah that's true i'm probably never going to use it again ever in my life i would personally put it somewhere in this category ooh okay but again using nano as a as a landmark are we putting it below nano it's a lot better than nano yeah really yeah i think it's if i have the same or better because the me provides value i don't like to use it but again if i've got to use it i'm going to use it it's for me it's the only way to do coding on windows without like making my own compiler chain which is a pain in the ass okay so i guess fair point which is if i had to do something with c plus plus and windows would i use visual studio slash videos studio express if they still make express i think express was the free one and that's what i did to all my windows projects in chat disagrees with us so chat chat's looking at painful or dog water all right chat type in your type in your idea what do you think type in your ideas here you know what videos i don't think chat knows what video studio is i think they're confusing it with vs code yeah yeah they are different by the way just make sure wrong at the same thing there's like three iterations of visual studio on this list there is yeah all right so we got lots lots of dog waters and then a huge spam of useful which i'm just gonna assume is bisco all right so ever they they all have a chat has it all down here yeah all right let's call it middle then let's call it painful i'm i'm in for the painful round because that's how i feel about it there's a t in there but i didn't want to have to go through and rename it that logo scares me and i don't know another jet brands product though it is another jetbrains product hmm okay well i've noticed a bug in my program if i start too low it actually completely disappears completely so much like fleet in which nobody has any idea where it is i've also discovered that i don't know where it went and so we're just going to move on and sort of rightfully in who perfect i like it yep it's rightfully and who with the other one that i also forgot all right what about zed i don't know what this is either is this even real i'm not gonna lie how do you not know that okay so zen let me give you let me give you a little introduction into who's that is it is new it's very very new it only works on mac last time i checked oh and it's written by the team that brought us everybody's favorite editor adam yeah so how'd that work out for them oh wait is this a tree sitter guy yeah a tree sitter guy so we are we are at minimally saying at least the tree sitter guy is making something which we i still use these products to this day that's good i don't know anything about this though wait pretty sure his dad is dead wait zed already died wait no no i think that was that is dead that's from uh what's it called oh pulp fiction um right all right i'm gonna throw this out here i'm gonna go with i'm gonna go with who i'm gonna go through also yeah who again oh you already know about it yeah yeah yeah well the person who wrote tree sitter uh tree sorry and uh the person who is writing zed came onto the neovim uh conference talks and gave a talk about what is that i think someone from zed replied to your tweet too and asked you to evaluate zed on this list also again so i i look at i look at zed online and it says code at the speed of thought i'm like okay cringe next and you read the next line and it's like made by the creators of adam which if you look at the wikipedia article for it says it was an editor so you know how how'd that work out for you guys so for me it's a who okay i just don't know what it is does anyone does anyone use uh does anyone use zed and chat type one chat if you use zed or your [ __ ] one of the two we all know we all know how this works right you say type one in the chat and there's like 500 ones [music] benchmarks on their site oh wait but it's just comparing to vs code and sublime yes yeah so i'm gonna okay i'm gonna keep zed as a who in some sense i feel like a who is better than dog water that's true because i just don't know anything about them and i'm probably not going to invest any time because it it feels like yet another vs code clone in which is written in some native language so it's faster i believe it's written in rust if i'm not mistaken yeah i think you're right and so it's like do i want yet another vs code clone no i want something different like my general take on these things is that stop making vs code clones start making i'd rather see intellij clones than uh than vs code clones personal opinion here all right i agree this is for you dax i can't even read that what's that page oh front page dude this is actually useful you think front page is actually useful all right i'm gonna paint you a picture all right paint it nine-year-old decks yeah at barnes and noble picks up a book microsoft front page for beginners no is this why you didn't go to college that's all i needed i just needed a front page book and it carried me to where i am to this day and front page got me there so i made i made a website about eagles which was my favorite animal at the time so is my favorite animal bald eagle great animal great country um so yeah front page actually useful my whole career is built on it in a way glowing recommendation the front page has made it all the way to the tippity top bald eagles shotguns everything flying out of there by the way that is a pretty badass first website would you make your first website of eagles specifically bald eagles the cursor would turn into an eagle when he went to that [ __ ] awesome wow i don't i honestly don't know if i can i i so so my only story about front end or front page was that my mom way back in the day was trying to make a website and it was called uh because she was really into trying to do charity stuff and she called in blessings exchangenetwork.com so i just want you to take a second maybe write it out think about it for for a little bit and so blessings exchangenetwork.com quickly became very confusing and uh yep yep uh and so this was early in the 90s and it was very very funny and uh she tried to use the front page to build it and so it's like classic mom moment just just getting in there fully confused about the entire situation loved it oh was that a baby yeah sorry my son is uh being my child so for me front page again i'm gonna tell a story here a bit of a roller coaster from where i start where i end right so for me starting the story actually useful be me similar nine years old and i wanted to learn html i had no idea how the internet worked at all so i wrote my first website and it wasn't as cool as dax as it had and maybe had a couple lines of you know words on it and i didn't know how to publish the website so i changed the html tag to have equals ed.com on it because my name is ed and then i go to ed.com be me and it says website under construction just so happens that it worked out like that so i thought i wrote and published my first website in front page so actually from the nostalgia factor but take it down to me painful or dog water microsoft product end of story wow that was a roll i i mean i feel a roller coaster right there i feel roller coaster because we got on one side we have dax who starts his career and skips the most pivotal moment in anyone's life going to college because of front end because of front page my mom making charity sites maybe missing the mark on what she was trying to do and lola you you even said you got started like i mean do you think that if you would not have seen that under construction if you would have went through all that and got nothing do you think you would have quit or do you feel like it actually was the reason that propelled you into the future it propelled me for sure um i would have kept going but that was definitely a motivator like wow i just published a website even though that works at all but i can't say that i give front page to credit like front page was the editor that i did that in but i then continued my career in dreamweaver actually hence why i gave her the code that i did um and so you know i don't see a lot of microsoft web editors nowadays and there's probably a good reason for that so for me i'm still i'm still looking at dog water you know i think i'm going to join you in dog water sorry dax your eagle story did not sell me [ __ ] your opinion i tried i tried and of course we all know chat they're too young to even know what what front page is like they actually have no idea is that a baby inside glasses guy yeah my wife left me so here i am with the kid anyway yeah literally chad thinks front page is some sort of extension to vs code they have they have absolutely no clue wow all right so i get bothered about this editor about once every month no it's not cocoon oh though i might start calling it cockown i think it's i think it's pronounced quan cool it's like how ubuntu is ubuntu no it's [ __ ] not yeah no one calls it ubuntu ubuntu no no no anyways cocoon um this editor is like its own version it's it's so helix is effectively birthed from kekwon and kekwon what they tried to do is they said well vim motions aren't as good because you should invert everything so everything you do is like a visual selection and so instead of being i forget how they describe vim it's like noun then verb instead do verb then noun or something like that i never really understood its selling point but it's it's a bespoke editor with a bespoke set of uh keys to do stuff and i tried to get i got semi-okay at the motions i kind of got most emotions down and i could tell you that most the time it was identical to vim the times that were important it was significantly harder than vim and the times that it beat vim were in things i didn't care about it's a who for me but based off what you describe it sounds like dog water i'll agree and i was gonna say who but then i saw that there was a clippy clone written in ascii art as a function of the browser of the editor that's awesome i'm team dog water as well blippi clone really brought you out yeah i was like they don't give a [ __ ] like they're just trying to be a vin but then i saw clippy and i'm like oh okay yeah right even better they're adding a little bit of spice in there so there you go i'm all about it okay well let me let me let me toss something at you guys what about for pure pursuits of learning a new way to do things do you think that you could find yourself maybe down to coding it it sounds like from we described there's reverse so you like select then you do the action something like that the general concept something like that yes that that doesn't feel life-changing to me you know is that going to change my life i don't know prime isn't well aware my vim motion foo is uh non-existent so i would probably not gain much from this but again it's an it's an attractive looking editor for me because it's console based and it's it's got the fun color scheme like you know you can do like it looks like you're coding in the early 2000s for me like before all the themes and stuff existed so i'll give it not a dtc i'll give it if i have to okay i'm going to ignore it and keep it in dog water because why learn an entirely separate set of motions to be useful nowhere except for in helix and kekwon so personally i'm on the i'm on the uh the dog water train as well sorry that's that chat don't care about your opinion moving on all right everybody to reflect on what we have like right now we've got notepad in intelligent is it two best editors yeah and then dreamweeter then dream dream weiner you know we got that one looking really good all right i guess all right what about eclipse [ __ ] eclipse sorry i i just no dog water it's so slow so terrible super hard to install just not good really bad memories with eclipse i ever had a good experience using eclipse like it needs like i mean i understand this tier list it's supposed to be like each tier needs to go down but i feel like eclipse perfectly fits in the painful category because when i use it it truly is just painful yeah i'm noticing a trend here where all of the ones all of the editors that i came in here meaning to [ __ ] on the visual studio uh dreamweaver and eclipse are also ones that hold a huge nostalgia factor for me so for me eclipse represents the time when i was trying to get into back end web dev where i was learning ruby on rails and you bet your ass i learned ruby on rails in eclipse you can do if this was just for java you can do it i'm pretty sure i used eclipse maybe it was netbeans no it was netbeans disregard that means it's green okay yeah so never mind [ __ ] this eclipse is painful all right should we put it in painful or dog water that's the real question which one is more of an insult because i didn't actually make a special category just for eclipse though i should have called eclipse where we put eclipse in it and given the fact that my uh that this is an entirely bespoke solution that i made up and is trash i cannot refresh this page so i cannot move it any further but what do you think should we go dog water or painful chat which one the most occurrence of dog water or painful wins i feel like dog water is definitely beating out painful there that's a lot that's a lot of dog water all right louie should take a moment to reflect on this and now i've intentionally chosen the worst editors to kind of start us off because i don't feel like there's a lot of great conversation around a lot of these editors right fleet nice try intellij trying to dupe me into vs code i know what you're doing kekwon yeah right right like there's just so many that i feel aren't very exciting uh what are you doing we're good don't worry about it we're good i know what you lowered yourself he wants to get away from me i move my camera down yeah that's too close to me i'm not no thank you there you go i helped you out there you go how's that is that better all right breastfeeding uh yeah i'm breastfeeding right now sorry guys i don't want to put it on the stream very very appropriate uh so i don't know like so far it is also really shocking about how many of these we've all used for significant moments in our life i bet you there's there's one that's not on here that's my significant moment which i think is actually coming up but you know it's pretty impressive personally i never really used much uh visual studio i used it for a little bit but it represents a horrible time in my life nano i still can't figure out how to access dreamweaver i guess i was just not there i used notepad instead all right so i just never had some of these experiences i don't know did you do web dev stuff running web stuff do you not see what we're using right now that's why i'm asking is this your first time no you know if you go to netflix.com and you see that gigantic very first experience that takes up the whole screen i wrote that okay the rectangle nice it's a big ass rectangle it is yeah i did that i did that i also made it let's go yeah i also made a nice little like little thingle yeah yeah i mean i've made a lot of little things okay okay i've programmed pretty things before okay all right so i'm gonna put out i i'm not doing vi i'm just gonna do vim okay i understand that some people if you're on a busy box you know like i okay i don't care about all that all right i don't wanna i don't want to get into this argument about it uh but vim og vim bram successor to stevie which is the successor to buy what do you feel about vim and so we are treating them and neither them a separate bowser yes or sorry separate editors yes yes them and neovim are separate beasts got it if i have to for me because it's gonna be the thing i install if i'm shing to the server and i need to do stuff if i have to we'll use vim uh but you know i'm never actually gonna reach for it otherwise really i don't mind it though i don't mind it when i'm in there it's familiar feels right but yeah i would i'm in the same train of thought i i think it's i'm down to code for me because like i do lean for a while i was leaning them but like i didn't use them the way you're supposed to and now that i've discovered the whole world of neovan any of them extensions like vim has gone like vim used to be actually useful for me but now it's been like almost downgraded a category and like all code and vim but i'm gonna i'm gonna choose somebody else so like it's up there but it's not the top so for me i'm down to code yeah i mean it used to be my daily daily editor for a while when i had it all set up but yeah and as of now i don't know why i would ever use it so so my my argument probably falls closer to yours which is if i'm on a server if i'm on somewhere else i'm going to use vim because it's usually almost always available by if that's just all there is then damn that's fine that's what i'm just going to use which to me doesn't really bother me so i i put it strongly in uh in the if i have to category because here's the deal i used to be a big vim specifically vim fanboy it's useful right it's useful but for the last two and a half years bram has been inventing his own language and has not made a singular thing about them much better at all whereas neovim has just massively just moved forward they're doing everything the community wants to do love what neovim's doing love the message of neovim uh but but vim itself has just like fallen by the wayside it is clear that it's just bram's project and so i just don't i'm just not loving it you know what i mean i'm not loving it i will use it when i have to i'm not one of those people that installs like neil vim on a production server no way but i'll use it yeah i agree i think like vim if i have to if i'm going a message aging somewhere it's going to be there but yeah i agree i'm not going to freaking pull in any of them and my scripts and plugins onto a uh production server so i'm teamwork i have to yeah cool i'm fine with that if i if i have to yeah uh but i also but here's the deal this is what gets me conflicted which is if i didn't have nailed him i would choose vim yeah same so it's like is it if i have to or is it more than if i have to i know i said because none of them exists you know it exists so today vim's still in the game so today if you're looking at it like that it's an if i have to yeah that's kind of where i'm at all right chat what do you think type it in chat what what tier should we go in i'm getting the vibe that we're gonna get a chat upgrade to dtc here but we'll see what they say yeah well the thing is is now all the people that hate them are going to be going hard in the uh in the painful category we have a lot of if i have to we actually have a shockingly large shockingly large if i have to slash down to code actually useful yeah see okay so okay so i gotta throw this out but if you're on a server or you have to say pair program with somebody and you're using a server as your little go-to in between a little tmux action uh like i don't know vim is actually useful when you need it because here's your choice when you're on a server you got nano gnu nano or you got vim like what are you gonna choose you know what you're choosing every single time it better be then yeah okay it has x x is good i use it all the time it has global marks i use global marks like wild when i'm on a server because i don't have i don't have harpoon but it feels like we're choosing this in place with something else we're choosing this because we have to we can't use what we want to use so i think for me i think we're still leaning if i have to okay if i have to i'm on team if i have to you've convinced me all right chat is saying we got to do a poll by the way i don't know if you saw that quick little flash by the screen but that is sir timothy pope the pope of them if you didn't know all right all right chad i'll listen to you let's do a little let's do a little pull here let's do a little pull uh vim uh actually uh ddc uh if i have to painful dog water we can't do a who everybody knows it's not a who you know this editor all right make your voice be heard right here right now look at that i see we have a strong if i have to i knew it we were right this whole time we knew it because here's the deal pretty much everyone that uses just vim they like neovim they know they do they're dirty rotten liars they knew they always liked neovim trying to pretend like oh you know i'm definitely november now you're not you like nail them don't lie to me neil vanico's dog [ __ ] and then equals god tier you don't even know what to say take it easy you don't even know what you're seeing in my life yeah people that say that just don't know all right i intentionally threw this one in here because i know we already have intellij but pie charm specifically for python it just held the very special places i always try to avoid python so i have no idea what this is awesome i love that answer it actually just disappeared on me so uh it's completely gone so we're just gonna move on so that's great yep okay awesome i'm glad that that happened because it's happening to did i program that in we don't even know how about this one though ed um it's like it's so hard to have any emotions around this one yeah it's like it's like nano for me in the sense that it's always there but other than that it's literally impossible to use so it's not who because everyone knows who it is it's ed it's like it's the editor but no one uses it because it's ed so dog water for me yeah okay i i i think i can i think i can agree with this ed is dog water because we've moved on since the days that ed was useful oh oh notepad plus plus this is a good one yeah it's a hard one what do you do here [music] man this was so killer back in the day yeah so many good features first thing i did when i got a windows install install this set it to be the defaults on all my files yep i think i don't think okay so i've used tons of notepad plus plus i don't think i've actually ever written code in notepad before it's been like everything but code like things i have to do features need to implement like this is like like the jira of the early 2000s for me like i would just make notes in in notepad i would like edit configuration files like just any random file i needed to open yeah i think it's actually useful i don't even know what does it exist anymore like is it still yeah so so i every time when i was a kid and i'd use this i remember trying to program in it and i hated programming in it it was awful because i was like netbeans all the way at that point netbeans all the way i'm over here trying to do php without netbeans in notepad plus plus and it was awful didn't have all that sweet auto complete all that good stuff that netbeans had personally i i think that minimally notepad plus plus is painful i think that all you remember is that you had a shitty experience windows and you used a less shitty editor no password yeah it's not for coding i never use it for coding yeah i agree i'm careful with that everyone everyone is saying that it's it's useful everyone is going useful is it i think there's one guy saying it over and over no they're just they're being edgy dude like the edge lords they're they're just edwarding like like oh no like the obvious editor that isn't great no which the mesh like no it's not show me a screenshot right now of your operating system with no pub plus plus installed guaranteed zero people have it installed right now i think casey how do you say his last name uh performance man he he uses a notepad plus plus often in his uh videos even i don't have it installed i thought i did i don't so yeah i don't have it either i like i'm perfectly fine leaving it in painful because it is one of those editors that everyone thinks is good but if you actually had to use it you would hate your life but we have notepad above notepad plus plus absolutely because notepad was there like windows 95 when you had to open up some config file and you're just like what is going on here that's what you got you got notepad okay as your first view into the computer yeah when i was three years old that's what i was doing exactly notepad's been there for us the entire time the guardian angel editor yeah that's right was it in windows 3-1 i used to do free ski in windows 3-1 i used to be uh five years old log in go into dos hit hit win load up windows play little mahjong tiles maybe a little free ski you know well you know you know let's go around any other uh ms-dos busy town enjoyers no oh i remember busy town there's no dangerous dave i think it was called games yeah see i'm gonna keep i mean personally i think notepad plus plus needs to stay pretty low i think that if we're being realistic here there's nothing good about notepad plus plus it has the illusions of being something good but in all reality it's horrible okay i don't want to do a poll because you guys are all a bunch of degenerates and every single time i do a poll like this you guys are gonna everyone's gonna select actually well we'll see if the edge lords get outnumbered by like the realistic 25 year olds in the chat but we'll see uh let's go like this this would be i wouldn't use it is that not what it is depends on the amount of force yeah how much force we talking about how much how much ma are we talking about dak probably don't get that joke you didn't go to college you know that's like a college only joke oh my god you're gonna regret this i didn't get a real college that's fine i went to montana state university okay i'm surprised prime went to college to be honest okay first off i failed out of college twice uh my first time i did too much lsd the second time i did too much lsd and so my third time though my second time i did so much lsd to this day i still have visual artifacts dude i had that same thing it eventually went away for me but man not not the best every now and then i'll just walk by something and i'll be like what the [ __ ] i'll just get all like shocked oh man look at an empty wall for too long all kinds of [ __ ] starts happening yeah a little little dance party waves go on anything that i look at yeah if they say actually they're just posers i know that's the thing is if people say actually i see it see painful okay so look at this painful and i would use it if i was born yeah oh you can't see the results well they're they're exactly what we thought yeah you can see it's heavily weighted towards the bottom yeah nothing but trolls live up there look at that nothing but [ __ ] up there okay there we go i did a lot of coding in notepad plus plus well bless your soul shirai all right here we go people visual studio express oh this this is what made me a programmer i want you to know that this is what made me a programmer i used visual studio express c sharp and c plus plus back when i was doing programming for games x and a baby let's go i'm so happy you know about xna this is so good xna is like really where i got my pursuit do you remember the blue default background for the xna games i still remember that sir you do not just call it blue okay it is corn flower blue cornflower that is the name of the default background of all like that's the hello world of game programming it's either the triangle or the cornflower blue i remember i got the book on xna programming that was made for visual studio express and there was actually an errata in the book that like had it fixed a bunch of syntax errors i didn't know how to debug for [ __ ] so i got to like chapter four of that book and just like stopped game dev because i couldn't figure out how to make the code compile i was so mad pretty much why most people's stuff came down yeah oh man uh yeah so i think going off the nostalgia factor and like so i my first career aspiration was to be a game dev and the game started in visual c plus plus an invisible uh c sharp rather so for me i'm a dtc you're actually useful for this one but i don't wanna i don't want all of the frameworks we choose that are top tier to be only nostalgia and like we are kind of leaning that way so maybe maybe because of that i'm dtc i was gonna say i also think this came out at a time where stuff wasn't super free and they had like this editor was free all the guides and all around it was super was free and that was novel at the time so yeah i would say actually useful now like i think it brought a lot of people into the programming world so that is i mean that's true it was free so there's only a few free ones you had eclipse which i mean come on uh you had net me you should pay you uh and we had visual studio express there was also bloodshed did you guys use bloodshed what the hell no no okay well there was there was that it sucked but yeah sounds like it sucks yeah okay so i personally feel like i the problem is is nostalgia i put it actually useful but reality it was probably pretty painful i just didn't know but i would put it if i have to back then it was what i had to you know yeah yeah and sticking to my guns of the i don't like ides thing that i said before i would say painful if i have to okay can we all agree if i have to then okay i'm not a boomer i'm a millennial okay that's only one generation that's your generation probably you're an elder millennial i'm an elder millennial um it feels good feels good being an elder millennial it is bloodshed let's go i'm not crazy okay perfect okay i could put it in the painful category it does represent a time in life the thing is i feel like it has to be better than visual studio yes because it was free yeah it was free and it was lighter weight which just made it easier to use almost always and xname let's go let's go best editor let's go let's go i think you're the only ones this excited i use this for like a week maybe this is what i think this is what i think right here actually useful i became this is okay look at this i'm gonna jump over here i'm gonna jump over to here i'm gonna go to twitter.com i'm gonna look up one of my favorite people in the universe classically named uh jj prem the micro king uh right here me and this guy right here look at that this is when i was a web designer this is my actual web designs on ie8 i wrote that way back in the day yeah pretty good guess what i used effing netbeans baby that's php javascript jquery netbeans html3 or something [ __ ] okay i don't even know okay okay hey you guys are all laughing there was no such thing as border radius you had to make your own curves that's the thing what do you mean oh yeah border radius like pre the mozilla kits and pre like modern css like doing anything like this where you had multiple center divs with border radius with drop shadow was literally impossible i literally sent her text right there without flexbox floats in there i know that oh we floated oh we floated hard clear fix every single line every effing single line was a clear fix ables i remember the clear fix oh damn yeah you had to clear flicks here you had to clear fix your float oh my goodness clear fixes to make it real yeah i remember that yeah yeah people just don't know people just don't know they come out here okay so obviously well i mean personally i'd put it up here just because of just like such a strong nostalgia factor but the fact that they still actually exist and are still being used makes me think that they're dog water yeah it's still used yes they're still developing netbeans so i i strongly give them like since i can't even go by nostalgia at this point they're still trying to be used get the hell out i always thought netbeans was java related was it not java related yeah you could use php you could use java you could use ruby i definitely learned yeah but the beans isn't like java related somehow it probably started as a java development framework and then they like learned how to incorporate different compilers and runtimes because i think i did java in there if i remember yeah people are getting various going with my ides are trash and it's old and horrible i'm team dog water all the way okay i i would like the record to be stated though that i am personally in in a lot of pain placing netbeans you know what actually honestly honestly i can't do it i i think netbeans is down not down to code netbeans right now yeah over there you got to use it for a month how about that on stream yeah all right well i guess you're using dreamweaver on stream then for a month there dax you got it oh my god can i even install it oh you're gonna have to figure out how to get it to run so you're gonna spend one month running it gotta go to totally legit cracked software dot roo and go download it real quick and then you'll be all set down for that i'm down for that challenge oh you know what yeah you're right relative i got dream we were up there for the same reasons as you and that being so this is and i'm not okay putting netbeans below nano because that's just like that's degrading to an entire generation of people so i'm fine with the being higher i disagree that it's down to code i think it should be if i have to but i i understand primes nostalgia factor so i'm i'm spoke so passionately about it you know they did yeah the fond memories of learning to code and his web projects that in today's that back then were impossible like i get it i'm all about it i even wrote or i even read the book detail and die tell java and i don't know if you know about dietel and dytel but their way they taught you recursion was doing the tower of hanoi yes switch to this door to this doi to this day i still have no idea how it works like i i would consider myself very good at recursion and that is the most confusing way to teach anyone ever how to do recursion ah you want to learn about recursion let's talk about the tower of hanoi and you're like what the [ __ ] is going on here yeah it yeah i was gonna capture the flag event one time and you had to essentially do tower of hanoi on a plc and uh it it was being done recursively and it was it was insane my wife is calling me excuse me for two seconds i'm sorry yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah while he's gone we're doing it while he's gone we're doing it ooh sublime i think i'm down to code i'm down i used to blame for a good amount down to code really he's fine you think it's down to code i don't know like compared to other stuff in the category like visual studio code sublime like i don't know down the code i'm fine with it i think one problem about sublime is that it's simultaneously takes up the position of down to code and who at the exact same time it's like what is that i guess it's fine yeah i mean that the fact that i still to this day have like some weird like adrenal reaction to pop-ups almost purely due to sublime every single time every single time you start your work dismiss yeah i say let you dismiss it you know they did let you dismiss it but they they made you feel bad for doing it it's like winrar like would you like to pay for winrar like no i'm all right thanks though appreciate it there was someone in my chat literally named i paid for win winrar no way it was it was a great name it was a great name no one has ever purchased winrar in the history of the universe facts um man i don't know so sublime where do you think we should play sublime because this is honestly a one i don't even know how to rank because i would most certainly use it above everything below this list yes i agree but i would most certainly take it and throw it into the garbage as quickly as possible it is one of the most confusing editors of all time but i will say okay so so i'm gonna give it i'm gonna give it a plus one here sublime is the only editor i know of that can open a file with a long line yes it's the only file it's the only editor there is no other editor yeah i would say that sublime has the pluses of being a gui editor but of it but it's lightweight as compared to vs code right like vs code weighs like gigabytes of ram sublime does not feel that way so if you're looking for an alternative to vs code slime is up there but i would adjust in if i had to choose between sublime or neovim i'm going to use neovim yep so i think definitely above all the rest that are there i think for me it's down to code for sure it's not actually useful me five years ago i would have said actually useful but but i'm past over that part of my life now okay um dtc for me all right i agree let's let's let chat do a little quick uh you know a little pull here let's see what they think about sublime right so i'm just gonna go a b oh gosh actually uh dtc forced uh painful and then dog water all right there we go while you do that i gotta pee so bad oh my goodness hey chad how are we doing how's it going my stream now we can't see uh pole can we uh no not yet chat just so you know someone someone before we started here was talking about stack overflow in the ladies let me talk to you a lot of you here are youngins okay when you stack overflow the ladies but let's say you don't use a stack canary to protect yourself for example okay this is what happens just be aware of that be aware of that okay you can't escape it i'm with this guy forever now so be aware all right how we doing okay boomer get the [ __ ] out of here i would love to see the results a little overflow the little baby overflow yeah dude that's what happens man noted yes someone's saying llc i love your videos i don't know if that's pointed towards me i am not alone i am not a limited liability company so you literally compiled with the f no stack protector active that's true should i fork my child's don't don't be doing that nope uh let's see what else hey prime you can't hear me let's get those results hey you ready for this you ready to see what happened here forced force and down the code okay really uh yeah forced painful dog forced painful dog you know that's a phrase i've found myself saying pretty regularly these days jesus all right we're keeping that down the code you know i think the people have spoken uh sublime is the editor you love to hate i swear again it's just like python it exists in both the the best category and the worst category at the exact same time oh my god oh yeah painful i think this one gives me like like you're saying before adrenal reactions yeah um i wanted to be a game dev and then eventually i wanted to be like an apple developer and i was trying to figure out how to write apple applications what you're an apple fanboy uh dude i'm still an apple fanboy you know that's part of the game but the fact that you have to pay to get a developer license the fact they have to use exclude exclusively the fact that you can't use apple like compile chains to make apps it's i hate it i'm i'm dog water it's not who people know yeah what it is but i just i can't stand just the idea of xcode makes me want to throw up i'm in full support of that full support all right dax what do you gotta say because i got a story no same thing i mean for me it was like step one of using xcode was first install a hackintosh on my pc i'm just like the nightmare from there i uh i i wrote this a very well-known program called falcor in which i have regretted and said sorry many times okay this was trpc before there's trpc or really typescript and uh during that i had to port it to objective c and that is how we've done i i bet you probably it might actually still be true to this day that it's still running on on uh your application on your iphone if you open up netflix that might be still how it's getting data and i wrote falcor an objective c with threads using xcode as a vim fanboy so i want you to just to just sit on that for a little while yeah that sounds like it hurts it was the worst experience i've ever had but at the exact same time i refuse to be bullied by any language or editor and i did it so good wrote you to test i i crushed it it was amazing i built an amazing piece of software and i will always and forever say xcode was the single worst experience i've ever had in my lifetime wow yeah i cannot put it in the who category because who demands more respect than what it is it is true dog water wow yeah i mean i'm i think we're all on the same page here it's not a fun experience pay to win and it's just it's it's a language that if it wasn't apple i would say that it's who but it's apple so we'll call it dog water yeah i can't believe there are so many people that use this every single day yep for all the work they do we gotta pour one out incredible for those that use xcode i'm gonna make that meme when we're done by the way it's gonna be great crash dab don't steal it can you believe my ui skills okay can we just take a moment and appreciate what i've built it's worked ninety percent of the time so far uh emacs this is a who for me what i mean i know what it is it's just i have literally have never opened it never tried it it was always a one weird guy at work that was using it and i just yeah okay whoa whoa okay i i know the weird guy i know who you're talking about we have one as well um but let's be real here when that weird guy opened his editor he flew like hussein bolt and you sat there and you thought why am i not as good of a developer as this guy why am i not as good as this guy with some holland based name why is he so good i don't know you are i already know trust me i know it's everybody from amsterdam uses uh estonia yeah it's just it's wild how good i have never met someone that i've personally never met someone that used emacs that i'm not just impressed with yes i agree so every mentor that i've had in my life every greybeard hacker or programmer that i've met has been an emacs fan and an emacs pro and when i watch them do anything i'm like holy [ __ ] you are a god but then i go into emacs and i kind of want to die so for me it's painful because in my head i equate emacs and nano they are the same alternative to them in my head they're equally as painful and they provide as little use as each other that i don't know i don't know where to put this at all i've never in my life had the urge to install and open up emacs like just never really never lisped no and neither have i never really configured my internet i actually used a do max for quite some time and space max i've probably used emacs as a full-time editor for a year and a half really holy [ __ ] wow yeah i think i might have tried space max now that you bring it up yeah that's to this day when i want to open up a file that's not a part of a git uh repo i do a leader pf that's straight from uh space max or do max project file yeah so if you've used it then i feel like your opinion carries more weight here like do you oh no it got shrunk it did the problem look at it look how small it is no like list [laughter] [music] um yes that sucks uh so where are we gonna put emacs gosh i'm being painful like in my head nano and emacs are the same really find it oh my goodness my mouse is lagging that was weird ooh okay why is max height not doing it why is it not doing it that should be that should be the that's the hack max width that's definitely not gonna do it really what is going on here how about min height top tier html programming or gameplay right here yeah i know mid height uh how about like how about 100 pixels okay that's that's not what i want to see that's uh that's not what i want to see oh gosh is it because the image is too big that's what she said um wow uh i don't um the image is too big oh my goodness and it just doesn't seem to shrink itself well like huh well that's strange okay well just like emacs can't even use it anyways i am putting it i am personally i mean i i think that this should be somewhere in the d2c here i'm gonna pull twitch as well because this is shocking how much you guys are speaking negative about emacs i'm not speaking negative i'm just like not emex was invented in the 70s okay and not only was it invented in the 70s it was such a good piece of software that bill joy inventor of vi said what he made was a mistake wow i was not aware of that that's a that's a twister he went on why am i hearing myself from you guys he went on with ox fanboy 1985 okay 1985. maybe i was wrong it was in the 70s it was the 80s emacs was definitely the 70s though i mean uh vai was the 70s it was right it was right after tcp if i'm not mistaken i believe tcp was 1974 and emacs or if i was 76. bill joy all right uh actually okay who is making that noise think it's you dex oh this is an echo yeah your game's a little high yeah uh d to c uh if i have to uh what is it if i have to and then uh painful or dog water bill joy also made java he's full of wait no bill joy did not make java hold on that now now this is bill joy all right what do we think here because i personally wow this is one of the most even spreadings of all time is this ever happened wow yeah so hold on bill joy see he co-founded sun microsystems yeah he made java sun microsystems by the way back in the day that was that was i would say the spiritual successor to bell laboratories yeah i agree with that it was like the best engineers of all time brendan greg was there uh bill joy obviously bill joy and every time i read it like any i think d trace came out of uh sun microsystems right i think so wow anyways i'm actually surprised at the leaning of this one sitting here forgetting i'm actually in chat uh for these polls i know best engineers worst managers yeah that's that that sounds just like any good engineering place but did they ever work at netflix brandon greg does that's funny um so yeah i think the poll is similar to the usual right like actually is edge lording in the top and then about where we already kind of had it if i have to painful um i don't think i think that the actually is not edge loading i think the painful people are people who've just never used it maybe that's okay maybe i'm one of those people then because i've i've used emacs but i have not used it as my like my daily driver you barely know vim motions like when it comes to opinions about editors you don't even know what you're doing out there david do you even know what vap does vap oh is it fap uh no i do not that probably means you don't know what yap means either why ap uh hold on yank and then no a number i don't i'm so sorry call yourself so disappointed in me all yourself low level and yet this is what you deliver okay you probably use your mouth i've been a sublime guy until very recently go watch my youtube videos i use vs code too i'm a degenerate it's horrible i know i know for a moment here i just need to kind of cleanse the palette from what i'm hearing all right um yeah i think down the code's a fair category for emacs unless but you guys really don't think so so i'll move it down to if i have to yeah i got on my if i have to i'm sure it's great i just have i've never had to you know low level ide user more like it uh damn damn vs code is an ide you know that all right damn okay i will leave it as if i have to i'm not happy i want you to know i'm not happy about that but i will do that for you that's fine that works anyone recognize this logo no this is that thing everyone in my chat has always telling me to try and i don't want to yeah he licks deez nuts that's what it stands for helix yeah uh helix is the spiritual successor to kekwon and um it's written in rust it has kekwon motions uh do i have it installed i probably shouldn't kill my server uh ajax do i have it i do look at that let's go so okay i don't currently have a color scheme apparently but like you can do oh you can do a lot of things like notice that i'm doing control u control d but look at this one this is one of my favorite things about it when you're here and you press ctrl d it doesn't jump to the end you can't jump a half page down once you're left within a half page that is nice i hate this editor but look it does have it does have that like emac style right like as you type it has that legend that comes up which can be useful anyways it's kakwan it's all that stuff that's dog water it is straight talk water uh personally or dog water like i've never heard of helix or attack on um so yeah i don't know i don't i just don't know why it exists that's my big thing is is why would you want to learn helix because the thing about helix editor is that you you develop this muscle memory that you effectively can't take anywhere yeah and chat's even saying that uh the uh what's it called the motions aren't even actually kekwon one to one they're actually part of their own bespoke thing vim is for old people yes you're gonna be old one day too tough guy um vs code has uh helix support oh i'm sure it's great because they're vims if it's anything like their vim support i'm sure it's amazing who bothered making helix support for vs code like who needs that yeah so for me this is like my probably unpopular opinion on uh nim and odin why right like what problem are we solving and to the point of kaquan and helix i i who i don't know what is this for who is this for i don't get it i will say this if you're making an editor to make an editor because that's like what you want to do that's totally cool i'm happy with people making editors becoming better programmers also odin has a real use case and you're just you just don't get it um yeah you're just ignorant uh odin's use case is is classically stated as instead of a struct of arrays it's an array of structs if you don't get it you don't get it okay you don't clearly not an ecs boy uh but odin knows odin knows some things but it's very it's very specific it's very narrow it's very niche language um but helix on the other hand i don't know i don't know i i'm just not down to coding it i'm not down to learn it no i think it's it too man like i i have not heard of this until today i'm fine putting helix next to zed yeah yeah yep that's what i'm saying all those new editors down there yep all right this is where things are going to get a little bit spicy are you ready for the spice adam classically referred to as the dick logo uh what do you think what do you think about adam painful for me because it was just really slow just just slow overall i don't know just painful painful it was so slow i i would still say that the biggest disappointment with adam was not how slow it was but when they came out as like we're the truly first hackable editor first off that's false but they came out they said that you open it up and you're like all right i'm ready here we go we're gonna hack on this editor i bet you they have a great api let's look at an example the only examples you find are written in coffeescript is that true yes it was a coffee script first editor oh so useful it was by far just if there is it i should have made an eclipse tier editor and i think this should have gone into that into the tier list of of of eclipse because it is that i just cannot believe to this day i'm still disciplined i can still actually feel my disappointment thinking about the idea that there was actually coffee script yikes the person i put this one in dog water yeah i'm fine with that funny that you mentioned that it's the first hackable editor because i'm reading the blog post about how their code signing certificates got stolen um and they had to revoke the certs from their code signing server or their code server so yeah again this is one of those editors that like it made a lot of claims about what it was able to do didn't really solve anyone's problems and a lot of people that i used to work with used to like evangelize over edit over adam even though like it was just kind of like spicy sublime right so for that reason dog water for me i i do not care about adam at all can i give one compelling piece of evidence why it's good no yes let's go back here let's quit out of this uh editor we have no idea how to quit out of let's jump over here and i'm going to type in something called ts playground toggle do you see this little thing right here which is obviously an ast of my of what i'm currently writing just an ast that's available right here you can see i'm highlighting this little region of various color schemes this is from adam that's tree sitter baby yeah that's from that's tree sitter that's how i do all my highlights indenting everything is via tree sitter hang on adam and teresa are related how the guy who made adam made tree sitter to be able to make fast highlights for adam uh okay wait but now it's integrated into neovim tree sitter became its own library written in rust by the way by the way uh and became its own thing and vs code is still in the middle of trying to make tree sitter work they still use like a bunch of regis and stuff to do highlighting but this on the other hand is really simple you can write a bunch of cool plugins with tree sitter tree sitters it's surprisingly easy to use but are we going to allow adam to be propped up by a true story absolutely not i'm just saying i'm just i'm just just announcing one of the good parts of adam which got taken out immediately because it was the only good part and coffeescript went to where all things that are produced from coffee go the toilet got it got it got it okay all right yeah yeah this one is uh this one's tough for me yeah it's tough for me too it's tough for me too me too i do have it installed it is on my ios yep um i do have installed too i used it for a week straight recently yeah this is one of those things that like for me it's like firefox right it's like the other thing that's there if i need it that if chrome's being a dick it's a little heavier than the other ones but you know what sometimes it just works sometimes i'm trying to look through a lot of code and as you know my vim foo sucks i need to open a lot of files at the same time and sometimes i'm going to use vs code i'll admit it i'm gonna do it okay skill issue is what you're trying to say it's a yeah skill issue so because i'll divert to vs code because of a skill issue i think i put vs code at if i have to because i'm gonna use vim but i'll use vs code if i have to i'm gonna use neovim but i'll use vs code if i have to that's where i'm at yeah it's an if i have to i literally only use it to see if my language server is being slow because i [ __ ] up something on neovim or because it's messed up overall that's one reason i ever opened it to compare but if i had to it's it's fine don't hate it it's just slow it's heavy that's my only thing with any of them or with the vs code yeah um everyone's like it's not slow it's not working a virtual machine too like so i'm already slow and then on top of that i'm in vs code in a vm like it's a disaster every time well um i'd like to present my thoughts on this matter uh i would like to just point out clearly that this logo right here you'll notice that it does share this exact same logo right here it's half as good as visual studio it only takes a half infinity to start up which is pretty nice uh it takes about a half infinity to auto complete it's definitely not slow eats all your memory or any of those very naughty things it's definitely not written in electron or javascript clearly a good choice for an editor uh i actually really dislike vs code the reason why i dislike vs code in the most truest sense is that it's the same argument as the ide argument which is it gets you into the door coding which is great i love that but it hides everything about coding that makes somebody go from somebody that doesn't know what's happening into somebody that knows what's happening and is able to actually like really blossom as a developer and i always feel like vs code just prevents people from doing that i've met so many developers that just don't even know the basics of anything but they're great coders and it's like just take like 10 minutes and learn the command line like why are you walking your file tree to find something that's in a file when grep is right there still saying that the abstractions from the command line that vs code gives you like um hampers people learning i think long run it can be very like the thing is i'm fine with vs code if you want to use it it's just that you have to like take an adventure somewhere else for a little while and then come back and go okay i've i've gone my i've gone my uh i've gone my rounds i just want to use vs code because i don't care and i'd go yeah i don't i whatever you know you can do you can do whatever you got to do you know there you go yeah i'd buy that argument but if you had to use it how do you feel about using it i personally uh find the experience extremely frustrating and i did just get done using it for a full week customized it to the to the hilt just like gosh three months ago two months ago i think chat gave me like 200 subs to use it for a week why are you frustrated by it like what about it it's frustrating it's slow it's key bindings are inconsistent depending on what is highlighted uh creation of files is extremely upsetting uh top level file creation versus inner tree creation are done two different ways uh there's just like so many little tiny things that most people don't notice because they're not vim users i know i know vim users right i'm just i just want one way to interact with everything that's it yeah it is very hard to move fast in vs code like aside from the performance of the editor like from the performance standpoint like just how it's programmed oh people don't know what i'm talking about so when you're right here like top level you can either you could you have to do a little plus city plus and then you can go in here and you'll notice that you you really don't have options for anything so you have to press specifically this little plus thing to create a new top level file whereas when you're in here you can actually go in here and say new file specifically for that folder so i just like hate those inconsistencies and that is vs code is a series of those like thousands of little tiny inconsistencies around just frustrates me okay code flows control n sort of works but it control n works from a different area it's not quite the key bindings aren't universal they don't always work everywhere which is extremely interesting but but control n and creating a file where does it create the file ocd much yeah skill issue i don't think so you're a skill issue uh anyways there we go uh a lot of copium in chat they love the copium they love the copium okay you know i hate it but i won't respect i will respect the wishes of chat i'll weigh them 25 percent all right here we go um what is it actually uh dtc uh forced uh gosh that's close enough uh what is it painful uh painful i just fapping uh painful and dog water yep perfect all right please everybody take a nice voting here me personally i'm gonna jump in here and hit it with that that heavy dog water vibes you're gonna put it in dog water oh hell yeah there's gonna be so many edge alerts because this is your chat that are going to put it in actually though you know that it's gonna be like a hundred actually votes [ __ ] that's probably what most people use right it is what most people use i understand that i am a minority here and the editor world that shit's dog water it is dog water i just don't want to have to press key combos for a feature of course you do you love going in your editor and pressing ctrl p to open up a file everyone does everyone does this thing you love the f you love the shortcuts that you're used to you don't like learning new ones boom knowledge drop yeah bam get the hell out all right i don't know i i agree that it's inconsistent i agree that it's frustrating but i can't call it dog water i think for me it's like i said before it's if i have to i'm gonna pick him yeah but if it's not there i'm gonna have to use a vs code if i have to all right so we got some if i have to okay so you you two are if i have to i am dog water chat is actually that literally puts the average right there look at that my program didn't quite even perfection i'm not even sure how i did that how is it even possible what is going on how did i do that he wrote the webp encoder in rust he rendered size pixels oh it's like all crazy i'm not exactly sure what uh what happened there nobody knows skill issue that's fine don't worry i'll fix this in post okay i'll take a picture of this and fix it in post i'll put fleet down here too nice compression shut up okay that actually could be a webp artifact i wonder if that is a webp artifact it might be all right so it looks like we got actually's we got two forced two and one uh dog water which means i have to put it in if i i have to put it here if i have to of course some troll in chat just said you should refresh you think you're clever but you're not yeah i'm not gonna fall for that trick i wrote the shitty program okay i know how it works do we need to do this one hell yeah hell yeah brother haley um so yeah this is uh if you would have asked me three years ago about this i would have said dog water i would have said there's no reason for this i would have said that people um make too big of a deal out of customizing their editors and should just use sublime or vs code but i've realized now that the ability to make them or any of them do whatever you want is [ __ ] amazing and so now it's definitely my actually i'm learning every day more and more to make neo been my daily driver because it's just so extensible it is force uh was a little painful uh what's the last one that water dog water that's that's what it's all right all these poll results gonna be these pull results will be interesting uh i let's see i'm just gonna look at it for a quick second i'm gonna put it under actually okay good i almost had to shout stop the count but i clearly don't have to stop i clearly don't have to stop call that okay yeah so i'm also gonna be uh in the actually category in fact i'm so in the actually category uh let's see hold on uh streamer let's see if i can pull this up really quickly uh yeah i think i can so watch this one uh can i do it here no uh let's go like this oh actually i can check this out are you ready for this one i'm gonna source this page that's pretty cool huh that is pretty cool whoa wrote that neil van me and tj that's not even that hard though it's not even hard to write no that it's a typical look at that nice scrolling effect that's going on and everything you can write whatever plugins you want it's like it's it's absolutely just mind-boggling what you can do what you don't see is look at that that's my cursor i actually put my cursor in the bottom corner in a hidden float in a floating plane right here there's a there's a window right here that is where i put my cursor so it doesn't get in here and so i just type it as if it's going this is amazing yeah wow yeah i use it for presentation in the hours editing videos like just this alone that's that's wild wow yeah i can let you uh pretty much use it oh do it please yeah anyways yeah so for me like yeah like this is a point about how how powerful the lua back end of neodym is and i didn't realize that until recently and because of that like when you get good at using that plug-in interface like you can make any of them do literally whatever you want it becomes any editor you want it to be yeah so that's that's the big thing so that's that's one of the big things that i i feel like people aren't putting in here which is they use the lua the world's simplest language that's well documented to make all their apis and all their apis are made by like tj uh uh befredo wherever he's at like some of the best api tools designers for developers ever like their apis are so clean and so easy to use so that's why i love it yeah i was a i was on vim before and i never understood my config i was always confused yeah and i moved to neovim finally understood what the hell was going on huge difference so yeah obviously it's an actually i don't think that's controversial at all yep i don't think it's controversial and not only that but look at this we have 425 which is super close a little bit you put a little error in there a little like one point two five percent error boom that's 420. you know what i mean lewis brazilian yeah and plus it's you know lewis made by brazilians and we love that uh there you go i think i think we're all on board right we're on board everyone's on board i i abided by the poll results again so dax are you actually of course we're gonna skip this one entirely i think we knew where it was going okay i appreciate i appreciate that first universal agreement between us and chat that's incredible yeah that is true and actually only u of them could do that and only neil van could truly do that uh have you uh heard of the laplace text editor funny you should say that it's somewhere in here you just can't see it do you see that little do you see that little specking who you see that that's where it's at um that's it that's all the editors we have that's it amazing can you believe how many editors yeah what's your daily driver the oven what level what is your start near them i'm transitioning i'm recovering vs code addict uh and sublime addict but learning neo them slowly every day okay what about you chat what do you guys use just just put it in here what do we see here rigged uh we let you guys vote okay oh i think i think chad's just about to get all goofy really [music] emacs intellij someone's did powerpoint awesome i love it okay cannot all right i saw let's see oh yeah dude did i just see a pig say do max do max is really good i actually really appreciate it do max it was like really my first try starting to edit i forgot about that i uh i also didn't have text mate in there as well a g edit is like an og editor man that's so it's kind of like for me like nano or vim like it's just always there if you need it it's like it's like the nano for me of vs code ge edit the thing is this with those ones i never understand why not just use vim right vim's also always there so i'm just gonna use vim there is something weirdly subconsciously satisfying about using my mouse though someone said i missed nano right there nano is literally right there yeah tell me more about the satisfying using the mouse because i always find that every time i need to use my mouse when it comes to text editing it's just like so much extra yeah literally i could be working on one file a single file and i get this very claustrophobic sensation when i have to use only keys and like i i do do that every day i do do sometimes that's the sensation of like making the cursor move somewhere i'm like ah freedom you know what i mean i i feel like i'm i'm let free from my straight jacket of you know cursor only or you know no no cursor mode i actually literally is i've had the same feelings back when i was starting vim in 2010 or 11 when i started my vim journey that's my exact same feeling or no 2000 13. yeah 2013. that thing is the skill issue which is 100 sure there's a skill issue i suck at motions and i'm i need to figure that out what os are you on uh i i bare metal windows and i do ubuntu in a vm when you say bare metal windows do you just mean like windows 11 like what does that even mean sorry it's windows 10 and then i drive inside of a vm for work like when what's a vmos up on two yes neovan does have mouse you can technically use mouse in it and look at that look at that nice little beautiful thing you can actually even set it up so that when you right click look at that look at that that's a neovim only uh selection i don't use any of it but you can imagine you could you could imagine what it'd be like right you use that all the time embarrassingly really yeah like copy copy code from somewhere and then right click and paste it in the event as opposed to just [ __ ] fee i don't know why like i literally couldn't tell you why exactly i could literally just control shift v it but i don't know i just it's satisfying so here here's something else for you a little little shortcut that i did okay for you i'm gonna move myself over since we're in the middle of doing this all right look down here this is where i put uh that's where i put something if i go space y oopsies i already was in in highlight mode space y look at what it replaced it with quotes plus why which is your system clipboard so now if i go ap i'll yank that paragraph which is any contiguous text and now when i press ctrl shift v i get that on my clipboard yeah that's cool yeah okay so for me like 100 skill issue need to figure out uh how the [ __ ] to just use them properly vim is fantastic i actually stole this key map yeah it's a great key map it is one of the best key maps out there so i don't like this one right here so people always suggest just do this one vim o uh clipboard equals unnamed plus what that means is what that means is that if you highlight and yank it goes to your clipboard also i actually like having the two because there's sometimes i want something that i got from like a browser or something and then i need to delete some text and then i get to that damn deleting text whatever i hate it yeah if if typing like dd to delete a line overwrote my system clipboard i would go insane yep and it would all right there you go touching your mouse while coding is going out uh out wait what oh my goodness i can't even finish reading that it's so degenerate i'm just leaving it there uh all right um well hey many appreciations thanks for joining yeah yeah thanks for having us appreciate it sorry i had to bring the kiddo but you know wife caught me coding in c plus plus so she's out wherever the [ __ ] she's at yeah no i don't blame her she's probably finding a real man coding in an assembly right now and you know what honestly good for her you know probably using neovan knows probably will yap does and vip and fap yeah fap is not really a real thing it is if you're a programmer nope don't believe it don't believe it one bit dax don't encourage him okay dax stop encouraging the man all right hey thank you i think in the chat this guy is wearing a human that's that's accurate same guy that doesn't know how to use vim also wearing a human yeah sounds pretty standard all right guys i'm gonna let you guys go all right oh hey wait a second i forgot to shout out dax shout out uh dax sorry about that uh it's a thd xr there you go boom nice there you go go follow dax i've already shouted you out lll all right i'm gonna do one more little article and then i'm gonna be done for the day bye all right thank you very much that was awesome i love you welcome to
