i'm not going to lie i was a little nervous to 
make this video i wasn't sure if i was going to   a lot of my videos and the whole point i 
started this channel was around encouraging   others to break into tech to break into coding 
advance their careers and all of the above to make   a video that does kind of the complete opposite i 
was really nervous to make but i thought it really   needed to be made wait wait are you actually 
going to make a video on this it goes against   everything you stand for all your other videos 
yes i feel like i really need to make this video   and just let everyone know what's on my mind okay 
i'm just warning you i'm just warning you before i   get into it though make sure to hit that subscribe 
button for more tech and coding related videos   as always shout out to some of these amazing 
subscribers here thank you so much for your   support your love i see you and you all are 
amazing okay let's just get right into it as i mentioned i was a little hesitant to make 
this video but as the title suggests reasons   why you should not be a software engineer i really 
wanted to address this video or this topic because   so i get so many inquiries or requests or people 
that have kind of almost this fantasy or this   dream of what software engineering really entails 
and sometimes it's not made up made out to be all   that it is and i really wanted to talk about 
that especially the reasons why if these are the   main reasons you are considering being a software 
engineer you might want to think again the first   one is going into software engineering or breaking 
into tech in general for the perks i think the   media whether it's movies or social media really 
put this glamorization on the perks that come with   tech i often get messages from others being like 
tiff why don't you want to work for a fan company   why don't you break into google or amazon look at 
all the perks that come with these companies and   the reason being or one of the reason beings 
is i'm sure there are amazing companies to work   for but for the reason being of the extra perks 
whether it be free lunch free food you know the   gym whatever it is it used to entice me it doesn't 
anymore the reason being is because at the end   of the day those perks are all great but if you 
don't like your job or the work and life balance   it's not worth it in my opinion and i think a lot 
of people really glamorize the tech industry and   software engineering that if they get into this 
industry they will have all these free perks and   it's totally worth it and that might be exciting 
for the first few days or moments that you are   working there but those perks will quickly wear 
off and the reality of do you enjoy your job we'll   set it another reason i think you should not be a 
software engineer is if you're in it for the money   now this might be a controversial one because 
obviously you don't need to have a super strong   love or passion for what you do nine to 
five i'm not saying that but you do need to   enjoy to some degree what you do in order to excel 
at it yes money is important but to fit yourself   into a specific role just because you can make 
a lot of money to me it doesn't make any sense   i think the tech industry is so broad and there 
are so many amazing roles within it that you don't   need to kind of pigeon yourself into pigeonhole 
yourself into one specific role just because you   think you'll make a ton of money you know you 
can use you can break into the tech industry and   if money is really important to you make a lot 
of money in so many different areas so i really   want to highlight that as well and some of you 
may be saying well tiff that's easy for someone   to say who is living comfortably but if i need 
to make that extra money or work really hard i   have no option but to put myself into a role that 
i can earn quite a bit of money and i hear what   you're saying but it goes back to once again i 
think there are so many roles within tech that   you can do just that so don't force yourself to be 
in software engineering if you're not feeling it   is for you i think recently the media going back 
to the media has put a lot of attention and focus   on technology and coders and hackers and even data 
science these are these sexy cool jobs right now   but at the end of the day you have to actually 
enjoy doing them i think we often forget that it's   not about what your linkedin title is or what 
you can tell people but rather about what you   actually are excited to go into office to do are 
you looking forward to what you are building or   how you are progressing because if you're not 
you're not going to succeed long term and i know   a lot of my videos are about how everyone should 
at least learn how to code or explore the basics   of coding but that doesn't result or equate to 
being a software engineer and i just really want   to clear that up i think everyone should learn 
how to code i think they should learn that just   like they learn math or science when you're going 
to school but it doesn't mean everyone needs to   be a software engineer no we need everyone 
to have different interests and different   roles the last reason i think you should not be 
a software engineer is if you don't like to learn   if you are someone who does not look forward 
to learning or challenging yourself on new   things then definitely do not get into software 
engineering or really any technical role for that   matter tech is changing so quickly that you really 
need to be someone who wants to continue to work   their brain and learn new things grow new skills 
because if you just even if you are a software   engineer and you do not grow new skills you're 
going to stay in the same place or fall behind   you always need to be learning no i'm not saying 
you need to spend your evenings or your weekends   learning new technical skills that's definitely 
something i don't do and i don't recommend   you do either you also need to have a life but 
that being said as a software engineer you need   to be learning and upskilling on a regular basis 
maybe an hour here throughout work maybe an hour   here on the weekend or after work but don't don't 
think that if you get into this role you'll never   have to learn it's it's a forever learning thing 
and a lot of times you have to get comfortable   with being uncomfortable you're going to be in 
new situations a lot solving new problems a lot   and you have to be certain if that is for 
you or something you really don't want to do   i hope this video is coming across the way i'm 
hoping it for which is that there's so much more   opportunity out there for you if you are not 
interested in specifically software engineering   do not force it if you think it's just because 
it's one of the cool industries to be in right   now or one of the cool jobs just like data science 
or any of these jobs but rather really look in   onto what is important to you what you want to 
strive to do for me the reason i became a software   engineer and got into um you know this role of 
it is because i wanted to be part of building   the future and to understand how that future was 
built and you don't need to be a software engineer   to do that but to me that just really lined up so 
well that i wanted to understand of how code works   and be a part of building different products and 
seeing them come to life and see people use them   and helping people finding solutions and if that 
excites you then yes i think software engineering   is a great career for you but and there's many 
other careers that you can do that with that so   this is more just like a ted talk of my thoughts 
around software engineering and why sometimes   maybe you shouldn't go into software engineering 
for specific reasons especially when it comes to   these free exciting perks or all the money that 
can come with it you really need to have more   depth to wanting to get into the field than just 
that i'm really curious to hear your thoughts so   on this video are you someone who is striving to 
become a software engineer or maybe you aren't   in software engineering just wanting to 
learn more about tech where are you at in   your career where are you at in your life i want 
to know more about you so leave in the comments   your thoughts on this your feedback do you agree 
or disagree with me i'm always down for either   make sure to hit that subscribe button 
for more tech and coding related videos   give this video a thumbs up for listening 
to me just view my thoughts to you i hope   it was really valuable though and i 
will see you all soon thanks everyone
