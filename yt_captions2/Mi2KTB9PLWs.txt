ladies and gentlemen welcome to the final day of action at the champions chess tour 2023 it's magnus carlson versus wesley so today is the second and final day and magnus carlson leads one to nothing wesley so must win the second set and force a tie break and potentially cause one of the biggest upsets in recent chess history or magnus carlson will win yet another event and add another feather to his cap today is also leon edwards versus colby covington so i had to wear my best bruise buffer uh sport coat which uh i've been getting dressed by my main man joe bananas australian fashion designer and um couldn't be happier so i i have been uh hopefully you've enjoyed some of these blazers i've enjoyed some of these blazers um and uh contrary to comments in the live chat no i am not being dressed by my mom although if she was dressing me she would have impeccable taste and clothing my friends yesterday wesley so opened up the rapid match with the move b3 that was a weird move but it was even weirder when wesley so opened up the rapid portion of the match on the second day with the move b3 this was strange this was definitely a strange decision i mean he does not go for e4 he does not go for d4 he does not go for a main line he plays pawn to b3 trying to develop the bishop on the diagonal and magnus for a second day in a row plays g6 and knight f6 he did the exact same thing yesterday and you'll notice magnus today spent 20 seconds playing g6 instead of 40 seconds but he definitely was surprised by b3 because it's unconventional i'm not saying it's bad it's just it's a little bit weird right so g6 knight f6 and this time before he play play c4 wesley decides i'm going to put bishops on both diagonals and actually not let magnus play b6 because the way wesley played this yesterday is he played c4 and then magnus put bishops like this right away but this time wesley says okay i'm going to do it my way i'm getting my bishops out before my knights breaking traditional chess principles uh and so what magus did is he set up in a king's indian way right this is a king's indian setup for black g6 d6 knight f6 bishop g7 there is a you know i i i've had many videos talking about how to play this setup there's a very famous uh piece of short form content where i say you know you can play this piece of you can play this opening against anything and then you see hikaru reacting to a clip of like somebody pre-moving some opening and winning it uh while black is pre-moving this setup that was a very long-winded way of saying you can play this against everything but you you shouldn't pre-move it because your opponent could catch you off guard now something really strange happens right in this position wesley does not castle okay he doesn't castle yet and first he plays here magnus seeing this goes oh well i'm going to go try to take the center right i want to develop my knight but i actually want to go here and take the entire center because wesley's actually refusing to do so wesley seeing this and seeing magnus wanting to go here does not play the traditional castles in d4 i think because he was actually quite worried about a position that looks like this where then black just basically starts firing away at white's king wesley doesn't want that so he moves his ewn a second time which is kind of weird cuz he just did that and right around here i realized i look at how much time wesley spent two minutes on this move and right around here i was interviewing fabiano caruana on the live broadcast and i kind of asked him like what's i'm i'm sensing hesitancy just like in the first game and look at magnus magnus just starts you know if you don't want to take the fight to me given i have the right prerequisites i'm going to take the fight to you magnus has a massive psychological advantage at this point in the match because yesterday they played a match that was three draws and a borderline win for magnus where it was never really like magnus was literally not in danger of losing any of those four games and he just picks up where he left off and look at this very timid approach from wesley and a move here that was highly criticized by fabiano by the way i mean what is going on here right just a lot of wesley playing a lot of moves that are like just getting out just a little just a little bit and right here fabiano said he didn't understand this move from wesley ah my neck is stiff oh he said if wesley wanted to win a game why not imbalance the position just why not create dake c4 on the board which could create a little bit of complication a little bit of imbalance something to play for because as fabiano said what happens now is that it's a symmetrical pawn structure no b pawns but black is doing completely fine black can play like bishop d7 queen a5 rook b8 um and he well plays the bishop out this way rook d1 and uh magnus begins taking over i mean he's just got a minus one position he's going to seize control of the b file at some point he might play d5 but he also could transfer the pieces in a closed position he also could play f5 and we're getting a sense from wesley that like look how many pieces are on the back rank magnus plays knight fd7 he's to bring the knight to the queen side finally wesley wakes up and plays d4 but but now he's like ill equipped to deal potentially with the consequences of opening up this position so now e takes d4 knight takes d4 and magnus gives up the bishop he actually gives up the bishop that is protecting his king to get this massive implant of horses in the position to get a horse tattoo apparently queen b8 retreating defending and getting the knight in here uh is even more powerful but knight e5 is a nice move and despite being a pawn down i mean he he is just swarming and and and wesley's really struggling to defend his queen side this is all under attack and that means that could be under attack and that could be under pressure well i'm just saying that square like the queen would not hang it the queen would not be blundered queen d1 and just queen a3 and i mean the rook is just stuck wesley's rook completely stuck he tries to defend it here comes magnus bishop b3 bishop c4 defending and also magnus has has an outside pass pawn he has a pass pawn that has no pawn stopping its path to the end of the board and knight e2 queen c5 is just is just a brutal situation the rook on d6 is under fire the queen is being pressured over here or not being pressured but rather pressuring this one gets into a scramble magnus actually gets down to 16 seconds on the clock a little bit spooky but he keeps everything under control for a while the game is a little bit chaotic apparently rook d8 a mistake as he tried to sacrifice his bishop to play rook d1 check but wesley does not seize the moment and instead goes goes here and after a4 uh bad news the rook is being deflected and um rook takes b5 rook takes d3 and magnus is just cleaning up and um this is just about the worst start to a game that you could ask for to a match that you could ask for if you are wesley so magnus has too many pass pawns nice idea knight f1 check and the rook is going to come to e1 wesley cannot promote and the game is over as the king walk in three pass pawns from magnus and um the m the match is just as good as done um wesley yesterday you know loses a game that could have gone either way it was a rook end game it was very very tense frankly it couldn't have gone either way um it was very very tense let me just respond uh to my wonderful wife i don't think i told her uh that i'm recapping i said i'm recapping i will reply later i love you there you go you got a you got a listen my my my fellow young men you go to you can't be afraid of showing your emotions life lessons with red blazer gotham chess anyway this is um this is a nightmare uh this is not the wesley that we needed to show up you you will remember by the way do you remember from the round robin stage that wesley sacrificed like four pieces and checkmated magnus that was insanity and this is just not this is not it and uh magnus is now just looking to put the match away he plays e4 wesley knows he's got to go for it he plays a sicilian defense and magnus plays this sideline sicilian with bishop c4 and knight f3 uh and um and is just playing in a way to get wesley out of any sort of prep uh wesley plays d5 bishop b5 check king to f8 vol voluntarily losing the right to castle because he's actually threatening to trap magnus's bishop and magnus pushes the knight back and then plays a5 and sacrifices the pawn right so magnus i don't know if sacrifice or loses but he's down a pawn he just needs to stop b5 so he plays here now you may wonder how is that stopping b5 at all well white would be playing bishop d2 and you see if if the queen tries to go back then i'm going to you know take on uh i'm going to take on b 5 and you're not actually going to be able to uh right so ab rook a8 so this one gets locked early and it's about time that wesley stopped playing super solid positions like that against magnus super slow positions positions where he's not actually getting much of anything and instead we need a mess if wesley's going to beat magnus he needs a mess but let's not forget i mean magnus is still in good shape in this position and we have take take h6 h4 and i have no idea how wesley is going to get a single piece out he can't move the bishop forward he can't move the knight forward he can't move this knight forward can't really move his f pawn forward because then that's going to get weak so he moved something else forward and now magnus is just one and a half points of advantage i mean he is just an absolute juggernaut not to be denied uh he can he has a plethora of options here the computer really likes this move h5 either making black take and damage his structure long term or make black overextend at which point black just can't move a thing he can't move any pawn forward without creating more weakness and then white is going to begin expanding over here put the knight in here control the e file maybe move this knight and play f4 and shred open the like terrible position but instead instead of that magnus plays b4 which is still a very very good move the computer really likes it and magnus gives away this and takes this and it's just a matter of time like until the avalanche just goes straight down into wesley's position wesley doesn't have a d or c pawn he also can't move these and and and really white is going to be the one calling the shots here look at this position i mean what it's just just just unbelievable play from magnus wesley got nothing absolutely nothing here the king goes to g7 the knight drives its way into the black position and it's on the verge of being over it's on the verge of being over black can't move a single thing like let's say black plays a move like knight c5 just you know a lack ofical move you're already looking at tactics it just doesn't quite work but something like queen f7 is literally checkmate like this is made on the board i don't know what wesley is going to do here he ends up taking the knight and the queen slides back to c8 but magnus's pawn is two squares away from queening white can play a move like rook e1 white can play a move like h5 all of these things look pretty good all black hases this e5 move but it's not really scaring anybody but magnus plays rookie one apparently a mistake apparently again better to play h5 this move has been sort of begging to be played for a little bit uh and now coming back and hitting that pawn is what stockfish wants once you give it a little bit of time to think yeah but rook e eight and again like c5 advancing over here magnus decides to undevelop and then put the bishop on this diagonal with good pressure but wesley now begins creating a barrier and we are in a scramble 140 versus 3 minutes on the clock g4 magnus going for an attack wesley playing king to g8 stepping off of the diagonal of oops off the diagonal of the dark squared bishop the knight goes to d2 with opportunity to potentially remove that knight from the board and continue this attack now e6 magnus plays g5 attacking with the kingside pawns takes takes the computer wants this or this but what it doesn't want is this move given a major question mark and it is a really really curious decision because white is going to play knight e4 and just locomotive you know what's one thing missing from this position from this move g5 it has less to do with the knight it has to do with the opening of the h file and if you put that knight there it is a target for long-term attack and magnus carlson is about to crash through and and make it two to nothing which would be a worst case scenario for wesley so who is trying not to get eliminated wesley grabs that pawn though wesley's up two pawns we can't underestimate that and now magnus plays d4 with 30 seconds remaining on the clock the idea of d4 is actually quite clever because black can't take that pawn with the pawn because he would lose the rook he also can't take the rook the pawn with the rook because he's going to lose the rook so what do you do here if you are playing black well you sacri ice a brilliant move from wesley and as it turns out you actually can you actually can do this bishop takes e takes and wesley actually has some past pawns look at these pawns now we are far away from that those pawns don't really matter right now what matters right now is the attack on the h file what matters right now is the infiltration of the knight what matters right now is the infiltration of the rook but the computer is pointing to an advantage for magnus rook to for for wesley rook to e7 losing to queen c5 which is a fork of the rook and the pawn on but instead of that wesley plays knight c5 with a major miss the queen should have gone to that square rook e1 played by magnus doubling the rooks now wesley starts panicking rook f8 wesley below a minute wesley should not have undeveloped his rook he needed to play actively queen f5 or knight f8 transferring in over here but he plays passively wesley hesitant magnus steps forward with queen h4 with 15 seconds remaining on the clock wesley panics and plays pawn to b3 and now magnus is completely winning if he brings another pawn if magnus plays f4 and rook e5 and f5 he is winning why is this move winning the knight constantly monitors the pawn the pawn is going to need the help of another pawn and something like king g2 rook h1 anchoring in that pawn on f5 on g5 rather prevents all counterplay in the position magnus plays king g2 he is now just moments away from landing a fatal blow on the h file queen to f5 played by wesley who now also has 15 seconds remaining this is completely insane magnus rook e5 apparently a mistake because the queen can go back patrolling the seventh rank now rook d5 attacking the queen the queen to the queen goes to c7 rook h1 f6 magnus is crashing through but he's only got 5 seconds on the clock he plays knight e4 black can play knight takes e4 wesley has 10 seconds to make a decision or he's going to lose on time wesley makes a a major major major mistake and now the best move here for white is to be patient and go for that pawn instead but instead he goes here tons of pressure building up over here knight takes g5 is the only move that doesn't lose you have to play knight takes g5 and then you have to be ready to run your king to the other side of the board but all of a sudden wesley so has lost the game oh my goodness magnus carlson is completely winning he is completely winning if he plays knight takes h7 because knight takes h7 if something like rook takes f2 the king goes to g1 and this looks very scary but actually white wins black is a move away from checkmating white and it is actually white who wins the game but this is very dangerous to calculate with 5 seconds on the clock and instead of that magnus does this but that is still winning move 7 seconds each queen f7 and now he has to be brave and take the rook and for whatever reason magnus in this position goes wait if i trade everything and then i take it's check and i'm upper rook take take take take check that's exactly what happens take take take take take with check but agnes is losing he's losing what he should have done instead was just taking the rook if king takes he swarms the king with rook d8 queen h7 if knight takes queen h8 is mate if queen knight f8 you can't actually take the knet with anything you can't take the knight with anything you have to go here first force the king in front of the rook but instead of that all of a sudden magnus is losing rook d6 and wesley so his pawns are coming down the board and the there's nothing there's nothing he can do magnus so rook b8 and now magnus just has to force some sort of cage around the king and he nearly does magnus is threatening knight h7 with a draw wesley can make two different queens in this position but making a queen would throw the game oh my god how is that even possible making a queen would throw the game because king e8 king g8 is a box and now with 12 seconds on the clock wesley finds the only winning move give a check give a check and go here and magnus resigned the point is you deflect the knight away from the f6 square you can give me a check but you cannot come back and my king will run away while both of my pawns are threatening to promote i mean this is a gangster final position right it's a it's a it's it's a picture perfect situation of the threat is more valuable than the execution knight h5 and wesley so is back what a game magnus was super unhappy after this uh as you might imagine i mean typical right if you're like the greatest in a sport it's like jokovic smashing his racket i don't think he did that but that was nuts and now it's one to one and it's wesley's first win over magnus in a rapid game he didn't beat him yesterday first win in six games d4 knight f6 c4 e6 and we have a nso indian queen c2 d5 this is a very cutting edge line black takes then black puts the knight on e4 attacking the queen and just starts trying to mess around in the center of the board a very forcing line white plays dc5 magnus plays knight c6 and queen a5 check and he's basically just trying to use white's early kind of strange development of not developing on this side of the board against him then he grabs this grabs this takes the pawn he knows that trade is going to happen and when it's all said and done we have bishop and knight bishop and knight same color bishop light score bishop exact same pawns we have efgh as well as a andb and um life is good life is good position is very balanced and it really did seem like after the absolute chaos of the previous game the players kind of needed this oh my neck is so stiff from sitting and looking at chess boards for like a week straight queen e7 bishop e8 very passive but very massive position as well bishop e2 and um both guys just kind of solidly position is symmetrical and at some point maybe they're going to clash we have a rook trade all right rook c4 ambitious move potentially by wesley looking to create a threat of a checkmate but magnus just gets in there real quick and okay i mean if you play h4 h5 that's real nice but i don't think anybody's going to be blundering checkmate queen c1 check queens are off and we have the following position which is maybe microscopically better for the guy that has the knight normally a bishop is better than a knight in an end game but when the structure is a little bit goofy like that you know we we we can agree to disagree um also you know any intermediate player might lose this with either color but now we go to this end game now i would argue that this end game is actually probably better practically for again the guy that has the better structure and you know many intermediates make simple mistakes but at the highest level this is really just equality f4 bishop b5 the nidus push back magnus takes and magnus's structure is slightly worse but he you you can't beat a bishop with a knight i mean that the bishop is just simply too fast wesley putting a bunch of pawns on the dark squares in fact all his pieces are on dark squares or not the king um speaking of the king absolutely nothing to be done a total fortress created white just defends everything and uh after the absolute insanity that we just saw this is kind of a nice stabilizer you got to give credit magnus basically showed up with a with a uh with an opening against the nso indian that was very good he plays this line d5 taking early this interesting early provocative knight move rather than playing castles or anything like that and um it's a line where basically white gets black gets nothing absolutely nothing white has a slight microscopic advantage due to the slightly more uh active nature of the bishops like magnus's bishop is like not really impressing anybody uh but uh you know it's solid in this game was 99.2 versus 99.4 magnus gets white i mean that was just about the best type of game that you could have asked for coming out of a chaotic game that you ultimately lost and magnus says my turn i'm going to try it and wesley plays c5 and something interesting couple of years ago when the champions chess tour final started here's a fun fact about this game this is called the semi tash okay and historically black has played cd5 knight d5 e4 take take take take bishop b4 bishop d2 and black has gone for this solid setup which is slightly worse as you can see by the computer but ultimately black would equalize but about 2 or three years ago this variation cd5 cd4 a mirror image capture was almost invented by wesley so during the pandemic there was a lot of online events and wesley so was playing the symmetrical line and it actually almost broke the queen's pawn like to play this setup with white if black played c5 they were really trying to kill the game and apparently wesley so did that a lot to magnus early on two or three years ago some of you might have been watching the early days of the champions chess tour online some of you might have not so magnus enters the thing wesley invented to try to win the entire champions chess tour now back in the day um the main line was considered like the sometimes you can play queen a4 check and and force something in front of the king but after queen d4 ed a major line used to be e4 they stopped playing that because after e4 there would be a huge exchange of pieces like you know there's just too many trades you know and there was a line knight g5 bishop e6 you would play knight e6 you would damage black's structure then you would you know white has a lot of development but black is a pawn up and in a very high level of analysis white can't win white just can't win i mean it's really difficult so everybody started looking elsewhere how to get an advantage well against fabiano earlier in the event magnus went knight e5 and he posed a lot of problems he went on to win that game this time magnus says bishop d2 so magnus plays bishop d2 i'm not sure if the move bishop d2 has been played before you may be wondering why he didn't take his pawn or why he why he didn't damage his structure why he didn't take the pawn the question is you wait and see bozo that is the point because the computer says this move is completely fine now kn bd7 interesting so the idea might have been to make black waste time uh or commit the knight there maybe that's another major point rather than putting the knight actively on the c6 square now magnus takes and now wesley plays this move h6 right away covering anything going to g5 apparently the computer highly prefers f6 once to keep that pawn where it is but wesley does that a little bit later and um he plays f6 and now he walks his king to safety okay so the king is safe behind the pawns black is basically two or three accurate moves away from stabilizing the position and getting equality which is sort of the point of this line right wesley sort of invented this line quote unquote um where black is always under a tiny bit of pressure but if you defend well you sort of kill the game like white cannot find a way to get an advantage against you and he's he's just there he's almost there magnus plays f4 after spending two minutes magnus does not like to push pawns he doesn't like to push pawns very much it's a very very big committal decision now if the oppent gets there it's nice so black is going to have to be ready and black can't play f5 he can't play f5 himself cuz he's going to get hit with this move and if g6 that rook is hanging so after bishop h8 you just hang a full rook so that doesn't work right so you can't do that because of bishop h5 which would force the king into a passive situation either there or there so what do you play well apparently you play h5 uh which stops bishop h5 and then you put the bishop on c4 so that's a very tough move to play if a few moves ago you played h6 but apparently you just have to accept that reality but now wesley plays this wesley decides to give away the bishop for the knight and his logic is i need to catch up on time not like this time i need to catch up on time like on the board i'm behind in development i play bishop to c5 spends half his time magnus takes and now rook d1 losing a major chunk of the advantage apparently the best move for white was to play bishop d4 right away to play bishop d4 right away way to try to get maybe that pawn for example if you allow rook c2 then you play bishop f3 with very good long-term pressure on the pawns if something like b6 is played you can try to trap the rook and make it feel unpleasant but in instead of that rook d1 is played and after knight b6 wesley's out of the woods and you know magnus is going to have to try to squeeze water out of a stone like he always does right it's one of those typical magnesian games symmetrical structure advantage of the two bishops maybe he's going to put the bishop there maybe he's going to double up try to get in on that square target over here maybe here and here damage the pawns long-term advantage light squir weaknesses wesley just poking out his pawns magnus plays b4 ooh ooh and the point is if rook a2 if rook a2 bishop h5 wins how you take the knight and then you get in if king g8 you actually build a box you don't let the king out and the same of g6 you have f5 shredding open the white position so suddenly wesley's like uhoh uhoh rook d5 bishop f three and now wesley needed to stand down wesley needed to realize i can't keep i can't keep playing pinball with magnus because if i do and i go here magnus is not going to play a3 magnus traps my rook and you are looking at the final moments of a rook trapped on the edge of the board wesley goes in with a fork and the threat is rook here takes bishop c4 skewer but magnus as we know now is a subscriber of the gotham chess youtube channel and what is worth more than a bishop and a rook combined you you are worth more than a bishop and a rook combined but so is wesley's king bishop to h5 check the idea being that even though you've now created two problems for yourself one of them is solved and one of them is now given back to black acdc bishop c4 rook d7 check escaping all the danger rook d6 check escaping the danger and rook c1 and all of a sudden the fumes have run out knight to e4 rook to d4 the danger has been evaded it's a fork wesley so resigns magnus carlson wins the champions chess tour 2023 200,000 bucks not much more to say and awesome awesome event commiserations to wesley a uh really commendable performance by everybody everybody in the event nir be abdur of absolute beast from usbekistan he is a world rapid champion he will go back to samar khand uh in usbekistan to play the world rapid and blitz championship fabiano carana put on an really like to me almost like at a level magnus fabby was almost like uh it was like yugi versus kaiba that's what that was semi-finals of battle city it's a yu-gi-oh reference i mean like that was the final of the final maybe um hikaru a crazy event almost a comeback dennis lazovic the wonder kid uh from bellarus maxim vash gra putting on fights left and right and and um i think i named everybody ali resa fua ali resa fua that ali resa fua is continues to be the biggest wild card in chess the biggest what if in chess um we will see what his future holds and i'm i'm very curious and excited to look forward to it um i'm going to go do some more recording and some more media here in toronto and what a special week it's been um you know for me uh i uh i was on a radio interview i did two tv interviews here
