i like the new house it's got most of the things that i care about in it but my first love isn't here yet we haven't moved our computers all right the computer room is empty so the goal today is to get both mine and yvonne's computers moved over here set up and most importantly wired in and it's going to be a little bit tricky because unlike most people's computers who sit right next to their monitor and their peripherals ours are gonna sit somewhere in the depths of the basement and use fiber optic cables to connect to our stations here in the office should go fine you know what else is fine our sponsor viewsonic their elite xg321 ug mini led monitor offers a 4k native ips panel with 144hz refresh rate and g-sync ultimate r4 and a quantum dot color layer so it's great for gamers and creators learn more at the link down below [music] this is where my computer plugs in i have no idea how that's going to reach my computer and i can't even reach it fortunately for today's endeavor i do have a helper hello special guest appearance luke lafreniere i love your shirt by the way um we traded not the company i work for where are they supposed to go where's your computer well they're gonna have to go into the road my computer's not here we're gonna have to move that oh you thought i was prepared for this or what like the main problem isn't going to be the computer i think this is mine what this yeah well for all the stuff employees have stolen from me over the years you actually gave it to me oh did i you had two the main problem is going to be all the peripherals and accessories and microphones and stuff like that you're just gonna start unplugging and i just grab stuff we didn't bring any bins the problem with cable management is at some point you have to unmanage it i wonder if you could make that better oh luke's luke teasing the new products yes we'll be showing our new cable management product today the early prototypes i counted box well this is great what is hanging off of me ah cable ties they're so sticky lttstar.com don't let me move the monitor uh yeah sure do you want to oh okay see it's like really expensive so i was gonna be careful with it but he just while linus plays with his little pc we're going to be solving important problems like whether or not our van fits in here now i say important but my solution to this is really simple let's just park the van over there but linus is really insistent that it has to go on this side so i guess it's important to him we have these two steps here and i think the front of it might just cross it so it might not work but we're going to clear the space and try to figure that out for him we already moved yvonne's computer oh yeah i'm really really looking forward to having proper access to all sides of my rack i'm uh i'm excited for having access to all sides of your rack too thankfully it's cute this is really not my finest work just hire professional movers they don't have to cost as much as the horrible quote we got you should yeah this is not good don't overburden yourself there luke that was a lot it's a heavy load i'm just gonna i'm really glad really glad you're not overburdening yourself just gonna make sure that you can yeah there you go i think it's just the monitor and we're good yeah sure i'll do a sweep upstairs and make sure actually i'm going to pull this in what a good driver okay so um you want to help guide me in sure you're not straight so you're just finding this out now okay uh luke am i in no you got to go deeper okay that's all i got you gotta keep coming you gotta push coming you have okay stop your bumper's over the stair well just barely just barely what about the back though you have a lot of room actually i mean i don't know if i'd call it a lot of room okay this is a high risk maneuver we're gonna close the garage and i'm gonna back up to high risk maneuver think of the views linus just drive right through the door that's much better just realized we forgot the rails for this thing so i'm hauling it down here but i can't even mount it i do have yvonne's rails here so i can at least mount one of them for now okay so you guide your side in i guide my side in anytime sorry it's just really big it's hard to just give her yeah it's time to figure out if this reaches oh this is bad this is not long enough wait the green fiber only needs to go to the icron dock where are the icon docs yay that's the source side this is the client side here's what i'm kind of feeling luke without any desks let's just see if all the in-floor and in-wall fiber optics actually work okay so we're going functionality first let's go function first sounds good mark come check this out remember the fiber optic and displayport cables that i showed you down in the server room well this is theoretically how it works you just plug in and you're good to go these little covers here very very important they keep the ah the fiber optic ends clean and if they get dirty it's a real chore to clean them and then you just plug in like that easy what do you think are the odds it lights up hello are you on or not no dice wait what is this why would we put two extensions on it now we're gonna plug in directly i think this might be that end oh goodness i see it you want me to grab it hold on oh sorry nobody breathe everybody don't breathe what the hell okay yes so it's going in here it's in here oh balls so it's right here i was plugging completely the wrong cable in oh wait yes they're labeled i have the other end of the cable you are holding this is the rack end which explains why that was so short because it was never intended to go in the rack i was actually wondering how i was supposed to plug in her fiber unit because i didn't see any plugs on that side there is the hole in the floor this is great news it means that this goes to you this plugs into yvonne's fiber usb thing that means this one next to it is almost certainly the one on my end wait no no where was the one next to it there was one bundled with that one pretty sure that was it yeah okay i'm feeling good wait this doesn't help us with the display port do you want to go check if there's a label on the dp cable sticking out of the wall 24. some of these aren't even labeled yeah but they have labels here 24 24 yeah okay all right got it got it got it got it yay now we need to know if it's actually going to work through the wall plate thing we're gonna be okay that goes there oh yes we're not out of the woods yet though just because it's working at 4k 60 hertz doesn't mean that it has the signal integrity to work at 4k 120 hertz actually it seems to be working at 120 hertz right now that's a very good sign minor detail i haven't transported my desk to the new place and i didn't bring a drill here so i guess i get to do this manually taking the top off i'm not gonna hit i'm good well would have hit that look at this guy's showboating as soon as the camera turns on he's like oh i'll grab something heavy now it should be noted this is not the final form desktop for the new place these are cable management speed holes ah that are from my previous setup and it's not actually the full size that i'm going to be putting there but what i can do is i can set everything up the way that i think it will go maybe put some like cardboard extensions map out exactly where i want all the new holes and then i can use it as a template for the real desk put all the holes in and then i'll be ready to go right out of the gate yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah stop looks busy upstairs so my plan is to solo install yvonne's machine in the rack you know i had actually intended to upgrade her gpu but i do not know where that graphics card is it's a titan rtx oh crap now i need these out don't worry i'm a professional but i have whoa solo installed these a few times that happens once in a while i've never built one of these before but it seems pretty straightforward so not a big deal as i miss very cool luke we don't need this cable management tray because i have the cable management thing i've been teasing all day on the surface these are perfectly normal cable management arches but what's special about them hahaha is how strong they are so you'll be able to use all the different sizes to manage everything from gigantic bundles of wire like this down to individual wires boop here's an example of a perfect application for these i put a cable tie on this and had it just hanging here but what i could have done since i know that this is temporary and i'm going to do a better job of this later it's just gone like this these are little steel plates and these are going to be really useful for our cable management stuff the ones that we actually make are going to have holes in them instead of just adhesive but you'll be able to stick them onto anything and then you'll be able to take all your tables or whatever and you'll be able to run them through there and then you'll take your little arch and cable managed it down into place there's going to be one that's designed to hold down power bricks like this look they gotta understand the products they gonna have to run this business for us someday then there's this one which is designed for you to run a cable tie through it like this and then that one can hold as many things as you can fit in a cable tie you're good uh wow you're going uh okay sure yes uh why not it's taking shortcuts here ladies and gentlemen i used to have two staples in here holding this extra coil of wire no more all about the magnets now hello okay okay flipping awesome really not my finest work but hey it's all magnetic so it's super easy to change which is cool but i saved the coolest part for last part of the point of having my machine in a central location like this and then using fiber optic cabling to get signals elsewhere in the house is that i can actually use it in different parts of the house is there an hdmi to there crap i don't think there is that's okay we can cheat unfortunately this one's only hdmi 2.0 so it'll do 4k 60 hertz still that's perfectly fine for our demo there's conduit so that i can run something hdmi 2.1 compliant over to the theater room or to the land room or wherever the case may be okay aux one please just immediately work what are the odds my brain hurts it'll work it's it didn't work you lied to me second display is here extend duplicate these displays okay guys we are so good at this okay theoretically steam big picture down we go there it is we got him ladies and gentlemen powerful sure steam clouder wait oh is this still i have i have no other controls the only controls are also i don't detect any audio definitely some things to fine-tune but i mean it's functioning yes and there's no fan noise no heat output in either the theater room or in the office upstairs an input lag feels fantastic well of course because it's just an optical hdmi or an optical displayport connection there's no additional latency compared to just running a regular cable or what did you die i didn't even die did you killing my own brambles i guess this is not going well for me oh what is that nice hash switching oh my god the stupidest part of this is the pool i'm mining into is like the lounge night lunch one i think i'm just gonna stop basically you just need keyboard mouse down here this is not a great experience can we even get back i don't think we could get out of it as a
