why hello there you didn't think you'd ever see this puppy again did you the third installment of nextgen desk pc is here and guys we are getting so close i can taste it oh sawdust disgusting but that's okay because it only needs to look good and have top tier performance flavor is optional so this time the reservoir is finally for realsies done the parts are mostly all here and it's time to put it all together and make sure it's actually going to work but what if you're done work for the day well then you should check out our sponsor war thunder war thunder is an online military vehicle combat game that's free to play and a ton of fun try it for free down below today and get some special bonus items for signing up [music] now i couldn't help noticing that other than the res being done this looks pretty much the same as last time it's changed a bit so let's start with the res it's been redesigned again now instead of being a three piece design it's a four piece design the most failure prone part of building this thing is drilling and tapping the g1 quarter holes the new design does nothing to make acrylic less brittle it just is right but if we can do that brittle finicky part before we invest a bunch of time etching and cutting the' millimeter thick acrylic ring at least it's not so heartbreaking when it breaks the port arrangement has also moved so we've gone up to three ports from two and we're gonna talk about that a little bit later it looks freaking awesome though this exceeds my expectations for what we were going to end up with here and it's full of water that was a challenge sometimes you fix one problem and you create another and moving to a four piece design makes o-ring ceiling way more difficult i thought i could maybe get away with uh acrylic solvent welding the whole thing together but it's a one-shot deal mom spaghetti so yeah i mean the small test chips look great yes the bigger test chips leave a lot to be desired i think the client would probably send this one back to the kitchen if it looked like that that means we're back to using o-rings from cord stock we have to make sure to tighten them evenly so they can press more or less equally the whole way around now the yellow um ooze yeah that's o-ring lube it's like vaseline essentially i needed every chance i could get to keep it sealed because the laser leaves it a little bit rough in the grooves that i edged it yellowed a bit with water who knows maybe some water changes will help fix that truthfully though i wouldn't have even noticed if you hadn't pointed out to me before we started shooting so i don't think that's a big deal and that concludes the scripted portion of today's video let's assemble a computer let's do it got our new ltt store flask design here just pop that baby open and give it the old you know all no no see you later thanks to ek just littering us with stuff ugh uh what can i work on i do you want to make some hoses and stuff the fittings are right behind you they're sitting in the blue bins oh there's your fittings um this guy is going to be just a dumped a tank and it's pulling out of here okay i don't know how i didn't notice this before but this is a very unusual graphics card it's clearly an nvidia reference pcb of some sort because it uses their little weirdo 12 pin connector but instead of having the terminations for the g1 quarter fittings up here they're at the back and more like a kind of like a more server friendly orientation but it's an rtx 3070. yo dog i heard you like fittings so i put a fitting in your fitting there's no there's no tube going here like that's it that's going there which means and this is bad news this has to have a mount because it actually needs to come up a few millimeters do you mind supporting this a little bit it just uh happily feels kind of off angle and then it's really hard to ah oh this hard line run is going to be an absolute nightmare there's no other way to get it in and out of there now i kind of wish we hadn't cut the holes yet because we could have turned the drives around and kind of gone this way if we needed a bit more room to move the side okay so right now this is perpendicular to the edge of the desktop that's where we want it um so that would put this like this it's it's not yeah it's a little off it's a little off okay so this has to go like this which means we have to have some soft something somewhere in here yeah let me try something here i'ma try something ladies and gentlemen got a 90 degree fitting oh she goes we're not out of the woods here yet though because here's the thing just because your right angle fits doesn't mean your fitting fits oh boy that's that's ratchet no oh wait wait and then a right angle okay okay i don't know about using these hard line fittings to be honest with you they're just really junky and they're going to make our lives more difficult we can use something else oh my god why were you why were we even talking about using these ones this is but what do you think cross-sectional diet like area come on this don't wreck my res i think it's okay actually okay that is so much easier to deal with okay do you think we can just get away with not having any of that it rubs well it will only rub once yeah but we're gonna have to try to put tubing on here and stuff do we want to try and put the fittings on the underside here so we can put the glass on i already put fittings on it i've been out like grabbing fittings and he's just been working away yeah and they actually like yeah that actually like works great because they it holds it at almost exactly the right height it's real close yeah i mean it's kind of nice though like to bring your graphics card up to the level of the desk so it's like sitting right under the glass colin if you hated the snake off the cpu block you are going to double hate the snake off the gpu block oh man how many o-rings is it in like 12 inches oh god one so many two three four five six seven yeah i mean a o for or what could go wrong over oh are these posts not straight there we go okay mint it's gonna have to come off again to put thermal paste on it yeah yeah that's fine we're just we're experimenting so we'll just do a 90 degree like it's a ultimate hard line yeah all metal all metal water cooling can we do that we should we should do that i think it's been done we're trying to figure out what the best way to get the tubing cleanly in and out of this pump is and i i think that's going to be it this run is pretty much straight straight and this one should actually be pretty much straight too we might have to sneak it pollen again again it's okay i already got one this is a mess i thought it would be so much cleaner yeah me too that's her that's your i call this the weenie boy it's not about the size it's about the functionality all right yeah whatever you tell yourself yeah yeah so one thing we haven't discussed yet is uh that oh shoot yeah don't leave it there for aesthetics but we could shim the desk up a niche nope okay what's worked for me all good yeah no it's old not necessary oh wow that would actually not be that hard to do yeah it's really like put a shimmer oh okay damn it wow yeah before you told me how simple the solution was not counting the o-rings that are in the reservoir there's over 50 o-rings in this loop oh yeah we didn't even count the ones in the blocks oh yeah and in the pumps give me your odds that this actually stays pressurized ten percent this is a big loop yes it's leaking this one's loose damn i was hoping it wouldn't be one of mine it's holding it's a living i mean one out of 50 ain't bad that's 98 good unfortunately in a water cooling loop 98 ain't it chief i don't know i hear one no it's leaking again hold on hold on a really good way to check where a leak is coming from is to use some soapy water you'll start to see bubbles where the air is escaping the system there's not enough o-ring crushing going on right here see that andy how you can see the o-ring being crushed here and over here but not right there so that would explain how we had a little spill here the bad news is that we'll significantly delay our test of the whole loop the good news is that should be a relatively simple fix with a thicker o-ring call and i found it oh there we go well that might be it dog i haven't tightened these since i originally put it together like a week ago and it's been holding water one thing to note is the acrylic that i used is cast so it's not very level um it's actually there's a 0.8 millimeter difference in thickness across the entire thing so you're really taking these unflat things and trying to smush them together now this side you can see the leak andy can come have a look yeah yeah all right so why don't you finish doing your thing then and then i'll pump it i probably won't be able to tell because it's all the way in there there's definitely one like up here there we go i heard it stop we gotta get to the green zone colin take me to the green zone see that one popped yeah but it's it's tight it seems like the top one is not the main problem it seems like it's the bottom one once we're getting through all those layers struggling yeah we have uneven thicknesses pressing down on an o-ring we're holding pressure now yeah and we're right on whoa whoa i didn't even see that that's a bomb [laughter] safety glasses there they are oh the viewers who might not have noticed what colin and i noticed it now has a domed top um so colin this might be good news though i i did good okay i've made a pressure vessel because yeah because if this thing if water doesn't leak then it doesn't necessarily need to pass this pressure test but it did sort of kind of yeah i mean it's it seems to be holding yeah can we vent the pressure now this is scaring me yeah we can vent the pressure yeah let's go ahead and just do that is it deflating yep it's hard for me to tell from here oh do you hear that creak oh my goodness that was um okay this is something different ultimately what our test failure means is that we're ready to rock because now that we've depressurized it i'm confident enough to fill this thing with water so there's still a few decisions we have to make though this pump for example could be relocated we could go straight into the inlet here or we could rotate it 90 degrees and go into here or here so that we can try and get a nice perfect 45 degree angle between where the tube comes out of the pump and where this comes out we can use one of these fittings right here just to make our hard line lives a bit easier and over here this just isn't going to work because this is going to be like eight nine degrees off axis it's going to look really horrible so what we can do is we can take this one and go out 90 90 then we'll do just an l bend here and then we'll use one of these one of these fittings but a 90 degree right here and we'll go right over to here so that means this might actually move up here to give us a bit more space to work with and we can keep the angles all looking nice because anything other than a 45 or a 90 degree turn you have to do it with tubing and there's not enough room to put tubing here but that's it it didn't blow up and for once when i say that i mean it not like metaphorically or like no no it just literally did not blow up which is good oh we need a water bottle uh lttstore.com we just gotta go there and get one yeah um shipping might be an issue actually i have one of the uh water cooling loop fill bottles right here but i got a bigger one oh he's got a bigger it's not a competition colin that's what you think okay i just want to tip it a little yeah i mean if we tip it all the way it's everything will go flying yeah okay it will be yolt which is the past tense of yeet okay so let's be gentle this is not exactly the thickest wood okay okay hold on hold on we have the technique so nice why was it so high before because i wanted to work up here that's the whole idea okay please don't make it ah i'll take the funnel thank you no leaks so far colin even though we've filled it up to the point of one of the leaks before good that puts us at a liter and a half so far with more to go uh oh god okay yeah you gotta uh you gotta turn it on i gotta turn it on yeah for those of you just tuning into this project now we're using these two ac to dc 12 volt converters here the gray ones and then they're going into a dc to dc power supply from uh hd plex okay i'm gonna like have my hand on the yeah yeah good thought at least one pump's going yeah interesting come check this out andy we've got like little micro bubbles coming out here it just needs to get properly flooded is this one even spinning yeah yeah it is okay what's our theory here why why is this pump not our theory is we don't know let's try shaking it shaking the table okay going forward let's bring her down see what happens let's try power cycling again hello oh okay yeah that's way better oh yeah okay this does not bode well for filling it when everything is bolted down though uh hit it again okay oh yeah now we're getting some power i don't understand why it's not pulling from this inlet though there's bubbles moving here they are not coming out here well they might be getting stuck up here actually we're getting a little bit look micro bubbles yeah so it's ingesting them through the pump yeah they're getting shredded in here yeah okay so let's top it up a little so actually if you look at that we've yeah we've ditched a lot of bubbles yeah check this out hey andy we've got pretty good coolant velocity oh look at that yeah like we're moving now this wasn't as easy as i might have liked but it's a lot easier than it could have been can we call it a success great success let's see what's what's shake a lake in with these i'm glad we're doing this test fill before actually trying to okay these are definitely very bubble full so why don't we take our boxes again and let's tilt the table tilt the table this way and then we can fill this and see if that works thanks uh oh a little more is that okay uh yeah okay you're good we good now all the bubbles should either rise up to here or rise up through here oh there we go yeah okay so now that the pump is off the bubbles can come up through here so it should start sucking in here it's definitely still circulating so if there's circulation it has to it has to be pulling through here now does it look like it's pulling it doesn't look like it to me so it just looks like the flow rate is a lot faster than the little amount of bubbles i can see wait so that's it that's it yeah good news colin all of our leak points are not leaking yay so it turns out when you don't inflate it like a balloon it's watertight try anything once that's what i say how adventurous actually i usually say try anything twice so maybe one more time for that holy schnikeys i think it's working let's uh let's see what our temps are because i have no idea how good this block is even yeah temps 38 fun cpu right now okay that's perfectly reasonable for idling we are still spitting a lot of bubbles out like i don't even understand where they're coming from at this point we are going to have so much extra footage for a float plane exclusive in this one by the way make sure you subscribe to floatplane we've got behind the scenes meet the team cutting room floor stuff and we try to do early access oh you look at that 32 course not bad yeah yeah everything's looking okay everything's showing up now all we got to do is paint it hard line water cool it get cable mod cables so it's all custom and gorgeous rgb lighting and then i get a new desk then you get a new desk your first stand-up desk you're kind of finally getting with the times i know right yeah oh i'm so excited no one will ever whack their leg on the side of my desk again and it's a i think it is actually a size increase from your old desk it's like a foot deeper or something and uh you'll have more room for your monitors nice even though like if you put them here they'll be completely unsupported yeah minor details i think the motherboard can probably take the weight yeah totally just like you guys can take
