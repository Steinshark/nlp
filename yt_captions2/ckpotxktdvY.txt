fun fact squeal light is the most deployed and most used database there are over 1 trillion squeal light databases in active use how do you have a trillion how do you have a trillion databases what are you putting in there what the h what the hell are you putting in there what the what the hell are you putting in there that's more dbs than humans by a lot yeah i know like a factor of a thousand they liing it's just classic you know what the real thing i call [ __ ] okay okay okay one trillion pieces of data uh of data each in their own datab classic nsa has a a thousand per person okay now now you guys are starting to make me don't worry it's hip a compliant nsa nsa nsa hip a compliant while spying on you dude that's actually pretty funny it's actually a huge possibility that uh that nsa has one of those 1,000 let's see plus 1k uh people tried a billion row challenge yeah that's possible that is possible um sponsored by the nsa turo sponsored by the mena see it's maintained by three people isn't this crazy by the way this is squeal light so for those that don't know we're not talking about tso tso is lib lib squeal this is squeal light they don't allow outside contributions three people maintain lib squeal and nobody is allowed or not lib squeal uh squeal light and nobody's allowed to contribute is that not just like a little wild really well don't do that uh squeal light is christian software is it christian software uh they never disallow forks i know they don't allow they they don't you can't yeah i understand they don't disallow forks but they also don't allow outside contributions which seems kind of wild it's pretty much uh it's it's pretty much everywhere most widely used and deployed database squeal light is used in more than all other database engines combined billions and billions of copies of squeal light exist in the wild sque light can be found on every android device every ios and uh iphone mac windows 10 firefox chrome safari web browser instances of skype instan of itunes dropbox clients turbo tax and quick boot quickbooks php and python has it what wait just the language has it is squeal light just in php is this true huh yep as a standard lib yes that's crazy i didn't realize that yes it [ __ ] rocks all right cam hell yeah cam hell yeah countless millions of others applications actually i i'm very shocked that's in the language itself most television set set top cable boxes you know what that whole you know going back to this whole trillion uh this whole trillion all of a sudden becomes much more believable when you see this i mean i know there's not like a trillion devices but it's starting to sound a lot more uh you know reasonable yeah jinx jinx you have uh if you have 100 instance of a squal light on your machine might uh uh might be all right all right let's keep on going the developers hell yeah look at this guy this guy this guy's cheeking something okay this guy's looking very cheeky i don't know who this guy hey thank you dan kennedy dr richard hip and joe mistachkin mistachkin look at that dude this guy's been working on uh and the eagle the eagle scripting language man this guy was working on a language called the eagle scripting language that's the most american [ __ ] i've ever heard of my entire lifetime oh it is literally christian software all right nice nice all right uh there is a more a squeal light on your computer than netflix all right nice i'm squealing eagle eagle ass soft eagle ass programming language it's let's see inspired from this fun fact here's a fun fact almost all modern computer systems depend on a single time zone database that gets updated when local laws change it's maintained by two people does anybody ever think about the fact of how crazy this is like how much of our life how much of our life is spent like right on the edge of just collapse two people maintain this you know this is like dude it's just so fragile i'm edging daddy dude it is so fragile oh my goodness open source not open contribution i like this i so i like to actually use the term public source versus open source because i feel like that's a much clearer thing uh squeal light is open source meaning that you can make as many copies of it as you want and do whatever uh you want with those copies without limitation but squeal light is not open contribution in order to keep squeal light in the public domain and ensure that code does not become contaminated with proprietary or li content the project does not accept patches from people who have not submitted an affidavit uh dedicating their contributions into public domain all of the code in sque light is original having been uh written specifically for the use by squeal light no code has been copied from unknown sources on the internet it's on oh telegram whatsapp dang it's it's everywhere uh they have a christian code of conduct adopted by the rules of st benedict okay let's let's let's look at what what let's look at what old st benedict has to say about this all right uh let's see this document was originally called the code of contact and was created uh and created for the purpose of filling in a box on supplier registration form submitted to the squeal light developers from by some clients however we subsequently learned that code of conduct has a very specific and almost sacred meaning to some readers a meaning to which this document does not conform uh therefore this document was renamed code of ethics we are encouraging to do uh encouraged to do by rule 71 in particular there's also rules 28 oh my goodness this is truly it okay okay okay okay the founders of squeal light and all the current developers at the time when this document was composed have pledged to govern their interactions with each other with their clients and with the large larger squeal light community uh in accordance with their instruments of good works from chapter 4 the rule of st benedict damn damn this is they're go they're going deep on this the code of ethics has proven its metal in thousands of diverse communities for over 1500 years and has served as the baseline for many civil law codes since the time of charlamagne dude imagine having your code of ethics be like oh what's what's your code of ethics ah damn my mine's been around for 1500 years how long has your been around oh wow okay you made you made it last year okay cool hey cool cool dog dude this is crazy the rule of st benedict is no joke i actually don't know this rule i don't know any of this uh so i i want to see this first of all love the lord your god with your whole heart your whole soul and your whole strength okay straight from uh the most important command commment uh then love your neighbor as yourself okay that's part one of the most important commandment right do not murder okay yep do not commit adultery do not steal do not covet do not bear false witness honor all people do not do to another what you would not have done to yourself okay the inversion the inversion of the golden rule interesting deny oneself to follow christ chastise the body this is a good one by the way you should be waking up and chast you should chastise that body okay hey if you want if you want to become strong fit dude what is this this is this is the code of code of ethics for squeal light i did not know that it it had do not dude i by the way just tossing in the middle section of the ten commandments like that or the end section the person section of the ten commandments is incredible by the way this is this is this right here could be copy posted i think into every last code of conduct out there this is great this is great advice by the way uh bury the dead yeah i failed to see uh how clothing the naked helps you develop software but okay uh that is like a great they that how how is that not fantastic though uh do not become attached to pleasures love fasting interesting health advice and spiritual advice all at the same time uh relieve the poor clothe the naked how is this not great stuff how how is that not great okay so why would clothing the naked not be good well if you're if you're not helping the poor like real talk type one in the chat if you actually do some sort of real charity anyone i want to see it type one in the chat if you do a real form of charity yeah charity is good for the soul okay there's a lot of people that get nothing you know what i mean i like to see that by the way i like i like that i'm subscribed to you okay okay hey don't let's not call me a charity case people okay okay hey let's not do that let's i'm not ready for that okay okay i'm not ready for this uh visit the sick bury the dead and be uh help in times of trouble by the way if you can't if you can't figure out what these ones mean this just means like be good to people that don't have the opportunity to be good like imag what does bearing the dead mean right i mean these are people who died and just got left out to just rot right like what a horrible like how horrible does that have to be that not only did you die just nobody's even going to take the time to bury you like that's how you you just might as well get eaten by the dogs and and and the birds right like that's crazy yeah imagine you're just collateral damage happens a lot in war yeah well that's like the whole point is that you should care even for the people you kill you should attempt to bury them uh be a help in times of trouble counsel the sorrowing uh the sorrowing be a stranger to the world's ways prefer nothing more than the love of christ do not give uh way to anger do not nurse a grudge by the way i mean can't even it's crazy how good those things are do not entertain deceit in your heart do not give false peace do not give a false piece oh interesting uh do not forsake charity do not swear for fear of ing yourself yeah you should this is great advice by the way good advice right there what a what a good list there's this is crazy how much more wholesome is rule uh 34 do not be proud rule 34 i i think i prefer rule 34 on this list than the other list okay can we be can we be all real here i prefer the original rule 34 n i i i like this one this is pretty good it's pretty good this is the original rule 34 crazy anyways this is crazy this is this is squeal lights uh love your juniors great great look at these these are all just so fantastic wow all right well hey who would have guessed who would have guessed the code of conduct is uh that crazy okay anyways but this is where things get uh this is where things get weird but how do they cook there are over 600 lines of test code for every line of code in squeal light tests cover 100% of the branches in the library you missed code of ethics i thought he linked it right here um that's kind of crazy how do you feel about that well it tests regression it does look did you see this uh it has fuzz test boundary value test regression test tests that simulate operating operating system crashes power losses io errors and out of memory errors wow yeah but but but real talk would you not want a database that that really try like i mean that's why that tiger style one was was pretty exciting yeah the thing is is that it's not that i'm not opposed to really full testing right i just don't think it's something you should ever recommend because most people aren't writing squeal light you know what i mean can i take squeal light home yes you can it's 5:30 a.m. here bro you stream so early yeah god- driven development it's god- driven development tdd god's way yeah you know for something like squeal light i'm not opposed to it i'm do you know what i mean testing is false security it's not false security but it's it's it's it's not it's not it's not a it's not it's not affirmation for for bug free code the real takeaway here is there's only three developers who are one not two moral enough uh let's see two moral enough to be one with god where's the third or there's more takeaways i'm just shocked that this even exists right i'm shocked that anyone can do any of this your hair is gold yeah the sun got me a little bit uh what makes uh work uh what's not actually formal verification what makes testing work when it's not formal verification i don't know i donated to the primagen and his continuing struggles with typing uh type baiting and rust dude i dude i've been baiting too hard in rust thank you for this appreciate appreciate that benny thank you claiming with 100% code coverage at the code base is bug bug free is false security yeah that's fine yeah we all agree with that i just think it's more interesting that like it's funny that you know like for the most part if i hear of an organization that's building just say like some user application some user experience right and i see that they're doing 100% code coverage i think wow what an idiot but when i see something like uh squeal light being like we try to do every last possible way we you know we can possibly test and we have um 100% code coverage i feel better about that you know what i mean uh test for like every scenario is basically good do it after not before i don't know for whatever reason it feels better i'm not saying that it's it's great i for something like a database i'm happy that they at least run every line of code before releasing anything can we at least uh can we at least agree to that that if you were to use a database like here's the inverse if would you use a database with with 70% code coverage or at least yeah i'll go with that right you probably wouldn't and the thing is it's not because 100% is is like safety right what i think about is that when someone is that willing to test their product especially like this one which is a very well-known surface area right this is a very blackbox kind of testing it's ex yeah it's extremely business critical um since it's such a well-known expectation in squeal light to be able to do stuff to me it seems like when i see someone that wants 100% you know code coverage at least testing is a very big part of how they try to write it and i'm i'm i'm okay with that the amount of people that don't care about their app crashing because they will at least have their data still much uh so much trust is place plac in a db just working exactly dbs are just expected to work no one ever even questions the fact that dbs remember i just want to be real for just a quick second here remember databases are written by just as good as programmers as people in this chat [ __ ] you i'm just saying people in this chat are capable of writing databases talking about us i doubt that i don't doubt that like real talk i am not capable crimson mana i don't believe that even for a second um the thing is is that people have this this notion in their head that people who commit to databases operating systems and compilers are somehow these like gods of programming they're not they're like they're they're they're not they're just like everybody else tiger beetle testing sounds awesome tiger beetle testing was super awesome isn't it true no i know this is shocking to you but like i store all my data in memory i don't need dis storage well that's awesome i can write a db it won't be good but i can do it yeah i could write a db it won't be good i've committed to pg and i'm an idiot we literally have a pg committer right here people how do you like that right here either that man's april fooling us he's just a rando from the internet that wants street cred or he's telling the truth okay the liar lunatic or lord argument is happening right now april fools got you i committed to a mental hospital well nice you're clinically regarded what is pg postgres come on babies postgres you may have heard of it anyways um highly regarded well good post grace uh anyone can uh write a db but not everyone can commit to doing it yeah that's exactly it anyways i just want to let you guys know that because this is i mean for me this is actually pretty this is pretty interesting and i don't really know what to do with this fact because like typically i hate hate the idea of 100% code coverage but i don't know if i can hate i don't know if i can hate that i'm happy i'm happy that it exists true story i started to build a programming language over the weekend i got to say uh it's uh the most schizophrenic [ __ ] i've ever done barely got variable initialization working so far half the parser is just syntax testing this is insane why is their code stupid [ __ ] smelly nerds yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah are you following uh the thoron balls book thoron balls book i thought was really really good um i got look at this right here here the interpreter book.com use code the prim gen for 30% off i don't get any money from this this is just for free it's just right there for you i get z from that zer 0.0 it's a great book you can just have it okay this is going into a youtube video in fact you just go buy it thoron said he' buy me a beer right adless ad that's an adless ad it's just like hey if you want to be really good make a make a uh make a compiler it's a great honestly if you think that databases compilers and oss are all magical go write a compiler and then you realize okay it's not magical it's just a lot of work everything can be broken down into just a lot of work and a lot of reading that's it now making the first compiler that was crazy right that was crazy the first person to be like wait a second i'm going to tokenize this son of a [ __ ] and then i'm going to make a tree out of making this language into a into some like actions and then on the back end we're going to do semantic analysis right like that that person was a genius but that person then wrote a paper now everyone can just access you know access it so it's it's not the same anymore anyways hey this was kind of a charles babage charles babage mentioned dude by the way charles babbage the most i'm dude i'm i'm i'm tweeting this and this is this will probably get me canceled out of all things uh charles uh babbage is uh how do how do you say this how do you say someone that pro got the got one of the shortest ends of the stick in all of in all of computers and all of computing charles has a small stick he he's being let around by a uh is the most shafted uh uh let's see like uh what's what do we call this computation historical figure close enough i don't want to think about it anymore i i firmly believe this for those that don't know for those that don't know what what went on here for those that don't actually know what went on here um historical figure in computing oh i like that historical figure in computing for those that for those that don't know what this is uh charles babage created the difference in analytical machine a loveless helped program it a loveless has gotten like nobody nobody knows charles babage everybody remembers a which is crazy right which is crazy they're not remembered together they're not remembered even as aah loveless yeah it is crazy like she dude the guy literally one day was like i'm going to construct a machine that's the mechanical version of a computer literally builds a computer out of mechanical parts it's crazy right like dude charles babage man you know what i mean crazy just bought the books nice nice nice nice nice nice anyways it's crazy it's crazy all right hey the name the name wasn't it a theoretical uh she wrote the theoretical program she wrote i i can't remember if it was theoretical or literal i i know it executed things i assume that she wrote something that allowed it to actually execute or she set up the mechanical of it all anyways bye the name's by again
