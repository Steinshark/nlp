android happens the speedrun starts right now here we go i'm playing against emir i'm gonna play a carl con to start things off all right what's he gonna play let's pre-move this okay we have an exchange variation knight c6 is a safe pre-move that's the panov c4 is the pan off i like to defend this uh i'm gonna try to see how well the intermediate bots play openings so so far so good isolate upon i could have taken that but i'm pre-moving queen takes d4 is in fact a free pawn um i don't think that's a free bishop okay so the intermediate bonds lasted a decent amount of time before making some i'm doing a speed run what am i doing why did i spend like five seconds on that move um before making a terrible mistake but okay this is just the beginning uh you can't actually take that because if you do i'll pre-move taking your rook okay terrific uh now what now knight d5 let's hit this and this let's pre-move this move that's just a free queen we can probably pre-move taking the bishop i don't want to pre-move that because knight d1 is possible okay and now now we just gotta convert this position um i'm trying to open up my bishop to get to the king wonderful i'm gonna take this next and now i'm gonna move my queen out here i'm gonna bring my rook i'm gonna play queen b2 i'm gonna play rook d3 depending on if the king goes backwards or not and i it should be an end of a game here very quick rookie three looks like that's a pin that almost was stalemate that would have been really bad check check uh take and there we go okay clean that could have been a stalemate but there was there was b5 um now i'm gonna go to the next bot as i said i'm gonna be playing uh at each of these bots and i'm gonna be switching colors uh let's start off with a good old london against maxim from the czech republic i think that is okay that's just a free pawn uh and he's gonna lose the what okay i'm gonna take that this is also bad because it's getting in the way of his night um in the early stage intermediate players you all have to be familiar with like being able to take in the center a lot of you have blind spots for this type of stuff you just put center center pawns out and you kind of leave them there what how does a bot even mouse slip how does that even make sense if queen b2 queen d6 is fatal yeah uh and that now i i should just be winning i actually don't see how exactly so i i'm gonna castle and then i'm gonna play rook d1 i did that so i could be protecting my rook uh uh okay i'm setting up bishop f7 check i'm also threatening queen c8 um yeah so bishop f7 is a discovered attack on his queen all right i have to play some fancy tactics there but i'm not really proud of that but it is what it is is he gonna take all right let's let's offer a rook trade we're up a queen so now a rook trade is is obviously okay we're winning a rook by we're absolutely free is also nice uh knight d4 let's try to keep trading pieces and uh let's take that and i should just have a check now the king has to stop guarding the bishop and we will get in on the final rank i had rook d8 as well rook date was actually a faster checkmate uh check if this made if that i take and then the queen comes to help okay that wasn't a that wasn't that wasn't terrible but it it really was not a very good game right now we're playing we're playing hans wow there's a hans bot okay uh let's play a scandinavian this time i'm gonna try to mix things up i'm gonna try to play different openings i'm gonna try to what is that what is that what is this an intermediate this is what happens well i mean i'm just gonna hit the queen a couple of times not not physically and uh okay i mean i'm just gonna develop my pieces like a good intermediate player uh all right i'll give the bot this oh oops okay it doesn't even it doesn't even take um now i'm just gonna castle so i'm just a pawn up i have a safe king i have to be a little concerned about this uh a queen trade is not a good way to play a speed run but i'm gonna do it anyway uh because i would rather be a bit instructional now i'm trying to get in here i also had a discovered attack that i could have played let's see if the bot sees this hopefully it doesn't it didn't but i have check check and now both rooks are hanging and i will take this one first and will the bot save this one now i'm setting up a mate look at this the knight d3 is checkmate oh that's so brutal that is so brutal now i can say i smothermated hans in less than 20 moves and nobody will know what i'm talking about aziz all right the ratings are going up now i played d4 alaska let's play d4 again i'm not gonna play the london this time um all right let's play the queen's gambit with knight f3 uh this is the slav defense if aziz ever plays d5 there it is all right i'm playing uh i'm just gonna play very solid i'm gonna put the two knights this is not a very solid move i don't have to worry about double pawns it's much more important here that i'm getting development quickly this is a decent move yeah and and now i mean i i personally i just play queen c2 maybe maybe he's gonna play this which is funny now i'm actually threatening to take i also could have taken actually on the last move but now taking with the knight is even better uh because obviously i'm not pinned now i'm turning on h7 okay now the best thing to do here is just to take and come back and and then take a little bit more space and open up the dark squared bishop so now all i have to do here is get to the king which i will do by uh taking space i can kick the bishop out and um i mean i can play a move like bishop g5 for example there is f6 which is or he can defend his queen i okay uh yeah now now he but he said playing without my queen is fun too that's what he just said that's not i transfer my queen in front of my bishop and this is mate uh i have onpasson but i think he's gonna probably take with a knight yeah now the game has to go on so maybe instead of checkmate we will just take as many pieces away from aziz as possible like the bishop and then maybe here i have some some other way to win check i don't actually see it which is quite annoying you want to attack me aziz just said oh you want to attack me let's see how you defend i'm gonna take the rook he's gonna get my queen but i'm gonna get this back and uh yeah now i can probably very safely pre-move for a while uh check uh check double check put my rook there put my other rook here and that should be made oh my god he's so annoying he lasted quite a long time actually all right oh that was fun uh let's uh laura laura loves judith polgar something something is laura also an e4 player okay this time i'll play sicilian and i guess i'm gonna play the dr okay this might be a close sicilian g3 f4 okay i don't know what that is so this is though this i like i like to play the dragon style sicilian all right laura's not really playing an opening but you know okay she's wasting time too so i'm going to what laura laura's description said that she likes to she likes to read judith polgar's book if judith polgar saw this she might have a heart attack um multiple pieces being moved multiple times like these pieces back and forth it's just kind of letting me effortlessly improve my position uh that's just the free pawn when when your opponents play poorly in the opening what that i could take the okay i'm just i'm not gonna let you have any fun like the bot actually tried to do something there um when uh yeah when you uh when you do a lot of incorrect things in the opening stage of a game like oftentimes you set yourself up for failure in the long run i have to be a little careful here i don't want to hang on to the bottom i'm just going to castle actually in a shocking turn of events laura's like not totally losing here which is kind of annoying uh oh i did not expect that okay there's a knight there so i'm gonna play that first which traps the rook hopefully i mean the knight not the rook my rook attacks tonight okay now c4 i will take that knight e5 is next hitting both pawns i'm gonna take this one and then this one and now i think the easiest way to win is just to rotate the roar just win another rook but there is king e2 unfortunately oh my gosh oh my gosh all right now let's go to the back rank laura's cut off okay laura hung maiden one i did not expect the bot to hang mating one laura i ain't gonna lie that was not a good game that was not a good game do not tell judith polgar about that game all right let's play e4 i've played a couple of d4 games let's play e4 we have a sicilian uh let's play the allopin with c3 and d4 [music] yep okay wow real openings from sven from slovenia that's what i said advanced french now now we're in an advanced french defense this is one of the best openings you can play this is the amilla berry gambit uh you basically give away this with bishop b5 check uh he doesn't fall for it knight takes d4 this is crazy sven is playing real opening theory wow this is this is real theory this is incredible that g6 is not the most accurate move um yeah now now i'm i'm getting you know more development i'm giving up this pawn because it's a oh oh sven just said i can defend without my queen i don't think so it's fine i'm gonna trade the bishop now gotta get to the uh the bishop that's in front of the king like this and now let's give a check to prevent the king from escaping and now we're gonna play rook c once we're gonna bring all of our pieces to the party uh nope you are not blocking the bishop's path i could have also played knight g5 okay loses that pog let's bring in the rook let's bring in the uh okay sven had a good game until he didn't now we're gonna anchor in our rook and that's uh that's gg's in a moment wow all right sven played like magnus carlson and then he played like i don't know sven all right playing with black again are they all gonna play e4 okay terrific let's play a dutch defense d4 f5 wow that's a crazy gambit okay let's capture it does maria oh my god all right now the best way to respond is d5 to defend that pawn that's crazy who is this bot and why is this bot playing a ridiculously aggressive gambit all right knight f6 if take take i'm gonna develop in castle or the bots just gonna hang a knight pog all right outstanding uh knight c6 just get developed get as many pieces to the center as we can knight e5 hopefully knight e2 gets played that would be really nice of course gotta do it uh let's pin the knight to the queen i have a feeling uh there's queen a4 check by the way there there was uh something there that maria could have done oh that's a good move wow that is an excellent move uh but now i'm just gonna take the bishop castles let's bring the knight back i'm actually in a little bit of like trouble i mean i i'm not i'm not actually in any danger at all but uh it's a little bit precarious i'm gonna play bishop g7 and try to castle as fast as possible here we're up to 11 minutes and i don't know how many bots i've beaten but it's definitely slower than the intermediate one hope you're all doing great though uh now there's going to be a rook trade or they're gonna just do this and then i can take bishop and now i have a check gotta look for ways to activate the queen i don't want to pre-move this in case this move is played and now it should be smooth sailing i'm going to play check and one of these moves is mate check and this is mate yes all right that was that was a dutch it was an interesting gambit um but uh all right now i'm gonna play white against elena can you play better oh i'm playing white right that means i move i move first sicilian was last time all right let's play vienna let's see how the bot plays against the vienna we're gonna get a gambit are we playing symmetrical maybe we're gonna get a copycat variation okay we got a passive vienna like a king's indian vienna thing i don't know what this is but i imagine bishop g4 is coming or that that i have taken there probably let's take now take take uh okay unless i'm on some sort of drugs i'm pretty sure that is a free pawn we can take on e6 now then i should probably go back and uh okay we're just up a pond and we have a safer king so let's conclude our development maybe elena's gonna castle this way no so with the king in the center we should try to open things up a little bit okay now elena castles which is definitely a little bit more annoying now this is going to be a longer game i'm still going to try to march down the center but i am not threatening to take although let's just say we take and we lose our queen uh we are still doing pretty pretty well i would i would say i think we have we have a rook and a knight for a queen here uh and i have a very strong setter also knight t5 there was was a good move if takes i take the queen um oh that's that's a good defense man these bots are are not just crumbling anymore trying to get in here and take on g5 okay now connected past pawns and this is hanging yeah this should be smooth sailing pawns are just too strong here f7 i'm a square away from queening uh now i am queening and that's mate just as long as i don't get mated elena typed did i miss something yes indeed elena yes you definitely did uh wilson says how is my end game well we're about to find out f4 wow okay well when in doubt i guess just play toward the center i don't know how to play the birds opening so we're gonna play a reverse london style uh e6 that was free maybe okay normal stuff what okay protect my pawn i don't know what's good it's a weird opening from uh okay let's just kick the queen out i don't maybe this all right rock solid and you can't take anything bozo now i'm trying to get rid of your knight ween d4 wow okay that's still free by the way well now now it's my turn to take over this game okay i'm gonna take him and now i'm upon him and i think i think mr wilson here really did not do a good service to his position what what that's just a free rook why did you do that now i have queen h4 what i think wilson's just programmed to lose somehow uh i have double check and discovered uh discover oh he stopped it kind of okay i'm gonna still try to do it though okay yeah i'm just i'm just bulldozing here uh check uh okay i'm gonna do this simply i'm gonna take the queen i'm gonna play queen f2 that's mate that's mate stopped both of them because he's annoying check and there we go the king has no escape all right i mean when in doubt when they play those like ridiculous looking openings just take the center you know just take the center all right i'm gonna play e4 once again c5 okay this time let's play an open sicilian knight f3 and pawn to d4 uh i don't know what uh what jade is gonna play jade is gonna play a night orf all right one of the best ways to play against the neither of us to play bishop e3 f3 queen d2 and long castle this is a very principled way to play against the night or like this oh oh and uh you're gonna get into a very sharp complicated battle where black has the c file you have attacking possibilities i'm gonna go here i mean my opponent could do this but king b1 is always useful and next we'll play for yeah we're gonna play for the the d5 square in the center is very important in the night orf uh is that just the free pawn i think it might be there might be a five but i'm just gonna put my knight back a4 put my knight back on c1 and i'm just the pawn up now and that's actually also hanging not anymore that's scary but i think knight d3 is completely fine uh uh let's just throw out a warning shot over here that we mean business and it's okay but this is very this is very nice for me you see this attack kind of got extinguished and uh now now i'm i'm pretty safe and the thing is that black is not safe uh black uh black i think is in some trouble i think i just have to not blunder anything i don't think i am everything looks quite safe over here okay there is no threat to this move it's just getting closer to my position uh what i do have to be a little careful okay g takes f7 this is very very dangerous now wow queen g6 is looking mighty nice ah can i sack my rook against the bot to win the game is that is that a thing am i crazy i think i am crazy by the way i don't think this works at all oh my goodness i don't know why i did this bishop h6 is a winning threat though ah i'm gonna take i should not have done this i got way too cocky oh my goodness i might get mated i i really hope not oh check you can't take because of this i had queen h8 but i'm doing it this way i'm gonna take the rook with check i'm gonna win all the pieces i think i think i'm gonna win all the pieces oh my gosh do i have to get back do i have to get back to stop getting mated this is insane whoa all right my friends i don't like what i've done here wait am i even winning this is nuts who is this bot oh they hung their queen okay well that that was that was terrifying i mean i did not like that at all that was that was very uncomfortable that what that botches did check all right now i'm gonna have to win but i mean my friends that was uh that was terrifying this is mate check check check check check oh all right let's push the pawn that was actually checkmate in one move oh right not one oh god that was stressful it's nelson but let's go it's nelson we're gonna beat the we're gonna beat the legendary nelson let's play the karo khan he's gonna play the stupid queen h5 thing that he does every game but this just doesn't work yeah cara was probably the best way to beat nelson because he's gonna like play queen out and bishop out and then he's just gonna lose he doesn't actually know how to play chess we attack his queen uh we develop and uh we're just much better with black because he only moves his queen nelson is actually not that terrible um he he will let yes see i mean he castles i guess i have bishop g4 i actually really hope he castles i'm gonna try to instigate here on his uh a4 a3 just trying to break up his structure make him uncomfortable a3 is a nice move uh uh hey what is he doing he can't play rook b1 what you just let me promote to a queen with check what what is this he just gave me all his pieces and i'm gonna win his other queen what what is the what is happening right now i have two queens how did how did nelson bot the god of queens lose two queens to me insanity that was a terrible game god nelson is the worst intermediate bot you just have to get past this nonsense all right d4 bishop g5 right i'm playing a trumpowski uh i like to do this and then play knight c3 this is called the vaganyang gambit you give up the pawn on b2 you bring the bishop back and then you take a big healthy center like this so it looks like veen from vietnam uh clearly has some idea uh of how to play this position i'm gonna do this every time a6 happens to play b5 you play a4 uh this is a move but it's i mean it shouldn't be be scary anytime that happens i i really like to force this trade okay well clearly the uh the bot is unimpressed i'm gonna i'm gonna cover the dark squares here a little bit and then i'm gonna go for this pawn on c4 because i can okay and then maybe some something like this all right i i don't know what this is i'm just i'm trying to play principal chess okay principal chess means that when you have a big lead in development like this you you really can can go start uh creating some serious problems for your opponent open king in the center probably some tactics here as well let's play knight b5 and just get rid of the bishop completely uh bishop d4 and i mean i'm slaughtering the king in a moment that's free also and the rook is trapped actually he takes but i just can take back and nothing has improved here it's probably the best move takes between h5 yep and um we can bring the rook even back around it's not the best move probably but does the job uh knight takes d6 pin the bishop has been to the bishop f5 hits the i hung my knight oh punished immediately 24 check hangs a queen that would be quite nice wow the bot is suddenly playing very sharp okay but i have bishop h7 and queen g8 yeah that was my first blunder of the video that's very funny uh i was playing way too quickly there was not respecting uh the counter play shaq to remove the king's defense of the bishop uh is the is the bot gonna find bishop here oh my god i hate when the bot just like randomly starts playing very well uh but uh okay i take the queen okay the easiest way to win is to simplify this play like bishop d3 and just push the pawns just push the buttons and uh the bot is defending but uh f7 f8 takes hopefully knight c3 in check yes i could have taken there but remember bots don't resign so you you do have to deliver a checkmate okay don't stalemate no stalemate or stalemate no stalemate no stalemate no stalemate no stalemate no stalemate king f2 is possible uh king g3 is possible that's it those are the two squares now so let's just pre-move the whole game make sure we don't stalemate and that's checkmate on g2 nice all right we're down to our final three i was white that game so let's play let's try to let's try to end this video what is that garbage why did he just play that what is this what is this okay if you don't know what to do just play for the center okay i'm gonna damage his structure oh no my knight oh no my night oh oh what was that i beat the intermediate bot in seven moves bro what was loves to have fun and surprise his opponents pay close attention what was that i i should have played e4 but it's okay um we can play another trimpowski no problem uh knight d2 and i'm gonna try to play for e4 this is ali all right i want to play c3 and then i want to play e4 okay i can no longer play e4 fine i'm gonna do something else i'm gonna play a stonewall structure i'm gonna get rid of my dark squared bishop like this and then i'm gonna take on f6 when i'm attacked and what this allows me to do is to plant my knight very strongly in the center of the board like this and i'm not even gonna castle i'm gonna show you all how to play a position where your opponent was the one that castled first and uh you can create some very powerful attacks like i'm gonna sacrifice i'm just gonna sack and uh yeah this this checkmate is now almost unstoppable um i have a couple of ways here i can probably just play rook h3 look at this this is crazy i don't i don't have to even acknowledge this pawn uh takes takes and uh this is just gg's uh rook g oh takes its mate oh my goodness rook g5 you have to sack the queen oh or that but i guess f5 on passion uh check check mate pre-move mate oh all right we're gonna definitely oh wait no we're not we might not end this video in 30 minutes because there was an ad read i forgot about the ad read uh cairo we gotta we gotta end the video smacking the intermediate bombs with our favorite opening takes takes let's play the tarta tower bishop d6 castles rookie eight is one of the most solid openings knight d7 knight f8 we're gonna wrap around we're gonna wait to see where our opponent is going oh this is gonna be a long game my friends bishop g4 maybe i like to induce this move unfortunately that move was not induced we induced a different move entirely uh bishop here maybe we'll get a pawn cube no pawn cube very annoying i don't think we're gonna beat 30 minutes i'm gonna try my best but unfortunately strong anchor but knight g3 is a good move yeah these intermediate bots like at 1400 well the last one was a i mean that was an abomination but uh for the most part they they tend to not do egregiously stupid stuff um i guess david was an exception i have pressure on everything it's gonna take me a second to calculate though oh my gosh i'm gonna try to take control of the light squares completely here bishop f8 you can't play knight c3 because i take them i'm trying to wrap around to that pawn that's what i want yeah i seem to have won the battle for this pawn takes gotta have something i gotta have something let's give a check and drop the knight back to c7 like this oh my god is he gonna find queen c3 check but the pawn is still a goner i'm definitely gonna win the pawn yeah and now i'm hitting everything i can take this two pawns up clean i don't think we're gonna be 30 minutes though ah that was not free oh i have 91 91 check is huge huge huge i'm picking that up and i'm gonna pick this up and maybe i can just freeze this king on the edge of the board here like this and maybe i can i can mate quickly ah but no promises f6 g5 this kind of a thing nope you can't have that bozo rook f2 is coming rook f2 knight's gotta go somewhere oh my goodness this is insanity this is insanity i have to i'm mating i mean it's mate oh my god he has no moves he has literally no moves he's sacrificing his pieces because he has no moves look at this this is this is madness this is madness he's out of moves check rook g4 and now i'm gonna go rook here and deliver this fatal blow oh my goodness he's not letting me check b4 king g4 b3 b2 b1 checkmate it wasn't 30 minutes it was close but i managed to beat all of the bots in 28 minutes and 29 seconds i guess it was under 30 minutes the entire video wasn't uh what was uh was over 30 but uh the speed run itself was 28 minutes and a half um not bad not bad i managed to beat uh 15 bots 15 intermediate bots in 28 minutes not too shabby i hope you enjoyed this video let me know in the comments if you want me to to do the advanced bot speed run that one's gonna be a bit tougher uh because i'm not even sure i can beat the bots at the end there's also more advanced bots uh which is kind of annoying um but uh you know we'll uh we'll see maybe i'll be able to beat them too quickly or not quickly um in any case i hope you enjoyed the video now get out of here
