woohoo in today's video i'm going to be breaking down this really fun spiderman swing landing effect before we get into it consider subscribing if you like this kind of content and if you're interested the project files from this video are available on my patreon to download so to start off with this is the nuke script for the video as you can see it's nothing super complicated this bit down here is the cg of me which looks like this and then the top bit is all the invisible 2d cleanup that i did if you know much about visual effects how i did this is probably fairly self-explanatory but essentially there's two parts to the effect this is the raw footage so i'm currently looking at the plate at the top of the script and if i scroll through you can see i'm actually in the footage the whole time my friend deck was helping me film this and essentially i was just crouched down out of frame here and then we did a few takes where as the camera panned down i did a jump and landed and then eventually we just picked the one that worked best so the idea is that when i get to about here just before i land there's going to be a takeover where it cuts back to the real version of me and then before this is the digi double that's swinging up here so the first thing to do was actually remove the real version of me from in the shot just for those few frames here where i should actually still be in the air it's really simple to do that i just took a frame later on in the shot once i'd walked out of frame so about here i took a freeze frame of this and then masked out the section where i'm going to be and i needed to cover it up and then from here i did a quick 3d camera track i'm not going to go over how to do that in this video but if you want to know i have a video on 3d camera tracking in nuke that you can check out from the card in the top corner i did a really quick bit of roto around me while i'm still in the shot so i wasn't confusing the camera track with the movement and then i just tracked the points set the ground plane and added some basic geo for where the floor was and where the crane was in 3d space once i had a card set up on the floor for the ground plane i then duplicated it and rotated at 90degrees this bit of goo is going to be for the fence that's behind me and then when i combine these two in a scene it gives me this and then from there i just projected this clean frame onto those two bits of geo i'm using a frame hold underneath the project 3d node which holds the camera on that frame and then the scan line render is bypassing that frame hold and going back up to the original camera so it's filming that projection for the whole shot i turned on motion blur in the scan like my render as you can see here so it was mimicking the motion blur of the shot as well so the patch bedded in better and then because rendering 3d motion blur is quite heavy i just did a pre-comp of this patch on its own so it's much lighter to work with so now i have this moving patch in 3d space i can then just merge this over my background and remove myself from the shot when i don't want to be there and then i've got some key frames here where at the point where i want to reappear the patch turns off and it reveals the liveaction version of me again so i play that on the rum you can see it's fairly straightforward we've got the clean shot and then at the right point i just pop back in and then it cuts to basically just the original footage once all that was done i took the geometry that i set up for the scene and exported this to blender so it's all plugged into a scene node here as you can see and then i'm using a right geo and exporting this to blender as nmic and then from here we can hop into blender this is what the blender scene looks like we've got the animated camera track down here the 3d model of me and then some animation it's quite motion blurred so you can't see it massively in the final render but there is a web here and then there's a little bit of a cloth sim on it at the end of the shot just as i let go of it the digid double was probably the most timec consuming part of this process this 3d model was made using the revo point range 2 3d scanner that i showcased in my last video so to make this work it was pretty simple my friend deck who helped me film the live action plate also came around and did the 3d scan with me so i stood in a kind of a pose in my living room and then he moved around me with a 3d scanner until we captured my full body i then ran the scan through their software called revo scan which is for processing the models once they come out of the scanner in here you can do things like choosing the mesh resolution removing any overlapping geometry or floating points and then you can bake out the final model with your textures to use in another software like blender so i then bought the obj into blender and used the riger fight add-on to create this nice ik rig for the mesh and then it was ready for animation which is probably the second most time consuming part of this shot i've said it before in multiple videos but i'm not an animator at all and animation really isn't my strong point so i watch quite a lot of reference of gymnastics videos of people doing back flips to get the correct movement for the start of this bit my main process was essentially just to animate the root bone so as you can see there's not many key frames on this i just went through and blocked out all the main poses before i started animating any of the other bones and then i would go through and kind of space out the key frames appropriately so that there wasn't any stop starting motion in the animation and then once that started to feel smooth i started to animate things like the arms and legs so this is all of those key frames as you can see there's quite a few more of these once i'd finished blocking out all the main poses and got the animation feeling fairly smooth i then went in and started animating more minute things like where the feet were pointing where the eyes were looking and that kind of stuff as well so eventually this is the result if i look at it through the camera you can see that's working pretty nicely i had to do quite a bit of back and forth about how much speed i should have coming into the landing because i didn't want it to feel like i was decelerating as it cut to the live action what i ended up doing which worked pretty well is i went to the frame where it was actually cutting back to me so at this point it's the liveaction version but i lined up the 3d scan perfectly with my body on this frame and then just allowed the interpolation between the key frames before to kind of finish off that animation between those two points so the last one i had was set about here and then the digid double just kind of automatically animates into the correct position there was quite a bit of taking these key frames and sliding them back and forth to get the speed correct but after a bit of fiddling it just kind of felt right the web itself is also pretty simple it's just a string of vertices like this that have a skin modifier on them to give them some thickness as you can see here then i went into edit mode and selected the end verticy for each and pressed crl h and then did hook to new object which creates these empties and then from here you can animate the empties to create the web animation so this one here is parented to the 3d model's hand so i move this you can see that the empty sticks to it that's just done using a child off constraint so it's added onto the empty and then you can select the armature and the specific bone and then the empty will actually stick to the armature and then this one here is just animated by hand for a few frames to shoot out from the hand and then go to the crane like so i've key framed their visibility to turn off before they're needed so as you can see here they disappear suddenly and then when it gets to this point where i let go i just did a simple cloth animation on the web so as it's let go it actually kind of springs backwards that was just done by adding a cloth simulation as you can see here i created a vertex group for the bit that would be stuck on the crane which is this verticy here at the top and assigned that to the vertex group just called pinning and then under the shape settings i just key framed the shrinking factor to go from 1 to.5 as you can see here so that means the web is nice and tight here and then as it key frames down to 0.5 it kind of springs where were we that was pretty rude wasn't it but yeah as i was saying the rope simulation kind of kicks in it springs backwards and goes quite loose as you can see here obviously the lighting had to match pretty well on the cg double so that it would cut nice and seamlessly with me so to get that working accurately i took an hdri where we were filming so you can see this is the environment behind me this is the actual same location and it's got all the dynamic range i need to change the lighting to be exactly the right intensity so then once i finished the animation on the 3d double and the web i rendered it out of blender and it was just time to do a bit of compositing magic to really b it into the shot so as you can see here we've got some color corrects and stuff going on a little bit of defocusing to match the plate and then just a little bit of light wrap and things here so let's go through those one by one the first couple of nodes here are just an exposure and a grade node and they're just matching the intensity of the plate a little bit so maybe if i turn all of this stuff off actually this is what the render looks like fresh out of blender so this first exposure in grade is just making me a little bit brighter i did the proper technique of using a color chart and everything so the hdri was properly calibrated to be the right intensity but when i comped it over it just felt like the renders were still a little bit dark so i just boosted the exposure slightly as you can see these next few grades are actually animated and as you can see here they're named face shoes and jumper and what these are doing is when i come into land i was trying to match my skin tones on the 3d double to be exactly the same as the real version of me so that when it cuts it's even more forgiving so if i turn these off you can see that my jumper was a bit bright my face felt a little bit pale and this right shoe was quite bright when it cuts to the next frame where it's the real one of me so essentially i just went through one by one and just drew some rotor shapes for my face made my skin tones a bit darker and warmer and then i graded down this shoe slightly on the right hand side and then here i've just got a soft mask on my jumper and i'm just using that to tame those highlights a little bit as well and those three grade nodes in conjunction are just helping with that jump cut a little bit and they're kind of animated to turn off so so by about here they're completely off just so i didn't have to do the roto for the whole shot it's all quite motion blurred and far away here so it doesn't matter anyway i've also got a node that's changing the black point here if i go back to the beginning you can kind of see if i crank the viewport gain all the way up the black point on the cg in my jeans and stuff as you can see is quite a lot darker than the rest of the shot so that's just lifting the black point up to be the correct level i talked about this in a few videos now but i'll just show it again cuz it's very quick my technique for getting the black point right on cg is i will gain the viewport all the way up as i've done here let's just disable this one and do this again then i will pick the black point and i will choose something in the shot that's really dark so probably something like underneath this ledge here so as you can see at the moment that's actually making the cg darker but then if i turn on reverse it will do the inverse of that black point operation and now as you can see the black point on the 3d double of me matches into the shot much better so that's pretty much all the color correction stuff i added a very subtle defocus just to make the cg lose a little bit of that pin sharpness that comes out of cg renders not even sure how much you'll see that with youtube compression but it's just softening everything a tiny bit then then i'm applying the lens distortion setup here when i did the camera track up here i used an st map to actually undistort the footage so you can see that this plate is undistorted i'm very fortunate that working at vfx studio i have access to lens grids so i shot lens grids for all the focal lengths that i use for all of my visual effect shots and then i created st maps for all of them as well so like i said i tracked the unded plate and then i rendered the cg with a bit of overscan as you can see here and then i'm just reapplying that lens distortion onto the shot afterwards so the cg matches the plate perfectly and then finally got a little bit of light wrap and the roto of the crane going on top here so i turn this on this is without it and then this is with the light wrap i tend to do two different types of light wrap i do a really sharp one like this and then a much softer one like this where i turn up the diffusion i just tend to find that one on its own looks a bit fake and never really gets the effect properly so both of them in conjunction tend to do a better job and on each of these the mix is turned down quite low so you never want to merge it over fully otherwise it goes a bit nuts like that but it's just mixed in to be quite subtle especially as the cg is on such a bright background they should be quite a lot of light wrap and then finally i've just got some roto here of the crane obviously the cg has kind of sat behind it here so roto the crane back on top nothing special here i did a two-point track on the crane and stabilized it and then drew some rotor shapes so i didn't have to animate it frame by frame so they just tracked on and as you can see the crane is nicely rotated for the whole shot and that's all it really took to put this together overall from start to finish this probably took me about 2 days of work stretched across a week cuz i was just doing a few hours in my evenings it's a pretty fun effect in this case i'm using it for a spider-man swing but you can use this for any kind of superhero landing really the trick is just getting a good digi double and then doing a convincing takeover at the cut point here where the jump cut happens so there we go that's the end of the tutorial i hope you enjoyed and you found it useful again if you're interested the project files for this will be available on my patreon as well as the files from all my other videos thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next video
