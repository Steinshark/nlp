ladies and gentlemen you play chess i play chess if you don't play chess well thank you for clicking on this video anyway hopefully after that we convince you to play chess a major milestone for every single chess player is not grand master it's not world champion it's four digit elo many of you have gotten there and many of you have not did you remember how you felt do you remember where you were it's an incredible sense of self you feel pride you feel encouragement well not everybody gets there and if you haven't gotten there you know the night is dark as just before the dawn or some other movie quote i heard in a batman movie but in this video i'm going to spend the day at the 1000 elo on chess.com and we're gonna really see how good those players are i've already made two other videos 100 and 500 and i can continue doing this do let me know in the comments if you'd like me to before we jump into the games today i'd like to thank the sponsor of today's video thanks sponsored gotham so my username is 1000 elo matog which is gotham backwards and we're gonna see how good people are at discovering my identity obviously every player is refunded you shouldn't smurf uh chess.com gave me the permission to do this and then is giving all the rating points back we're playing in 9.99 so i'm gonna play on to e4 uh and uh and then we're gonna see right okay they play e6 the french defense and we will be asking every single player if they watch gotham chess uh or not so uh i'm i'm a thousand which means i have you know good uh understanding of center putting pawns in the center i'm moving two nights out pawn to d4 very nice move uh and i play knight to e2 i obviously can't capture will my opponent okay a little bit too fast and a little bit too careless like it you you only made pawn moves did this is just free there's that should not be getting blundered this early uh and i and i will take that too because i'm because i am up material uh my opponent's very fast though every move is play is being played very quickly so at least their speed is good uh i'm gonna move my knight so i can finish my development in castling but we do see even 1000s uh make mistakes i'm gonna ask do you watch gotham chess uh i ask everybody this and normally i get ignored um i'm gonna give them 10 seconds to respond to this inquiry it's a very important inquiry and perhaps they they think i'm not gonna make a move until 10 seconds have gone i haven't gotten a response okay we're gonna pin the night now of course they should probably attack my bishop that's not a bad move um going to d2 this is a good idea now i should be pushing my pawns on the same side to that's a nice move will my opponent see the the trapped bishop pawn to g5 they do now the best thing for me to do is to take it's actually very unlucky because after this it's a fork that wasn't my idea uh but uh but i'll take it okay i'm gonna repeat moves do they see the backwards night move to defend themselves they do very nice very nice and what if i threaten a checkmate that's not actually a checkmate but will they get scared will they play a rook move oh look at that oh my goodness that was that's incredible will they sacrifice the bishop to open up my king no way right will the 1000 do that that's a crazy move i mean it's much more natural to go rook g8 or something or panger queen oh on the oh my god that's incredible do they wow wow amazing stuff pawn to f4 now please do not do this check here here looks like mate but a backwards night move defense f4 is a good move it's a very nice move by me and if the bishop goes here they might actually hang their own mate but rook to g8 check is lethal or that that that's also not a bad move all right i'm gonna play king h1 the bishop is hanging but that bishop is hanging two it's a fight to the death i mean this 1000 is good i mean whoa oh my goodness um will they come back if i take the bishop you think you think they're gonna find queen h3 let's see and i hung my queen oh they took my queen oh they didn't see the mate but they took my queen well done wow this is a strong 1000 damn okay man yo yo you got y'all got some work to do to get to a thousand i'm telling you i mean my goodness what a strong player one thousand blitz what's the uh what's the join a couple four or five months ago wow it's amazing stuff um okay now my opponent should play like yeah that's not a bad move um i'm gonna block this will they play knight g5 or rook g5 they should trade pieces now it's a lot easier to win this if you're uh if you're if you're up a lot of material by trading pieces like rook yeah every move they're playing is good that's incredible i'm gonna take you could double uh rook takes and then queen to h3 picks up the bishop as well so you could sack the rook but then get the bishop and that's a nice simplification you could also double just don't panic that's the thing like you you could panic here and why he's taking a lot of time now black black was up about a minute okay that's not a bad move rook g1 is threatened uh i'm i'm doing my best but i don't know how much longer i can survive will they find rook to g1 that's just probably lights out for me nice i play king h2 they could take i couldn't take because it was made well they just okay and now that do they see mate oh my goodness that was an incredible game wow i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna game review that i feel like that person played well above the thousands threshold okay they got a 56 accuracy but they got a brilliant move what was the brilliant move bishop takes h3 is a brilliant move amazing yes trouble um i should have played a bit more aggressively and and obviously i should have noticed the bishop hanging but that was a that was a really really good demonstration of ability by my opponent my goodness that was really nice um and i always like to play a rapid game as well that that that was a very well conducted attack uh they didn't actually answer my question though um don't play a play a rapid game as well see how the 1000s are i'm gonna play a london this time everybody be playing in london it's a 981 rated player okay another e6 let's go for a london and now let's ask the question early do you watch gotham chess okay let's let them make a move first maybe they're gonna write to me first they gave me a check not a good move seems like this opponent doesn't have a great sense of the opening because i can just block uh and now as i play that move i'm gonna i'm gonna ask them a question i'm gonna do my say i'm gonna sit 10 15 seconds let them get their thoughts hmm do you watch gotham chess and i'm letting them think there's a lot of time so i'll let them think about it for for a while uh shab is that shahab shahab eight okay shahabad is a bit shy so we're just gonna play our london and this is no good i mean it's ah this is a person that likes to bring their queen out well we're gonna show how to punish this against the london i'm gonna go here and i'm gonna trap the queen hopefully unless they play very aggressively but this is a very yeah this is this is bad so that last 1000 was unbelievable but that was also blitz this just traps the queen queen's got no way out and everything is oh h6 wow uh i can still play g4 but well well spotted well spotted nice but again you can't play like this the london is way too solid i have no weaknesses there's only so much uh unprincipled chess you can play for instance if black plays g5 i just go here and i win the rook and it's just a result of not great opening play um okay that's not bad i can castle i can play knight to e4 i can also chase this bishop all castle i i feel like my opponent's gonna yeah okay they're just playing how they want to play knight to e4 is not a great move because the queen just runs and my knight is in the way of my pawns since i'm castled and i have better central development i should be trying to expand with as many pawns as possible for instance b4 c4 and really my e-pawn but i'm a thousand so i got in the way of my own pawn there uh and now maybe my opponent can fight back a little bit but this is a very bad position for black because you just haven't developed the knights and see now you're trying to fight but i i this is a counting exercise right i have three so i'm gonna win that trade and you're not doing yourself any favors right oh my goodness now i'm up two pawns and your rook is hanging right now my bishop is hanging i have like various tricks but i'm just going to come back and this is just this is this is this is very very chaotic play here from the 980. uh and this is why your knights have to come out first your queen shouldn't be coming out early you'll just get yourself into a bunch of trouble i'm still gonna maybe give my opponent the opportunity to fight back well spotted by the way nice right very well spotted uh but now i have a tactic which is a discovered attack because of my bishop so i'm gonna play knight to d6 check and that's just that that that's a clean tactic now a lot of you here would see this and you would immediately start looking over here but you should always look for checks first and that's why you look for checks because now we emerge up material and checks captures attacks in the middle of a game black just played this move you see that your bishop is targeted but also you can capture but then this so what do you do do you move your bishop back to safety that's the wrong thinking process step one do you have any checks no do you have any captures step two do you have any captures do you have any attacks captures of maximum value yes i can actually take this queen do you see where we're going with this the queen is actually defending both knights that's why you have to look you never know the bishop is gonna hit the knight but this is so we take the queen and now a bonus question when black takes which knight do we take which knight is better to capture this one because if you take this one they go here so you take this one and you win a full night with nothing else you have to calculate in chess based on your moves and what your opponent also wants okay i also think black is going to go here and forget about this bishop at some point i'm gonna go here will black play this read their mind i know how 1 000 rated players think and they make moves and they don't think for the opponent backwards bishop move now if i beat this individual their rating will get refunded obviously uh but i am just showing you and please don't go here oh they just resign okay i thought they were gonna play this move and then blunder another backwards bishop move so my opponent only ran into trouble here and this is very common at the thousand level freestyling in the opening a lot of you probably face people on chess.com at the 1000 level 1100 level that you know you study all these lines and then they play this and this is not in any opening course right you bought a 50 opening course and this is not covered right but all i did is i as i stuck to the principles and then when you have a good castle position with good central presence your position is equipped for the next stage of the game which is advancing nobody wins a chess game by sitting back unless your opponent loses all their pieces you have to advance you have to do it in a way that's coordinated knight e4 was not an accurate move you'll notice my advantage drops by an entire point because my knight is in the way of my pieces but after i did this right and i started expanding black thought back and now it's from 0.9 to 2.2 2.3 because it's 11 moves into the game and black hasn't developed the knight that's just not normal like the knights and the central pawns have to go first right so that first game is a huge range the the 1000 we just played played an incredible game this 1000 because they got off to a really bad start in the opening never got back into the game they just never got back into the game it happens right and they're accuracy probably suffered as well like they're not doing themselves any favors okay granted i'm obviously a higher rating than a thousand but right they like they made they made several blunders even as early as move five okay because they were just allowing me to play my game uh let's play another uh rapid game and then um okay we're white again i i would really like to get a game with black like maybe can i refresh can i get a game with black is that a thing can i i hope there's not like a setting where i'm just gonna play okay this person aborted two uh 10 minute game please there we go oh rubiks 1025 still over two on the gotham responses um let's play a what what to be i'm going to play a karo khan defense okay what's my opponent gonna do all right advanced variation right now your knowledge at the 1000 level just has to be okay e5 c5 right e5 c5 normal knight f3 all right now we're gonna go here we're gonna pin we know a little bit of the opening we don't know a huge amount of the opening let's say hi do you watch gotham chess third attempt world for two we've been ghosted twice i think this person might answer they they're they they're they're from the uk they're very nice you know uk folks always apologizing for stuff let's play bishop g4 so we got two pins going on here it's a very common for one thousands to play like this already this person has a much better opening foundation uh no answer by the way no answer maybe they're thinking of an answer we can take uh some of you may be wondering if queen a5 is winning a bishop it's not because the knight blocks so we took this and we'd like to take this as well i think my opponent might be realizing right but let's just say at the 1000 we don't we don't fully realize that we can win this pawn we're just playing principal chess in the opening that's a weird move a couple of things number one you really should not be making multiple moves in the opening with a piece unless you have a good reason there is no good reason for the move bishop a4 just not a good move okay number two going backwards making retreating moves eight times nine times out of ten not good at this level just not good you probably have a better move going forward so two little things i'd just like to address at the 1000 level um i'm still not gonna find this move because i'm a thousand i'm playing knight e7 because i'm gonna get my knight out here and then i want to castle and that's you know if i put my bishop there then i would have been blocking my knight so i'm gonna put my knight out i'm pretty sure i'm following the philosophy of my opening and i know how to play against these two pawns night here night here with my knight keeping an eye on them this is not a good move but you know i didn't take full advantage of it of it just yet castles i still can't take by the way and a major blind spot for a lot of 1000 rated players is central pawn interactions so let's see if my opponent realizes that i'm even attacking this pawn they might they might go oh wow i should take and that's gonna help me a little bit right i'm gonna get my bishop out so let's see opponent's taking a little while here uh and this just sort of shows you the effect like how strong the karo khan is at this level people with white don't know how to deal with central pawns just standing there they will very easily forget about them it's very common this is not a knock on my opponent this is uh it's a real thing all right so we still haven't gotten a response oh for three not a single person not a single person watches content um oh very interesting that with with with everything that's going on white is spending so much time in this position i yeah i uh life is good i'm gonna have some nuts and put some nuts in my um got some nuts here almonds cashews healthy unless you're allergic for legal reasons okay my opponent is thinking for a very long time uh i i mean i will edit this out of the video if necessary if they just sit here for six and a half minutes that would be pretty wild maybe they got a phone oh a move has happened two minutes and 20 seconds okay wow sensational uh my opponent made a move finally after two minutes and 20 seconds they did take my bot i'm gonna take back listen you boot up a 10 minute game you're allowed to think i don't exactly know what my opponent was thinking about there their pawn was hanging maybe they were thinking of various aggressive things maybe they got a phone call all right back to normal pace so a bit of a disconnected approach by my opponent every move sort of just feels mechanical one move after the other they haven't really pieced together a plan yet i would love if they did i would love if they brought the rooks to the center and noticed this because now i'm unpinned for the first time in the game okay but you notice you went there there and then there with the bishop the bishop went forward back forward to take a bit of a waste of time don't hate this move but again very short-sighted right kind of a one mover um what happens when i just return home was there anything beyond that did that move improve your position it opened up your c pawn but i have a feeling your next move is going to be here because you're like i haven't gotten my bishop out yet you know or like a rook move g4 is too much i would not push pawns where you're castled you should stop yourself from playing that move um i anticipate this or this and anything else would be a complete and utter shock to me i would not be ready for any other move and we can end this video oh no no but i was just there i was just on that square which means i definitely cover it no no i think my opponent might be distracted they might be playing like on a toilet on a bullet train and someone's knocking on the door that was relatively straightforward i mean i again when you leave a square you still control it right so now they get the bishop out um let's play rook b8 i just want to test my opponent's vision a little bit right i'm playing rook b8 so the level at this at like we've gotten everything today we got the first person that played a slightly dubious opening but then played fantastic chess then we got a person that didn't play a good opening that was a good move there you go you're stopping ruby too but then they but but they didn't play a good opening and they got themselves in a lot of trouble this person played a decent opening but then just sort of one move at a time type of thing right like every move one move at a time then a one mover like big blunder right just knight c5 and long term we gotta stop thinking in one moves you've got to be able to demonstrate a plan you've got to be able to explain what the what the idea is okay i predicted this move right i said g4 was gonna happen because white just is kind of like i'm attacking the knight which makes sense but what happens when i move the knight back now you've over extended now your king's a little weak right so you gotta think i gotta i haven't moved my rooks yet checks captures attack see every move every move is aggressive but i'm defended so some people really like to force things in chess but sometimes there's is nothing to force right now white is probably gonna i don't know throw a bunch of pawns for it obviously you don't want to trade queens because you're down a bishop trading queens is not good but it's a forcing move maybe this and bring the pawns up try to pawn storm stuff to do anything all right so yeah c4 there we go just every move aggressive um takes okay first thing now my opponent's thinking what are they thinking about hmm i think okay and queen d4 i want to find a way to make a blunder and see if my opponent takes advantage so obviously they're gonna go here or here that's just their playing style they might they might defend the pawn they might play rook e1 defending the pawn but this is a fork right and also they might go here let's not forget it's a tough spot it's a tough spot for white white is really really struggling here queen c6 has been played taking upon defending this i'm gonna go here queen's under attack this is under fire and you have two ways to win this with black you can trade down into an end game where you'll just have an extra bishop and then you will take a couple of pawns promote win like that or just go for mate take here checkmate utilizing this right utilizing the open king position trying to get a rook in there that could be a little bit more stressful if you're not good at controlling the game meaning you're gonna move a bunch of pieces forward and then your opponent's gonna have an opportunity to counter attack i'm going to take this obviously the next move is going to be an attack on my queen and then if it's not i will set this up right it's just a very pure this is also not a bad one move thread it's very different than the ones my opponent has made because i'm at least i'm improving the positioning of my bishop i just this has not been a good game i i really do feel like oh my goodness and white just resigns oh my god oh no oh no okay so let's learn right it was a bad game it doesn't mean you're not smart it doesn't mean any of those things you just played poorly like you just play poorly that that's it right for example i really like tennis and when i go to the tennis court to play with my friends some days i'm really sharp and some days i'm not some days i'm really not like that doesn't mean like one of those days i'm an idiot probably but it doesn't mean the same thing with chess so what my opponents what my opponent needs is is is a better understanding of how to deal with the karo khan okay so that's step one you you have to be able to challenge the karo khan maybe you need to play the fantasy variation maybe you need to just play knight c3 normal stuff right right now white is just sort of on autopilot in the opening and already losing a pawn right already second thing was this bishop a4 move it just didn't right it didn't make sense don't make multiple moves in the opening unless you have a good reason or as i mentioned don't go backwards okay i went forward right they spent a little time here knight c3 all of this was fine but but this is a crazy move to play you are now making a third move with this knight when this bishop hasn't moved right we want to bring our rooks to the center you have to have an alarm bell an alarm bell that's like stop making one move moves so stop making these moves they're like i'm attacking the bishop and then what i'm attacking the knight and then what and if you can't if you struggle to come up with a plan it means you don't quite get the transition from the opening that you're playing to the middle game okay um all of these people will get rating points refunded it was just wasn't a good game by white it's okay like it's some blunders and and most of it stems from the fact that i think white just did not feel comfortable in this position so played a lot of one move type of stuff and that's all right uh i want to see 1000 elo bullet so let's boot up a bullet game and not a single person has answered uh if if we okay let's see do you watch gotham chess the fourth and last person i'm gonna push that's not a real move but that's okay knight c6 knight f3 all right nice and easy develop the bishop good wow all right i'm blocking take take is a free pawn by the way do they see that oh look at the tactics on queer to you yoyo pass db wow okay development try to go forward try to go forward attack the knight do they see this do they see do they want to make that trade they do e6 here in castle e6 there in castle all right i'm attacking the queen and developing a bishop so it's not just the one oh no no no no no oh okay i i got scared don't take my pawn don't you just stop okay i think they see it they're not good a3 i blundered this okay now please do not take my knight don't take it's defended please okay good now i'm playing um i'm playing rook b3 i had rook b7 but it's bullet uh it's craziness out here don't hang the queen please don't hang the queen good it's still safe bishop takes pandemonium is black on a castle or develop the bishop and castle short okay very good um rook a1 is an attack on the queen will they take my rook they could have taken my rook for free but instead they got scared and ran into this but i don't see that i don't see that because i'm a thousand oh they move the queen out of the way rook to e1 now i've got 13 seconds versus 20. this is insanity 12 seconds don't don't move your knight i'll checkmate you don't move i'm housing my queen i couldn't check my oh my goodness i'm out slipped oh god i got nine seconds it's eight seconds it's nine it's nine versus thirteen twelve eleven but we're just pushing pawns total pandemonium bishop to g3 back rook takes oh i'm catching up on time they're slowing down i'm catching up make a move make a move make a move six seconds six seconds five seconds five seconds oh we both have five seconds rook to e7 rook to e7 oh they're thinking they're thinking three seconds each no i'm going here somebody's gonna lose on time they're starting to pre-move rook takes g7 is this is gonna win me the game it does it does it does buzzer beat a sacrifice wins me oh my goodness oh the good news is bullet at 1000 is still a total arcade game i mean it is not chess this was chess for a while actually my opponent played very well in the opening but oh that was crazy that was actually a really nice tactic taken 95 really well done and it was good i mean it was this one but this is there's a crazy move that's a crazy move to play i just control it twice oh my goodness that was fun um to summarize one thousands are actually quite sharp with their tactics that first person i played was unbelievable the openings total chaos so it could be a person that doesn't play the opening at all could be a person that's actually quite well versed in the opening like the person in the garlic on got a very decent position and in the middle game it's a lot of middle game concepts to improve some people are more sharp tactically and have an instinct for tactics than others um but uh but yeah the level is is noticeable from the last video 500 up to a thousand and the next stage is minimizing chaos controlling the game a bit better sharpening up your tactics and understanding the openings you play that's the way you're gonna get better let me know if you want me to do this as i go up the rating ladder even higher and get out of here
