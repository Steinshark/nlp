ladies and gentlemen in today's video i'm going to show you what it takes to become a top 1% chess player and what i roughly mean by that is getting to around 1,800 playing strength everybody has a different perception of what top 1% is you know when they talk about the economy they're like top 10 of 1% or top 1% nobody really knows but i'm going to show you what it takes to get past intermediate level and into advanced territory we're going to look at openings middle games end games four subscriber games were submitted to me in uh elo range and that's the entire intro of the video we're going to have a great time thank you to everybody who submitted and also today is october 24th 2023 i don't know when you're watching this in the future i don't know if you still watch the

future so it's incredible uh to be part of this and links are in the description available in usa uk europe german language spanish language australia new zealand like any mostly anywhere in the world um just thank you for being a part of this thank you uh that's all that's that's the intro um let's get into some games uh and uh the first one is by a 1577 now you might remember i said top 1% 1577 is not top 1% it's like top 3% but we still have to start somewhere so 1577 rapid game we have e4 e5 now the first thing we're going to do is we're going to figure out where the opening ends knight f3 bishop c5 that is not a real opening that is just a full loss of a pawn um um at the 1500 level and the 1600 level you still see this chapter called this little area called stupid openings like you still have people who are you know like look i don't know who's playing with the black pieces you're this person in a 1600 but clearly this person has some sort of tricky trappy thing that they like to play you are going to see that vanish at'00 1900 2180 people at 15600 are still doing goofy stuff so you have to know how to punish it you have to know how to play if your opening courses don't work d4 this is called the bush gas gambit it's the official name of this opening but this opening is just bad okay there are much better openings knight to f6 look at this move this is a very very very tricky move essentially black is saying take my bishop so i can take your knight and guarantee that i win back one of the pawns now even here white can probably just play knight c3 and and in general the way you tame a stupid opening is you just play solidly and don't let your opponent have fun like you know what i would do here i mean i guess there is queen to e2 but if you really want to be solid like just trade all their pieces and be slightly better for the entire game bishop to f4 long castles don't let them have fun white plays f3 i don't hate this move at all this is a great move you defend your center and now you are just ready to finish developing black goes bishop b4 check look how much time black spent black was clearly att l by this move even though it was just a solid move bishop b4 now white built up a big wall and just went knight c4 now white's completely winning why won a center pawn and just has a good center right very solid center is and w a pawn like as a bonus and now white just has to consolidate now e5 by the way is a very nice move punishing black setup but it's not actually threatening to win anything because there's a pin so black could move the knight and then maybe move the bishop but maybe not actually maybe not maybe the bishop is just purely trapped now that i'm looking at this maybe the bishop's just trapped after this well done look at that now again a lot of people here might just go bishop b2 in castle i love e5 i just i just thought this bishop wasn't trapped that was an oversight by me bishop look at this just winning the bishop punishing this bad opening taking and just bringing the knight back to d2 but but a mistake 1500 is not perfect you should at this point be thinking how is my opponent going to bother me my opponent wants knight e3 or knight f4 or queen h4 right this is allowing too much and look at this 1.3 seconds spent in chess we like to say knight on the rim is uh dim right oh i don't want to put my knight on the edge of the board no superseding concepts this is what i like to call sueding concepts you know you don't want to put your knight on the edge of the board so if you have an option you should obviously put it here no because now you have this so in this particular case it was fine to put the knight on the edge of the board it would have came back and you wouldn't have blocked your bishop and now look at this now here comes black tactical sharp right knight e4 now take take and bishop to b7 trying to put pressure now white white this is the most clutch move that white played white in this position could have just been like oh i got to guard my knight and then lost the game after d5 lost the game just you're going to lose because d5 f5 so white responds here by going this is the threat danger levels bishop to g5 a very very well-timed move using the knight that is still pinned the queen now goes back to e8 and now we defend the knight with the king now we could have just done that we could have probably just played king d3 but it's better to play bishop g5 because it's a free developing move you're just getting a full bishop out and i can't go f6 because of this pin now i don't know if black if white saw all of this when they played bishop g5 but that was a fantastic move and now look at these danger levels your bishop is hanging a lot of you would go i got to go bishop a four and then takes and then trap the rook i'm so smart no what's worth more than a bishop boom the queen is trapped trapped as in it can only go to e6 and at that point i'm going to trade i'm going to grab the bishop watch this boom boom by the way best move if you try to get greedy rook takes f3 is check so white seeing this simplifies down finishes development doesn't rush out with the knight because white knows it's not trapped and let's see this conversion process see all the that that is excellent stuff do you know how many beginners here would just snap take this just allowing in activity look at white just closing the position rook at four getting the rooks off the board a great move rook e one i mean i would have taken on f4 but rook e one i guess they wanted to play rook e four now they take rook e4 is a forced rook trade knight c6 take take and let's watch this conversion c5 knight c4 take the pawn black should not be trading knights there i would go for the d7 pawn we got to get the d7 pawn now we can stop let's reroute our knight on passant okay osant right at 1500 they still don't remember about that rule but knight e4 stop everything promote the pawn and in this position black resigned excellent game dealt with a goofy opening in a perfect way took a chance in the opening not just like oh i got to get castled i got to get castled no punishing unpinning excellent simplification bad move bad move you're not going to play a perfect game at 1570 bad move knight on the rim would have been fine because you would have gotten to castle this was definitely blundered but good consolidation saving the king bishop g5 was just unbelievable un amazing move now let's keep going another game where where uh gotham sub 1790 this time now look at this this is very different stuff we have a tyon of sicilian a mainline sicilian defense no bs now white could play the alipin white could play the smith mora gambit but white plays the main line white plays the main line look at this bishop e3 this has all been played many many times before the principal move against b5 is to take on c6 but let's look at white just playing all of the ideas of this opening black now wants to fight on the queen side with bishop b4 now in if you want to be a top 1% chess player you have to not just know your openings you have to be able to explain the ideas of your openings to a child what are black's ideas in this opening who is going to understand their opening better take take and now white should be playing for bishop to f3 white does that first white goes queen d4 don't know why white played queen d4 i think white was trying to prevent b4 but bishop f3 was very strong and now bishop f3 and now e yes this is exactly what we we want in the sicilian if white can strike first look at this very coordinated effort if white can strike first what they're going to do is they're going to open up the position for their attack and black is going to feel very airy here like a windy day in summer and you're wearing a tank top knight d7 now something is is cooking here something is cooking up the sicilian is one of the most tactical openings in chess knight d7 was not a good move black does not have an understanding of the sicilian all right they have to time when they play certain moves you can't just play b5 anytime you want in this opening bishop e3 b5 it's a big commitment it's a big commitment to play b5 you might want to develop your bishop first to b4 for example and then if you're going to do it this way you got to get this bishop look at this look how far behind black black's still not developed pawn takes and now these three pieces are all intertwined because the queen can't guard this and this and white look at this completely winning 15 moves boom now a lot of people here would panic take take and just go on to lose the game black had an idea black had a tactic bishop c5 whoa a lot of players panic here for white and go my queen is hanging my bishop is behind that i'm just going to go here and then after take take take white you know might play 94 check because that's a fork and then it's an equal position and a lot of intermediate players just still are in that beginner mindset where they make moves and then things happen every move is a surprise to you when you're a beginner in chest you take on b7 you go ah if queen takes then this but as you get better you got to go but what about bishop c5 how does my opponent attack me how can my opponent check me how can my opponent take my pieces how can my opponent attack me you got to see a move like bishop c5 but a very nice piece of calculation here by white queen takes g7 hanging a bishop with a check but remember you just took a bishop so you have to keep this mental balance or you could just read what's on the screen white is up a bishop and a pawn white loses a bishop but after king to h1 this and this they're both hanging the only way this would not work is if queen takes b7 was a check in fact if queen takes b7 was a check it would be mate white would just block and then lose if this pawn was here but it's not so after this this completely winning position white grabs a pawn on the way out and now what white needs to do is white needs to play rook e one f5 and just blast into black's king's position b4 knight e4 transferring the knight to the center black plays rook to c8 white plays rook e1 bishop to d4 and white does not wait seeing this there are two ways to win a winning position i always like to say this you can either go for an endgame or go for checkmate knight g5 queen is hanging here uh queen is threatening to take not hanging f7 is hanging to the queen rook e6 is a massive threat and in this position black played knight f6 and resigned black played knight f6 and fell back into begin look at this 1,800 very good player but fell back into the mindset of i don't know what to do so i'm going to attack the queen and just like but it's completely lost you you know if you play rook f8 here i'll take on e6 because of the pin so white won the skirmish and sometimes like in a fight like in a like in a fight all right sometimes in a fight guy takes a punch other guy takes a punch they both wrestle they both punch a little bit more they kicking each other and it's back and forth or sometimes you get volkanovski makach 2 head kick knock out that's it and sometimes couple of punches are exchanged one guy's knocked out bishop b7 bishop c5 queen g7 and when this was all over it was white who emerged beyond beyond a level that you need to even focus here and that was very well done why did this happen black plays the sicilian but doesn't know it black just you cannot finish the opening setup the black was done with the opening setup here and within moments got themselves under severe pressure at this level you cannot lose a game like this ever again you lose a game like this once it's just a matter of not understanding your opening that well and that's what you have to improve on white clearly carried out the ideas and if you play an opening like the sicilian you hang on a knife's edge so if you want to play a high-risk high reward opening you have to have the necessary knowledge to navigate it on your own because if you play a type of opening where you make one mistake and it's all over like here not going to be sustainable in the long run speaking of here uh gotham sub is rated'27 and white is rated 1960 so we are going high higher and higher knight f3 now white here playing already and black doing the exact same thing black groomfield player clearly okay speaking of the grunfeld is one of those openings if you don't know the ideas you are going to die it is such a complex opening it's a fascinating opening and the idea of the grunfeld is essentially that when white plays a queen's gambit setup like for example d4 knight f6 c4 for g6 and some of you don't like when the board is highlighting like a different color uh when i analyze games directly this is unfortunately the logic of the board on a regular analysis board it's not like this instead of going here and playing a kings indian defense against e4 uh in the groomfield you strike in the center right away and effectively you try to attack white center with your pieces from long range white likes to have something like this in the particular game in question that's not really what's happening black plays d5 take take white goes e4 and again black wants to fight against the center with the knight and with the bishop so black goes knight c6 okay knight a5 um let me refresh that was i don't know why the clocks are not updating all right i will refresh this game completely because for some reason the clocks decided to break uh e4 d4 knight c6 outstanding look both players have 16 minutes 1540 and 16 at this level they know the opening now they need to think on their own so black knows that black is going to park the knights on the edge of the board and pressure this maybe go bishop g4 maybe e6 and c6 the knight will dance into the square right here comes c6 exactly what you're supposed to do and now white spends 2 minutes and 30 seconds plays bishop g5 okay pinning the pawn to the queen what i would do here is i would play h6 my logic for attacking this bishop is can it go there and maintain this position no no cuz they would lose it i mean you need to like be you know you got to like not be so scared here maybe queen d6 queen g6 you have to find but that would be my logic but okay i don't i don't hate black next move which is which is taking on d5 and then knight c4 essentially black decides okay white is going to have this pawn i'm going to target b2 i'm going to target this i have a good position i'm i'm executing the plans of the grunfeld i'm transferring my pieces on the queen side you know white can't play a move like b3 uh because i'll take and then after take i could take the rook but actually in the gron field it's a little scary so you know with black you you still have to defend yourself you might not even be better that's that's how the gr field works unfortunately queen e2 and now rook e8 rook e8 is just trying to defend e7 and next black will figure out what they're going to do are they going to play here they're going to try to play for e6 make sure they don't hang the queen right if i was playing white here after rook e8 i probably just go rook d1 and then rook e1 and if black plays like bishop f5 knight to d4 just try to make progress with my position but rook d1 is played and black goes for what they think is a tactic black goes for knight takes b2 because at the end of the day you could be 1,00 but your brain is still going to go back to tactics brain the idea here is the queen is attracted to the knight not like that and then is pinned he here so knight a4 and actually the best move here believe it or not is knight takes a4 and getting the three pieces the three pieces here are better than this queen 100% 100% because rook c1 knight c4 knight e5 and this is actually a moment where i'm not sure mathet knew that even as a 1900 or'30 you can learn things in chess and believe it or not more often than not in a position with more pieces on the board three pieces are better than a queen now if it's like an end game and there's like queen and pawns versus three pie probably the queen is going to win because it's just too fast but on board like this when white does not have any targets three pieces for a queen is not that good of a deal but neither player knew that that's just kind of like a fundamental thing it's just one of those things you add to your barrel of chess knowledge all right your barrel of chess knowledge this is my barrel right here you keep adding stuff you you get to 1900 three pieces for a queen that's not something you need to learn when your 700 there's nothing about three pieces for a queen in this book all right that's stuff you you you know you you you do later having said that white got to this position also one thing white is doing very poorly here and subscriber is doing very well time management doesn't matter if you're playing a 15-minute game a 5 minute game a 35 minute game my friends if you are playing a tournament you're playing any competitive game you cannot be behind on the clock but more than 50% of the opponent time and in this position 1226 versus 551 half of 1226 is 613 it's a lot of time to be down a lot all right so rook e1 queen takes d5 and in this position black emerged two pawns up black won the tactical skirmish watch how effortlessly black plays bishop to e6 everything is defended we are going for the weakness rook e3 trying to get two pieces for the rook trying to get this is this two pieces for the rook black says nope dance out of the way rook d3 kick out the bishop finally yes now the bishop's going to have to be passive there it is rook c8 trade the rooks up material effortless move knight d4 effortless don't even think about it rook c1 boom now this bishop is undeveloped this is hanging so we got to figure out what to do do we want to double our own pawns if we move our bishop we're going to lose this so what do we do knight b oh my what a move getting the the knight out of the way the bishop can't be taken cuz the rook is hanging and now the bishop slides forward excellent stuff excellent stuff here this is superb bishop a3 the knight is hanging if we move it the bishop let's just grab the bishop bishop all right king takes time we got to guard our knight right no bishop takes d4 if you want to trade with me we'll be in a rook and bishop end game but i'm up two pawns i'm going to play e5 anchor my bishop to the center take the open file bring my king but if this fork and now you're just in a completely lost rook end game rook c8 a5 keeping it closed keep an eye on the pawn bring the king don't like this i would have taken a bit more space here instead of playing king f8 i think like f5 here and maybe running the king don't hate this but don't love it little bit slow but great move king e6 rook c5 or rook a8 are good and just push the pawn you just push the pawn just push the pawn just push the pawn because the rook is going to have to play defense just push the pawn i don't like it's a little scattered but we're going to get there in the end because at this level you don't make and again push the pawn push the pawn because the rook has to go back now we push but we've lost a little more than i like here because now it's going to be you know none of that had to happen but i think black's just getting a little bit you know excited and excellent and that's it and uh yeah you just get back in time or there and white resigns because and and that was that was that was fantastic that was once again a player who managed to implement the game plan of their opening exactly right they went for a tactic it was mildly flawed only if you kind of get the three pieces for the queen is probably better that was a piece of knowledge just missing at that level and that's fine that's like a very small thing it was a good idea that they went for it worked out they won two pawns what a flawless conversion like trading the rooks trading the bishops trading these oh my i it's just look at this done all chances for this 2000 to play on gone completely gone excellent job and um last but not least 2183 actually a gentleman by the name of uh of pablo who who actually helps out tremendously on chesley courses those of you that have those um the qr codes material hosted in in this book uh are are actually hosted on chesley so let's see how he does 2183 versus a 2046 uh it's a queen's gambit decline white plays bishop g5 and now we transpose to what's called the cambridge springs variation you don't have to know the name i'm not going to quiz you on that white plays knight d2 which according to theory is one of the best moves idea being that after pawn takes and this attacking this you go here here and knight takes c4 and you're going to see that kind of happens bishop takes queen b3 the players don't play the opening perfectly but black actually here implements the plans slightly better i would even argue but d takes c4 allowing white to get the knight into the game maybe not necessary but completely fine queen b4 and now it's the middle game how do 2180 rated players play the middle game they keep the tension queen c2 back they target the pawn as long as everything is protected and now they want to use the queen as a punch back a3 traps the queen by the way one to a3 wins queen is completely trapped so uh pablo here with white knows queen's got to go or the bishop's got to go bishop goes what i would do here is i would chase out the queen and i would bring my rooks to c and d because this rook is going to want d and this rook is going to want c that's just like that's where the board is going to open up instead he does this and the queen actually goes to g5 and i'm i'm looking at this and i'm like okay if i'm playing white here what i might do in this position is uh is i might play something like knight to e4 right and the idea of knight to e4 is a trade that leaves me with pressure and monitoring that pawn just preventing black from developing that is one idea pablo plays even more aggressively he weakens his structure a little bit because the queen can't go that way so this queen cannot touch any of these squares so goes to h6 and now i'm thinking i have eyes there what if i went up and over rook f3 look at that out of nowhere and attack why because the opponent stuck around for with the queen for too long they should have went here they should have gone to c7 brought the bishop brought the rook brought the rook chasing the queen does nothing chasing the queen does nothing it's safe kick out the knight sniper on h2 but when you bring the queen over here you're just it's like waving a flag in front of a bull f4 rook f3 now how do you get how do you defend yourself look at this and rook h3 is not even the best move the best move is apparently to go back to the center i don't know how human that is knight e5 trying to restrain now what does black want here if i'm playing black here i want to trade a few pieces and finish my development and get my rooks to the center i want to fight back all right i want to fight back b6 you make a move like that you start weakening the light squares you got to make sure you're not blundering anything i like knight e4 i love this next move by black knight e4 look for take take but black does what every good 22100 needs to do at this level keeps the tension bishop to b7 pressuring the knight rook c8 rook d8 remember the side that is restricted by space with like trades so for example if white plays rook e i don't know why rookie one would be played even a trade like this is completely fine for black because white is losing attackers all right losing attackers rook f1 preparing for the attack but now black should start coming in with the rook rook c8 apparently rook fc8 was better queen b1 keeping that battery rook d8 excellent or is it or is it it's been 23 moves of high level chess at that at the earlier level something already happened at this point some tactics blood rook d8 kind of a absentminded like you know i'm just putting both rooks on the open file one inaccuracy black mentally left this knight here just like it's there he's not taking me i'm not taking we're staring at each other one mistake and white went boop what's the big deal two knights attacking f7 so what everything else is a brick wall right everything else black just went back to f8 well knight takes f7 and in this position rook takes f7 it's not about that knight takes e6 at this level you can spot the most absurd tactics the queen is trapped and after queen h8 it looks completely lost because white will go here and all of a sudden the whole position is disintegrating if pon i'm going to win your queen and then i'm going to go here but as it turns out rook to g8 so even though knight e6 is played and this whole sacrifice is looming at this level of chess because you have such a high foundation of skill things rarely end in flash knockouts things rarely end in crazy absurd victories like this but in this position black resigned and we can learn something from that black resigned because they thought they were just completely lost they were like after this i lose i'm going to lose my rook and my queen if i try to save my rook bishop h7 and queen g6 and that's it and queen g7 and mate so black thought it's over black is 2046 for a reason you have to keep fighting you you have four you got two and a half two minutes more white only has two minutes it is very easy in this position with playing white to blunder something like queen g6 queen g7 queen g7 take take and all of a sudden you're losing you're losing there is no pride in res resignation fight till the end you're up 2 minutes this is so something to learn even in an early resignation but it's amazing that at this level one mistake can lead to something like this players played 23 great moves it's a great fighting game but it comes down to still a tactical shot zigging and zagging in with the knight and a resignation just thinking that they were losing because i'm 2100 i can handle myself i know i'm going to lose why would i even prolong the game i'm so mad no you just totally forgot about the counter shot from this bishop and this g file something to learn all the time right those other players they'll play till mate they won't resign like early as you get better you think resigning early is fine because you're like well i know what's going to happen play it out till the end my friends you see at 15 and 1600 still a little bit chaotic in the opening at 1718 and 1900 people are studying people are playing mainlines they're playing grun felds they're playing open sicilians they're playing all sorts of stuff they're playing what the top level players play but they're also navigating the openings very well afterward the margin of error is uh is i mean like they are they are really not making a lot of mistakes so learn from these games learn from these games you got to get through a string of games without making big blunders and you you know what will help no but seriously it is a it is a very very proud day in my life and if you made it 31 minutes into the video um tonight uh i'm doing a live fan event my first ever in new york city it's going to be uh it's like 200 people it's sold out so if uh if i'm going to see you there uh very exciting stuff please be normal and um i'll be signing books and then there's another event on november 4th in new york city at the catch and ice cream shop all this is in the description clifton new jersey barnes & noble november 14th and if these all do well y'all might do more around the country might go to london might go to europe might go might go to many places so that's how to get better at chess that's the book we keep moving right along now get out of here
