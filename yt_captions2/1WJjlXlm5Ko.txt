ladies and gentlemen welcome back to tata steel 2024 this is the first major chess event of the calendar year and despite magnus carlson not playing fabiano carana not playing and hikara nakamura not playing the top three rated chess players in the world are not participating in this event in the first time in i don't know a decade this event is really really fun and i think it's showing that we don't always need the top names in the world to participate we've got the young generation we have the older generation we have the master section we have the challenger section we have dingl ren we have yan pomi anish giri pranda gesh hans nean over there in the challengers got a great field and today we are featuring a massive game between prag nanda and digler ren the world champion once again we have an opportunity for prague to prove that he is elite on the world stage there's a couple of indian youngsters like prag and gukesh who have risen to this level but will they stay consistent enough to break past 2730 2740 2750 into that ultra elite near 2800 elo chess dingly ren coming off a very convincing win where he beat gukesh with black showing once again gukesh you have to wait to get to this level in this game he opens with e4 now dingly ren by the way is a lifelong d4 c4 kind of guy he goes for e4 we have a spanish which at this level is very very common a6 mhm mhm was that clear castles b5 bishop b3 and now we have c3 all of this has been played before uh obviously i mean it's a spanish um d3 is ait is already a major commitment if there's anything you know about the spanish you know that you know white likes to castle here and we can get a mainline spanish with the bishop going to e7 c castles uh or we can get an open spanish where after castles black takes on e4 but dingly ren says d3 and let's have a closed game all right we're going to have a long closed maneuvering game i'm going to put my rook in e1 rotate my knight to f1 then to g3 that's what i want there it goes prag danda also making kind of improving moves plays knight e7 maybe he'll play c6 and d5 or c5 and then put the knight on g6 and now ding plays a4 ding still in his prep prague not all right prag not in his prep clearly ding is ask asking some questions here about pg's queen side prg plays rook b8 to get the rook off the a file so that abab is now possible ding plays h3 ding still in his prep by the way as you can tell from the time management still in his prep brock plays knight g6 ding plays knight g3 ding still in his prep still in his home analysis prog plays c5 prag now down 26 minutes on the clock in the opening all right idea to expand here we'll see what he's going to do with his bishop it's a very closed game so there's tons of pawn breaks there's a lot of pece maneuver ing that can happen neither guy can use the h file to bring in a knight like they would both love to put a knight on f5 uh ding plays bishop e3 so he spends a little bit of time here he plays bishop e3 now what's interesting is that that's not the best move and as you can see suddenly black's position comes to life this might have been a bluff by ding to continue playing fast the engine here gives ab ab first uh then of course if bishop e3 the same idea but the computer after see d5 wants the bishop to go to d2 uh in basically every line and then if bishop d2 and black still play c4 it doesn't work because there's no you're not going to get to trade the bishop ding plays here and now p plays c4 so he spends another 13 minutes he is now down 36 minutes on the clock in the opening but it's classical chess so he still has another 65 minutes to go and he's going to clarify the position ding takes on b6 instantly prog takes with the rook ding plays bishop a2 so now ding spends 11 minutes and i think it's quite clear that despite getting an advantage of preparation in the opening meaning you didn't get an advantage on the board but you got to a playable position i think this might have been a little bit of a bluff by ding i don't know if it was a bluff or just you know he wanted to continue to play fast and keep the pressure on his opponent but this is a great move which guarantees the opening of the position and prag correctly evaluates that after all of this is said and done he's doing very well for example d can play pawn takes pawn takes bishop takes but the rook getting to b2 is actually very nice for black he has good pressure the c3 pawn is weak and uh black is microscopically better and probably the game will just end in a draw but rook b6 and ding does it like this and now prague just plays queen c7 and yeah ding ding's pieces are a little bit suspicious which is why you know he tries to play bishop b1 he tries to kind of zigzag out of the way uh and prague just plays very simply he plays takes takes and he's the first first one to get a knight on f4 so he does he doesn't care that he's down 37 minutes ding is using his time advantage and the position is in the balance but he's playing in a slightly dismissive way of prague like he he's saying all right you want my bishop so come and take it come and take my bishop when the best move very well could be bishop f1 it very well could just be moving the bishop out of the way and then playing like queen d2 and slowly maneuvering and getting the knight out but ding plays knight e2 and pg's like well okay i'll take your bishop i don't know why you're giving it to me so easily bishop e6 and now i'd like to play bishop c4 now if all these pawns get traded it will just be a draw all right and in general in these e4 e5 games it's difficult to prove an advantage like you know so violently i mean these these positions don't end in like checkmates knight g3 b4 prague is just doing what he can he's trying to fight against the weakness now if prag can get a an end game where he has five on four of course he's going to be in good shape and we're kind of heading there like who's gna guard this pawn prague's got a bishop versus a knight which is considered a slight advantage in an end game and he has good pressure on the b pawn dingoes here trying to give away the pawn for the pawn prg goes back defends himself queen a3 prg doubles up and i got news for you it's just a matter of time until ding completely can't guard his b pawn uh and that's exactly what prg does he plays 98 and suddenly he's like dang uh you play too fast i'm down 50 minutes but um you're not going to get your pawn and rook b3 and he just applies as much pressure as possible and he just wins the pawn wins the pawn and we go to this end game ding goes here p goes g6 ding goes here prog blocks the bish blocks the rook's activity and they both move their h pawns now again stockfish can still draw this but look how fast ding is playing ding plays f3 prague doesn't wait he simplifies the game and says you know what i'll take my chances in this bishop versus knight five on four again the meta here is always going to be a draw it's always going to be a draw it's going to be a draw because at the end of the day if black is left with one pawn versus nothing i can sack my knight for it knight versus knight and bishop despite being a full piece down is a draw you can't beat me with bishop knight if i have a knight it's not possible i mean i'm assuming i'm not going to lose my kn but it's just not possible so the meta of this end game should basically always be a draw the only way really to win this would be to trade the right way and create an imbalance where it's not just like a pawn like you know you you you might need me to take that way so that way you get a pass pawn if you can get a pass pawn and win a pawn for a night you win as long as there's pawns on the board so prague now needs a consolidation phase right he keeps the bishop there and he takes he goes to a night end game ding again might have rushed with knight d5 he might have needed to play g4 he might have needed to isolate a pawn because getting a pass pawn would actually help ding for his counter play but he goes knight d5 and he probably just doesn't expect brock takes and it's a very tough decision ding now goes here now look at ding look at look at his time management he spends 27 minutes he spends all his time all his time all his time has spent by the time he gets there right now he got a little extra time here i think he got some bonus time on move on move uh move 40 but he spent so much time and he decides to do it this way and now prague just has to win a night end game which is not easy i mean it's probably a draw ding tries to create some counterplay and we get this end game it's a it's a three on two it's likely just a draw with best play but ding had to go here and then if knight e4 this is the defensive setup and maybe he just dances around with his horse but of course you got winning chances but you have knight e3 king goes back it's impossible to he play knight d6 knight e3 and this is the defensive setup apparently where white has the best chances but ding instead of that plays king e2 now the knight comes to e4 and now he goes knight f1 now the difference is that in this position there's knight takes pawn it's a defensive illusion and then f4 and then you lose this king and pawn end game you lose because the pawn is a decoy by the time you go anywhere i will win this pawn or i'll push this can't rush though you can't rush now it's a draw which you would play king e5 you'd play king f4 you' slowly win the pawn and then you would be winning yeah so ding even on move 48 apparently could have gotten a defensive setup and maybe drawn and instead he goes here and he he's he's just losing like prague just marches the king into the position and it he just completely from start to finish outclasses the current world champion and wins that was a shocking game it was a shocking game for several reasons how easy prag made it look and just like ding blitzed out the first 14 moves of the game and then from here it was like wait was that his prep cuz prag played a great move instigating stuff on the queen side and then it was just like a series of inaccurate decisions he didn't want to keep his bishop he gave away the bishop prague just masterful technique put pressure on this pawn was very patient very patient put his knight on a passive square to defend himself and then just like i mean he was like all right i guess i'm going to create winning chances from this position and he did i mean he just went to a night end game where he had some chances he had some little chances and it's just a shocking a shocking game like the the back and forth of that game to this game and prague just beats the world champ second time in a row in t steel in round four with black last year he beat ding round four with black and also with this win prog is now officially the highest rated indian chess player which i don't think he's ever held i think he's always been gukesh but prag is now officially uh well unofficially in the rankings he is the highest rated indian chess player so that is huge now we go to a a nice little hans demon game hans demon playing against divia deshmuk who yesterday defeated haime santos latasa 2600 her third win against the 2600 uh i saw this stat uh on socials there's an account that follows women's chess i believe it's called at on the queen side which makes sense queen side uh which said it was the f third win that she had against the 26 00 gm in the last three months i will tell you i've had zero so you know three more than me also nobody watching this has had one either so we've all got zero hans nean trying to uh i mean he's a 270 point favorite in this game so he's going to try to get it done he plays an italian plays with d3 um all these positions look the same like like look the opening in this game right like uh knight f1 like this position and this position right i mean like or or or this pos like they look so similar isn't isn't that fascinating like prague played a6 b5 diva has not played a6 b5 the bishop just went there it was just interesting how these positions the structure is so fascinatingly identical right knight e3 now diva gives up the bishop for the knight something that we haven't seen in a while uh also prague maneuvered his knight that way divia maneuvers her knight that way slightly different right and now hans takes on c6 creates an opposite colored bishop position and tries to take as much central space as possible the way black can fight back here is there's there's many ways you can be solid you can also take give white the center but try to fire away try to fire away with the like this queen g6 create light squir attacking possibilities but the computer always evaluates the position as a touch better for white but black is very solid so d4 but instead of playing open she plays solid she plays f6 lot of pawns on dark squares considering she has just traded off a dark square bishop hans plays b3 and c4 taking a little bit of free real estate st over there and the idea let's say black plays like king h8 the idea actually could be c5 which is very nasty at which point you restrict black's knight to d7 or you go to an end game where this is just awful i mean too many uh weaknesses c5 under pressure a6 and so he plays like this and makes divia play c5 now hans plays a nice idea plays knight d2 opposite colored bishops benefit the attacking player f4 and it's going to be bad news he's going to get a lot of traction going on this attack while this knight is sort of stuck can't get into the game rookie 7 f5 pushes the bishop back there's the queen there's no checkmate yet but it's a matter of time the knight is transferred in much better on g3 than where it was defending black has no play black has no play black can't do anything with any of her pawns she plays knight d7 trying to plug the center the knight arrives on h5 the rook is coming this rook is on the way as well and it's just a really brutal position queen h h4 poking at g7 poking at f6 diva down to 30 uh not 30 hans's 38 minutes diva has 59 seconds and it's just like a matter of time if you're going to reposition you're going to get in bishop d2 knight d5 there's a sacrifice somewhere it's just a matter of time can hans find his way in maybe not whoa maneuvering maneuvering and waiting and waiting and waiting but where's the where's the win where's the win the advantage is blossoming but where's the win knight h5 there it is there it is when you are severely restricted for space something is always going to happen now you could actually go back and say maybe diva should not have played c6 like maybe she should have just said you know what knight on d5 is very annoying but maybe just rook d7 maybe playing c6 actually was a major major mistake cuz this move makes that weak it takes away the knight but makes that very weak and maybe that's just it like maybe black just because of the new weakness on d6 has to play this very passive defense and now knight takes f6 she tries to go for some counterplay but the black position is falling apart so fascinating like maybe the attack was very deceiving and actually here black was not getting mated it was just unstoppable force meets immovable object but that's chess sometimes you play something and it doesn't work and when it's all said and done the attack is simply too strong bishop takes g7 rook d6 and uh black resigns here because she is going to lose all the pawns or she's going to get checkmated both of those are bad hans wins and he's uh he's actually in first place i will show you some more games i've got this game anon kbov popped off today and then we're going to i mean my man anij giri is on one he is on one in t steel wei plays e4 pam makulu has not won a game he is half out of three he goes for a caroan we have e5 bishop f5 we have the main line of the caroan and we have this very passive uh passive solid not passive uh short variation with bishop e2 and castles back in the day they used to play c5 and queen b6 now they play a bit more of a maneuvering way c5 now dc this has been played many many times so now wei plays bishop g5 gets rid of the dark squir bishops plays knight a3 he knows that his opponent wants to take this pawn but he can't take it right away because the knight is going to go to b5 so he castles and now c4 basically we is saying all right you can take my pawn i know you want it i'm going to try to open up your queen side and create some attack but black is fine black equalized black did his job black is minus .1 from the opening carlan op you know there's like this weird misconception like i always see stuff like this on reddit or youtube comments it's where people it's like um dunning krueger is that like i forgot what exactly it means but it's like this weird thing where you think you're the smartest person in the room all right uh that might not be that's not the definition of dunning krueger i'm just saying i see these things people like well you know i don't want to learn the carlon cuz at top level nobody plays it right yes the meta at top level is these e4 e5 games that you see all the time but like here's an example of a caroan game where param knew his stuff and he equalized i mean he got a very pleasant position from the opening and now it's about you got to play chess right speaking of you got to play chess rook d8 knight b5 and instead of allowing the knight in param uh he could have played knight a he says go ahead trap my rook look at that the rook is trapped param gets his own rook trapped plays dc opens up an attack on we's queen queen c1 knight takes e5 the rook has to be taken now you got no choice there it goes knight c6 param says okay i got a knight i got two pawns i got two pawns extra right i got seven pawns you got five we i'm going to get your knight we takes takes queen c3 rook a this is the position now in a perfect world param is going to get his pawns down here in a perfect world param is going to decide which of these pieces he wants to trade for this bishop or neither what wei is going to do is wei is going to try to win some pawns on that side of the board maybe trade the queens cuz queens would remove a lot of winning chances for black any checkmate chances and then we're going to try to win an endgame or tactic wow tactic okay so you can't take with the queen because then i take your knight knight takes b3 can't move the knight b5 if you want to win my knight i'm going to get so we says i think a rook for a bishop is the right balance i'm going to sack my bishop win the knight there it is and wei says let's play this game fascinating okay apparently stockfish wants param to wait it actually doesn't want him to take yet by taking he now allows we to play rook fd1 and these six pawns versus whites four are two extra but it doesn't feel that way the thing is they they don't feel that way if this pawn was on b5 it would feel a lot more potent just a small example okay queen c4 it's not a good move it's not a good move but let's just say we got queen b2 queen d5 and like rook rook no rook b1 hangs a rook let's say we got like rook a1 this is a much better structure for black because the pawns are together but this is worse because the pawns cannot work together and now wei begins an extraction process baram has to defend himself wei goes here and while black has to defend himself the rook goes to the seventh rank now the the evaluation is still in the balance but we is creating good chances for himself his king is a little weak f6 a5 rook b5 10 game we's got a minute queen h5 baram looking for mate queen a4 black's king darts out of the way but he loses a pawn black's king goes to d8 it looks like there's mate all over the board but then there's queen d7 the king goes to g6 i sack the rook and i win yours back so rook d8 rook a7 queen c2 oh my goodness this is nuts king g6 king is running around queen c2 king g6 we're going to make a draw no draw queen f5 now way goes with his pawns queen b1 sacrificing the queen but it's a mate h4 he's hunting baram's king king f7 what is happening in this game queen e3 we go to a queen trade finally we can breathe we can breathe but white has a pass a pawn and if white is able to get that pawn moving i think he's going to win the game uh-oh uhoh uhoh he's looking for a trade of rooks he's swarming the black king with his rooks param is creating counterplay but is it going to be quick enough king f8 check check is it going to be fast enough rook rook b7 you can't push because there's mate there's mate there's mate all over the back r king f8 rook c7 we go to an end game but now white's pawn might be the problem a5 whose pawn is stronger f5 the king c comes the king wants to go here and also there is e4 and you cannot take because the pawn is going to get to a7 at which point it's going to be fatal this is nuts this is a game of inches g4 the king goes to d2 stopping the pawn but black has a g pawn but white has an a pawn but black has a g pawn but white has an a pawn what is happening king e7 a7 and that's it because rook c2 you cannot take g2 my king stops the pawn way stops both pawns and param maklu goes down in a crazy back and forth game decided with it with a imbalance and pass pawns and param makulu has half out of four he's lost three games insane back to the challenger section we go this was smooth like butter anton kbov losing one of his first games to salm salah this was a g3 semi slot versus the uh young man from france mark andrea maritti this was a uh closed calan took on c4 and then watch as my man anon kbov creates imbalance gives up his bishop right puts stuff on dark squares watch as his knights just dance dance to the dark squares all his pawns on dark squares cuz he traded off his dark squared bishop beautiful positional game bringing out his queen getting his king off that g file so there's no mate look at look at the the dance of the knights what a beautiful position what a beautiful now how are we going to win we don't just get this and say okay we're winning queen a5 we centralize our rooks and we our opponent takes our opponent makes a big clarifying decision not allowing us to advance we take with the pawn to secure control of this to get the file knight c4 and dancing into the position and e4 all of these different ideas now we come back mar andrea tries to create counterplay cuz he doesn't like the positional but now we take we take because if he takes we go there and if he takes like this he's got weak pawns now what anon corov is one of the most aggressive players in the world e4 get that knight out of there queen c4 looking for queen d4 and an infiltration on these dark squares the black position is too scattered like look at these pieces black has a horrendous queen and rook horrendous and now the board is opening up now threatened here of course corov can play the top eng and move rook g1 rook g1 just gets the rook to safety you play for the future you still threaten the pawn but he's anton freaking corov he gives up the rook of course he gives up the rook cuz if you take the rook then he's going to get another pawn with check and then he's going to take the rook over he's going to take the bishop back mar andrea has to go here and now cor's just like yeah man you really should have taken when you had the chance cuz now i'm a pawn up and it's about to be real bad knight f4 and the opening of that file is completely lethal black goes here knight h5 queen and now we threaten the look at the look look at how this game ends this is this is so nasty queen b6 completely ignoring the threat on the bishop because after take take if you take i just play b7 you have these beautiful pieces but who's stopping the pawn cuz if you go over there i take and then i'll just win the end game what a what a game from corov he made it look so effortless like marri is 2572 that like some of us could live like four lifetimes and not get to that rating myself included i mean just the ease of which he made this look just queen c2 knight e5 look at him just planting his one trade lost mark andre the whole game he did that and the game was over that the game was over once he made that trade and he allowed kbov to have dark squared access no dark squared bishop in the maneuvering game with e4 idea it was over and he made it look easy anon kbov tied for first in the challengers section i mean korobov is like higher rated and has a higher peak rating than many of the participants of the masters corov and the masters would be cooking up a storm too but he is cooking in the challenger section speaking of another man who is in the kitchen all right and my man is cooking up some good stuff it is an giri gesh yesterday losing to dingl ren tries to create a very complex english opening this is a sideline d3 normally here they are playing a3 e3 or g3 the not g4 although maybe but uh no g3 and e3 are the main lines d3 is just creating a reverse sicilian and now g3 and now we're playing really a reverse sicilian it's a sicilian dragon reversed uh the knight goes back to f6 modern games also go knight b6 very often as well as bishop e6 bishop b7 he does this and now giri plays this move spends eight minutes and he does not develop the bishop to g2 bishop g5 wow why what about h6 oh he was ready to take he was ready to give up the bishop and then just i guess play a position like where he was going to pressure gukesh like this on the cile fascinating i mean i love this type of i love this an giri this man is coming to make all his opponents uncomfortable he's kicking them under the table he's stealing pawns off the chess board i mean it's amazing stuff bishop g2 castles castles and like i said that bishop went in to die take take that bishop knew its purpose it was not going to be able to stand around anywhere or make itself useful and now he's just going to pressure the queen side a5 committal decision stopping white from playing b4 a3 committal decision trying to re allow the move b4 knight d4 looking to clarify matters and pawn to c6 you' be you' be you bet your life c6 is going to be played next replacing the knight stopping the pawn blocking the bishop anish plays knight uh he plays e3 i apologies targets the knight knight takes bishop takes c6 completely equal position very imbalanced white has a majority of pawns in the center white has a minority of pawns on the queen side white has a knight for a bishop white is stronger on the light squares cuz two of these pieces can fight on the light squares this piece however is weaker than that piece on dark squares so white might try to get a b5 going if white can get b4 b5 white's playing for something queen c2 rook c1 then if we trade the knight is going to go there and there let's let's see if it's going to happen queen c2 rook d1 defending ourselves knight a4 we're fighting for the dark squares cuz they're actually completely available like sometimes you have a mercenary that that can go and fight for the dark squares but this is the move that will make or break the position for both sides if anish giri is successfully able to implement the game plan here he's going to be in good shape they're also very tough to decide what to do with black white is somehow defending himself perfectly so what's next b5 and now a massive question mark to the black position we're about to get the same end game that we had in ding's game remember prague ding where it was five versus 4 d through h versus e through h same exact pawns but an extra d pawn look at this it's about to be five versus four d through h fascinating right that's very interesting the person with the extra pawn in dings game had the bishop rook takes d3 gkes sacrifices the rook to create bishop d3 queen d3 rook a4 and i guess his logic was opposite color bishops i can't lose not going to be able to lose this game massive decision massive apparently he shouldn't have done that apparently he should have played like rook a5 take take he should have just held on to this weakness for a little while but he plays rook d3 he wants to clarify matters now and anish trades everything down and takes he's able to take because of the back rank okay rook a7 so it's opposite colored bishops it's identical level of pawns so who's better well white why well if you compare the quality of the bishops right like white's bishop is better than black's bishop it's actually got a target white's got all the pawns on the right color right this this if this pawn was e6 g6 they agree to withdraw but this is all we got working for us right rook b5 it's actually a shockingly difficult position to play for black cuz white has a lot of threats queen e7 we poke at the rook we get the rook off the seventh rank now we play rook b8 rook b7 now we won the seven rank now kukes makes a massive decision he trades the queens but he breaks his structure apart so he's still equal pawns and the queens are off what do we know about opposite colored bishop end games probably a draw g5 he's just trying to trade he's trying to trade as much as possible bishop h7 take take but look at the this is not the same structure man that three and that three are not the same check rook d2 the king goes to f1 h4 and guess what anisha is still able to trade because there is no you can't play rook h this rook h7 you can't take so in this absolutely absurd position if something like king g8 were to be played bishop h5 and then king f8 this is apparently the way you try to draw this you get the king over here you play rook d6 and you stubbornly sit and wait with your atrocious doubled e- pawns but because ges does it this way it allows anish to get the rook to f7 you still can't take and now he gets the pawn to h5 and now he has very very very big winning chances cuz black's king is stuck in the corner and wh's king can mobilize while he wins the second pawn so gukesh could have played king g8 rook e7 rook d6 but if he played rook d6 there is this this h6 now you're definitely dead so he gets this pawn up end game it's really a two- pawn up end game got to be winning got to be winning and anish giri i hate to say this i hate to say this but an giri looking like magnus carlson out here now stockfish is still kind of saying this is drawable it's still showing like this is a fortress and black's got a fortress and you can't win this and it was saying that for a very long time i think practically speaking this is extremely difficult and here instead of rook b3 gukesh had to play rook b6 and try to go back to f6 play rook b6 um he didn't like that i guess he didn't he didn't like how that looked he didn't like i don't know what he didn't like maybe he thought like you can sack so maybe he thought three pawns and a bishop are probably losing as it turns out this is a draw which is insane you put your king on g4 what you get your king active and the point is that it's too many pawns you rook a6 apparently this is a draw which looks insane but white can't make progress cuz king g5 and you create a fortress and white can't advance king d5 you give checks king d4 you give a check king e3 you give a check if the king goes back now the king's cut off now the king's never going to join the pawns which is you know you play rook a5 like apparently yeah ges doesn't find that and uh anish gets the king to the magic square once once once he's going to win the third pawn it's just game over and u anish giri has uh he he's got three and a half points anish giri after four rounds of t of steel has three and a half out of four ali ros has got three he made a quick draw against nck nock has had a very very calm event but he had that insane game against param yesterday and our standings in the challengers that's that's the same thing oops why is that that's no it should it here are your standings in the challengers arowin lami hans nean anon kov all tied for first with three points elina who is the uh strong dutch uh junior player unfortunately has zero points she has yet to get on the board she had a event thus far hopefully she improves i got there's no easy match ups there and pam makulu shocking half out of four donchenko j and june tied with one uh but still many more rounds to go prand takes down dingl ren world uh he is the indian number one tomorrow is a rest day get out of here
