ladies and gentlemen i've got a question if you could have anything you wanted in chess what would it be would it be the return permanently of mittens would it be frank getting to grand master would it be you finally hitting 500 elo would it be magnus versus hikaru on demand anytime we want because in today's video i am going to be sharing with you two games that they played yesterday in the title tuesday tournament they were each paired against each other in both the morning edition and the evening edition and i did live commentary on both of these games the first one was live on stream the second one was actually off stream that's how dedicated i am to this i hope you enjoy come on dude do it for my youtube content oh we accepted let's go hikaru's got white he starts with a3 because he likes to troll all right now it's a queen's gambit d4 c4 it's a it's a king's indian that's what it is it's a king's indian defense all right that's what this is a king's indian where both sides have played a3 a6 actually i think this probably benefits black because i think black in many lines likes to play a6 i don't think white likes to play a3 alright c5 magnus is not going for e5 he's going for the c5 and now hikaru is doing this in a way where he doesn't take or do anything he doesn't play d5 yeah he's just keeping the tension at some point magnus will run out of moves he might have to take on there it is wow all right bishop b7 or rook a7 because this is a huge threat okay rook a7 now hikaru's got cannons this is one move what else i really like white's position by the way don't you i really like white's position i would just play like rook c1 b4 this is what i would do computer really likes a4a5 a4 with the idea of poking there and then if black plays a5 it's a massive over commitment and then okay yeah see see hikaru plays like i play which is either a very good sign or a very bad sign i would have played b4 because you know it feels very weird to play a4 but a4 a5 was the idea there let's see i said rook c1 and b4 all right now magnus probably wants to put a knight on e5 because he can't put a knight on c5 anymore yeah i just said before rook c1 right i i just said that you see when i don't play the games i don't get so nervous you see how i said rook c1 b4 all right now it's a massive question of uh you know knight t5 right knight to five now it's a massive question of what's next if i think taking is a massive mistake by the way by magnus because it gives hikaru unrestricted access to c6 and that would be really bad uh what did magnus play he played e6 so he's like okay hikaru it's not checkers i don't have to take so you take me now hikaru plays g3 to try to go here and magnus plays there and probably he will play knight e5 attacking this and hikaru will play i don't know queen v3 queen e2 whoa but now hikaru can play f4 no but then e5 might be a problem uh any bonus points in the chat if you know what the structure is called by black hedgehog hedgehog structure i didn't give you a chance to answer all right that's not hanging yeah you got it you got to go for h3f oh oh oh wait a minute wait a minute by the way i love how they're just the two titans like these guys are 32-65 average oh my goodness you see if hikaru could play at four and knight d7 would happen he would be in great shape but actually magnus is threatening to take this and then anchor in his knight this is actually very bad hikaru's got to be very careful here the computer wants b5 because it prevents black from playing b5 okay knight f3 is a more human approach but now magnus will take and play b5 he's just gonna be a pawn up and 45 seconds which is exactly where kikaru wants him by the way whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa because i feel like hikaru ah he got a pawn back he got a pawn back he used tricks and he got a pawn back use some tactics but here comes magnus rook c3 on the way potentially rook c3 yeah this is a problem i mean the queen side here is under a bit of fire oh my god that's so that's so nasty tactical defense anyway as i was saying hikaru's got him right where he wants him because this is like the type of position that hikaru will save for breakfast or lunch or dinner queen d3 this is nuts look at this everything's defended i mean the man has defended everything stop engine move yo yo hold you what oh my god we have got to analyze that bishop i saw the idea of bishop a1 it was absolutely stupid okay magnus is trying to trade the queens and he's trying to win the end game by utilizing his long range pieces because this knight is very bad and the bishop doesn't have to be on a what the heck bishop a1 oh my lord okay now yeah now now now it at least makes more sense to move the bishop like i would go bishop e5 because you need yeah of course you need to go to d6 uh hikaru is in a tough spot it's very tough to move any pieces magnus should probably just slowly bring his king or that what is the idea of that move i don't know is he trying to go here okay i have no idea anymore ah knight wow it's really tough to move oh my goodness hikaru can't move a piece bishop e2 oh my goodness bishop f2 though i guess he's chucking it to play e5 maybe i don't know but e5 yeah bishop g2 pawns though right no but then knights no this hangs king g2 and then knight c4 you really never know with hikaru man i'm telling you like you don't want to do this because king g2 knight c4 but uh i mean it's got to be the right move right king g2 all right 40 seconds i mean if he saves this game it's it's okay rook f1 hikaru is so good with his back to the wall i mean it's really no no bishop d1 doesn't work yeah rookie one is the only move and or that should be six nope knight t2 but what about this knight f3 how does he do this like how does he just keep the game going i mean it's so it's probably over like bishop d7 is is an idea or bishop c2 oh it's a mutual scramble now dude oh my there's no way right 12 seconds oh my god magnus has 10 seconds on the clock oh my god this is nuts there's no way right bishop c3 it's gotta be over oh mike i'm terrified here that's it right oh he's he's gone wait he's sacking everything whoa king g2 wait the rook the rook oh the pawn the pawn the pawn that yeah yeah yeah that's okay okay no more extracurricular activities it's it's gotta be um bishop f5 it was just oh okay yeah that ah all right magnus got one back i don't know the last time that magnus actually won in title tuesday wow that was the first time magnus won entitled tuesday against hikaru in a very long time actually wow yeah that's tough um okay can we can we please address bishop a1 multiple times in the middle game the computer wanted bishop a1 it wanted bishop a1 here i think or where yeah here top engine move bishop a1 what do you know what the idea of bishop a1 is oh my god the idea of bishop 2a1 is that black wants to play e5 so black wants to play e5 bishop d4 oh my god oh my god and there's no way to anchor that any other way and if you play bishop b2 oh well that's really sad i could probably draw this game okay i'm inspired now i'm inspired alright folks here it is last time they played actually the last few times they've played um hikaru has played a3 this time he goes for a normal opening i imagine magnus will go for sicilian maybe a french oh he goes for asics oh my god this is insane wow all right i mean that's pretty bold playing a3 with white is ridiculous these dudes just refuse to play each other on normal grounds so at least they have a built-in excuse when one of them loses um magnus is playing a hippo i guess kind of he's playing a baby pierce i mean he hasn't put his bishop here which i don't really know what else you could do wow is magnus just gonna feed and kettle both bishops but not actually move them there this is insane this is like a tremendous level of disrespect oh let me know if you enjoy the offline commentary hikaru playing nice and solid here uh not complicated yep keeping it nice and tight magnus will play knight d7 or castle although in a lot of these hippos you tend not to castle there's positions you you don't castle um at some point white has a completely dominant center and could get really aggro hikaru playing a bit of a waiting move also a bit of a prophylactic move just kind of making you know just a just a useful flexible move five now is according to the computer completely winning apparently white is perfectly equipped now to just send a rocket ship down the center of the board uh yeah hikaru a bit hesitant to do that magnus takes takes and now apparently magnus has to castle and he does uh and visually speaking i mean it looks like again the cannons are just absolutely pointed in this direction but and the hikaru does in fact like the move queen g3 it's not an easy position though and and magnus does meet him there now and it's one of these positions where you have to jump in and do something for example knight h4 here looks decent but it doesn't carry much of an issue knight f5 now is apparently very good and you cannot play queen g6 yeah hikaru's gotten himself in a little bit of a situation here now d5 is very well timed if it wasn't for d5 hikaru is sacrificing a pawn here damaging magnus's structure if it wasn't for that move magnus would have played knight e7 and had a very powerful bishop like for example he would have went knight e7 but we can analyze after so hikaru is actually better um apparently the other knight to d4 was preferred the computer preferred keeping a knight on f3 i think it's because if hikaru had moved that night there he could have moved this knight here and here uh magnus is now utilizing the g file and has slightly weakened king actually against hikaru uh magnus's bishop is totally offside here he could try to move it into the game and trade it but he also can put his rook on e4 which is just extremely menacing uh hikaru would like to put his knight on d4 and the knight on d4 versus a light scored bishop is like a french bishop not that this is a french defense it's kind of a french defense yeah there's bishop a4 which when the when these guys are playing my moves i get concerned now hikaru could play rook d2 to unpin himself he'd like to play knight t4 but he would need to go here and i wonder if magnus's intention is to capture the knight because if the knight goes to d4 it will never be removed ever and yeah magnus is thinking because it's actually very unpleasant to take with either piece and i think probably taking here is bad but what so if bishop takes bishop c6 oh my god i mean the computer's unconcerned it's just i i don't know if hikara will have the nerves to play rook d2 that is a crazy move it makes sense though i mean it unpins it transposes to the other line yeah d4 is a crazy move again this move deals with this pin it deals with the threat on g2 your bishop is a sunk cost you're not going to be able to save it because if you touch it bishop c6 hikaru might just think he's in trouble after d4 but obviously i'm sitting here watching with the engine on um so it's a little easier yeah hikaru significantly tanking and he does find it after 53 seconds of thought that's a long time and he's still better queen h3 now attacks this and and forces a trade um not really a trade but um i mean that the bishop is just hanging black has to take uh magnus takes in a way that f5 is defended and now locks this in but again i still think hikaru is probably visually for choice uh with some of these targets but as you can see his advantage dissipated very quickly apparently after bishop before he had to do something else so stockfish clearly unimpressed and gives a lot of value to this very powerful bishop on e4 and uh yeah i might be making a slight amendment i mean the more pieces that you trade the better it gets for white if the queens come off and white can play g3 white will never get mated and the bishop will not have a target the knight and the rooks on the other hand are quite nice and hikara does play that magnus could play d5 okay he's going for naughty stuff over here this looks terrifying rook c1 there rook c5 there might just be queen b1 somehow there is no mate i mean wow i think if white tries to do if black tries to do this it's just too slow i think now also there's queenie one uh the computer wants to leave and i guess go this way but that seems i mean yeah apparently now knight e6 is just a fork but there is queen h1 but apparently oh my goodness oh hikaru missed it there was a fork and magnus just trades oh my gosh and uh this is defended now probably rook b2 is a nice move to attack the weakness and then yeah hikaru now will be able to play this in this and he's completely fine as long as he can play king d2 and knight d4 yeah this is good stuff there it is he's gonna get the blockade he doesn't even have to do that he could try to do some other stuff like rook b4 and a4 he really wants to play for a win magnus i guess is trying to yep there it is very well timed move magnus down to 10 seconds ba okay hikaru going for a6 and maybe by extension a4 rook b7 rook b2 is scary agnes just walking in his king i mean that's that's a that's a terrifying sight because if you lose that you might lose everything else although h6 is hanging but apparently kikara doesn't take it rook here okay i guess it's just a draw king g2 king f2 and i don't think that this is losable but i'm not the one playing the game oh maybe it is losable yes they will just repeat moves maybe they won't just repeat moves and then if knight d4 he will try again yep yep yep yep yep apparently g4 now that's a very tough move to play that's that's oh my god if if there's a man alive who would play that and keep his nerves at hikaru there's no threat it's just no threat and okay just don't play f6 and hang everything now you can play f6 king g5 oh magnus flagged oh my god oh my god that's crazy i did not even realize how little time she had that's insanity what a hold by hikaru super clutch and he takes the lead um the end game is a draw if just king g5 that's just a fork i mean it was right there for the taking this is just a draw but my god i mean if there is a man alive in the position after rook a7 that plays g4 in sicaro i mean that's just insanity completely cold-blooded evaluating this safely and wow uh that's how it goes sometimes and apparently magnus blundered big time with uh queen b1 apparently apparently there was just a fork which is funny i guess rook c3 queen c3 yeah and there's like a mate threat and if you play queen h1 looking for all this you take that rook and the king walks out freely and you block so hikaru was winning for a move half a move but as always they provided us with a high quality battle and uh ultimately a draw but i mean my god wow oh my gosh that was what a game
