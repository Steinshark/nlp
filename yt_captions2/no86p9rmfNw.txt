ladies and gentlemen it's currently thursday may 4th 2023 and if you've been following the chess world at all you know that we recently crowned a new world champion and that world champion is not named magnus carlson in today's video i will be telling you my exact thought process for why magnus relinquished the world championship title and the answer or the reveal might surprise you it has nothing to do with yanyupomishi or dingly ren it has to do with a british dude named frank and if you've been following chess content whatsoever over the last 30 to 60 days you will know exactly what i'm talking about um i have done a few collabs now at this point uh with frank from the uk and he is rapidly improving in strength he might be improving at a rate that magnus carlson could only hope to aspire to and in today's video i will share with you some of the recent games that frank has played as he has surged past 500 and up to even 600 elo now this is really sensational stuff frank was 500 for like three days and then he got up to 600 as i am recording this video he is almost halfway to 700 and it hasn't even been 12 hours this is truly spectacular stuff now maybe frank was 2800 elo to start with and he was just i don't know nerfing himself for content but this th this is really something and i would love to share this with all of you so a series of about five to six games uh from yesterday and frank is only improving uh and his elo is only climbing higher now of course he's still making mistakes or we're gonna analyze so his opponent starts out with a nim so larson and then plays e4 just kind of weird nothing crazy yet love what frank's doing here uh this is a very bad move i don't know why you're putting the bishop to people blocked by two pawns frank is a principled man all right he plays the move d5 two pawns in the center knight d5 now here frank misses the attack on this pawn he should of course just develop the bishop he plays bishop b6 okay whatever plunders upon typical 600 you know 560 elo stuff uh but now he castles and good things are gonna happen to you if you play like this right if you just develop your pieces in the center of the board in the new castle uh frank now plays a fantastic move i love knight before looking to get the knight for the bishop trade bishop c4 can't really hate on this trade whatsoever f5 is a nice idea trying to open up the queen to go here and also conveniently attacked the pawn on c4 and basically to gain elo at this level you need to outlast your opponents you basically need to be the one to make the second to last mistake or just make less mistakes in general well in this position franklin quarks the move knight takes c2 now knight takes c2 is a fascinating idea because when this knight goes here suddenly the knight sees everything the queen sees the night the rooks are staring at each other and the bishops see the bishop and regard like white can't take everything and run so white tries to do this frank trades and now of course the ending of the combination should have been this move but instead he plays the move queen to h4 but okay then he takes the best it's typical 500 stuff queen f5 now this game was a fight to the death this was the hunger games of low elo chess as his opponent was trying to get him to take the queen and get back rank mated but what frank realized is the bishop is actually guarding the rook now he also went back and then actually went forward and started launching a monstrous attack of his own and in this position frank can actually take the queen he can take the queen because after rook takes the eight it's not actually backcrank mate since the bishop can come back which is very nice and then frank is winning but he didn't see that because he's not a smurf instead here frank played a ridiculously creative move and i'm not just saying that because you know that's my way of being nice this was a very unique idea frank wanted to get the rook away from the defense over here and he played the move bishop to c1 which is amazing uh let me undo that he played the move bishop to c1 and the point is that if you play rook takes i'm getting this for free so his opponent did this and now frank took the pawn and a few moves later uh frank got into a queen and night end game defended against checkmate forked the rook immediately swarmed the king and right before his opponent was able to infiltrate rook f1 was the dagger what a game a back and forth affair making sure his king was protected on the back rank clutch defensive performance there uh from frank and he had another game with the black pieces this one was a london he went after the bishop look at this edgy stuff uh tried to kick the bishop around now here he did something kind of weird like generally if you're gonna play knight h5 you should probably take the bishop because otherwise i don't really know what you're doing um but he doesn't he kind of does whatever he wants and then he played e5 which is which is incredible look at utilizing this pin uh and his opponent cannot actually sufficiently capture so his opponent's gotta like move and now a fork and he's just winning i mean he's beating the london in nine moves out here which is i mean every player's uh but then he didn't take the knight for some reason uh you know from a frank is a genius every it's every player's dream to beat the london right this quickly of course you just take the knight here but you see frank is really smart frank played bishop before check now of course white should just play here and now you cannot really take this because probably i will just go here but frank knew that his opponent in this position would be possessed by low elo demons and instead of hanging a knight he hung a queen and whereas the last game that frank played was like a back and forth and the the this and that no frank in this game just converted how do you win a position where you're up such a massive amount of material trade down a few pieces and then probably launch a devastating attack knight takes bishop exactly right bishop takes knight exactly right couldn't have played it better myself and now that you've castled your rook has an open line of sight boom i mean this man is playing 1000 level chess and he's got a 574 rating and look at this i mean the rook just goes on a roller coaster just eating every pawn in its path and now in this position he plays probably his best move of the game i know he's already crushing but d4 is just amazing an amazing move to get the knight and the queen into the position by forcing a pawn trade a couple moves later he took here and then his knight got in took on b3 the queen is hitting the king in goes the queen on d4 and just clinical absolutely clinical technique check check check and down to f1 i mean this is amazing like this is the opening was a little bit tricky i don't love the the moving the knight and then the pawn but i mean he made it work he pinned the knight to the queen and he made it work this is i mean this is exactly how you play on peace mechanics this is like perfect play here for you know trying to get the 600 i'm telling you he's playing 1 000 level chess another game we have d4 uh another london this time frank doesn't go for knight c6 knight h5 you know frank's not a one-dimensional pony okay put some respect on his name this time he plays the the world championship preparation c5 yanipom she played against ding loren in the world champs uh we have dc5 now the way you're supposed to win this pawn bag is to play e6 but you know frank makes his own rules 94 and knight c5 but he's fine and i mean for a second game in a row he's doing super well against the london and this game my man frank got edgy with it my man frank went pawn to e6 knight to c6 and he met the move knight b5 looking to get in here of course he should just play rook c8 this man played oh oh oh long castling into this now he might have done that by mistake he might have like accidentally clicked that square and then it like moved it like that's happened like for example if i touch my king and then i'm like ah actually i don't want a castle i want to go uh move my rook instead look what happens if you touch the king and then touch the rook chess.com just assumes that you cannot put two and two together so they like help you out very very annoying um but you know uh his opponent did not follow up with it with the right response his opponent of course should start upon attack but instead plays knight e5 which immediately blunders because not all trades are the same his opponent's idea was knight takes bishop takes and then some sort of attack but he failed to realize that when black's knight moves to e5 the queen's line of sight opens up here so every time a piece moves in chess that's the stuff you gotta think about what other pieces can see now now the opponent's like oh actually i didn't mean it and now frank plays a6 and f6 and it's just a p sub now let's watch him convert this game uh let me just turn the color back on queen d6 e4 closed the center with pawn to d4 just don't blunder anything okay i'm not not a huge fan but bishop d6 and now frank misses something very fun you always have to look for checks and frank's just got to do a little bit more puzzles this is something that you build up as you play more chess uh in this position black only has one check and before you do anything else you should really scan for this check bishop takes h2 and that just wins you the queen so this is like for all of you trying to improve let frank be your ambassador that's just a free night by the way that's just a one mover uh blocks excellent c3 now get the king i would get the king out of the way so you're never susceptible to pawn to b4 because now you see you really need to play king b8 in this position or you need to offer a trade of queens so that you're no longer pinned right but that doesn't happen um instead we have rookie eight his opponent does play bc frank plays bishop takes h2 queen h6 and then wins the queen this is probably the most sophisticated i would say this is the greatest tactic frank has ever played ever in this position frank's opponent takes his knight and if frank takes the queen he'll lose his queen but if frank takes the pawn he will lose his rook so what does frank do of course he can just trade queens but here frank plays bishop takes h2 check and after king takes back both queens are still hanging but now this and now check on the king the queen moves out of danger and the queen has no way to escape and frank with a three move combo picks up the queen i mean what who taught this man rook d4 he cleans up gets in and it's queen h6 and it's rook d1 and it's game over and frank is now a game away all right he is a game away i mean this is two games away uh chess.com counts your official rating and and he never stopped another london no problem all right another london this time frank plays it slightly differently knight e4 he doesn't play it perfectly in fact he gets quite a bad position early what did frank do wrong in this position uh you never want to play c4 in the london you never want to do that you want to keep the pressure on the center but even if you do this it's fine uh and you don't want to play these kind of like random h pawn moves bishop in the center bishop f5 e6 and you don't want to make multiple moves with the same pieces before you finish developing he made multiple moves knight e4 totally unnecessary knight e4 his opponent's got way too many pieces out and frank doesn't have anything out so frank should play bishop f5 frank should play e6 and all of this so sometimes when you're 600 you you know you break you break the principles and it happens all right that's you you cannot always play at a at a high enough level where you're going to consistently improve this is a very bad decision because not only did frank lose upon he also lost all of his development and then he not only is down upon in development he triple isolated his e-pawns and queen h5 check is now devastating because the king has to go here and at the very least i can win a rook and this was all caused by frank's mistakes so what did he do wrong made multiple moves with pieces that he already developed sabotaging his own development not only do they sabotage his own development in the process he actually greatly improved his opponent's position then he lost the pawn and then he opened up his king but his opponent played knight g6 in one go and then here and that allowed frank to actually castle and now he's not that much worse his opponent plays queen b3 now here frank you know sees that his pawn is hanging and decides it's better to lose a rook than to lose upon which is inaccurate that's not a good decision his opponent doesn't see that his opponent only sees this and doesn't see this at all and so goes here now what should have his opponent done take first because the queen is hanging and the rook is hanging and black can't stop both threats um this rook d7 and the opponent keeps dancing around and trying to but this is a terrible decision so not all trades are the same you are taught at a very you know young young age low elo you are taught three for three is a fair trade this is not a fair trade black's dark scored bishop has not moved the entire game it's stuck behind two pawns that white knight is galloping around the board triumphantly what you want to do here for white is lock in an outpost an outpost is a square in your opponent's position from where a piece can park and never be removed without material loss and no peace in black's position is going to be able to take that knight unless it's a rook or a queen instead of that we have this and as we have seen throughout these games frank is a monster rolling downhill and uh frank in this position plays the move e6 which is using his triple stack against his opponent pawn takes e6 is a fatal error and in this position frank sacrifices the queen on d1 for a back rank checkmate incredible one of the most common tactical patterns in chess frank detonates it on an unsuspecting opponent his opponent didn't have a killer instinct in this game and goes down and folks it's not stopping frank with the white pieces has also been well that's a terrible move uh frank you cannot put two pawns in the center if you're gonna lose one you know you got to move your bishop which is what i taught you but it's just a pawn and we've seen him come back from worse this time he decided to give his opponent a little bit of odds but uh b4 his opponent went 94 hanging queen now the knight is hanging this queen is hanging his opponent negating development now the queen takes the knight the queen is still hanging now frank gets a rook too plays bishop d3 rook d1 and his opponent plays queen c3 check ryan can take that but he feels bad for his opponent but his opponent insists his opponent insisting on the loss of the queen and um yeah it's uh it's going to be over soon and by soon i mean right now and frank beats a 600 and for the first time ever frank has crossed 600 elo he won six out of seven games to get there that's not the end that is not the end of the story because when i sat down to prepare this video today frank started playing a few more games and this man just will not stop he is a man on a mission he will not be denied of whatever it is his rating is his rating goals are you won't stop look at frank playing the vienna the two pawns and the knight on c3 now here you're supposed to take but knight f3 i also told frank never to take this pawn but you know we'll we'll get there one step at a time bishop c5 bishop c4 bishop c5 knight g4 and frank you know because he didn't study the vienna perfectly runs into a little bit of trouble but it's all good uh and then this game gets real weird rook h1 which just loses the game to queen h4 check his opponent goes here now rook h5 we call this the frank vienna f6 now he goes here attacking the bishop the bishop infiltrates knight e3 actually wins the queen i don't know if that was some sort of miracle or what you can take you can take but if you do that there's queen d1 so frank loses the queen for two pieces and he's just busted up i mean he's going to lose the bishop he's going to lose the knight but then here he finds bishop back to e2 but black takes this now frank is down eight points of material so he brings his rook back takes on that five billy comes back to h5 bishop g4 and queen g4 by the way both win his opponent goes here takes this and is just completely winning g6 bishop f3 and then in this position for reasons i cannot fully explain i've been telling you all this entire time the last person to make the mistake is the one that loses we have four check frank takes the queen his opponent spent 10 seconds on that move played the worst move on the board frank backs up and now here come the bishops the triumphant and glorious bishops rookie seven rook e3 discover check and it gets even worse because after losing his queen in his rook his opponent lost the game frank is up to 630 he has not lost in 48 hours frank has not lost a chess game in 48 hours could we be seeing the greatest arc in chess since magnus carlson wow this guy's the limit now get out of here
