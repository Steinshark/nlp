all right so let's first start with this whole hacker news article right here keep linux open and free we can't afford not to this is oracle classically known as the people who happen to own the javascript trademark and have actually sent cease and desist letters if you didn't know to people with the word javascript in their uh website name horrible company that's all that's now can preach to us about the glories and the goodness of being good which clearly they're not okay oracle let's let's hear about it oracle i love to hear about it hey nice website oracle nice linkedin good job uh oracle has been part of the linux community for 25 years our goal has remained the same over those years to help make linux the best server operating system for everyone freely available to all with high quality low-cost support providing to those who need it our linux engineering team makes significant contributions to the kernel file system and tools wow corporate speak we push all the work back to the main line so that every linux distribution can include it we are proud those contributions are part of the reason linux is now so very capable benefiting not just oracle customers but all users did oracle just take the w the reason why linux is now a very great capable operating system is because of oracle did i just read that correctly i made this i made this in 2006 we launched what is now called oracle linux a hell compatible distribution and supporting a support offering that is used widely and powers oracle's engineered systems in our cloud infrastructure we chose to be hail compatible because we did not want to fragment the linux community oh really but you wanted the charges my assumption why why fracture at all you could have just used linux crazy that you would create your own crazy i don't even get it maybe i'm just stupid um our efforts to remain compatible has been enormously successful cute anime eyebrows uh in the year since launch we have almost no compatibility bugs filed customers and isvs i'm not sure what isvs are uh um it can switch to oracle linux from hell without modifying their application we certify oracle software products on real even though they are built and tested on oracle linux uh only never on sale okay rail red hat enterprise linux independent safe versions though that we just call those arch users or tarnished okay just wanted to make sure i had the right thing just in case my head i somehow didn't have it um okay while oracle and ibm have compatible linux distributions we have very different ideas about our responsibilities as open source stewards and and about operating under the v2 uh oracle has always made oracle linux binaries and source freely available to all we do not have subscription agreements that interfere with the subscribers right to redistribute uh oracle linux okay okay on the other hand ibm oh man they're going at it on the other hand ibm subscription agreements specify that you're in breach if you use those subscription services to exercise your jibbled v2 rights and now as of june 21st ibm no longer publicly releases rails source code okay okay okay oracle going at okay oracles go for the throat which is really shocking uh i mean i i'm just surprised that larry ellison was able to write this article while potentially murdering people on his worldwide yacht races i i'm i'm shocked that he has the time for all of this why did ibm make this change well if you read ibm you're sorry i blog attempting to explain its rationale it boils down to this and red hat thousands of people spend their time writing code to enable new features fixing bugs integrating different packages and sporting that work for a long time we have to pay the people to do that work it's kind of juicy interesting ibm doesn't want to continue publicly interesting this article is kind of snarky i had no idea this article is going to be this snarky interesting ibm doesn't want to continue publicly releasing rel source code because it has to pay engineers that seems odd given that red hat as a successful independence so open source company chose to publicly release morale source and pay its engineers for many years before ibm acquired red hat in 2019 for 34 billion coincidence i think not am i reading the inquirer is what am i reading what the hell am i reading right now am i reading some sort of juicy gossip column what what twitter has ruined everything i'm convinced of it the blog goes on to mention centos the freshmaker and it's no surprise that centos was top of mind uh for the author attempting to justify withholding a relic source centos had been very popular free rail uh compatible distribution in december 2020 ibm effectively killed it as a free alternative torell two new alternatives darrell have sprung up uh in centos place the freshmaker of course alma linux and rocky linux now by withholding rel source code ibm has directly attacked them and perhaps that is the real answer to the question of why eliminating competitors fewer competitors means more revenue opportunity for ibm well they did pay 40 34 billion for for you know i'm not gonna lie to you 34 billion dollars for a linux distribution that just seems kind of crazy i maybe i don't understand software anymore i think i'm old or am i too young or my two old young or am i just too dumb mate i don't know what it is but how did you get debated into buying how did you get how how did you do that uh as for oracle we will continue pursuing our goal as uh for linux as transparently and as openly as we have uh have uh always have while minimizing fragmentation we will continue to develop and test our software products on oracle linux we don't fracture but we have oracle linux we'll continue to be rel compatible to the extent we can make it so in the past oracle's access to published rail source has been important for maintaining that compatibility from a practical standpoint we believe oracle linux will remain as compatible as it always has been through released 9.2 but after that there may be a greater chance for compatibility issues to arise if incompatibility does affect a customer or isv remember that's independent severe version oracle will work to remedy the problem what i hear what i'm hearing with my ears is that oracle's upset because they want to be able to successfully take the customers from ibm with no friction and now ibm's like checkmate atheist and now look at what's happening now everybody's all upset and now oracle's trying to take this high ground virtue signal road well i actually said so we love open source oh by the way oh is that do you have the word javascript in your website you get that off right now we live up we're the greatest open sources of all time we'd love you guys uh larry when you get back from murdering people on your yacht worldwide cruise please come back we need you it's like dude what the hell is this we want to emphasize by the way if those don't know larry ellison has been accused of letting people die in the ocean because he wanted to win a yacht race like that's the accusation whether it's true or not it's an accusation i personally will never be accused of murdering somebody in the ocean right so that's the good news is that all you have to do is not do that and people won't think you'll do that you know i'm just just saying i'm just saying allegedly may have murdered somebody we don't know uh we want to emphasize to linux developers linux customers and linux distributions that oracle is committed to linux freedom hold oracle makes the following promise as long as oracle distribute distributes linux oracle will make the binaries and source code for that distribution public and freely available furthermore oracle welcomes downstream distributions of every kind community and commercial we are happy to work with distributors to ease that process work together on the content of oracle linux and ensure oracle software products are certified on your distribution by the way if you are a linux developer who disagrees with ibm's action and you believe in linux freedom the way we do we are hiring really i thought this piece was all about open source said goodness i didn't think this was a sales pitch or a hiring attempt crazy me one observation for independent service versions uh ibm's actions are not your uh in your best interest by killing centos the freshmaker as a rel alternative in attacking alma linux and rocky linux ibm is eliminating one way your customers save money and make a lot a larger share of their wallet available to you if you don't yet support your product on oracle linux we would be happy to show you how easy that is give your customers more choice baby by also ensuring that you may pay us finally to ibm here's a big idea for you hey ibm you say that you don't want to pay all those rel developers here's how you can save money just pull from us become a downstream distributor of oracle linux will happily take on that burden this is the most savage article i've ever read you know i always thought oracle is just a piece of sh now i know they're just a piece of but they actually can do something pretty funny i am super impressed by this i am super impressed that they actually wrote this blog this is an incredible incredible piece of just on your competition in the highest most amazing way possible this is so dang funny and i am shocked i am shook i am completely blown away that they've actually done this and it was actually oracle okay so someone's saying the give the seuss one what's the seuss one give it to me well can someone link that to me give me the next thing i need the next thing give it to me give me give it to me okay so yeah so let's go over some of the hacker news responses here yeah this is just an opportunistic pr oracle cares less about open source than even the most brain dead red hatter as with all things oracle they are taking the angle that potentially creates a revenue opportunity for themselves which is i mean obvious when they're just like hey ibm how about you let us do it all hahaha you only put 34 billion in it just a couple years ago this is fine i get it but doing it under the guise of higher open source ideals is comically transparent dude this is facts they still i mean look at what they've done to javascript people on twitter uh uh there i don't know what oel they're aol market share mostly consists of them targeting specific red hat accounts and severely undercutting rail costs since red hat encouraged significantly more development burden and costs and using it as a launch pad to embed myriad of other oracle products within the customer ecosystem other products that conveniently aren't grounded in their supposed open source ideals dude just it's just i mean this is just microsoft playbook 101 right microsoft does this crap all the time i mean this is it this is why they do it right well like think about this one get up copilot x it's available only in vs code but copilot's available everywhere like they're almost creating an ecosystem why it's weird that they have language services servers that are kind of closed source they do these things because they want you in their ecosystem so they can sell you more of their products right everything is designed this is the problem about taking free stuff anytime you take free stuff you must understand that free comes with a cost always it always does it's one thing that i like about apple is at least apple they're like we will make you pay for it and you're like okay i'm doing a business transaction right like that feels better i would prefer that you know uh oracle does not care about open source to the extent that they have been the top linux kernel uh contributor several times uh or eric or oracle does care about open source okay interesting here you go uh oracle actually does not undercut uh the least expensive red hat support offerings oracle linux support is for 500 a year for basic uh fourteen hundred dollars for premiere both tiers allow 24 7 uh access to file service requests um okay is this is is chisel chazzle it's chazal it's chazil uh some sort of employee some sort of a red hat has a more complicated support structure starting with workstation self-support 200 a month workstation 8x5 support 300 a month self server self support 350 server 8x5 support uh 800 server 27 support 1300 okay if you'd be interested uh i it would be interesting if ibm did exactly what this oracle block suggests finally ibm here's a big idea for you still my favorite line of the whole thing why you rapping eight by five i don't know linux does care about open source counterpoints oracle killed open solaris oracle killed open office oracle killed hudson oracle attempted to make a case uh a law such that apis fall under copyright oh no this is gonna keep on going this is just oh gosh here we go oracle does not care about open source to the extent that they have been the top back when i worked for hallway we regularly figured in the top list of contributors to the linux kernel each cycle i never got the impression that huawei cares about open source it was just a pragmatic disinterested business decision also you shouldn't anthromorphosize oracle let's go it's easier to answer more of a size oracle if you consider it as one rich  called ariel oh no yeah but the dude is like a lawnmower what does that even mean yeah but the dude's like a lawnmower i don't even i have two older young for this what is the joke what the hell's a lawnmower does that does that mean larry ellison's yoked uh we should always remember that companies are just groups of humans who are accountable for their actions okay i mean if this has never been the most empty platitude of all time awesome uh they care so much for open source that they instantly killed open solaris even if it led um uh to much of the team quitting they also very much cared to create an open and competitive environment that's why their uh reps repeatedly refused to sell us licenses to have solaris run under vmware uh esxi demanding we replace our esxi deployments with virtualbox no really honestly what is the point of continuing to fund open solaris tiny market share no prospects for improvement oh man now we're just dunking on open solaris damn this is why hey yo hey yo all of you just stay off of hacker news this what what did you the only thing that was worthwhile is this right here yeah but the dude is like a lawnmower like that honestly is the only reply to all of this that was actually amazing the rest what the hell is the point okay hey oracle clearly used an opportunity to sell more oracle and i don't blame them it's not like ibm's not a piece of crap like really if you had a business and you were selling widgets sprockets and it was basically sprockets versus cogwell cogs and cogwell cogs decided the closed source their part and you kept yours open source of course basically sprockets is going to take that opportunity to both try to poach great talent and then on top of that try to be able to sell more of their space lease pockets it's not crazy this is totally reasonable thing to do and i would do this hands down okay absolutely uh i think what they did was hilarious uh i think their article was extremely well written and fantastic at the end of the day i will never use oracle okay because i don't like oracle i don't want to use oracle products i don't want to do anything with oracle okay i don't want anything at all to do with with facebook microsoft or oracle okay okay sorry i don't want anything but i can still think their article was funny okay jetsons you like the jesus reference it was a very old reference but i thought it was pretty good right it was a pretty good one right uh anyways um oh will you use spot a sign up will you set what is that did i just get dumped absolutely uh lithium you just got dumped live what if oracle offered you one million dollars to sponsor your stream i love oracle i think oracle's a really great company and you know i think that we should all find ourselves happy with oracle have you heard of their what they're doing how they're rel compatible did you know that i could also love online gambling for 1.5 million kick just so you know i'm just saying kick i'm going to vegas kik okay i see the opportunity
