hey people who say php is insecure are uninformed if you don't believe me press the like button you'll see almost daily i see someone making a crack at php implying that apps written in php are somehow less secure than other languages i have never once heard this as a critique for php and i don't mean that any sort of rude way i'm not trying to like combat the article off the rip i'm just saying i've never heard someone say this about php all i ever hear about php is about the quality of the language not necessarily about the security of the language do you know what i mean uh here's the thing they're not what does the idea stem from i have a few theories about why people think php is less secure than other languages and i'm going to address all of them all right people's perception of php is outdated by 15 plus years this is just true in general this is php in a box okay uh back in the early days of php it was one of the few options for webbased languages and probably the best there was also an age where security was more of an afterthought so vulnerabilities were everywhere this wasn't specific to php rather it was a general lack of awareness regarding security in that area fair cross-side scripting all that kind of stuff we had no idea right we just had no idea pearl's better than php maybe cgi b that pearl hit it with a little bit of cobal called a day uh many older security professionals began began their careers by finding vulnerabilities and websites during the '90s and the early 2000s back when php powered pretty much everything now when they cp i forgot the turn off alerts thank you magnum dingus for that awesome tier one i appreciate that i would just like to let you know that this music that's currently playing is not the right music it's just not we're gonna we're going to have to pivot we're making a pivot we're making a pivot because this ain't it this is just not the right one now when they see php it just feels vulnerable because they're equating php with the vulnerability of 15 plus year old web applications you see php has stood the test of time time and still powers most of the internet today i think it's 42.3% of the internet is php and it's continued to grow okay it's continued to become more because of wordpress ph ll lel also is playing a big big role in this people love people love them lel okay um let's see you let's see you can't say the same about asp just cold fusion or pearl master pages rest i hope you don't rest in peace i hope you rest in a horrible fiery place wherever that is microsoft uh which were the other popular web languages that were available 20 years ago uh cold fusion i know jumla don't worry j jumla is disgusting we have to give a shout out to asp though which has been modernized with c.net aspnet you you don't notice it's php unless you see a php extension are you sure you sure about that uh in the early days of the web applications we would split php code into different files and access those files directly for example if you wanted to visit an about page of a website it would probably be located at an about.php the user would have to navigate to example.com about.php which would execute the about.php file on the server side and return the result yeah unless if you're an ht access wizard then you wouldn't need none of this okay you wouldn't need none of it you just do that general route handling move all those things around it was so good back back in the day i actually understood what an hd access file would do and i could actually use it now i have no idea i have no idea if you showed me one i' i'd have no clue modern applications are much more likely to use application routing to forward request to the right section of code within their application when we use routing in this way there's no need to have a dot pitch uh extension visible in the ural so we emit them okay this is fair the vast majority of modern php applications don't show php extensions in the eural uh for this reason you're unlikely to notice that an application runs php unless it's really old application in that case once again the application is more likely to be vulnerable because it's old not because it uses php the same goes for asp extension for example okay okay i mean i'm not going to lie to this i don't feel like this is selling on the reasons right now um you know because i knew 15 years ago you didn't necessarily have to have a php right if you just routed your stuff correctly you didn't have to have that either you know it's it's real just saying you know i'm not just saying um examples of vulnerable code are often written in php if you've done uh ever done any app sec training i actually have not uh i have created such a glorious bug once that it it could have taken down all of netflix with a simple while loop luckily that was corrected long time ago but still i made the bug so i i'm like really good at making them um just not good at uh knowing that i've made one okay netflix mentioned falor yeah it was a falor design i falor it i a capital f for falor uh if you've ever done any absec training there's a good chance you've seen php used to demonstrate vulnerable code for example how many times have you seen this excesss demo echo hello get name exclamation point the truth is php is often uh chosen as a language to demonstrate vulnerabilities because or simply because php was the language where most of the vulnerabilities were first discovered not because php is somehow more vulnerable but because php was one of the fewer or one of the fewer serers side web languages that existed back then okay okay i believe you i believe you okay just calm down we believe you on this one just just by training security professionals with vulnerable code snippets and php we have inadvertently trained them to feel that php is somehow less secure okay okay okay you know um is this like a okay do we have any app do we have any security folks do we have any pen testers some pen 15s in the chat can i get some ones in the chat if we got some security individuals in the chat anyone got some ones can i get some ones we got a couple ones we got a few ones okay we got we got a few ones a lot of zeros going to come in to let me so that i can never see how many ones there are i test pens does that count no okay so we got very few pen island oh yeah pen test me okay okay no nine um thanks warren for that educational addition to this channel okay for the people that pressed one and for nobody else shut up do you think php do you view php has an inherently vulnerable language ask my wife okay i don't want to ask her i don't i don't want to ask her okay no no no no no no no i don't just use 8.2 okay so maybe that's not a reason why people feel that way uh people compare raw php with full web frameworks for some reason when people argue that php is less secure they often compare raw php we got vanilla js we got raw php with web framework in another language rather than comparing the two raw languages against each other uh php versus js for example i've seen people comparing raw php with nextjs i mean it's a lot it makes absolutely no sense agreed in fact the closest equivalent to nextjs in php world is probably lel lel mention larl we got a lel mention let's go let's go and anyone who uses laurel knows that it is amazing modern and just as secure as any popular framework in any language pog lambos can we get some lambos in chat right now php is very easy for beginners creating a web application with php can be as easy as writing a file in p uh writing a file php in notepad exe and uploading it to a web server i mean to be completely fair it's just as easy as opening up a node.js file downloading 15,000 dependencies and then once you download those dependencies you have to create a build system and then once you get the typescript out of the javascript then you can actually probably use node.js to be able to run it and hopefully you've done everything correct i mean it's just that simple it's like literally that simple i don't see what the difference is there's like no difference okay you just need node and you need npm and you probably maybe you want to use yarn because yarn was cool and you didn't realize it's not cool anymore so use pnpm which no one can actually type pnpm pnpm is impossible to type fun to say though it's this this weird thing that exists where something can be both fun to say and terrible to type all at the exact same time easy sneezy limb and squeezy don't forget about npx and nx and uh you got to get nvm and manage those node versions everybody knows about this there's very little prerequisite knowledge required this is very encouraging for beginner coders but beginner coders are the ones most likely to write insecure code facts this is facts pnpm yeah thank you for viewer thank you for that insightful pnpm in their pinky gate why am i reading chat why am i reading chat by the way for those that are watching this on youtube i'm 10 hours into a coding stream i'm amazing at this point okay i'm feeling hot and bothered okay feeling good uh let's see uh this is very encouraging to beginner coders but beginner coders are the one regular yep i've already read this as a result there's a lot of bad php code out there yeah i mean the same things to be said about javascript okay to be completely fair javascript the exact same thing you know what i mean giga thank you giga for that twitch prime i also think that many developers who are experienced today probably started their web development journey with php i did uh for the web yeah yeah actually well to be fair i did try jsp once it was the only thing that was worse than php back then besides for [music] asp uh cold fusion like besides for everything else it was it's really good the code that they wrote when they started was likely full of vulnerabilities because they weren't experienced developers yet rather than blame their own inexperience they blame the uh the languages they used a poor worker blames his tools as they say i mean sometimes i blame javascript for being javascript you know have you ever thought about that sometimes your tool is kind of stupid okay have you ever seen a hammer the php hammer the php hammer okay like the php hammer okay i don't know if you've seen the php hammer but it's not not necessarily like the greatest tool i don't know what you're going to do with that tool but that's the php hammer right that's a real deal this is a real deal what do you do with that hammer i'm not sure exactly how to use that hammer it looks fun but at the same time looks a little terrifying okay it gets you out of a jam both ways it's it it gets you out of a jam every time all right is is it phb's fault no in fact i'd say that being a beginner is pro beginner friendly is probably a net positive important production code is rarely written by beginners that's fair that's fair uh people don't know about lel oh people know about that lel that little lambo riding mr otwell okay a big fan of otwell by the way uh it still blows me away how many cyber security folks have never heard of laravel or any of php frameworks for that matter they hear php and assume that people are just raw dog and php i just assume everyone uses lel at this point at this point i'm ready to just start using lel and just give up the whole fight i that's it you know what i'm tired honestly i'm just tired of fighting all the time i'm ready just to use larl send me the guinie i'm ready i'm ready like real real talk i'm just ready i'm ready i'm you know what no more zig no more go no more rust i'll just write php and larl and call it a day use open swole which apparently is like blazingly fast i consider larvel to be one of the most robust modern developer friendly frameworks out there today it even has a healthy ecosystem of pre-made starter kits testing suites managed hosting solutions local dev environments admin dashboards off flows debugging interfaces and much more okay wow that's really cool most um modern frameworks like laral attempt to shield developers from writing vulnerable code by using secure defaults for example the blade templating engine and php w will html encode variable output by default thwarting xs assess vulnerabilities unless the developer explicitly disables it uh the php the the php framework for web artis is that really is that really it i like xss so i use hdmx hdmx for ssx you know what i mean i mean ssx almost sounds like sex which any arch user would get excited about so that's probably why they use it you know what i mean it's like super close they could in fact it could be the same thing it could be it could be it actually could be the it actually could be um more than anything else i when i hear someone imply in 2023 that php is somehow more insecure than other languages it tells me that they're simply ignorant or uninformed they're paring well literally ignorant means uninformed yeah that's the same word in this situation uh they're parting an inaccurate opinion that somehow has stuck around for decades uh if you're if you are still sure that php is an inherently insecure language and i'd encourage you to try finding zero days in some long-standing popular php apps like wordpress or uh phbb good luck so so here's okay okay here we go i'm going to give you guys an opinion about this whole thing uh i think what this article is really showing is that there's a general angst among any developer using any framework to want to prove that it's not terrible right if you're using angular everyone judges you by angular 1.6 days right they're like oh wow you're using angular does it come with pleated pants sir right like they're going to make fun of you you're going to feel bad about it and then you're going to be like no really angular is awesome you don't understand you're like okay they bleeded pants andy sure it's fantastic i believe you and then they're going to argue and argue and argue if you use you know if you use react they're going to say a lot of correct things um or htm x gets xss all the time like right they're like ah hdmx you're going to xss yourself it's going to be terrible you're going to you know and they go and they have noide idea what that even means they just assume that it's inherently insecure and so this is not somehow a php specific problem this is literally the problem of twitter.com so if you go to twitter.com and you just go on here and you just start typing something random right this could actually become you know like this right here people are going to take this to heart and they're going to get offended and they're going to start saying things and it's going to be awful but the reality is is that just just that's just how twitter works okay it's just how it works and then people gather all their ideas from their favorite twitter and their favorite twitterers may not say correct things like me who i have done this before okay i've said things that aren't correct and then they go on twitter and then people believe it for the rest of their lives okay no you no you my man thanks 69ine nice um anyways so is this a problem is this a problem with web dev is this a problem with php no really what this is pointing out is that us as humans we can't learn everything we stereotype it is just a part of our nature it is something that is very hard to get rid of and so when we go through we just look at gen like general people's reactions to technology and we like adopt or reflect them ourselves right so when people are like ew php like you adopt that mentality too when you hear all of tech twitter like oh react is the greatest you think react is the greatest ui framework which even out of the ui frameworks react's not even the greatest right like everything else is better right now and so it's it's just like it's just a reflection of what you think people do and you just make these judgments and then they settle deep in your heart so it's actually called something um so this is like an old donald rumsfeld quote and it's not even a complete quote but it goes uh there are known knowns there are uh unknown knowns or known unknowns and then there's unknown unknowns right so like that's the classic one there are known knowns there are known unknowns and then there's unknown unknowns unknown unknowns are like the risky one because you don't even know what you don't know but there's actually a fourth category which is equally as risky as the third category which is an unknown known why do you know something often you don't realize why you think in a certain way and so is php inherently insecure if you think that way you actually are using it's a known it's an unknown known you don't know why you've arrived to this opinion you don't know why you think react's the best you don't know why you think h mx is insecure you just simply have adopted these opinions via some sort of osmosis and being around other people and that's just like life and this keeps on happening so should you be upset that people think php is insecure no this is just part of the life of being a php developer you're going to take your little lambo you're going to hop on in it you're going to take your hot wife you guys are going to go cruising while your 16 kids are currently getting babysit by three different babysitters and you're going to go to your your little nice golf course play a round of golf get on your yacht and you're going to just cry about the fact that everyone thinks that your php sucks okay on your yacht so guess what grow up get over it it's not a big deal the name is i probably shouldn't do react content because i'm really sleepy and i might be a bit too spicy at this time of the evening a jen
