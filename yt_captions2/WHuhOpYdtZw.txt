what are some of the top programming languages 
that are most in demand for 2023. if you are   watching this video it's probably because of few 
things one you are looking to break into the tech   industry and just want more information on what 
tech companies are using what languages are in   demand to you have been in the tech industry for a 
while maybe you're a software engineer qa product   manager and you want to know and have a better 
understanding of what trends are coming up in 2023   regardless of why you're here watching this video 
you will leave this video with an understanding of   the top programming languages coming up for 2023 
and also to how to learn them where to learn them   because that is very key i've been a software 
developer for over five years now started out   in qa moved to back end front end and now i'm in 
developer relations so knowing what programming   languages are really in demand ahead of time is 
very important for me as i need to stay up to   date on tech trends what's coming up and also be 
able to speak about these different technologies   i'm understand them and that's why i always do 
this research regardless of what top programming   languages are coming up what programming languages 
are in demand so i thought i would share my data   and research with you okay let's go oh also thank 
you so much for udemy to sponsoring this video i   love you to me it's how i first learned to code i 
still use it today for all my upskilling link them   down below and all the courses i'm mentioning 
are linked down below so go check them out   oh can you guess the first one i'll list i'll 
give you a second here if you guessed python you   are correct and it's probably no surprise mainly 
because python is used among many different roles   from data scientists web developer qa python 
touches a lot of roles and is used for many   different things i really think that is one of 
the reasons why python continues to dominate on   a lot of these lists another reason is because the 
entry to learning python is pretty straightforward   now let's go back and have a little bit of an 
understanding as to how python originated python   was originally developed as a hobby project which 
sounds crazy now just how much it exploded it was   mainly developed for emphasis on code readability 
no surprise here and also its syntax allows for   programmers to express concepts in fewer lines 
of code well yeah sure give me a sec so so why   should you even learn python well for one thing 
all the big tech companies big and small typically   use python to varying degrees another reason is if 
you are first starting out in your coding journey   python is a very is one of the better languages i 
would say to start with because of its readability   okay the most important question where do you 
learn it what course is the best now we are   entering an age where the problem isn't where to 
find courses it's there is so much information   out there how do you decipher which ones are 
the best enter in the complete python bootcamp   from zero to hero in python one of the reasons i 
really like this course is i actually took this   course many years ago or a few years ago when 
i was first learning python and i really liked   it because it not only teaches you the basics 
from the essentials but you also are building   you're building really interesting projects and 
i think that's so key which a lot of courses are   missing because a lot of them kind of do the same 
courses over and over again and i feel like with   this course you are building different games from 
uh blackjack tic-tac-toe and i just think it's   really fun because the games you are building 
or the projects you are building can be applied   to the real world coming in at number two on the 
list is java java is a widely used object-oriented   programming language and software platform that 
runs on billions of devices including notebook   computers mobile devices gaming consoles medical 
devices and more also a really interesting fact   about java its initial name was actually oh it was 
later changed to java because at the time there   was already a programming language named oak okay 
another intern another interesting thing another   interesting thing about java is it was actually 
created on accident yes you heard that right   james gosling the creator of java programming 
was working at somewhere called sun labs they   were working on some big projects and working 
with c plus plus long story short they ended up   with java a new programming language pretty cool 
okay if you are looking to learn jabba as it is   widely widely used across many different companies 
here's where to go java programming masterclass   that's covering java 11 and java 17. this course 
i loved because it was recently updated actually   in 10 october of this year which is huge and they 
always release quite frequent updates as well so   why do i love this course in particular one of the 
things that initially drew me to this course is i   always look at the instructors credentials who 
are they where do they come from what is their   background and for me i love that it is actually 
taught by a professional java developer who who   hasn't just been in the industry for a few years 
but has worked with the language for over' years   so not only do they know the positives of jabba 
but they also know the downsides the pitfalls and   i think that is almost more important because 
then they know how to teach in a way that they   will know what you will come across the problems 
you will face potentially with that language also   too in this course it has 52 coding exercises 
i don't typically see courses having this many   exercises exercises are a great way when you are 
taking a course that is a little bit lengthier   that it breaks it up in a way to actually test 
your learning because sometimes okay maybe it's   just me but sometimes i kind of get dozy when i 
start watching courses and i have to rewind and   figure out where i was so having exercises within 
them is a great way to stay on top of things   next up is next on the list my personal favorite 
maybe lee because this was the programming   language i learned on which is javascript love 
it or hate it javascript made it on this list   and it's here to stay for the time being i love 
javascript because not only can you use it on   front end but you can also use it on the back end 
side of things the original name for javascript   was mocha it was developed in 1995 for use with 
netscape 2 browser and honestly in my opinion   i feel like they should have stuck with the name 
mocha because too often especially probably when   it was first developed between java and javascript 
people would get confused hopefully not anymore   but i think the names you know it's not the 
best even though they're completely different   now what course to take for javascript this was 
a tough one because javascript i feel like there   are just an overload of courses for javascript and 
how do you know which one is the right one to take   this course i'll put on screen here really stood 
out to me the complete javascript course from 2023   from xero to expert and why it stood out to me 
well the first thing if i'm being honest is the   number of ratings it almost has 200 000 ratings 
it has almost a million students 700 000 students   with a 4.7 star rating so you know based on the 
numbers based on the data this is a good course   already by just looking at that another thing 
that stood out to me is just how quickly they   updated the last update was this month in november 
and i also like to how it's structured in a way   where you can start at the beginning from beginner 
just starting out or if you're someone who already   is a developer but you aren't as familiar with 
javascript you can start at the beginning to learn   the fundamentals or there are projects where you 
can start in on and just start building with those   okay let's take this off for a little bit 
next on the list is swift swift has continued   to gain popularity as ios becomes more and 
more popular people want more apps people   want more games it's not going anywhere it is 
a programming language that ensures you have   a long a really stable career as apps and ios 
development isn't going anywhere if you look at   the numbers it's continuing to go up and more and 
more in demand and honestly i have just tinkered   around with swift but it is so much fun it took 
me a minute to wrap my head around but i really   actually love xcode i know maybe that's because 
i'm not a professional ios developer i feel like   ios developers always say the opposite but just 
the visual aspect of it is really exciting to   me okay course time which ios course do you take 
you know this wouldn't be a proper list without   including a dr angela course she is og is that 
what you can say original aishi is just i love   love love her courses i've taken some of her 
python courses and she's just incredible she's   brilliant in my opinion okay angela if you're 
watching this you probably aren't but if you ever   do watch this i love you you're amazing you've 
really helped me in my coding career this is a   great ios and swift course uh you will learn to 
create a portfolio of 15 different apps to be   able to go from junior developer to senior and 
i love that this really enables you to build so   many interesting projects that you can speak 
about here's a little side tip after you are   done taking this course a really great way or 
thing to do that i do and i'm taking a course   is a project that i really liked or resonated 
with i'll build it again without the tutorial   but build it in something that i'm interested 
in for example in this course one of the things   that you will be building is an animated dice 
roll so what you could do after you've done   that example is you could start by building 
an animated object that you are interested in   maybe something other than a dice and this is a 
great way to take your learnings and apply them   to your own projects last but definitely not 
least on this list is i got the green screen c plus plus we couldn't end this list without 
c plus plus it's been around for a while it is   a classic and it's not going anywhere c plus 
plus is a powerful general purpose programming   language it can be used to develop operating 
systems browsers games and further now where   do you learn c plus plus put it up on screen here 
the course that i really enjoyed i started taking   this course i'll be honest with you i've never 
used c plus in my work so i was just curious   about it to understand it and have a have a deeper 
understanding and i think that's one of the things   as a side note that's really interesting about all 
these courses is don't just take them just because   it's what you are going to be using currently 
at work if you are curious about something why   not take it just to learn something new i don't 
think we do that enough this course really stood   out to me when i was looking for c plus courses 
because it teaches a modern c plus plus rather   than an obsolete version that many courses will 
be teaching you now this course is pretty long   in length it's about 45 almost 46 hours actually 
in length and that can be intimidating at first   to many why am i going to take this course that's 
so long but one thing that really helped me or i   really enjoyed about it is how well it's broken 
down into sections so just as another tip for   you what i do when i'm taking a course is i will 
break them down into or i'll schedule my time and   learnings based on the sections that's already 
broken down into okay those are the top five   programming languages for 2023. now let's get 
something clear here just because these are the   top five programming languages for 2023 doesn't 
mean that there aren't tons more out there that   are in demand and i want to make that clear 
because sometimes i'll get comments being like   well tiff i really want to learn um i really want 
to learn go i really want to learn this and that   you don't have this on the list still learn it the 
whole purpose of this list based on the research   i've done isn't to say these are the only five you 
can learn but to inspire and inform you of what   is coming up for 2023. also i want to end this 
video with a final note a lot of times we make   these videos talking about the technical skills 
that you need to learn which are so important but   even if you have the strongest technical skills 
without the soft skills it's going to be hard to   grow your career in a very successful long-term 
way yes you can be that person who doesn't talk   to anyone ever and just have a successful career 
that way potentially but what i love about you   to me is they also offer so many other courses 
on the soft skill side of things for leadership   public speaking personal development all those are 
equally as important so please do not forget about   those kind of courses as well i linked everything 
down below as well so make sure to go check them   out and if you haven't already hit that subscribe

answer every single one of them okay see you soon thank you
