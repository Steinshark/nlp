ladies and gentlemen welcome to one of the most insane chess games i have ever seen now yes i have probably started about 10 videos that way but in 2023 this is definitely an early candidate for the craziest chess game of the year it features a monarch imprisoned uh in the enemy ranks and it's just got so many insane plot twists that it looks like a guess the elo episode except the average elo of the players is something like 2400 so um if you're wondering why i didn't start the video full screen it's because i'm currently in california i do not live in california i have been to california probably about five times i am here for the streamer awards i was at youtube hq yesterday um lucy is right there and has to tolerate my recordings as always but the grind never stops finding incredible chess games never stops and sharing them with you also never stop so uh we are in a random city somewhere in the midwestern united states which basically accounts for about 30 states and 30 you know 30 uh not 30 but many many other types of cities and we are in a round robin chess tournament for grand master norm with white we have alder escobar ferrero who's a colombian grandmaster and with black we have uh tianchi wang who i actually played uh myself a long time ago the game begins with the karo khan defense which you know game of the year candidates very rarely start with the karo khan defense they almost always start with the sicilian or some other crazy opening but it's a karo khan white plays the move d4 and black plays the move d5 and i mean so far right it's a matter of what is white going to do i mean we just saw an insane game uh with a checkmate in like 20 moves by force and that was e5 bishop f5 and then h4 which is one of the most insane lines that you can play in the karo khan defense but this time we have knight c3 i have been playing the caro for like a decade i have never had a wild game after knight c3 i mean i just have back and forth games and interesting games but i have never had a a banger as the kids say on god no cap all right with the skull emoji and everything at the end i've never had one of those um so that you know we have de-94 and now the main line is bishop f5 attacking the knight but recently a lot more title players including myself play the move knight to f6 immediately inviting this exchange and taking like this uh that's because we're stupid and we're deviant and we've you know we're we got too strong at chest so now we break all the principles you're not really supposed to double your pawns like look at like black has no center pawns anymore just no d and e pawns just com you know but this is a line and it's called the tartik hour variation uh and um essentially the idea is that black will just play bishop d6 and castle and build a pawn wall and it's not as bad as it looks uh in this position white plays the main line for a few moves which is first to play the move c3 this move has two ideas the first idea is to defend the center and enable the move bishop to d3 so the pawn is protected the second idea is to put the queen on c2 where along with the bishop on d3 they will form a battery onto the pawn in h7 and so if black castles you can attack that pawn so black plays bishop d6 white plays bishop d3 black plays knight a6 96 is a very rare move uh most people here just play the move short castle uh and then white will play queen c2 and then black will find a way to defend this pawn either with h5 or h6 or g6 or rookie a check or there's even a move f5 recently h5 has become very popular again just a bunch of deviants you know underground uh hit you know hip artists who uh uh basically graffiti uh city establishments and then say it's an art form that's essentially what h5 is it's very stupid looking i've played it myself though with black with no success whatsoever like i mostly lose the games but at least i'm deviant and cool and edgy and my friends think i'm interesting um but uh yeah it's it's this is a much more compact solution um but knight a6 right and so the point of knight a6 i would imagine is probably to put it on b8 and then put it on a normal square and just sort of ask why i ever put it on a6 in the first place but in reality the idea of knight a6 is to go knight c7 and then probably go back to a6 and put it back on b8 and put it on a normal square and wonder why you wasted that time in the first place again as i said like none of this really makes any sense if you're trying to teach this to a beginner like if if i had a five-year-old that just sort of develop pieces like this i would yell at them and i would tell their parents that they're not studying chess enough um but it's a very legitimate way to play you can play knight c7 you can then put an iron d5 it it's it's really not as dumb as it looks um white now plays knight e2 he's playing knight e2 because he basically always wants to play queen c2 and he's waiting for his opponent to castle and his opponent is just refusing to castle he's just not castling um which is like i imagine in a boxing match or a mixed martial arts match like you prepare for somebody they play a certain way they do a certain thing and all of a sudden they're just not doing that thing anymore and they're doing a different thing i would imagine that you get very confused why your opponent is not castling because if you continue to play moves like queen to c2 target like he's just never going to castle and he he might even castle the other way he might just keep his king in the center of the board him he's just not castling so escobar ferreira plays bishop by four because his logic is okay um there's going to be a trade here i'm going to improve my position and so on and so forth now if you have a very bad attention span and all those videos on your sidebar are looking really appealing whether they're about sport or i don't know the most recent mr beast video or whatever it might be just bear with me for a second i i really i can't embellish the opening in any sort of fake capacity this is a game between two very good chess players nobody's going to be losing in the first nine moves although in my previous video 2500 was losing in seven uh and now it gets really goofy so the first goofy move now occurs which is the move h5 you might remember that a couple of moves ago i said black usually plays h5 when this pawn is under attack that pawn is not under attack in any way shape or form this is basically black just doing the chess equivalent of having a bit of a tantrum black could have played many other moves like knight d5 or developed a bishop out or played f5 and tried to i don't know but h5 is wild this is the and and this is how you know that we're gonna have a banger so bishop d6 queen d6 and ferrero basically has absolutely no respect for this pawn advancing just no respect at all if i'm playing white here you know what i'm gonna do i might play h3 to prevent bishop g4 and also prevent the pawn from getting to h3 then i might castle or i might try to castle that way yeah he just plays knight g3 let me tell you right now knight g3 is an extremely provocative move because it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out what black is trying to do black is trying to play the move h4 and it's essentially like waving a red flag in front of a bull um that's what ferrero did here he stood up during a chess game took out a red cloth and waved it in front of tianchi who proceeded to call over the orbiter and wonder what narcotics his opponent had induced prior to the game but that's basically what's going on he's allowing h4 and then as a byproduct he will probably also allow h3 but his idea was to give a check which is really a tremendous move that black just he doesn't even block right there's three ways to get out of a check you can capture the piece you can block the check uh and uh you can move your king and moving your king is the last resort but in this case it's actually a very legitimate move and the king will find a very nice shelter behind his barricade of pawns and not to mention when the rook gets to e8 in the future you will be pinning the queen to the king so 94 and chen chi just puts the queen back on its home square and since ferrero does not like the prospect of castling short he castles long and the black king is now going to find that shelter on the g7 square the white king slides over to b1 just almost always a useful move and here comes tianchi a5 clearly uh the player with the black pieces was trained in the school of crabs for chess uh the crab of course being the opening which is h5a5 or a4 h4 this is just essentially a glorified crab attack i mean basically no matter where you're safe i'll get you know no matter where you think you're finding shelter i will get you i mean this is this is disgusting frankly like uh you know if this game was played in the 17th century if if black played this move they would just come pause the clock take him out put a brick on his leg and throw him in the water because they thought he was a witch this is essentially that and i mean the fact that the computer thinks that it's balanced is just heinous and shows you that everything that we originally thought we knew about chess we we absolutely do not and by the way he just he just plays a4 on the next move um there's nothing there i mean maybe he'll play a3 maybe he won't maybe white should play a3 it's never clear here like this white play a3 this white play h3 or whatever but as you can see the game is really heating up and now we have rook g1 uh and uh and tenshi does in fact not play uh a3 he plays the move knight to d5 uh allowing white to play a3 as it turns out the computer really liked this because black really should respond uh if you don't respond then uh for instance i will take this as weak and you help me open up my rook so that's a completely horrible decision for white as you can see from the eval bar so knight d5 we have a3 and now we have king to g7 i mean both sides are making very mild in accuracies according to the computer but they're still sort of fulfilling all of their objectives in the position which is black putting the king on g7 and preparing some attack and kings are on opposite sides which means it's going to be a very chaotic game white now plays the move queen f3 um and in this position this is deemed a mistake by the computer because now black can play f5 and when the knight is booted uh black can now just launch an attack with b5 that is what the computer wants it wants f5 it wants b5 and it thinks that black is essentially just you know winning the game um and uh yeah after queen f3 uh f5 happens so knight t2 but instead of b5 uh black plays the move h3 now i don't dislike the move h3 essentially the move h3 was played so that white would not ever take so for for instance maybe something like this and white just didn't black just didn't like the prospect of having a rook staring at a pawn in front of a king which makes sense so black played the move h3 white played the move knights c4 looking to take advantage of various dark squares and also create an attack of his own black played the move knight back to f6 looking to get in on the light scores over here queen d5 maybe in the future bishop e6 in the future and so on and so forth as you can see the tension is bubbling it's a zero zero zero position queen e6 f3 and now queen d5 uh and black is making all active operations and now b5 and it's go time okay so remember a long time ago how the person playing with white essentially waved a red flag in front of black well that's sort of what's about to happen because in this position if you move your knight the queen and the bishop will come down to a2 and it looks like the white king is going to be evicted and all the pawns will fall and black will win the game the only way to avoid the queen coming down here is to think of a concept called danger levels and play the move a rook to e5 the problem with rook 2e5 is it does in fact look like you will lose some big degree of material but you don't because of this attacking the queen i give a check if you block i take that so that doesn't work rookie 5 has to be played here and then you know there is no infiltration yeah he just allows it he just allows to move queen a2 he just allows the move queen a2 not only that he allows the move queen a1 and now bishop to b1 what is going on i think you're beginning to see the uh first and early signs of the queen being in jail the queen is just now not allowed out the only piece that can help the queen is the bishop and if you do that i'm just gonna go here and i think what white anticipated here was a draw by repetition repetition meaning bishop a2 king c2 because it's it's impossible to just play chess like this when you have no queen how can you play an entire game of chess with no queen uh like this what what is he doing how is this possible how after knight takes d5 and c takes d5 is black winning how is it minus two like cd5 yeah how what but the queen can't if the king if the bishop goes here we already know it's just gonna be this now yes uh let's say white plays uh you know g4 there's bishop a2 there's king c2 if you give a check there's this and the queen can escape but by the time the queen is escaping it's white that's delivering the checkmate so how on earth is black winning i don't understand and i think in the game white also did not understand and i think in the game black also despite maybe having certain suspicions also did not fully understand why is this position winning for black well queen e5 check i mean the guy with black is literally playing with no queen and yet is -4 what so the king goes to g8 which apparently is an inaccurate move i think king h7 here was preferred by the computer um and if something like queen f6 apparently black can just play like this and this and rook c3 is just on the way and it turns out the queen actually does have a lot of help um the idea being uh to play rook c3 bc3 queen c3 and actually white has made it and if it's not that then you know i'll take on a3 and then i'll chase your king out and i'm still winning so by some completely insane miracle it it's winning for black we have queen e5 check we have this and white plays queen d6 and black is now completely winning the game after the move rook c8 rook c3 queen c3 is now a foregone conclusion the only way to defend that is either to isolate your queen here but then black continues with rook c4 or to play the move rook e3 and now the move b4 is just lights out why is it lights out the move b4 is completely winning because if you take with the a pawn i do this if you take with a c pawn i take your king and if you play queen takes before which is basically the only move i just play king g7 what an absolutely brilliant game um from the gentleman playing with the black pieces what a clinic what a game rookie 7 rook c4 the queen goes to a5 and now all black needs to do is play rook c8 and second c3 and what a game queen in jail he bails the queen out by understanding piece play and dynamics and rescuing the queen and he plays rook 2a8 and he throws away the entire game what what rook a8 how was that throwing away the entire game the idea of rook 8 is relatively straightforward the idea of rook a8 is that you are forcing the queen away from the rook check and it's made it's made in a few moves what black had missed was that after rook a8 white will play rook takes f7 you want to sacrifice a rook i can do it even better than you rook takes f7 king2h6 and now g4 and now it actually turns out that white might be winning this game this is completely insane there is a hanging queen and there is a there is a queen in prison folks g4 is completely ludicrous if you take the queen i have g5 king h7 rook h7 mate what are we even looking at what the hell is this position look at this there is a queen in prison and this is here how does that make any sense so we have king g5 now white plays the move f4 check which g takes f5 excuse me g takes a five check and the king runs to f4 and black is winning again the only way for white not to lose here was to play f4 the point is that after this now white plays pawn takes f5 and if you take my queen i have pawn takes and a ladder mate in the center of the board i have never seen something like this ever in my life this is completely ridiculous the king is just walled off there is absolutely nothing so g takes f5 check king to f4 and now f takes g6 and the king runs in and black is winning the king has ran all all the way here this is completely nuts king f2 there are no more checks there are no more checks black is winning and now apparently rookie one is the only way to continue to try to make a draw there is this possibility you have rook takes a5 and then you have check you have here you have check you have here and g7 and the point is the queen is just simply in prison if bishop here i have king d2 if you take with check i just block and i'm queening this is completely this is this is this is this is crazy and instead of that black white instead of playing rook g e one plays rook ee1 and now white is lost again because after this check the black king runs king e3 rookie one king f4 rook good g wait a minute wait a minute is black winning is black winning king takes f3 now the rook is hanging rook g3 the king comes back and now we have rookie three and the king is in a box bishop d1 bishop d1 what even is this position this position looks like it should be in a chess museum bishop d1 the king cannot take because this and the rook is covered on f3 so white plays g7 that is the only move now black plays rook to b5 checkmate is essentially on the way and now ferrero plays beef okay okay black can take the pawn with check but then white would be winning because queen b3 there is just bishops this is completely nuts what are we even looking at bishop c2 b4 played and black goes back to stop the queen but now white plays king takes d1 queen takes b1 check king d2 check here this has to be a draw right no black sacrifices the rook takes takes rook d3 check on a1 king c2 queen a2 king d1 check here and now in this position the winning move has to be d4 after d4 everything is covered and white is out of moves completely out of moves if you queen i take i take the rook you can't move anywhere if you go here i'll check you i'll take this rook d4 wins the game and instead of that we get this and after rook c3 black cannot stop the loss of a queen or getting mated again so he gives a check he comes in with his rook but after rook c2 takes takes the g7 pawn is queening and the only thing black can do now is to repeat moves and make a draw but you can also play queen takes edge attacking the rook but the rook goes here and there is no check you can give me a discover check but i just go here and buy a a just complete miracle of god this queen cannot check this king anywhere except here and here queen h1 check and now king moves up apparently to the wrong square okay apparently to the wrong square y to the wrong square because king a1 king a82 h2 is a winning idea for black after this white has the move queen e4 and is apparently making a queen if the king had gone to b2 instead apparently that's better because if h2 is played in this position there is this this some sort of check and the king is just better on the square that it currently is rather than being on a2 where it could be subjected to some checks i folks this was one of the most insane games of chess i have ever seen it featured a queen that wandered into the territory of the opponent and just sat there as an absolutely apocalyptic series of events was occurring the black king running up the board essentially on the move that he was about to get like win the game rook c8 is just game over and black goes here his king is evicted there is a threat of getting mated by a pawn the king runs down to f2 i mean what are we even looking at only for this game to conclude by a repetition of moves as white as up a rook and about to promote a pawn i mean what do you want me to i mean what [music] this was completely ridiculous and i had to share it with all of you so i will now throw on a nice suit and go to the streamer awards when you're watching this video i'm probably on a plane so write something nice for me in the comments maybe i'll uh maybe i'll check it if i get internet on the seven hour flight back to new york and i'll read your comment maybe they'll make me feel good make uh give me a congratulatory message if i won the award and you're allowed to make fun of me if i did not but i will be very sad so yeah that's all get out of here
