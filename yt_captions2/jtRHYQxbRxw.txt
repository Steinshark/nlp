if you've been on the internet for the last three weeks at all you've probably heard the sensational story about three million toothbrushes yes toothbrushes that were used in a dos or a distributed denial of service attack that is actively rampaging all over the internet and taking control of websites now the problem with this is that that didn't actually happen but it does highlight a really concerning trend in this need for manufacturers to make everything smart or internet enabled so let's talk about what happened with these toothbrushes and i'll highlight some really interesting devices that are coming online that probably shouldn't be online here we go so february 7th rolls around and zdnet very large publication for cyber security and other technology types puts out this article 3 million smart toothbrushes were just used in a dos attack really what's next malware infected dental floss but seriously it's a reminder that even the smallest smart home devices can be a threat here's how to protect yourself now the problem with this reason why it's a tweet by our buddy kevin kier here is if you go to zdnet now they have since presented that article saying 3 million smart tooth brushes were not used in a ds attack after all but it could happen so how how did we get here how did we get to a place where zet is resenting its own articles well the issue is the origin of all of this is from swiss newspaper i'm not going to try to pronounce this az uh written obviously not in english but if you translate to english generally what it says is the toothbrushes are attacking these are the current cyber threats and this is how you can protect yourself now this article is behind a pay wall but the article itself is the result of an interview between a and foret which is a pretty big us company that does cyber security research where foret and az were discussing what was thought to be a hypothetical scenario but because of a translation issue between german and english turns out that the newspaper thought that it was real and foret didn't mean to make them think it was real or there's some issue going on in there where foret got used as a point of authority in this article which zdnet then saw and then wrote their article now they have since resented this article and they've written what went down in the story they say in a note to zdnet a foret representative said to clarify the topic of toothbrushes being used in d attack was presented during an interview as an illustration of a given type of attack and is not based on research from foret or for guard labs it appears however the narrative on this topic has been stretched to the point where hypothetical and actual scenarios are blurred now zet does go on to describe how it is really important to be aware that more and more devices are coming online it no longer takes could we're living in homes filled with insecure iot devices and this is entirely true right now probably you have either a smart thermostat or a smart washing machine or even our buddy johnny over here has a smart washing machine that washes his clothes which also by the way he points out is extracting 3.6 gb of data out of his home network why is this happening really couldn't tell you i think what's actually happening here is this line of washing machine is an ai enabled washing machine meaning it's pulling out camera data from cameras inside of the washing machine and then processing them to train some kind of washing machine ai model which like on its own sounds freaking ridiculous and then using that data to more efficiently wash clothes if that doesn't scare you i'm not going to read this headline out of fear of being demonetized but you can probably read this yourself maker of smart these things left users emails passwords and locations exposed a company that makes a that device for people with a yep can be controlled by a partner over the internet exposed users email addresses plain text passwords home addresses and ip addresses and in some cases gps coordinates due to several flaws in its servers but it gets even better than this same kind of device however uh different manufacturer leaves users at risk of a permanent lock in now this article is wild the cellmate that thing works by allowing a trusted partner to remotely lock and unlock the chamber over bluetooth using a mobile app now obviously this makes sense right you install the app on your phone the phone then has to go out and hit some server and the server sends a push request down to your phone and it does the opening and the closing of that device the app communicates this way using an api but dude this i can't i cannot describe to you how absolutely insane this is okay what i'm about to tell you blows my mind how this company is not legally on the hook for the potential damages is out of this world to me okay here we go the api was left opened and without a password allowing anyone to take complete control of any user's device so what this literally means is i could have got openthe belt.com the username i don't know big dong 420 or whatever and i could have done open and if like if i knew all the correct information and this is pre the patch if i hit the enter key right now this poor man's device will open or maybe it will lock and maybe maybe i just keep hitting the refresh button and it's just locked forever when prompted about this issue the kiwi chief executive j go said that told tech crunch that a fix would arrive in august but that deadline came and went we are a basement team he said in a follow-up email explaining the risks to users when we fix it it creates more problems so th this is the dilemma that we're in we have this world of devices that are all more and more getting internet enabled with security as like the second thought it's not a thing they think about until it's a problem and these companies can't even afford to fix it it is absolutely wild and i want to know what you think in the comments below thanks for watching i'll see you guys later my name is uh my name is love learning and i do security stuff um goodbye
