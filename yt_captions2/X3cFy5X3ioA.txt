web versus mobile which one to learn first   this is definitely something that crossed my mind 
when i was first entering the tech industry is   what should i learn should i learn web development 
should i learn mobile development there is so much   to learn i don't even know what to do and it 
can become so overwhelming that it becomes   almost like you are frozen where you don't 
learn anything because it's so overwhelming   as someone who's been a software developer for 
over four years i'm going to talk to you today   about my thoughts on where to begin if you are 
interested in both web and mobile development   shout out to some nope that's the old one what 
are we getting into what are we leaving okay   before we get into this video further make sure 
to hit that subscribe button for more tech and   coding related videos leave in the comments other 
topics questions feedback anything you have for me   let me know in the comments i love the community 
we are continuing to build and i honestly every   day take time to read through your comments 
as best i can so i really do sit down and read   them so leave a comment for me i want something 
good to read okay let's just jump right into it before we get any further though i want to share 
with you about a really cool tool called filestack   filestack is the number one developer service for 
file uploads so it allows you to get user content   from anywhere and improve file and video uploads 
with a powerful and easy to use api this is an api   that is super friendly to use and i really 
wanted to share with you about it because   if you are starting to build different projects or   really looking for projects to showcase in your 
portfolio this is a great way to showcase you   using an api and to use it in a way that is very 
easy to integrate with file stack it allows you   to easily give your customers the power to adjust 
or manipulate their images before they upload them   so it allows your customers to transfer adjust or 
apply a beautiful filter to their images i linked   file stack down below in the description so make 
sure to click on it you can sign up for free play   around with it to see how it works and integrate 
it into your next project okay let's get going okay well before we get into it though let's 
talk about the tech stack required for either   if you are learning web development or considering 
learning web development here are some common   languages you will need to know or may need 
to know not necessarily all of them of course   you'll need to know css html then there's python 
php javascript ruby i mean there's tons more but   those are just some of the popular ones depending 
on your background and your previous experience   web development can be pretty easy to pick 
up and let me just say easy i understand if   you're someone who has no coding experience it is 
much more difficult but over time like javascript   was my first language and i found it to be pretty 
simple to learn it gets more complex as you add on   frameworks and then dive into the back end etc but 
it's a great entryway then if you're interested in   mobile development you really need to look at what 
kind of mobile development you are interested in   do you want to build android products do you 
want to build ios products and based on that   the languages will vary one of the things i 
think that can be very confusing to people is   they want a really good paying job they want 
the job that's most in demand and i feel really   comfortable saying that all three areas are very 
in demand so really focus on don't focus on the   salary that comes with each job but focus on 
where your interest lies and if you don't know   i think the best way to know is simply to start 
practicing and diving into it this is not good for me how i just started diving into it and 
and understanding where i really wanted to   start was through taking different tutorials 
online when i started to learn how to code i   of course installed vs code and started playing 
around with building different javascript   web applications and then i also downloaded xcode 
and started playing around with swift and getting   familiar with that application development 
side and i found i gravitated more towards   the website of things to start with and i think 
it was because it was an easier entry point for   me i just found like things were clicking quicker 
and i was seeing much more quicker progress and   i knew that if i learned web first i could still 
always go back and learn mobile which i have i'm a   horrible mobile developer though i very rarely do 
it um but if someone needs an application built i   can i can be your person um and starting with web 
for me made the entry into tech and coding easier   and i think that a lot of people find that but if 
you're very passionate about mobile it's another   great way to go well let's talk about demand 
now which is more in demand and i don't want to   necessarily share specific stats on that because 
it really varies based on where you are located so   i could share stats with you that web is way more 
in demand in say north america but then if you   live in europe it might be completely different 
so my best suggestion for you is to simply just   google what is more in demand in wherever the 
country you are and see what comes up now once   again though even if mobile is more in demand 
than web and vice versa it really shouldn't be   your deciding factor i think both of these roles 
are so in demand that having one or the other   based on salary or based on in demand shouldn't 
really be a reason because at the end of the day   they both will pay really well and they both are 
in demand and if you are in a location where maybe   they jobs around you don't pay as well or 
they aren't as in demand look start looking   for remote jobs now there are so many remote 
positions and i think it's one of the best things   that has happened these past few years in 
tech is just the demand and push for remote   jobs and hiring from anywhere in the world so 
don't let necessarily your location as well   be your main focus as to what path you choose 
okay but what about the learning curve this   is something i think is very important and 
as i've kind of alluded to throughout this   video from my experience i found web development 
easier to learn especially when starting out but   when you really think of everything you need 
to learn for web development there's a lot more   it seems like right out the gate that you need 
to learn versus for web development for or sorry   for mobile development for web development as 
i mentioned you need to learn html css and then   pick a programming language do you want to learn 
javascript python do you want to do more back end   with php what do you want to focus on but i always 
say for web development development even if you   want to do back end starting with css and html 
although they aren't programming languages are   a great place to start just to start getting used 
to to coding to some degree whereas if you look   at mobile for android you're more more focused 
on learning one thing which initially which is   kotlin and if you're focused on ios maybe you're 
focused on learning swift so it seems like hmm   those two seem easier to pick up because it's just 
one specific area versus web where there seems to   be a lot of things to learn but here's where 
i think it gets tricky when you are developing   a mobile there still are a lot of concepts 
that you learn in web you will have to apply   in mobile for example you will still have to learn 
to interact with the backend and the databases and   apis and how that all works and that's similar to 
what you'll have to learn in web now it might be a   bit different based on application and programming 
language etc but you're still going to have to   learn a lot of that stuff in order to make you 
really a proficient developer okay so that's my   thoughts on whether you should learn web or mobile 
and i know i didn't give you a specific clear   answer and the reason for that is intentional 
it's because that's not my place to decide for you   but from my experience and sharing my story 
i would start with web because even if you do   end up going into mobile there are so many 
concepts from web that you will have to take over   that i think starting with web is a great place 
to start however mobile is a bit more niche and if   that's kind of the area you're really interested 
in i think you really need to just dive into where   your interests lie thank you all for watching 
this video i hope you found it very valuable and   helpful in deciding which is right for you is 
it web is it mobile i'm curious to know though   what path you decide on so leave in the comments 
below and i will see you all soon thanks everyone   you
