have you ever bought something thinking surely this is as good as it gets at least for a while this guy sure did blew from the writing team loved alienware's first qd oled gaming monitor so much when we reviewed it earlier this year that he put his name on a waiting list paid 1300 us dollars and waited almost three months to finally get his baby since then he never misses an opportunity to flex that he has the best display on the block even the alienware cutie ol that i have for instance i've just gotten my alienware cutie oled finally i own a display i got it crazy right but he's about to learn a painful lesson being an early adopter sucks it's been just over six months since that monitor hit the market and dell alienware has already released a follow-up for us patient gamers not only is it 200 cheaper but it's more color accurate out of the box has more features available comes in black and allows user firmware updates to be honest i didn't see this coming so soon either samsung doesn't even have a monitor with this panel yet and their display division makes the bloody thing maybe there's a catch maybe the new one cuts an important corner thankfully our new specialist for the lab brandon 2 is here to help shed some light on the situation like i'm gonna shed some light on our sponsor msi their new geforce rtx 4080 supreme x delivers ultra performance through 16 gigabytes of gddr6 memory and its tri-frozer 3s thermal design learn more down below foreign [music] physically these two are almost identical aside from the color scheme almost the refreshed dwf now has two displayport 1.4 ports instead of two hdmi 2.0s but the 4 port usb hub with mouse and keyboard dongle friendly positioning dual three and a half millimeter jacks and simple c13 power input should all be familiar the rgb is slightly different though and you'll feel a difference when you pick them up alienware managed to shed about a pound and a half from the updated model firing them up the differences are even less obvious our hilarious behind the scenes videos on floatplane.com have never looked better and quantum dot oled or qd oled for short displays are simply the best for gaming amazing color accuracy and wide color gamut thanks to the quantum dots lightning fast pixel response times and inky blacks thanks to the self-emissive oled pixels now the newer f model is rated for 165 hertz refresh rate compared to 170 95 for the og one and you won't be making up that difference with an overclock we did try but we've also shown that there's a point of diminishing returns for high refresh rate displays and the difference between 165 and 175 that 10 hertz is a lot smaller than the difference between 60 and 70 even though they're both 10 hertz now one concern we had was that dell might have slimmed the new model by cutting down its power supply or its cooling which could hurt hdr performance but in practice both of them managed to get within striking distance of their rated 1000 nits peak brightness meaning that whichever one you choose you're going to be looking at a gaming session that is buttery smooth and bright enough to flashbang yourself in a dark room so how did they cut the weight and cost turns out you got to look really closely by not paying nvidia the original dw has a g-sync ultimate module inside which honestly nvidia doesn't even seem to know the purpose of anymore something about low latency variable refresh rate and lifelike hdr whatever that is but then the new one has freesync premium pro which on paper has all those same benefits anyway maybe the g-sync module helped them push that extra 10 hertz we'll never know but the reality is that variable refresh rate tech is really at its best on something like a console where it can eliminate tearing and mask stutters when the frame rate dips below 60fps on a top of the line high refresh rate display like either of these ones with a powerful gpu which you probably already own you're more likely to run your frame rate uncapped anyway for the lowest possible latency so let's change gears then and talk about color accuracy both of our dwfs and our dw came factory calibrated with delta e averages of less than two that's accurate enough that even to the train die any differences should be indiscernible but the dws results are even better in both the srgb and p3 color spaces it managed a delta e of less than one straight out of the box i mean it's the same panel so how did they do it ah this is interesting based on their spec sheets here qc at the factory is done using a more accurate testing tool now specifically a ca410 instead of an mk550t so it seems like in the extra time that del alienware has had they've refined their setup yielding significantly better results although it is also possible that they cherry-picked these units they were provided by dell now let's talk about hdr which used to be nvidia's primary selling point for g-sync ultimate their module was after all the first to support variable refresh rate and hdr at the same time and it seems like they might still be ahead of the competition here to be clear there's no best approach to hdr tone mapping but there are best practices unfortunately these best practices can be different for different types of content and nvidia seems laser focused on gaming for hdr gaming on windows the dw's nvidia certified approach to managing super bright on screen objects looks a lot better and the reason is that when you go through the process of calibrating your game during setup the point of that is to tell the game what the capabilities of your monitor are so that it can stay within them only peaking or losing detail in the image where the developer wants it to let's say as part of their artistic vision for how it should feel when an interrogation light turns on for comparison out of the box the dwf is going to try to maintain detail in bright objects by compressing them into the upper range of its capabilities this is a little hard to wrap your brain around but bear with me here say you had two light sources right next to each other in a scene one of them at a thousand and one at three thousand nits well this display might attempt to show both of them without peaking by going 900 and 950 nits to represent that this one is brighter even if it's outside of its capabilities well the theory here is sound and this connection really be a very good thing for films that were shot and mastered for the capabilities of future displays that do have that range but in games it messes with that calibration process because it makes the game think that the display is capable of much higher peak brightness so in practice you actually end up with more clipping rather than better preserved detail now this may have been an intentional move from dell some people prefer an hdr image that pops even if they lose some detail but as an artist's intent snob it's really not my cup of tea thankfully the dwf does include a source tone mapping mode as an option for those who want more accuracy but it's still not quite as accurate as the dw one neat trick the dwf has up its sleeve that the dw can't do though is the ability to accept a 4k hdr signal and this is a must if you're trying to game on an xbox series x with hdr enabled that's a clear win from mr blackfeet here and it's about to get a whole lot more of them picture in picture or picture by picture is supported it has more hdr color modes the osd is more responsive you can change the aspect ratio to 4x3 for retro content you can adjust the sharpness hue gain saturation and offset while the dw can only do saturation and if you want some test patterns for calibration or to check for defects the aw3423dwf comes with those built in and the dumbest part of all of this it's probably that lack of g-sync ultimate that you paid a whole bunch more money for that's right that module that we're paying extra for and not even really using makes it next to impossible for a home user to update the firmware on the dw we reached out to dell and they have confirmed that if there is an issue with your display you can send it in and they will attempt a firmware update as part of the fix but only they can do it because of some specific tool that that's required for this module and they won't do it on demand so if some new mode or feature gets rolled out in later revisions of the monitor your display if it's otherwise fine tough break kit the dwf however not only comes with the latest and greatest firmware but since we're no longer limited by the physical module we can simply update it ourselves so not only have you now paid 200 less by waiting nine months but you're actually getting more features out of the box with the ability to potentially get even more over time is that so is that someone crying that's all ready weird to be clear this doesn't happen with every new technology and it usually doesn't happen this quickly but it's certainly a bummer when it does which raises the question should you hold off on that big purchase that you might have been considering as funny as it's been to joke about i don't think ploof actually regrets this purchase he paid a lot of money and the dwf is pretty cool but he's also been using arguably the best gaming monitor on the planet for the last six months and he pretty much still does one thing that's worked out really well for him is that he pretty much never notices the text fringing issue that some have complained about with these qdo lid panels and compared to my regular oled gaming display that i've been using for less than a month he has no image retention whatsoever while i have some so it's always a personal decision are you happy with what you're getting for your money well if you are then don't let some shiny new toy make you feel bad about it there's always going to be something better coming and often for cheaper but we don't love our gadgets because having the best one makes us feel superior we love them because of what they enable like great gaming experiences on that note by the way we've got some new testing equipment in the lab a photodiode and oscilloscope that are both fast enough to measure the response times of oleds and we've been looking for an excuse to throw them at the original dw as it turns out that's one area where somewhat predictably both of these performed identically with just .16 millisecond black to white transition times that is absolutely freaking incredible but bye lcd see you later so regardless of which one you choose and we're going to have them both linked down below it's clear that now is a heck of a time to pick up a top-tier gaming display samsung msi and philips all have qdo-led monitors coming out over the next few months or a year some of which are going to have cool features that these ones don't have like power delivery for one cable charging your laptop but don't feel bad about that just enjoy the tech like you're going to enjoy this segway to our sponsor jackery from the 24th of november to the 28th jackery is offering up to 1080 us dollars off some of
