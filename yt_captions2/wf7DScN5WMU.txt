this might be one of the coolest ai tools i have come across in a while this tool will help you build fully functioning apps whether you are a technical individual such as a developer or non-technical but want to build apps want to see your ideas come to life quickly i think this is a tool that is great especially if you are someone who wants to build a full-fledged app like a very intense product or if you are someone on the flip side maybe you're a business person and you have a great idea you want to pitch it to investors or create a startup but don't have any money necessarily to put towards hiring a developer this will help [music] you also thank you to hubspot for sponsoring this video i have linked down below their free ai blog writer to help you create ai content quickly so go check it out all right the tool i am talking about is called tl draw and i've been playing around with it for a while building some really interesting things mainly i've been building a lot of different developer or building a lot of different games that when i was first learning to code would take me hours and weeks literally weeks sometimes to build now there's a flip side to this is that a good thing i mean what i learned during that time those pain points i faced when i was learning to code and building these games on my own is it a bad thing now that i can build them in seconds with this tool i mean what does that do for people who are learning to code if they're using this i think it is still a very valuable tool that we can tinker around with build projects with as long as you really understand what is going on at the end of the day for me i had my biggest learnings when i was a developer when i was actually working in that role at a company not when i was just tinkering around and i think that goes for this is a way to really fast forward that for people who want to learn to code and then as i mentioned the flip side you're non-technical but you have this amazing vision you want to bring it to life this will help you okay i i'm i'm doing from too much talking let's get into it all right we are back with jack again i find it way easier when i doing things that include screen sharing to sit at my dining room table than my office with my massive monitor because there's no space for my camera so here we are actually i'll share with you i'll insert a photo here i'll take a photo mr mugs is literally laying right underneath the table here and just like this is great life is good all right let's get back to it i'm going to share my screen here and we will jump into tl draw and i think it's really interesting because there are two ways to really use this tool one being you can go to make. tld draw.com and tinker around that way by putting in your open ai key so you do need an open aai api key or the other way is you can work with it locally in their github they have a repository which really goes through a read me which really goes through all of the instructions all right give me a sec here i got to get my screen share going also when it comes to to streamlining using ai uh in our workflows there are so many areas where its implementation can be beneficial i mean we're going to go through one today using sketches and turning them into code but i want to share another one once you get that part when you have the code whether you're creating a blog a website whatever the situation is one example would be through optimizing the content on our website or platform which plays a big role in attracting visitors and improving seo and one of the best ways to improve seo is through informative blog posts even though i personally do not enjoy the process at all when it comes to creating blog posts it just it feels very i don't know it's the writing for me i always get writer block i know how important they are and now using ai tools i don't have to spend so much time writing them or better yet so much time procrastinating in writing them because i still do write them let's take a look at hubspot's free ai blog writer tool okay let's go through an example of using the ai blog writer to create a post okay once we we have the blog created one thing i always like to do as a little tip is i like to add in or thread in different data and facts uh to the blog so it makes it more creditable creditable credible credit you get it you get what i'm saying and in the past i would have spent significant amount of time working on researching or looking up different articles uh through google to incorporate into this blog post however with the ai blog writer i don't need to leave the hubs swat platform to find this information it offers machine learning back articles that i can prompt to retrieve the specific information or facts i need also i want to share one more feature with you that i find particularly valuable this is for all you datadriven individuals it is built in reporting to measure roi and as someone who values data decision making i i think it's so key especially as you are iterating and building up different content i love having the ability to track which blog posts are actually resonating with my audience enabling me to create more of these types of posts i linked it down below so make sure to go use it today it is completely free and it will help you so much at work in your uh personal projects i mean we are here to build and then ai tools like this one can take care of the rest all right let's get speaking of building let's get building all right i'm sharing my screen here i'm in make real tl draw and it looks kind of boring right now i know but give it a minute here what's really cool about this is i did put my open ai api key risky but cool it's not that risky as long as right after you're done building uh i always remove it and then delete my key maybe i'm hyper paranoid but this is what i do before we jump into it though i want to share with you here um on hacker news uh something that i was searching up which is how does tl draw work like what is the tech behind it i'm someone who's very interested of course in how things actually work rather than just using these tools so i wanted to check it out so i found this message here from a guy named or a person named steve and he apparently is one of the authors um and i think this is really interesting so they they say the whole teal draw project is mit licensed and open source i think that's amazing um and you can actually because it's still in development you can still contribute join the discord channel which is still something you can do now and then it goes back to a little bit more about the project itself so at the bottom there is a renderer named teal draw core that is essentially uh put react components on a canvas ui engine you give it a data model along with a set of utilities to interpret that model all right let's see here what else do we have the main library exports the whole tl draw app as a react component named tl draw that's one thing that we'll get to in this uh video here is basically you can export your code and then input into a different app project that you're creating by importing tld draw component this is just so cool all right let's get to it what are we going to build with this i i feel like one thing i wanted to build with this this is going to be tricky and might take some time but i really want to build fully functioning calculator this is something that when i first learning to code i feel like i spent a lot of time on working you know those games where you're building a calculator so let's go ahead and build a calculator all right so all you have to do once you've inserted your api is literally doodle what you want to draw so we'll start here this is where our total will go then i need to pull up on screen here calculator because you know i have a massive calculator actually in front of me i guess i could use this for reference yeah sure let's use it all right we're going to do a basic one though so we have there's 3x4 one cop paste paste we'll just keep on pasting two come on is there another one no this is the suspense part i'm just kidding it's not that suspenseful but let's go here all right perfect now let's copy copy paste paste we'll just keep on doing this one more time paste then i didn't really add in a lot of room for the numbers the here is what we'll do our calculator will kind of be a little strange but that's okay i'll walk you through what i'm doing here in a sec here first let's add in the numbers so we have seven then we [music] have eight i'm literally just using for reference the calculator in front of me and then we're going to fill in all of these boxes here [music] for it's not perfect i mean the ui could look better and you can make it better if you want to spend more time on it but let's just go so you could do like that make it perfect but i feel like we're going to be here for a long time if we do that all right are we doing it are we committed now did i commit us i committed us speed this part up all right we have our calculator it's a very eccentric calculator because of the different number sizes but you get the point now what i'm going to do is i am going to do a very simplified calculator so there will be an addition sign subtraction and then of course equals and let's make these a bit bigger now the key here is we need to give it instructions as to what to do otherwise it doesn't know what to do so what you can do is i will put some arrows towards it but say this is a calculator and it's funny cuz tl draw they the engineers who built it are kind of uh they have a good sense of humor apparently because you could have to literally encourage the ai model to that it's a good coder and it can build amazing code for you in order to get really good results so you are an amazing coder build a working calculator for me that can add and subract numbers okay so now let's put this let's put this here and then we will draw like this and then go here i don't know if this makes sense or not we'll see if that works okay and then total total goes here i think that makes sense and then i don't know if this is going to work let's try it i feel this might be too vague for the system but let's let's try it so we go here make real and the suspense it's wild how fast it is and i'm going to show you the code afterwards this is we're taking things to the next level here okay it it's not going that fast i lied when i did this when i made a ping pong game it went really fast maybe it's cuz it's more complex okay double click to interact so they kind of moved some things around but that's okay okay let's go can i make you bigger can i make you bigger oops here we go all right so double clicked interact let's try it out let's do 7 + 7 equals how cool is that that's literally taking a drawing we just did and creating a calculator let's try subtract three so it should give us 11 this is a future like okay so this is a small example but if i go to their where is it here this is their docs give me a sec here let me go to their te dra okay they have made some incredible incredible different things like this one is a whole blog post that they made so now what you can do from here you can simply where are we here go copy html or let's do op open in we don't have to log in perfect all right so now you see here we can see the code that was generated from this and if we go down it's very this is very simple code um you can actually specify what you want it to build in i've seen i think it was wes boss uh who used what did he use for it was it typescript i think it was but you can use javascript with this as well um like sorry not javascript you can use very specific frameworks or languages i have only tried it with javascript though i haven't tried it with anything else so that would be interesting anyways here is our fully functioning calculator made just from a sketch like i need to reiterate this to you we literally took a sketch i made generated a fully functioning calculator with code that now we can work with this will take your coding whether you are like i said an act ual developer or someone who just wants to build really cool stuff and make it possible i don't know i think this is really interesting i'm curious to get your thoughts have you played around with this if you are someone who has a side project on the go or wants to start a business is this something you would use to at least get started with it i linked it down below um so go check it out i just think it's really cool and we're literally turning sketches to code mugs what do you think he's snoring he doesn't care all right in typical tiff fashion i forgot got to film an outro so we are already on the next day but i wanted i couldn't leave the video i couldn't end the video without saying goodbye to you so i hope you enjoyed going through this drawing a sketch and turning it to code and also understanding a bit more of the background behind it what it can be used for what ai tools can be used for speaking of which i link down below hubs spots free ai blog writer i love this tool and i hope you do as much as i do because you know we got to focus on the more difficult tasks than blog writing i'm just kidding that's a very difficult task too but ai can really help us with it all right if you haven't already hit that subscribe button you know the drill leave any comments or questions you have and i'll see you soon thanks [music]
