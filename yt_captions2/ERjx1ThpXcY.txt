in a lot of ways we're living in the golden age of documentaries a new big budget doc series is coming out on netflix or amazon prime or whatever at the same time camera technology has advanced to the point where it's possible for documentary film crews to afford cameras that look really good which is seriously upping the production value it used to be that cinema cameras cost so much that they were really only practical for big hollywood productions but thankfully those days are over and with a lot of new cameras from sony canon or blackmagic or wherever you can get some amazing results but just having a good camera and lens isn't automatically going to make your documentary look cinematic cinematic cinematic cinematic cinematic cinematic cinematic cinematic cinematic getting a cinematic look there's so much more to what we call the cinematic look than just spending money on gear and in this video i'm going to get into five things you can do to make your next project look as cinematic as possible hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsyth documentary cinematographer and filmmaker and on this channel i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer the word cinematic gets thrown around a lot on the internet to the point where it's hard to even know what it means anymore i've said jimy jeliker so many times the words have lost all meaning it used to be that non- cinema cameras like cam quars or news broadcast cameras looked so much worse than the hollywood gear that it was obvious to everyone cinema looked cinematic and everything else looked like cheap video this was especially true in the documentary world where tighter budgets meant cameras with smaller sensors that could only shoot in specific frame rates luckily for us that's all changed and there is no reason why your next dock shouldn't look amazing when i first started shooting video one of the most confusing things for me to understand coming over from the world of stills photography was what all the different frame rates meant it took a while and i got all sorts of weird results shooting my dslrs and different frame rates but eventually i learned to just stick to one and not change it unless a client demanded it for me project shot outside this frame rate looked terrible and i'll do anything i can to avoid it if you compare a hollywood movie to a football game or a news broadcast there's an obvious difference in the way they look and i don't think any of us wants our next film to look like a cnn report maybe it's just because of my background as a dp but to me there's something much more organic looking about a movie whereas the news looks more artificial i guess is the best word it's too sharp and too smooth and the real world just doesn't look like that that's because most news and sports and a lot of reality tv as well is shot in 30 frames a second which is not natural to our eyes i don't want this video to veer off into a deep technical dive into frame rates but the easiest way to understand it is to wave your hand in front of your face like this notice how your hand blurs as the movement gets faster your average sports or news broadcast there's no blurring at all everything is totally sharp this is good for sports where you want to follow a lot of fast action but it doesn't look organic at least not to me and i think hollywood agrees because pretty much every hollywood movie is shot at 24 or 25 frames a second depending on what part of the world it was made in in north america we use 24 in the uk and some other places use 25 but they're pretty similar so if there's one thing you can do that will have the greatest overall impact on the cinematic quality of your work just setting the camera to 24 frames a second will make a huge difference right away like i said unless someone forces me to do it i shoot every single project they work on at 24 and i'd recommend putting your camera on that and never changing it unless you want to shoot slow motion of course depending on your camera it might also say 23.976 but for all practical purposes it's the same thing the second thing i'd suggest has to do with your lens and not your camera let's compare the average news broadcast to one of my favorite looking movies in the last couple of years joker notice how in joker the shot of wen phoenix on the bus the subject is isolated and focused while the background and even some of the foreground fades off into blurriness this is called depth of field and the out of focus area in the background is called bokeh there's quite a few reasons some of them are deliberate and stylistic why the news has so little depth of field but that could be entire video in itself all we need to know here is that depth of field is closely tied to the cinematic look so using it intentionally in your documentary can really up the visual style there are a couple of ways you can play with up the field but the easiest way is by using a longer lens and a smaller aperture if you're not sure what i'm talking about the aperture is the little number on the side of your lens that says 1.4 or 2.8 when companies sell lenses they generally describe them by the minimum aperture and put the number right in the name of the lens so you know what you're getting the lens i'm shooting this video on is the sony 16 to35 2.8 you guessed it it has a minimum aperture of 2.8 a good prime lens might go down to 1.4 or even lower a zoom lens that comes to your camera is probably more like f4 but you don't need to rush off and buy a bunch of primes just so you can shoot everything at 1.4 in order to get some depth of field wide-angle lenses have less depth of field than telephoto lenses so just by using a longer lens you're going to get more background blur so an f4 kit lens at 24 mm might not have much depth of field but at 50 mm you're going to get a lot more i'm also not saying you need to shoot everything at the minimum aperture because it's cinematic your aperture should be a stylistic choice and you pick it bas based on the situation you're in and what look you want if you're following moving characters on an 85 1.4 you might have a really hard time keeping the action in focus because your depth of field is going to be razor thin you also tend to get slightly better image quality when stopping down a little from your minimum aperture and a lot of hollywood dps shoot at f4 or even 5.6 though their lenses can go a lot lower and of course if you want a very long depth of field like for a landscape you can shoot at f8 or even more personally i shoot most things between 2.8 or f4 for most projects unless it's super dark i think that's a pretty good balance between keeping things in focus while still giving some depth of feel to the background play around with different f- stops and see what works for you but not shooting at f11 on a wide- angle lens is going to make your footage look a lot more cinematic one thing to keep in mind is that if you want to shoot at low apertures during the day you'll need to pick up a variable nd filter to compensate for the extra light hitting your sensor the third tip i have is also about your lens specifically how to use it while filming i think zoom lenses are the most versatile when you're starting out and they help you pack a a bunch of different focal lengths into one package so you can get a variety of shots but if there's one thing you almost never see in hollywood except in very specific examples it's a lens zooming in and out mid shot that's called a crash zoom and you'll see it a lot in shows like the office or parks and wreck but not in something like blade runner now most hollywood movies use prime lenses anyways because they have the time to carefully set up each shot and they're not going to miss the moments that you might as a documentary filmmaker but that doesn't change the fact fact that there is nothing cinematic about a crash zoom when you're shooting with a zoom lens it can be really tempting to just stand in one spot and then just continuously zoom in and out to get different shots but if you want to get a more cinematic look try being a little more intentional here when i was starting out a dp gave me some really good advice and that was to use my zoom lens like a variable prime that meant i should pick a focal length that worked for that moment and then stick with it for a little while before changing so that not all of your shots are zooming all over the place of course you should zoom when you need to because that's what a zoom lens is for but let's imagine that you're shooting a wide shot at 24 mil and then your character start showing you something and you want to get some detail shots so maybe you zoom in to 50 mm to get the shot when you notice another good detail rather than cranking the zoom lens to go even tighter just move your feet and stay on that 50 then take a few steps back and stay at the same focal length until there's a reason to change this means that in the edit your shots aren't constantly zooming in and out you'll have a better chance at not needing to use an ugly crash zoom because you did one in the middle of a really important moment hollywood prime lenses often come in a set with a 24 35 a 15 and 85 and your zoom lens probably has markings on it at all the same numbers so you can use them for a reference with your variable prime with a bit of practice you might find that you don't have to continuously zoom in and out to make interesting frames okay let's change gears here and talk about light in hollywood dps spend most of their time lighting a scene way more than they actually spend shooting in documentaries we don't have a team of people and dozens of light fixtures that we can set up for every shot but we can apply some of the same lighting principles to get more cinematic results of all the different techniques i've tried the easiest and most reliable way to use light to your advantage on a dock shoot is by backlighting whenever possible backlight just means that the main source of light is coming from behind your character or subject which makes them pop out of the background and makes a 2d image look more 3d start looking for this in movies and you'll find examples again and again where the characters are back lit and if you want to make docks look more cinematic this is something you can do really easily just figure out where the main source of light is in your scene and move yourself so that it's behind your main subject if you're shooting outside in natural light the sun is probably your main source so position yourself so that the sun is over the shoulder of your character and you'll get a more 3d and therefore cinematic image you can do this with any light source from a tv to a table lamp like the one i have behind me and this works for shooting people objects buildings whatever just get the light behind your your subject and it will instantly pop more sticking on the theme of lighting when we're filming documentaries you might think that there's not much use for lights on a run and gun project i used to think the same thing and it was probably 2 years into my career before i started investing in lighting gear but since then i've learned that adding some hollywood lighting techniques to your documentary shoots can make a huge difference in the overall cinematic quality i was recently working on a big budget national geographic doc series and the main dp was a super talented dude that i have respected for years i'm not going to say what it was because i'm not exact ly sure the wording of the contracts i signed and i don't want to get a call from a lawyer but the show has been running for a few years and it's consistently one of the best looking docs on tv when i finally got to work on it myself i understood why the dp was constantly adding little lights to a scene to enhance what was already there and it made a big difference one example was when we were filming in a car at night we taped a 2ft light panel with a green gel on it and set it on a super low level but it was just enough to separate the people from the darkness while looking like it might have actually come from overhead street lights it looked amazing and so much better than it would have if we just rolled on the inside of a dark car on a different show i was filming a campfire scene and realized that the characters were just a little too dark and it was hard to see so i took a tiny aperture mc light that has built in effects set it to the fire mode and then stuck it on a gorilla pod just out of frame it wasn't a crazy difference but it was enough to brighten up the whole scene while making it still feel real and that's something that's really important to remember as much fun as lighting can be to play around with you always want to make sure that that things look realistic and natural if something looks lit viewers won't buy it as real and the whole mood is ruined roger deakin who's one of my favorite hollywood dps tells a story about filming the sha shank redemption apparently someone came up to him after seeing the movie and asked why he hadn't used any lights or something like that he loves the question because the truth was that roger had used a huge amount of lights but it was so intentional and he was so good with it that it came off as looking natural that should definitely be your goal too especially in documentaries and that's the fifth tip in a nutshell supplement natural light but keep it natural and there we go five things you can do to make your documentary look more cinematic this is not an exhaustive list but i hope it's given you guys a few ideas we are so lucky to be living in a time when dogs don't have to look bad anymore so do us all a favor and take advantage of the times and some of those hollywood techniques in your next project hope you liked that video and learned something new if you enjoyed that maybe think about hitting that subscribe button or maybe checking out this other video
