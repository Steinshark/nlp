i just lost what was supposed to be my biggest paying film job of the year and to make matters worse i had crew flying in on non-refundable plane tickets but instead of just staying home we decided to pivot a little bit and pack the car and head out to eastern canada for a seven day filmmaking road trip so i'm going to bring you along and as we go i'm going to share some of my top essential accessories to make a trip like this possible because believe me this has not been smooth sailing on top of losing all that money for not working my car's broken down five times in four days the car situation is obviously deteriorated even further i spend thousands of dollars on repairs and i haven't showered since we left i smell terrible right now with all that stuff going wrong this trip could have been a total nightmare but because we had the right gear we were able to stick it out and it was totally worth it i mean just look at this place okay this is a little easier to talk out of the wind a bit more as you can see my hair has some incredible volume today some of the items that i want to talk about today these accessories are not necessarily filmmaking gear but i'm talking about things that you can bring that are going to make your general quality of life as a filmmaker living out of a car or in a remote environment much much nicer but before i get into that stuff i should probably just take a minute to rewind and show you how we got into this mess in the first place [music] [music] maybe six hours [music] mercy i said i want to say gracias did you hear that yes sticks today [music] [music] hello the the engine light is on it came on when we were going up a hill okay are you open tomorrow you are okay uh let me think about it maybe we'll find a place to camp and we'll come and see you in the morning or maybe we'll just keep going i'm not sure but thank you very much seemed like such a fun idea let's take a road trip they said now we're stranded in quebec on a sunday night with no options foreign so even though the engine is falling apart the first thing for any good filmmaking road trip that i would recommend gives you peace of mind that at least the battery is never going to die because you left the light on or something and that is this guy this is a usb charged jumper so if your battery ever dies instead of having to look for jumper cables or ask someone else to help you out this thing can jump a car from completely flat to running twice on a single charge and it just operates off usb it's super handy i just keep it in the glove box and i pretty much never worry about the battery dying anymore okay so the second piece of gear in any camera road trip that's super important is a way to keep everything powered now we're camping our way across canada and some of these sites have electrical outlets and some don't and you never want to be in a situation where you can't shoot because you just don't have any power so the next things i want to talk about are these large capacity batteries compared to the normal usb blocks they can just charge one or two usb a or c items at a time these things have full size power outlets which means i can charge drones i can charge camera batteries pretty much anything you can recharge a computer it has a lot of power and it can do usb and full size power so if you're going to do a camera road trip of your own i would highly recommend getting some sort of power solutions thank you it's actually quite pretty here it's really beautiful yeah it's really nice almost makes you wish i wasn't only thinking about my car almost enough to make you forget almost enough to make you forget but not quite [music] so multi-tool isn't really exclusive to road trips it's pretty much just a general good thing to have for all filmmaking needs but on a road trip like this is where they start to really shine because you can't bring a whole toolbox you know and we can actually put this thing to work right now i'm making kindling for a fire always check a multi-tool in takes no space and just bring it on any filmmaking shoot in general but especially if you're out in the middle of nowhere on a road trip foreign this is not at all what we plan to do the car is definitely in trouble the check engine light is on your best laid plans are going to fall apart you just have to accept it and try and keep your cool i'm trying to remind myself of that but i'm also bracing for the possibility that instead of a seven day maritime road trip we might be in this mosquito infested campground on the side of the highway [music] all right this is dumb this is my worst nightmare [music] get some good footage there santi to call you back we need to gather some information please don't hang up until we've confirmed your callback request is complete goodbye goodbye the car situation is obviously deteriorated even further now we're looking at options to get a tow [music] the car died and the fourth mechanic we visited now couldn't tell us why and said we had to take it into a dealership and that you didn't recommend driving it at all if possible so we're camping one last time then i'm dropping the car off in a dealership and then we're gonna rent a car and keep going on the road trip and just hope they fix it before these guys have to be back for their flights [music] okay so the next essential accessory for me anyways this one's slightly on the bougie side but i think it's worth it it's been three days of constant camping and driving and i will not lie i smell terrible right now i've just been wearing the same cotton t-shirt every day so my secret for traveling and filmmaking where sometimes you can only bring a handful of shirts for uh maybe a three-week shoot um is these guys merino wool this is like special kind of wool from a sheep i think in new zealand if you've never heard of it before and this stuff is magic because it doesn't stink so i can wear one of these for like five days i know that probably is gross and triggers some people but i can probably wear one of these t-shirts for about five days before i smell like anything so that's pretty huge for me anyways because nobody likes the stinky guy in the van definitely a little bit on the expensive side but i think it's worth it [music] foreign [music] thank you [music] people always ask what canadian food is it we finally made it to nova scotia we are in my friend's tiny house we're four days late we spent pretty much the entire trip so far just in mechanics garages around new brunswick so not what we were planning when we set out but we're just rolling with it we're having a ton of fun now that we're here it feels like we finally arrived also a really good time to talk about the next thing that is now a travel essential item for me on a filmmaking road trip because we just got here and we're in a really rural area and there are mosquitoes everywhere inside this house and no one is going to sleep if we don't do something about it this might seem like a gimmick but richard got this last year when we were shooting a tree planning documentary just to see if it worked and this thing heats up little pads through some sort of sorcery and creates a five meter bubble with almost no bugs at all if you've ever sat in front of a laptop trying to back up footage while mosquitoes attack you it is horrifically bad so you might call me bougie for this but just remember that i have spent over two and a half years in cumulative nights in a tent so i am not some city dude who's never been outside but this cool little thing probably emits a bunch of chemicals but it is paradise when you're out in the woods other than that we're going to take some tours around the area tomorrow just go look for some beautiful stuff and really good news since we're here i think this is going to be the last day in a row where i don't shower so with any luck tomorrow i'm gonna look semi-presentable but no promises [music] thank you [music] foreign [music] final update we just got back to toronto i know this is jumping all over the place but we got a call at the very last minute on friday afternoon that the car was fixed miraculously and that we had to come pick it up right away so we rushed up to the dealership grabbed the car and then did an'-hour'00 kilometer which is like 1 200 miles from my american friends all the way across the country back to toronto and yeah now we're back it was a really interesting road trip i guess we plan to be doing a lot more filmmaking and shooting in scenic places but that just didn't happen the takeaway isn't to go buy a bunch of stuff it's just to go out and actually make stuff and there's a few things that if you include them in your kit is going to make your life a lot easier but the stuff isn't the point the road trip is the point and the end result wasn't even the point we didn't have to make some sort of hardcore documentary even though that's kind of what we wanted to do in the beginning then we pivoted to let's just go shoot some beautiful locations that didn't work out either so we just made the best of it and in the end we made something instead of just sitting around and that's the most important thing of all so yeah get out there make stuff and if you found those accessories helpful let me know what accessories you would take i probably forgot a bunch and this is not an extensive list so let me know in the comments and i'll see you guys back here for the next video we put a set in there yeah let's get a little adventure some here foreign
