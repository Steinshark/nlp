this is a nintendo 3ds or rather this is yeah you heard me the partner ctr is a beast unlike anything we've ever seen before it's a 3ds development and capture kit that was manufactured by kyoto micro computer company for nintendo and like other console dev kits it boasts features that are absent from its retail kin like the ability to remotely debug software and it also has extra memory and special controls but what sets this one apart from the development kits we've looked at before is that it adds back a feature that nearly every console has had in some manner since the invention of video games the ability to connect to a tv of course connecting ah tv wasn't enough for the 3ds so what about second tv this thing is absolutely wild this ds that i'm holding in my hand this is just a dummy roller all the brains are actually in here you can fit so much brains in here oh and so much segway to our sponsor you green ugreen's 100 watt power strip includes three ac outlets three usbc ports and a usb a port for maximum compatibility you can easily charge your iphone 13 to 60 in just 30 minutes learn more at the link down below foreign [music] covering older console dev kits we've been inundated with emails from people wanting to send us their precious retro relics to have them featured and when twitter users swimming got in touch his offering really stood out from the crowd of all the best selling consoles out there only the nintendo 3ds lacks a way to output to a television super nintendo and gamecube both had ways to play games from the game boy family the playstation portable hat models with directv out and the playstation tv was essentially just a non-portable ps vita even the ds lite had a built-in method for getting composite video though it was actually disabled in firmware and went undiscovered until 2020. over the years then there have been a handful of homebrew attempts to record video off of the 3ds some use the wi-fi some replaced the infrared with usb but none were quite successful in getting direct monitor output in real time as for this dev kit it can not only output directly to a monitor but it can output to one monitor for each screen and to this day it is the only official way to get video out from a 3ds game unfortunately you can't just take any old 3ds and grab video from it with this box this may look like a normal 3ds it may have buttons and speakers and joysticks and even screens like a 3ds but inside it's actually just a couple of custom boards everything in here is getting wired back to the main unit through these two big beefy cables and in fact the video signals for these displays are coming from this guy we'll kick things off with some stuff we can do without disassembling the unit like wake our software from sleep and by pressing x and y at the same time getting some basic debugging information here we see the build number of this particular game the mode of the system which seems to be production we're not 100 sure what these bars are if i had to guess i might say that it was something to do with like frame times but i am guessing whoa what's happening oh my god we're not even capturing that one that one let's get it on camera then some of the stuff is going to be up top some of the stuff's going to be on the bottom yes they were still believing in that at the time we spent the last hour figuring out capture for the top because it's how it puts a weird signal anyway the point is what we're about to show you is on the bottom oh and we crashed and we crashed okay press any button to shut does it open sometimes no it didn't even open in the uh development mode i just wanted to see it crash oh you just wanted to see it crash you're just you're just agent of chaos you're just taking pleasure in my pain at this point oh yeah i see config all right hey this is looking more interesting we got some menu settings debug settings user info settings hid settings ooh touch panel calibration analog stick calibration uh what do we got for menu setup setting oh i see i can change my language oh i can switch over to dev mode okay debug settings latency emulation wow you can add latency what would it be like with a hundred milliseconds of latency once it normally take this long to boot up no and it looks like it's boot cycling oh no i'm in a boot loop into system settings oh that's not a good sign right up here showing that we're using system 0.0.0 so that that's the firmware version that we're currently on did we just lose our firmware yeah we might have we just have no firmware now so we're just going into system settings and that's it wait hold on other settings wait i got this system update boom yes there's no way this is going to work i figured something out if i hold select while it's booting i can get into the luma 3ds configuration menu here i don't know that this is going to help us but what you guys are looking at here is a a hack for the 3ds because this thing is essentially a 3ds you can hack it to run homebrew games or whatever else just like a normal 3ds and this one has had that done this is a bit of a high risk play but we're going to try a system update to maybe restore a working firmware onto this thing hopefully that doesn't break the luma hacks or whatever else i mean when's the last time the 3ds got a firmware update anyway an error has occurred unable to update cool so we bricked it oh firmware version point 34.0 and we're back this thing is a nightmare you know what happened was we went into the config menu and while i was tooling around changing stuff one of the settings i changed was under menu setting i set the menu type test menu test menu and the test menu is bugged so we need to leave that on home menu the only way we were able to get it back was by going into that menu that flashes up for a second and changing it back to home menu anyone else getting a qa vibe from this user info settings hid settings and calibration lcd settings flicker top flicker bottom luminance level like you can i guess change the out of box experience eula settings you can oh my god you can edit it agree version whatever i'll just set my own eula nice we can just reset the settings right that seems like a good thing to do oh god what is this oh i reset the ubi okay i guess i'm yep going through this all right so wait can we try the dev menu again then whatever you get oh it crashed our suspicion is that to load up the dev menu there's some prerequisite that we're not meeting like a piece of software that has to be loaded up or an access code or key or something along those lines unfortunately it means that we can't access it what we can do though is play video games new super mario brothers 2 has never looked this big and blurry let's go oh wow that really does look like absolute garbage would you like a controller maybe like a controller wait what yeah here have a controller hold on a second should i recognize this controller it's from the wii i i only know the classic controller on the wii well it's a development controller so this is a development controller oh sick so wait wait wait wait shut up oh shoot it works what the heck it looks just like the wii classic controller except has actual you know ergonomic handles on it it's amazing how often you see a development version of a product you're like oh that's way better how did the stupid atrocity that made it to retail ever happen what the heck else do we have going on here what is video mode if i change this am i going to cause problems uh you might but all you need to do is reboot if it does what vertical oh oh cool wait why is it why is the top screen cloned oh this is for 3d projection that's so cool did they ever actually demo 3ds content like this because this is the left and the right view right yep oh no way what else we got okay so we see only the side by side and then that's on a separate screen sure fine okay top bottom 3d sure right because if you're in like a big you know demo haul or something like that a lot of the time they would have like vertical you know on the side of the stage or whatever you got to be ready for that sort of thing even if you never use it this is wild on the surface the stuff mostly makes sense here's your sd card slot just like the 3ds had here's your flash card slot where you would put a game you would think except that this system actually cannot play standard 3ds games that you would buy off the shelf it only plays special nintendo developer only cartridges which is i mean seems unnecessary but cool sort of i guess then we've got okay these we can show in a little bit more detail later but this is handling the inputs coming into the box which actually doing the compute and then the outputs sending display out to this and then we've got our external controller and then what the doodad is this oh this is just an ir emitter because why would it need to be small when it's not on a handheld system i without further ado i'm ready to finally play some big screen new super mario brothers 2 with a controller this is not emulated folks this is an actual 3ds this just feels wrong doesn't it like quite wrong indeed it's wrong and i love it ready to take it apart oh wait we haven't shown the back yet the back is super trippy you've got capture over usb that's why we're actually using our dvi to hdmi out into a capture card because the capture is honestly not great dual dvi outputs that's for your top and bottom display which seems to be some kind of weird variant of 720p and then this is kind of weird look at that this is a wii adapter that goes into a dc power in and then the same av output from the nintendo wii so it could actually output via component if you really wanted to although it's not clear to me ah yes okay it would be in place of dv output 1 which is i guess the top screen probably debugging usb port and there is an external antenna because this is a metal cage which is not great for rf performance and the easiest way to get it open seems to be to just take off the side panel lttstore.com screwdriver finally shipping to early buyers wait should we open up the 3ds first to show people how not normal this is oh wow what appears to be more debugging or something over here for the board and then i mean as advertised tenor it's just it looks like just basic boards in there to handle the screen and i o where there should be a ds there's just plastic okay that is super cool what we're looking at here is an fpga these are very expensive but very cool because unlike the chip that shipped in your retail 3ds this chip here can actually be reprogrammed in the field so if nintendo during the development of the 3ds hardware were to go oh gee you know we found some bugs or we found a way to improve performance and tweak the actual what will be final silicon they can roll that tweak out to these development boxes so that they will be essentially the new hardware of course the drawback is that at nintendo's scale just millions or tens or hundreds of millions of units the cost of these would be completely untenable in a retail product what's a cyclone 3 worth 200 to a thousand dollars well because this is still lots of performance for lots of things let's say you were developing uh i don't know a smart door lock or something like that this can be fully reprogrammed not emulated reprogrammed to behave exactly the same way that your mass-produced chip would so you can much more easily test things without doing a full tape out which costs millions of dollars what else are we looking at here we got two gigs of ddr2 memory that's a lot more than the 3ds had that makes sense because in development builds tend to be buggier and especially more bloated double a batteries trying to think why could we possibly need two double a cells maybe we need three volt power that's a possibility well why don't you start taking it apart and uh the connections might tell you something i can take it apart more oh yeah absolutely oh all right yeah understand which of the chords all right let's do it hey there we go all right this is definitely our main brain this is where our power comes wait what the f shut up there's a wii sensor wait is this also a wii why is there a wii ir bar here from what i've been told that was just likely to save money how sure are you that this isn't also a wii dev kit ah yep we found it remember we didn't comment on there being a we ir sensor bar port that's because this doesn't seem to be actually hooked up to anything if you look it was likely a cost saving measure where they just used the same assembly for the av multi-out and sensor bar and then just didn't hook this part up just only hooked up the av and does the wii u this is the wii u so it uses that same configuration then what please be a plain english silkscreen explanation of what you are because as far as i can tell this is the actual 3ds not that one we've got our nand flash we've got another cyclone no but there's no ram here we've got some nintendo laser etched arm processor which makes a lot more sense to be the actual 3ds processor maybe it includes both whatever revision they were shipping and then also an fpga so they have the ability to change it up if they need to i'm just guessing at this point to be honest with you guys do you know the answers to any of this i have a pretty good guess okay what's your guess go down another layer go down a layer okay i'll go down there still no ram on the sport which is a little confusing but it is host to some of the primary functions of the device wireless connectivity power in the sd card slot as well as the video output and input input here i thought this was getting kind of boring this is the farthest thing from boring remember what i said about fpgas being field reprogrammable what that means is that they can fulfill all sorts of different functions that means this board in spite of its size is probably more of a daughter board acting as just a bluetooth card and power supply and sd card slot and video output board but if i had to guess based on that this is the board with our dvi output and our capture usb i would say that this one is probably handling video capture which would mean that this last one could very well be the actual brains of our 3ds however my suspicion these three boards are the actual 3ds what do you think i think you're close close i think what's actually happening is this board right here you've got ram right there you've got your processor i want to say right there i can't they read it from here but this right here is handling your developer output so this is actually running whatever debug interface we have no way of accessing exactly okay and that allows us low level access to what is probably the actual 3ds right here in the event that we brick our firmware or something like that through this debug port which i if i was smart i would have looked at and yeah yeah i think you're right through this debug port i could actually reset this to a factory state or an upgraded state or whatever the case may be now this board is still part of the 3dsness of it because it otherwise doesn't have a game slot but it's not anymore part of it than say for example this bluetooth module it's it's a it's a daughter board okay did we ever figure out what these bloody double a's are for i'm gonna confess i don't know is it to simulate a like battery loss like power loss like i don't why would you need a battery in there the popular theory is real-time clock real time clock oh okay so basically a cmos battery but like with enormous mondo capacity all right fair enough as cool as it is though the partner ctr capture debugger isn't exactly unique and this right here the is nitro capture is actually the previous generation unit for the nintendo ds which swimling also sent us is stands for intelligent systems the manufacturer and then nitro was the code name for the nintendo ds and then capture of course is what the unit was made to do capture video many of these were used for various promotional and competition events like the pokemon world championships according to swimling that's where this unit is suspected to have lived out its days and likely where it got the uh dent by the gba slot that likes to scratch up cartridge labels there's not a whole lot to this one though that we didn't already see it uses a gamecube power adapter rather than a wii power adapter gamecube av cables rather than wii av cables and has dip switches to control video settings the controller is a shell of the system just like the partner ctr and it can play all retail ds and gba games and capturing video can be done over usb however its coolest party trick the capture a video off of the ds requires a working install of japanese windows xp in order to run the software it also lacks wireless functionality opting instead for an rj45 jack which on our unit is unfortunately damaged meaning that we have no network connectivity but i guess for the intended use of this unit it makes a ton of sense since events like a pokemon tournament are inevitably going to be chock full of wireless interference i mean you can't have your world championship game delayed because a
