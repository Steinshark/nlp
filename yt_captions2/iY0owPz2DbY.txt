you're in full-time studies or a full-time job 
yet you want to continue to upskill level up   whether it be to learn how to code learn a new 
language programming or maybe just spoken learn   something new but there's one problem there is 
no time to do it we've all been there before when   our schedules are slammed we feel like there's 
nothing else to take on yet we want to get ahead   we see these people on social media wondering 
how do they do it all where does all the time   come from they have families they have kids we 
have families we are busy how does everyone do   it all in order to get ahead maybe you want to get 
ahead for financial reasons maybe it's to level   up in your career build a business whatever the 
case may be what are the biggest challenges that i   personally have faced and i know a lot of you have 
faced as well hearing from you about it is where   to find the time how to balance either full-time 
studies a full-time job while learning something   new today i'm going to share with you just how i 
managed to have a full-time job run a business and   also continue to learn i did a video like this a 
while back and i really wanted to make another one   because there was a lot of follow-up questions 
from it mainly around well tiff i'm doing all   these things i'm managing my time but i'm not 
seeing results so i want to talk to you today   about some unconventional ways to really manage 
your time and stay focused and actually you know   what we're going to get into that more later i'm 
not going to give all my secrets away right away   but i wanted to share this video with you i hope 
you find this my experience very valuable i've had   to use a lot of these techniques time management 
and learning on the side while continuing to go   full speed on whatever it is on your other side 
is something that i've had to do throughout my   entire life basically from graduating high school 
i remember i was in fashion studying fashion while   modeling on the side learning that aspect then it 
transitioned from modeling full-time and then on   the side learning how to code and it was always 
one of the biggest factors in my success thus far   success whatever you want to call it meaning 
reaching my goals exceeding my goals has been   able to find balance and find this way of having 
something going on full time while successfully   managing a few other things on the side okay 
let's get into it oh hit that subscribe button   if you haven't already you know the drill comment 
down below other videos you want me to cover this   is how i make these videos and as always i answer 
every single one of your questions that you leave   down below so leave questions down below and i'll 
make sure to get to them now let's go foreign okay we are gonna go get a coffee catch up 
coffee and chat and uh kind of do what i'm   talking about which is balancing time 
doing things actually i'm not a fan of   doing multiple things at once but in this 
case you know it's fun it's personable but   for the most part multitasking is one 
of the biggest ways to fail actually okay i decided to end up actually at the grocery 
store so i'll uh take you grocery shopping with   me here quickly but long story short multitasking 
when i was speaking about that just a second ago   the problem with it is that too often than not we 
end up doing a lot of things at once really poorly   and this is something i used to do while trying 
to maintain uh my studies and then also learning   on the side for example i was going to school for 
graphic communications management and then also   learning coding on the side so studying while 
learning a new skill and i oftentimes would try   and find times during my lecture or on my lunch 
break to fit in studying wherever i could i could   fit it in here's the problem with that though it's 
quality it goes back to quality over quantity when   you start just trying to squeeze and studying or 
learning new things on top of your studies on top   of your full-time job what this really does is 
yes you might be checking off the box that you're   learning something new but are you retaining it 
are you in an environment where it is best suited   for learning are you learning at your optimal 
time these are all things that we oftentimes   just push to the side just to say we got it done 
almost versus quality and actually putting in the   effort and energy when it is best suited so what 
do i mean by that well we all have an optimal time   for learning for example for me i learn best in 
the morning i know after 3 p.m yes i'm definitely   working still but i'm not there's no way i'm going 
to be learning something new after 3 pm it's not   going to my brain will just not retain it and 
there are so many studies around this that to work   or study at your optimal time and there's also a 
lot of studies that showed to study right before   actually or learn something new before you go to 
sleep for me though even with all that data i know   what works best for me is to do it in the morning 
and i really wanted to highlight that because some   days you're not going to be able to do it all and 
that is okay some days you might have a very some   weeks you might have a very long week at work 
or at school and you're like i'm getting so far   behind in my learnings what do i do well here's 
what helped me one is find a community find people   to hold you accountable so this might be either a 
slack group you're part of a discord group you're   part of or maybe it's even just telling your 
friends and family what you are learning and what   this really does is it holds you accountable to 
learning and not only does it hold you accountable   but you also get to share what you are learning 
which really helps as far as reiterating your   learnings and your skill sets and where kind of 
whole slide the other thing this does is that   hopefully and if not you need to do this is set up 
a schedule a learning schedule and i really really   do not want you to be learning every single day 
on top of working on top of studying whatever the   case may be this is because you are going to burn 
out it's just you know it's one of those things   where working too much having too much on your 
plate it's like one plus one equals two it's going   to happen you need to enjoy your time learning 
and this might result in learning less frequently   but when you do learn you're actually putting more 
quality time into it so for me how i like to do it   as i've shared before in the past is a few times 
a week in the morning i will block off my schedule   and learn whatever it is that i'm learning at 
the moment and for me learning is so important   working in a full-time job as well because as 
some someone who is in developer relations i'm   speaking about new technology all the time i'm 
speaking to developers to engineers so i need   to understand what's coming up what's going on 
building the latest technologies and so it's   very important for me to stay on top of all that 
and i would burn out so quickly with my learnings   if i was continuously learning every day learning 
every weekend all of that you need time to breathe   okay groceries achieved this brings me 
to though the most important thing that   we circle back to that i mentioned at the 
beginning of the video which is your why   why are you learning something new on the side 
see i got into these chips a little bit already   whether you're learning something new on the 
side or you know on top of your full-time job   or on top of your studies the why you need to 
have a reason no matter if you like it or not   as to why you are learning something new and 
this is so important because at the end of the   day there are going to be times when the last 
thing you feel like doing is actually learning   something new and you need to have a very 
strong why in order to motivate you forward okay let's set you down here the y goes back to 
for me what i do is i actually put on my phone   i have where's my phones over there i have a 
vision board where it's actually what i want   my life to look like and in order to get that 
life i'm not talking necessarily materialistic   maybe it's through different experiences or things 
that come up but in order to achieve that this is   the steps i need to take and having that on my 
phone every single day seeing every single day   really motivates me for my why and some days 
as i mentioned i might not even be motivated   it might be disciplined but you need to have that 
why really strong i've actually been thinking of   putting something like a vision board or something 
i know it sounds kind of cheesy but it's so true   having this why will keep you motivated forward 
and that is the biggest takeaway i hope you take   from this video is understand your why and not 
only have a direct why maybe not i want to get   a promotion or i want to get a raise or whatever 
the case may be but think about how that will   affect your life long term and when you start 
really painting a picture and the story of how   this will affect your life whoa this could you 
know spending a few extra hours each week will   have a huge huge impact on my life when i look 
ahead and that makes it more impactful and more   meaningful okay i really hope this has given you 
some inspiration or motivation around when you are   working in a full-time job studying full-time 
and you have things you want to learn on top   of that it is possible do not burn out do not 
try and overwork yourself into the ground but   rather take it day by day find out your why your 
big why have that vision that you are going after   and then also to be kind to yourself break it 
down that you learn a few times a week have that   schedule keep people around you that will not 
only hold you motivated and encourage you but   also hold you accountable leave in the comments 
any questions you have around this what works   best for you when you are balancing everything and
