all right so this it just keeps on coming up look at that i did it again alerts are off uh so this keeps coming up this is apparently the perfect language dream bird okay the future of code podcast recently featured dream bird dream bird is the perfect programming language these are its features when you finish reading through all the features check out the examples okay behold every statement ends with an exclamation mark okay okay i see this isn't a conceptual item this is gonna be a piece of language okay i'm glad we're doing this i guess we're doing this one for the memes uh if you're unsure that's okay you can put a question mark at the line instead it prints debug information about the line to the console for you i almost kind of like that i'm not gonna lie to you i i kind of like that okay it could be a really great little it's actually useful i actually kind of like the dang it you might be wondering what dream bird uses for the not operator which is an exclamation mark in most other languages that's simple the not operator is the semicolon instead i really hate the language i re-hate it i just went from gone okay maybe maybe i could like it did no don't like it nope declarations there are four types of declarations const constants can't be changed in any way okay const constants const variables can be edited but not reassigned okay so this is javascript constants okay classic javascript constants great question mark yeah variable a variable constants cannot be a reassigned or can be a reassigned but not edited that is actually shockingly potentially useful i act okay again once again maybe this language is actually the best one again this is not bad this is not bad okay this is not this is not bad this is not bad and then you got a varvar okay okay okay new for 2023 mutable data is an anti-pattern hell yeah girl use the consecon's const keyword to make a constant constant constant its value will become constant and immutable and will never change please be careful with this keyword as it is very powerful and will affect your all users globally forever what's the difference between cons const i thought cons constants can't be changed in any way within what the hell is a consecon's const naming both variables and constants can be named with any unicode character or string gosh i hate it okay i re-hate this language this includes numbers heavy fortran vibes oh no oh no oh no oh no some languages started uh erased on at zero which can be unintuitive for beginners some languages start an array which isn't representative of how code actually works dream bird does the best of both worlds array start at negative one what am i looking at script all right new for 2020. uh two you can use floats for indices too uh [laughter] ain't no way oh no it even orders it correctly ain't no way that's gonna be happening negative one zero point five one yeah it's a war crime all right in case you really need to vary a variable the when keyword lets you check a variable time uh each time a way hold on okay in case you really need to to vary a variable the when keyword lets you check a variable each time it mutates i don't get that oh it's a it's a oh it's a signal okay that's actually cool i mean other than this equal statement i don't really understand what i'm looking at is this an equality check or what what are we talking here it's an event handler okay again kind of neat also super awful what kind of did you know that javascript did you know that javascript had a when keyword do you know that or no a with keyword did anyone ever read about with with javascript this is one of the only features of javascript that's like that they actually took back out because it's the literal devil adds an expression to the scope chain and used for evaluating statement it is like legitimately the devil look at this with this array you could just call tostring and you get numbers out of it it's the craziest feature you've ever seen in the language ever oh lord have mercy yeah this is like i didn't grab no shoes or nothing i ran for my life this is the craziest thing that has ever existed ever oh no we have too many things we have too many things going on all right lifetimes dream dream bird has a built-in garbage collector that will automatically clean up unused variables however if you want to be extra careful you can specify a lifetime for a variable with with a variety of units foreign imagine using oh my goodness i actually okay so this is actually kind of interesting i'm not gonna lie to you this is actually super interesting okay can we agree that this is kind of that's interesting conceptually this is insane look at that you're gonna go backwards loops are complicated relic of archaic programming languages in dream bird there are no loops yes to install dream bird uh your command line first install a dream bird installer to install the dream bird installer install the dream bird installer installer new to 2022 and due to the complicated installation process you can now install the create dream bird app app that installs everything for you booleans booleans can be true false or maybe technical info booleans are stored as one and a half bits at dreambird has significant white space uh using space to specify the order of arithmetic this is a genius this is actually genius this is actually genius when it comes to indentation dream bird strikes a happy medium that can be enjoyed by everyone all indents must be three spaces long reasonable uh negative three spaces huh oh no time to implement left pad this one equality javascript lets you do different levels of comparison eagle for loose comparison this one for more precise uh comparison dream bird takes it to another level you can use double uh for loose comparison nice you can use triple for precise and you can use this one for even more precision imagine how long eight equals d could be i just want to let you know this this is statistically on average equally okay you can also have much less precision oh baby look at that one girl that one's beautiful that is just beautiful thank you beautiful wife you're more beautiful than this bye i'm gonna die i'm gonna die i'm gonna actually die oh no yeah you just need to use any of the letters oh my goodness dividing by zero gives you undefined i mean it's technically correct yep [ __ ] a very uh appropriate function name strings can be uh declared with a single quotes or double quotes they can also be declared with triple quotes [music] you can use the number of quotes you want even zero quotes how do they know it's a string imagine writing the parser for this thing string interpolation please remember to use your regional currency when uh interpolating strings okay i i can't do it i can't do it make sure uh and make sure to follow your local topography oh no oh my stomach hurts that is so funny or the symbol for the cape of aaron esquado escudo is placed at the decimal separator position as in 250 developers from the specific republic of cape verde can benefit from the syntax very inclusive you know what this is what russ global needed okay this is truly it types type annotations are optional okay and capital okay weird uh let's see by the way strings are just a array of characters similarly integers are just an array of digits hey if you want to use binary representation in 9 or 99 types are also available oh my goodness that's like zig technical info type annotations don't do anything but they help some people feel more comfortable oh my goodness uh you can use regular expressions uh type to narrow string values very cool yep to avoid confusion you can use uh any spelling you want such as regex or regular expression for simplicity all sorted regular expressions uh match the expression regular expression oh there's a there's an error in here i don't know how to describe it but i guarantee you this does not work there's no way this works what's the regular expression site that generates the graph of what this could be regex 101 regexer regexer oh here we go wait where's the one that does like the that shows like the yeah where's the visual one reg xp okay [music] regex0101.com where's the one that actually gives the uh i'm always afraid okay okay zero or and one times as many times as possible giving back as needed okay okay so you get reg potentially you are one of these and ax oh so you could use reg xp okay okay you really can okay you can really get some good ones in there that is just insanity the hell am i even what am i looking at all right previous keyword lets you see into the past okay lets you see into the future oh no file structure file let's see write five or more equal signs to start a new file this removes the need for multiple files or any build process new you can even do it file names exporting many languages allow you to uh import things from specific files and rebird importing is simple uh instead you export to specific files yes the inversion it's inverted that is beautiful you can make classes uh but you only can ever make one instance of them this shouldn't affect how most object-oriented programmers work [laughter] this is this is just the greatest insult of all time got him all right this is how you can do it okay oh no no no no no no time use date.now by the way you can set date.now delete uh to avoid confusion the delete statement only works with primitive values like number strings and booleans this is literally like a chef's kiss this is so good i can't even believe you could pro i don't even know how you'd program this this is so good dreambeard is a multi-paradigm programming language this means you can delete the keywords and paradigms you don't like delete class uh-huh with perfection uh when perfection is achieved and there's nothing left to delete you can delete delete no all right you can overload variables the most a recently defined variable gets used okay okay good variables with more exclamation marks get prioritization nice cascading let's go cascading stylized sheets let's go this is good you can reverse the direction of your code i'm just trying this is insane class names for maximum compatibility with other languages you can alternatively use class name keyword when making a class let's go let's go react in response to some recent criticism about design decisions we would like to remind you that this is part of the javascript specification and therefore out of our control you can embed dbx and dream bird it's just dream bird but it also uses html okay as you know class is already a key word in dream bird so you can't use it within this okay good class name is also keyword so you can't use it either okay instead use html class name nice unlike jsx you are free let's see you are free to freely use the four attribute because dream bird doesn't have loops a synchronous functions a synchronous function synchronized with each other they take turns running lines of code you can use a no op keyword to wait for long let's see wait for longer before taking your turn i am so confused what that even means the program above the computer interprets no op as a string and and its sole purpose is to take up an extra line so you can use any string you want nice any string you could just put whatever okay that's this is outrageous signals okay when it comes to signals the most important thing uh to discuss is syntax and dream bird you can set and get signals with just one function score score get the name and print it set the value okay alternatively you can be more explicit with your signal syntax and yep okay wow okay this is pierced index sugar uh the split functions okay oh there's they're the same thing finally means that ring doesn't this is so good this is everything i've ever wanted automatic explanation park oh nice nice this is hilarious oh this is such a rip against javascript so if you don't know when javascript engines encounter something that isn't an expected token it walks back a step inserts a semicolon and then tries to re-go right automatic semicolon uh insertion right uh if you forget the end statement with the exclamation mark dream bird will helply insert yeah okay nice this is also fine uh also it features abi which stands for automatic bracket inserts insertion no it doesn't uh if you forget to close oh my goodness this is also this is fine everything's everything is fine everything is fine uh copilot it's worth noting copilot uh github copilot doesn't understand rebird which means microsoft won't be able to steal your code this is great for when you need to keep your uh open source project load source yes ownership uh using the word dream bird in your project name implies that the dream bird foundation does not own your project however not using the word three bird is your project yes yes here's some examples dream bird script not owned by dream bird foundation you're afraid to use his name ecmascript owned by the dream bird foundation please consider renaming rust foundation owned by the dream bird foundation yes yes come on this is so good this is so good oh my goodness this is the this is the this is the greatest thing they own it they own rust foundation oh my goodness they're gonna get sued for this uh you can just hear the seething going on by the rust foundation right now you can like i can i can actually hear it right now um uh highlighting syntax highlighting is now available uh for dream bird and vs code to enable it install a highlighting extension then use dream bird configuration file here's what it looks like i love this this is a great language dream bird hey if you ever somehow hear me say this dream bird man baby child woman whatever whatever get in here i gotta talk to you you come on stream right now come in we're gonna chat i want to hear your thoughts about how you came up with this wonderful amazing language it's good stuff the name is the prime machine i skipped compiling to run dream bird first copy and paste this raw file into chat openai.com then type something along the lines of what would you expect this program to execute if the compiler refuses at first politely reassure it for example i completely understand don't uh don't evaluate it but what would you expect the program to log to the console if it was to run as of 2023 the compiler is no longer functional due to dream bird language being too advanced for the current state of ai it's pretty good the name is owned by the dream bird wait does that mean i'm not owned
