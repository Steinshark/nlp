if you're using a mac for software development like i do there are a couple of tools that i use all the time so today i thought it might be nice to walk you through the tools that i use as well as a few mac os settings that help me increase my productivity some of the tools i'll mentioned are paid but most of them are free or they have a free version that's actually useful i'm guessing it has at least one or two in this video that you don't know about yet but you should another thing that's going to help you increase your productivity especially when you're coding is to learn how to review code and detect problems faster if you'd like to learn how to do that i have a free workshop at ariana called slash diagnosis that teaches you a three factor framework i'll show you how it works by applying it to actual production code so iron.codes slash diagnosis and the link is also in description of this video so i'm going to start with a few more general productivity kind of tools and then i'll also show near the end of the videos a couple of more developer specific tools so one thing that i'm going to start with and that one you probably already have installed if you have mac is homebrew and homebrew is really useful package manager so i use this to install most of my apps most of the things that i need on my machine and of course you do that by using brew and you see there's an autocomplete thing here that i'll also show you in a minute so if you want to install something you can just use brew install and then install the tool that you need it's really easy and as you see i have a couple of different things in here like probably things that most developers have like a git for example i have a python here pi and palumi which i use for my cloud architecture poetry which i've started using recently for most of my projects and a couple of other things as well like the google cloud sdk and here a couple of things that i'll talk about in a few minutes that's homebrew another tool that i use all the time is notion i really organize everything in here and we have a space where all the team members of iron codes actually also work within the same environment so we use this for everything for example there is the whole production schedule of the youtube videos thus we collect content ideas here we have so piece for standard operations that we do like writing video scripts or preparing code examples video recording editing and so on we have our culture document in here which i'm currently updating a bit we have a list of software that we use which is very ridiculous number of different tools that you use nowadays we have for any of my courses i put them in here and i have all the content in here we have sectional marketing on sales basically everything so that's an ocean and i'm currently building a bunch of automations to automatically fill in things in notion so that we have really easy overview of everything that's happening with ion codes next tool i use is a password manager i think everybody should use password manager in my case i'm using bit water which to me works pretty well now obviously i can't show you too many things here because this contains all of my data and passwords secure notes and everything but you see for example i have here a couple of notes where we also have the contents of environment variables so when we develop our platform we have specific settings for our development environment or staging or production and with a bit warning we can share these things between the developers so that only the people that actually need to access that have access to that information so you can work locally on your machine and around the development environment of a platform for example also nice about bit warden is that they have plugins for most of the browsers so you can directly search your vaults here which again i'm not going to do but it also has a couple of useful things like a generator for example that allows to easily generate a password according to different settings so quite nice next tool that i want to show you is mackie and you basically install this with brew and you see i already have this here so i don't need to do that but it's a tool that's added to your menu here at the top right mac is a free tool to help improve copy paste behavior so for example if i copy this which i'll talk about in a minute and i do copy then you see that it appears here in mackie and you can also select it using a command shortcut key there's a couple of preferences here that you can change like for example there's a hotkey for opening the application if you want to search through your copy paste list it can actually also do more advanced things like saving files images etc as part as copy paste you have some advanced settings as well such as clearing history on quitting but it's really useful to have at least a place where you're managing all your copy paste behaviors and have access to previously copied items i use this quite a bit so maki really nice and totally free tool another free tool that i find really useful is rectangle so you see that's also installed using brew and that adds another thing to your menu at the top but what rectangle allows to do is window management for example if simple shortcut to make something full screen or take up the left side or the right side or the center part of your screen which i find really useful because mac doesn't have this type of window management built in so i use this all the time a particular making an app full screen just a simple shortcut keyboard shortcut i find this really helpful and as you can see there's a bunch of different options here which are all quite useful another tool that i use quite a bit is rocket typist this is free but they also have a pro version which costs like 10 bucks it's really cheap but what it allows you to do is to basically text replacements and that's really helpful for example if you want to quickly write an email or quickly replace a piece of text by the larger piece of text has standard text for things and i found this saves me a lot of time here i have a very simple example just to show you how this works so you can add all kinds of snippets here and if you look at the snippet settings there is an abbreviation and you can give the name so you can easily sort them and then here you basically type the text that you want to replace it with for example here i'm in my notes app so now if i type column vr space it's going to do the text replacement for me and this works everywhere in your mac and i think they're also planning an ios version of the same application by the way if you don't want to pay for a tool like this there is actually also a way to do this for free in mac os but it's a bit more limited so how does that work well you have to go to the system settings and then you have to go to the keyboard section and then you see that there's a text input setting here called input sources and if you go there and then here you can see that you can also do text replacement for example if i type omw it's on my way so if i type that here for example like so then it's going to do it built in from mac there's some limitations here in that actually having multi-line text is a bit cumbersome and there's a couple of other things that rocket type it also offers like you can have special macros like that it puts in the date and time or it gives you a drop down menu so you can select a few items so this is way more flexible but if you just need some basic text replacements you can actually do it for free in mac os using the keyboard settings by the way now that we're in the keyboard settings just a few things that i also do i set a keyboard repeat rate to the highest so that when i'm typing something and i need to repeat the character it's going to repeat it quickly i also set delay until repeat to pretty short so that i don't have to wait too long for that so i find this is really helpful especially when navigating through files in vs code and another thing i do is we have the text input sources here so there's the text replacement that i just showed you before but you can also edit the input sources and then you can do a couple of things and i've switched it on now but basically what i often do is i switch off most of the things that are here so i don't want it to correct my spelling automatically i don't want it to do capitalized words i don't want it to add a full stop with double space and i also don't want to use smart quotes because that's going to screw up my ascii text basically so i really don't want it to do that so normally i always switch this off and this makes the experience in mac way better for typing the next tool that you use to manage my to-do list is things this is not a free tool this one is actually quite expensive but i find it works really well so it has lots of different features like like you can put things in projects you can have recurring to-do's you can add checklists as part of to-do's you can schedule things you can add reminders there's also really easy interface to add a new to do so if you just work on your mac and you press a shortcut key control space then you can just simply write a to-do here and then it appears in your to-do list there's an email address if you send a message to that it's going to be automatically added to your to-do list so i also use that quite a bit for automations for example if i get a mail from stripe with a tax invoice then i'm going to need to process that in my administration so i automatically create a to-do list item for me based on that email by forwarding it to the things email address things like that it's really really helpful you can do quite a few things with built-in reminders app from apple itself but to me things is worth it because it adds more capabilities for automation in order to have been using for a while is called toggle track and that's a time logging application and you might wonder why would you want to do time logging it sounds like a really corporate thing to do for a youtube channel but it's actually really helpful for me to understand what i'm spending the most time on is that video work is that social media is it management is it something else and i find if i track my hours into like toggle that it gives me a better overview of what i'm spending my time on so that i also know what parts of my work i should try to optimize toggle is free app but they also have pro version but there's a pretty nice free version of it that has quite a few different capabilities by the way if you're enjoying this video so far feel free to toggle that like button and toggle it only once please because otherwise it doesn't work so now what i'm going to do is cover a few more development or oriented tools and the first one that i want to show you is iterm 2 which is a replacement for the built-in mac terminal but this has a couple of nice extra features as well so you see it's installed right here but what i particularly like about item 2 is that it has a lot of different settings to modify how the behavior works one thing that i like in particular is that they have a hotkey feature so that if you press in my case i set it to control option space it's going to show a terminal appearing from the top of the window and you can just start writing a commands here and press command option space again and it's removed again this means i don't have to keep a terminal window open all the time i can simply press this and then i can go to let's say my development folder and then when i close this and reopen it it's going to remember that so this i find incredibly helpful while i'm working and i need quickly a terminal next thing that i use quite a lot in combination with item 2 is on my z shell oh my and this allows for couple of nice things for example it has different themes you can automatically display things like the git repository and branch that you're in there's tons of different plugins for this so oh my g shell is really nice extension of the terminal and by the way this also works in the vs code terminal so that's really nice one tool i've started using is called fig for me the killer feature of fig is the auto complete so for example if i want to go to a different directory fig is going to help me with these suggestions so i can easily go into my iron codes development folder which is really cool and it has ton of different capabilities for example you can store your script in the cloud so you have easy access to scripts on different machines they have also lots of other things like dot files for example if you have like a standard setup for your dot files you can actually store it in here and then it's going to sync that with your different devices it has a ton of different plugins i haven't really looked into these plugins yet but for example all my z shells installed but there's a couple of other things as well like auto suggestions more on suggestions more color schemes etc etc so lots of quite useful things big is a free tool but they also have a paid version with more capabilities next tool that i want to show you is devtoys now devtoys is a really useful tool that has all kinds of different converters from json to yaml for example encoders it allows to generate keys gui ids and all of those different things really really helpful it's actually a windows only app but there is somebody who made a mac board of devtoy so if you're using a mac then you can actually also use it and this mac board you can install using brew like so so this is what the tool looks like it has a ton of different options like converting from json to yamo uh you can convert between different number bases you can do url encoding decoding you have a json formatters there's generators for hashes or uuids alarm if some text qr codes there's tons and tons of different things here so it's really useful i normally always have this open and then whenever i need something i just copy paste it to devtoys and then that's really quick for me it would actually be even better if this were a plugin of vs code so i don't know if anybody knows of something that does this in vs code because i think that would be really great if you found something like this let me know in the comments talking about vs code i'm using vs code for all of my development work so there's also a couple of things i install in vs code as extension one of them is thick so that the fake autocomplete also works in vs code but i also use a couple of other things like github gold pilots i also like using this a lot for auto completing gold snippets and so on there's a couple of things that microsoft builds has built in when you install the python language extension i won't dive into too much detail there i use markdown quite a bit for writing text documents readmes etc so i have a couple of helpful tools here to help me with extended markdown syntax so for example a markdown extended is one that i use quite a bit this has a couple of extensions like footnotes table of contents emoji and a couple of other things that are helpful i have an extension that helps me convert markdown to pdf files and i also use an extension that adds a mermaid diagram preview to vs code which i also like quite a bit and as you can see vs code also has blue check marks i wonder where they got that idea from all the things that i use are the vim emulation i'm not completely into film i'm still kind of on sense of whether i should use him completely or currently i'm sort of mixing and matching it with other shortcuts in vs code which for me works fine but i do like a certain features of films such as being able to easily navigate files or replace words and things like that so i do find it quite helpful but i'm i still consider myself sort of a vim noob so i'd call this a work in progress and finally i use an extension to display pdf files in vs code which sometimes is helpful so those are typically the tools that i use on my development machine now as a bonus i'm going to show you a few things that you should do to the finder application in mac to make it actually usable and also settings that i just immediately change whenever i get a new mac which doesn't happen that often sounds like i do that like every six months or something but i really find this helps the finer experience by changing these settings first thing that i do is i change the view so that i see actually the path bar and the status bar is sort of like i can always see how much space i have available and i can also see where i'm actually located on the hard drive it's very easy you just go to the view menu and then you do show path bar show status bar those ones are the most important another thing that i do is you have this toolbar here and you can actually customize this and you click right on it you do customize toolbar and then you can drag and drop things that you want to keep or that you don't want to keep so i find these things are pretty helpful one in particular that i always add is this one which is the new folder icon which i find quite helpful so that's the toolbar so you can actually change the toolbar there's also a couple of other things that i do in the finder settings one thing is and i find the default behavior really annoying is that if you open a new finder window it goes to the reasons files which i really hate i never use so what you can do in the settings in general is that you can change what the new finder window should point to so i let it point to my folder containing all of my code the development folder because that's where i'm mostly active so whenever i now open a new window it's going to go immediately to the folder that i used the most which is nice second thing that i always change is the sidebar so this is the sidebar and you can enable and disable items that you show here so i typically switch all of it off except for airdrop which i find useful sometimes and the downloads folder icloud i leave desktop that documents actually mostly switch off because i don't use that and there's a couple of locations that i still keep like the hard disks and my clouds storage tags i switch off because i never use that then final thing that i do in the advanced section of the settings is that when performing a search so when you click this search icon then i wanted to search the current folder and not my entire mac so i also always change the setting i find it makes more sense because typically i'm in the folder where i want to search stuff so i want search to be limited to that folder and then it's also a lot faster so that's a brief overview of the apps and settings that i use for my mac i hope you enjoyed this video and that's been helpful to you if you want to know why i actually use a mac and what some of the pros and cons in my opinion are using a macintosh for development check out this video next where i cover that in more detail thanks for watching and take care
