ladies and gentlemen the grandmaster title in chess is the most coveted achievement in the game maybe a close second and third place is getting to quadruple digits meaning a thousand or becoming world champion which nowadays doesn't mean much cuz the best player in the game is not even trying to be the world champion now in this video i i'm going to be sharing with you a world record that was broken yesterday here in early 2024 and it involves the grandmaster title a young man at the age of 8 years old 6 months and 11 days from singapore by the name of ashwat kaik defeated a chess grandmaster in a tournament and this is is nothing short of spectacular his opponent 37-year-old yasik stopa has been a grandmaster longer than this child has been alive this is sensational there have been instances of 9-year-olds and 10year olds beating grand masters because those nine and 10 year olds end up becoming grand masters in their early teenage years but 8 and a2 dude at 8 and a2 i was eating chest pie i was like 1,400 my first grandmaster win was at the age of 20 this is scary now my voice might also be scary uh i did not smoke a pack of cigarettes before recording this video i was just in charlotte north carolina for 5 days and uh the charlotte heir did this to me now i was at a kids event and i seem to have lost my voice uh hopefully it's back tomorrow so today you're going to get this guy i don't know who this guy is but i kind of find it funny that i sound like this but uh i've been trying everything but i'm going to drink hot tea i'm going to have cough drops my voice will be back tomorrow let's celebrate this ridiculous achievement this was in a tournament in uh switzerland and ashwat started the game with the move e4 ashwat is outr by 400 points by more than 400 points but his strength is clearly underrated like likely he's more like a 22 2300 now yasik you might look at him and go why is he 2350 he became a grandmas 10 years ago and then i think he doesn't really pursue chess professionally as much so i think after he got the grandm title he just sort of does whatever he plays in random tournaments he doesn't care about the game as much so he probably stopped training as much probably gets invited to tournaments gets like free conditions hotel and just plays for fun of the game now you see principal chest to start out we have a uh filor defense is what this is called black plays solidly e5 d6 this knight blocks the bishop going to d7 and frequently the way black plays is pawn c6 threatening an expansion on the queen side bishop sort of sleeps this bishop comes here black castles and then decides what to do next god this i hate sounding like this white develops black develops both sides castle nothing new or extraordinary and now white plays h3 there's a lot of moves here white could play h3 a4 rook e one a lot of interchangeable transpositions that could occur uh black plays c6 which is a common idea and now white still plays the move a4 a move they could have played last move but very simply just trying to prevent black from playing b5 now like i said black has multiple ways to set up but yasik chooses a5 a5 is uh known actually as a little bit more confrontational so on the one hand you know the move stops and secures queenside space however you're going to weaken your own position okay and also you can't really prepare b6 a6 b5 so you don't really get your key idea so it you know it's got pluses it's got minuses you're probably never playing b5 which is a common idea in this opening but all right he plays uh plays a5 now white plays rook e one the good thing is for white these three moves are sort of interchangeable like i said you could sort of play them in any order now black plays h6 another common move stopping white from ever going to g5 also preparing g5 in the future also knight h7 knight g5 these types of ideas and now white plays this move bishop a2 all right bishop a2 gets out of the way of any stuff so you you put your bishop on the same diagonal but you no longer will get hit by any of the black moves black plays rook e 8 slightly destabilizing that pawn however the previous move h6 prevents knight g5 so black is following the plan white plays bishop e3 has optimal development and now black makes a slight inaccuracy by playing this move bishop f8 now it's given a question mark by game review but the point is that black wants to activate the rook however it would have been slightly more accurate probably to take on d4 right now uh and the idea is quite simply that now you don't even have to move bishop f8 you actually can move the knight to c5 or move the knight to f8 with the idea of putting something on the e6 square it's common idea here knight f8 followed by bishop e6 trying to trade activate the knight like this knight e6 as well so but black plays here the young man plays queen d2 the young man 8 years old plays queen d d2 black plays queen c7 keeping many pieces on the board and now rather than sort of lazily just bringing the rook to the center cuz white has sort of followed the golden moves if any of you are beginners this is what you're taught in chess you're taught pawn pawn night night bishop bishop castle connect your rooks the young man senses that the queen has left this diagonal and therefore the knight can go to h4 see a move ago if he went for that that wouldn't have worked cuz the knight would have been loose there would have been immediate strike in the center or knight here and then the queen would have taken but the second that the grandmaster makes a move off the diagonal this kid pounces 8 years old other dude has been alive 30 years more than this young man knight h4 the idea is to exploit the light squares in conjunction with the powerful bishop from the corner of the board black plays knight h7 i told you about that move a moment ago it's one of the ideas of playing h6 you're you are now ready to meet this knight and now white decides is he going to play knight f5 or what is he going to do if you play knight f5 now it's a nice looking move but black can very quickly try to trade the knight with that bishop that hasn't moved yet also d5 blocking the center destabilizing the center as well so instead of that the young man puts his knight right here can't be taken and the pin and the idea is that in the future he's just going to take the bishop which is going to leave the dark squares of the black position unstable it's actually really difficult to even get rid of the knight so he doesn't have to take right away yasik here decides all right i'm going to chop the center this kid is disrespecting me and here ashwat can go here and have a dominant position already totally better very weak pawn rook d1 knight f8 an idea very curious what yosik's plan was here because black's position just looks very precarious but the young man played bishop takes now he's got pieces pointed this way but black's position still very resilient and now knight c5 now there are multiple ideas here you can take the bishop you can play queen here you can start an attack with your f pawn you could just bring your rook all those things look good okay however however ashwat plays here f4 that move makes a lot of sense and i did just say it's an idea slightly inaccurate but it's still a good move the best move is this and the point is your next move is taking the bishop and transferring the queen to start an attack for example b6 queen g3 if bishop b7 you just win so black has to be a bit more careful but instead of that ashwat says hey let me just bring another pawn into this attack and win some central space and i've got many pieces pointed at my opponent's king and f4 however allows this and now black is back in business by removing this bishop from the pressure black is no longer going to be under such a powerful attack and the point is that if queen e3 was played bishop e6 is not possible because of this with the intention of playing queen g3 dink d dink but f4 allows bishop e6 and now ashwat has extinguished a little bit of his own advantage he still takes the bishop takes and now he plays f5 sacrificing positional ideas over here for an attack i mean you just played f4 obviously you have to play f5 but it's inaccurate the idea f4 f5 instead of that should have transfer the queen the most powerful attacking piece into the attack he utilizes the pawn giving up a little bit of positional chances and the point is that now his dark squares are weak so he's playing f5 he's getting a pawn closer to his opponent's king but after it takes takes black is uh already doing quite okay with a move like f6 or with a move like knight fd7 at which point the dark sores are just under you know under siege and this is exactly what black wants and now black is fine and that's the problem so instead of that he should have kept his pawn back f four at least but he's eight all right he's eight so he's got plenty of time to learn anytime you move a pawn in chess something gets stronger something gets better but something gets worse and something gets weaker as well like my vocal cords queen f4 natural move we're going to have to get this rook back into the game at some point by the way and white doesn't really have that bite to the position but he creates a threat all right knight fd7 knight d1 interesting knight d1 is a deep idea how do you activate two pieces at the same time a better question is how do you activate this rook without moving it knight d1 the idea of knight d1 is to bring this knight over here or over here or over there to trade and it's also to bring the rook up and over where it really likes life it's got a really great life on g3 it's also got a great life behind the pawns you know get a a rook on g3 and start this powerful pawn attack and you're like black's defenses are an illusion knight d1 is a deep idea now yasek finishes the plan however he should have respected this and this and he should have played b5 he should have made his opponent think about black's plan the idea being take take and continuing pressure it's tough to play that cuz knight c3 knight d5 looks really good but as it turns out there's nothing there and this pawn holding together the white position would fall so yashik should have played b5 a little bit sooner he plays knight e5 like i said it's sort of just fulfilling the des destiny but now rook a3 and now the young man's rook doesn't have to go via the first rank it goes via the third and black senses the attack so he plays king h7 the king is not going to play defense the king is just getting off the g file cu otherwise the rook would have arrived and the pawns look to defend each other but they don't because of the pin absolute pin so white would threaten this but now black is rock solid how are you going to break through this position well knight f2 the knight is on the way it's either on the way here or here maybe you're looking for a sacrifice see ashwat is is eight so he he likes to sacrifice pieces queen f7 now ashw gets a little bit aggressive again i've talked about rook g3 the computer for for white already wants to stop any access to c4 he wants to play the really sad move b3 but like no human can play that cuz you just put the rook on a3 you just you bought a house and now you're planting a tree in front of your windows that doesn't make a whole lot of sense right okay well ashwath plays g4 it's what i love children and i'm not trying to like infantilize this kid but he's eight all right the youngest player to ever be the grand master when you're young you don't have anxiet xy knock on wood some kids have anxiety depends on how they grow up but when you're young you're fearless you trust yourself g4 like an adult might against the grandmaster might go ah that's a little bit loose you know but when you have the fighting spirit when you have the confidence g4 is wonderful because the point is we're just going for it and people don't like to be attacked i don't care if they're 37 i don't care who they are but yasek plays the best move move that was the best move it was to target the bishop so now what well queen d2 queen d2 now we defend everything and it's a tough spot for white the best move here for black is to play queen b4 threatening a queen trade black trades the queens white never wins it's just not possible however if white doesn't trade the queens black has a really nice move knight d3 cutting the circulation of the white position hitting the bishop and white's in trouble the best line here for white is to take and allow this rook can't get into the game black is dominating the dark squares white has a long defensive task ahead instead of that yasik plays b6 very solid but it suddenly allows white right back into the game he wanted to defend everything he probably wanted to play rook d8 but it's too slow it doesn't demand the position demanded something a lot faster and that move does not meet the demands of the position now ashwat in this position plays king up i guess he was trying to prevent knight f3 but that's also not the right move he should go rook g3 chuck the pawn chuck the pawn justify your attack but that's probably going to happen on the next move king g2 now rook a7 okay that's interesting why rook a7 and not rook d8 i guess yasik is like well i'm going to protect my seventh rank and i'm going to put my rook right here and i'm going to pressure this pawn i don't know i haven't spoken to yashik but he plays rook to a7 now also instead of rook a7 you can play d5 like you see your opponent is trying to attack you strike back in the center very principal chess opponent attacks you on a side of the board you strike back in the middle rook a7 h4 still ashwat not playing rook g3 i really hope he does at some point and now d5 very tense moment the position is about to explode you attack me on the side of the board i'm going to open up the center d5 now we have b3 attacking the queen i think this was always a concern for yashik he didn't want his queen to go out to a6 right and now queen b4 doesn't work because now my rook comes back and i'm solid everything is defended it's different than it was a move ago so in this position b3 black has an option to play here or queen b4 like i just said queen a6 is right but it looks so wrong looks so wrong to get attacked but the point is the queen can actually dart back into the game very quickly and immediately start pressuring white but instead of that yashik decides well with no queens on this kid's not beating me because he's not going to be able to attack me he's right the kid is not going to be able to attack him with no queens however when he played d5 he set the position on fire the position is now now guaranteed to open and you need to be sure that the queenless game is okay for you after queen b4 take take and undevelopment these pawns look a little soft they're very close right the rook is going to come in maybe i don't even have to play g5 anymore and now yashik plays d takes e4 and suddenly the position begins opening up bishop takes knight and when this happens the position just transformed from a b c to nothing on a b cc like in an email now white has an outside protected pass pawn this pawn is a menace in every end game it's a worst menace in a king and pawn end game it's a ren this menace in a night end game in a rook end game it's just as bad so yashik is in serious trouble knight takes e4 he has to deal with the queen side he has to deal with this pawn and i don't mean rook a5 this is putting the rook in jail then white continues the attack this rook is never getting out of jail but that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about c4 active counterplay because if white just defends after take take there's a future in which you trade the pawns and the defile comes alive but instead of that yasik says well you know what i'm going to lose a pawn on c5 but i'm going to take this because then we're going to get into an end game right and all and and we're going to get into an end game he's not going to be able to attack me but he blunders must have been low time not exactly sure but he blunders knight g5 check and the idea was never to take the pawn the idea was a discovered attack and he picks up the rook this kid's eight he's going to find these tactics it's a little bit deflating that after such a tense position and opening up the game that here yashik plays this move thinking that we're headed here but he forgets that i guess he forgot that a couple of moves ago he got his rook off the back rank to double it and then he blundered and then he blunders knight g5 check happens to the best of us and in this end game white just begins picking up the pawns rook d7 a5 the pawn just goes you can give me check you can get him with my knight and the rook look at that that is so clinical from the young man a6 a7 i told you outside connected uh protected pass pawn is a problem he just gets rid of the knight rook for knight sacrifice this is called simplification and the idea is to push the rook back to the corner and this is domination now the king will just go across takes king f4 and in this position actually yashik stopa resigned to ashw kik the point is that the king will take all the pawns or king will just run right there a tense game a game where the young man went on a big attack brought all his pieces forward against the grandm and in what i would imagine would have been a low time situation yashik blundered cuz otherwise this is sort of you know knight g5 check is sort of straightforward i would hope he didn't have a lot of time on the clock but that happens and a great game nonetheless a lot of pressure applied at the age of eight and he wins and he sets the record for the youngest person to ever beat a grand master in any type of competitive game specifically classical but i'm talking blitz i'm talking rapid anything crazy and i look forward to this record being broken again he is the second or third highest rated player at his age b shivanan is there as well from england uh as well as um this kid from i think serbia or slovenia who last month defeated some grandmas uh as well i will keep relaying all of the updates to you about these prodigies and until then i will go rest my voice now get out of here
