what is up guys welcome back to tech intern so today we're going to be talking about computer science at waterloo we're going to talk about is it worth it we're going to go through all the factors warts and all it's not all fantastic and we're going to discuss everything so just a list of a few things we're going to go through we're going to talk about co-op versus non-co-op we're going to talk a lot about the disadvantages of waterloo and computer science we're going to talk about my journey having been a computer science major at waterloo that eventually led me to my job at microsoft or i'm a software engineer you can see in the background is the space needle and the seattle skyline which there's not much of a skyline but we're going to talk a little bit about cs versus engineering what my perception of that was and then finally we're going to talk about since it's kind of in season right now we'll talk about is it worth it to do it during covid let's just dive right in and first i want to get it out of the way let's just talk about the disadvantages put them all out there on the table and then we can get on to the advantages so the first disadvantage of waterloo the one that hit me the hardest the fastest it's a little more difficult to meet people to meet friends so all of my friends that went to different universities western and toronto uh they were all posting stories online and posting pictures about how they were having so much fun at orientation week and they were meeting such cool people and let me tell you that is not what waterloo is like at all let me just rip that band-aid off i remember orientation week i was really excited about events and i started going to the events and we were playing children's games like red rover i am not even kidding and then they made us do like this weird math dance and i hope nobody has any videos of me doing that i used to keep my dorm room door open but you know people just wouldn't come say hi they would all keep their doors closed but over time we met people and eventually my neighbors started keeping their door open and then we would talk and we would hang out they ended up becoming fantastic friends of mine we still talk to this day so although it is difficult to make friends at the beginning although it isn't fun and it's not a party school or anything like that uh you're still gonna make friends and it's still gonna be a good time so uh it's just not going to come in the beginning and you're going to feel a little bit jealous of your friends at the beginning but honestly honestly it's worth it so let's we're going to get to that last but not least is it's just really really difficult i i used to be top of my class and i went to waterloo and i started scraping high 60s low 70s and it was a struggle but over time things get easier you get adjusted you learn how to study and i ended up bringing that average over an 80 but it took four or five years of studying so it is difficult you can always take four courses at a time if it's a little bit much for you it is very difficult but you'll get through it of course if you're getting value out of this video right now please subscribe this channel is completely dedicated to helping you get your next internship so if you're going to waterloo you'll want to be subscribed now that we've got all the disadvantages out of the way let's get to the good stuff the reasons that you want to go to waterloo and honestly i would just say right off the bat these reasons eclipse all of the disadvantages uh there's so many more advantages to waterloo than disadvantages and especially for computer science so first things first let's say you decided you want to go to waterloo why do you want to go into computer science should i go into an engineering so when i went to the waterloo open house there was a whole talk about why you want to pick computer science over software engineering and essentially it boils down to it's more flexible and honestly just a little secret you're gonna get the same jobs everybody's gonna get the same jobs like i work with people at microsoft that were in engineering at waterloo one advantage of engineering at waterloo the one that i would say is the biggest is the fact that you have the same classes uh you have the same people in every class so you get really close to that class cs is a little bit different you get to choose your own classes which has its advantage you get to kind of pick what you want to study which is was really interesting i got to learn a lot of technologies i don't think i would have otherwise so it can be looked at a disadvantage or an advantage now at waterloo i i did six internships and i got to do that across three countries i worked in canada i worked in america and i worked in ireland i worked across a plethora of different technologies worked on bluetooth front end full stack back end i i just worked across the board in everything i wanted to try because that internship that co-op experience is just so good so that kind of leads into the next point waterloo co-op versus non-co-op and honestly there's no competition here if you can do the co-op option do the co-op option you get access to thousands of job postings it's really going to help nurture you there's a whole building on campus dedicated to actually doing interviews um and you just can't go wrong honestly it gave me the experience to go to three countries uh and six different internships in six different cities it was honestly just fantastic i'm going to talk more about my journey in my channel the last major advantage of waterloo co-op is that you can honestly pay off your degree while you're doing your degree so it's not a four-year degree it's a five-year degree it's a four-year degree and two years of work experience crammed into five years so it's practically six years and five you're gonna be way ahead of the curve and you're gonna make so much money during those internships that you'll start to pay for a lot probably not all but probably a lot of your degree as you go i know that was a big deal for me maybe it's not a big deal for you but i think it's so fantastic to have the opportunity to come out of school debt-free and i didn't come out of school exactly debt-free but when i started my next job it really did not take me a long time to pay off my debt so it's a really big deal and i know it means a lot to certain people such as myself you might say can it really help me pay off my degree well in the beginning you might be making something like' an hour by the end if you're working in the states you could be making 43 dollars an hour in the states and not even paying for your housing you'll get a stipend that 43 dollars an hour american will go straight into your pocket is waterloo worth it during covid well if i had to guess i would say yes if you have the opportunity to still go i would take it if you can defer a year i i think i would probably do that but if you just want to go and get it over with it's going to be more difficult to meet people i already told you it's hard when you're there anyway but that additional step of having a really difficult first year and not having great access to resources and to friends to help get through it is actually going gonna make it a little bit more difficult so i think if you can defer for a year if you've got something else to work on you've got something else to do i personally would probably take that deferred here but having said that i think it's a fantastic option to just go ahead and do the degree online in the beginning but make sure that you're reaching out to people you're trying to make friends and that you're getting help on assignments all right so that brings us to the end i've talked about all the advantages all the disadvantages of waterloo would should you go to waterloo computer science specifically yes i think you honestly should you should it's a major contender even against any engineering including software engineering thanks so much for joining us today guys remember subscribe if you're going to waterloo especially for co-op this whole channel is dedicated to helping you get your next tech internship so thank you guys so much i'll see you in the next episode
