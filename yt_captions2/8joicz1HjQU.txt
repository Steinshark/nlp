so you want to break into tech but maybe you don't know where to start you don't have any formal experience and you're new to the industry as someone who has been there i'm going to walk you through today just how i broke into tech from fashion and modeling to the complete'0 and have been in the industry now for well over five years as a software developer and i've done one of these videos before in the past where i talk about how i broke into tech with no experience and how you can too but i really wanted to do an updated version of this because i feel like i've been getting asked so many times this question and it's still such a relevant topic and it's not going anywhere and wanted to cover it with you today from my point of view especially in the past year i think i've really grown and a lot of things have changed and to share it with you kind of give you an updated and updated version and we're also going to go get i'm sure you can fill it in what we are getting because it's uh what i am constantly doing when i'm on the road which is coffee okay we got the nitro cold brew i've been obsessed with nitro cold brew recently it's so good and it's really quick i don't know why i know this is like the millennial or whatever in me but i hate waiting for things whether it be coffee or anything and nitro comes like right away which is cute for me i would say one of the hardest things when breaking into the industry was that i was coming in with no experience which really meant no contacts and leaving an industry where i had so many connections i felt like i knew so many people is just seamless to get a job at that point to an industry where i had no network it was terrifying and i think one of the best things looking back that i really did was immerse myself in communities whether it be online or in person and as an introvert that is definitely the hardest thing i did because i'd rather i'd rather hide behind the code than go meet people and be interacting with strangers but honestly it is the best thing i did because when you put yourself out there you get into communities get into different groups whether once again online or in person it really you'll start developing these relationships with these people and i think at the end of the day the key to landing your first job in tech or really any job obviously you don't have your you know your years and years of experience to back you up so it's who you are as a person showing people that hey this is me i have so much to bring to the table i might be new in this industry but i'm willing to learn i want to grow and the only way you can do that is to really show up and go to these events so for me for events i i live in toronto so everywhere is different but what i did was i used meetup.com i'm not sure if it's still active but essentially what it is is meetup.com you can go there and see different meetups happening in your city and i'm sure if there's not meetup.com there are similar ones now and it's a great way to get involved and a lot of times honestly like i said i didn't have any friends or connections in this industry so i'd go to the events by myself but one thing that really helped with that is when you're going going to a networking event everyone else is there to meet people into network as well so you're not going to event alone and i can have to stand in a corner no everyone is there for the same reason to meet other people so that really helped alleviate some of the from the pressure [music] okay so now that we've spoken about networking and the importance of putting yourself out there and interacting with the community what do you do next well one thing i get asked all the time or rather not asked but told is well tiff i don't have any relevant experience how am i going to stand out i have experience in a different industry or i have experience from internships but i don't have any relevant experience in the tech industry and as someone who's been there coming from fashion into tech i can tell you you do have experience it might not be completely straightforward that you can transfer it over but you have experience in other areas for example if you are in say you have a marketing background well you have probably experience with communication dealing in teams problem solving you know your marketing oftentimes you are looking towards uh targeting this specific demographic you are solving a problem a lot of that can apply over into tech as well and although it doesn't directly apply you can show examples of how you've done this in your past industry and how you can apply it into tech this shows two things which i think is really interesting and as i mentioned a lot of people kind of write it off and don't even practice this but if you do this if you show your previous experience in other industries what it does is of course the obvious which shows that hey you are capable you are competent you can do your job you did it very well in this industry but the other thing it does which isn't so obvious but it really gets recruiters and people who are hiring their minds going is it shows that you are taking initiative it shows that you are bringing examples to the table from what you did in other industries and how you can apply them into tech it really brings a sense of leadership to the table that you want to learn that you want to grow here are some examples of you doing that and i think it's a really great way to stand up because too many people just write off experience if they have none no direct experience as no experience at all which in reality is not the case okay for our next one i have our trusty whiteboard here because what good is a video if you don't have a whiteboard in it well most mine don't have whiteboards but it's really fun and it makes you feel like professional anyways let's okay let's recap of what we have spoken about so far so the first one we spoke about was networking and building that community the second one we spoke about oh this is gonna be backwards for you isn't it okay i'm gonna tell my editor right now can we flip the flip it around so it's proper for you i hope we can if not we'll put it up on screen second one we spoke about was first networking second is you do have experience okay so networking experience well what comes next well the third thing that i did and once again i think will really help you stand out from a crowd is to take action take initiative and no i'm not speaking about working for free or putting in all these hours for free but sometimes you really need to put yourself out there in the community and uh take on an internship take on a position that maybe you feel you know is it your dream position but oftentimes i've told this story so many times because really because it's so relevant into the tech industry and i think a lot of people have their expectations not aligned with their reality and when i was in a boot camp when i was in a coding bootcamp and it was my last last project i was starting to job hunt i remember there were some people who were like well i'm either working at a fan company or i'm going to reject all offers and i was like what what do you mean like this is your first job in tech you like that's maybe it is possible but like you're coming with no experience you know let's be realistic here so i'm not saying that that isn't a possible a possibility for you or you shouldn't strive towards that if it's something that you want to strive towards but what i am saying is make sure your expectations are aligned with reality so for me my first job actually after my bootcamp wasn't as a software developer it was a qa and qa is a great position i need to grow a career in as well but i knew i wanted to become go the developer route so i started as qa because i saw an opportunity there i saw that if i start out in this position it's a smaller tech company i can grow into a software developer role i can kind of start playing around with the code more and getting more familiar with it and push into that direction so i think at the end of the day let's call this one ego because it's really about letting go [music] because no ego you know what before we talk about the fourth one i need coffee give me a second here [music] okay i'm someone who if i have coffee later in the day i'm not going to be functioning i cannot sleep so but it's still early so we're good we're good okay back on track tiffany the fourth one what is the fourth one the fourth one i want to talk about today what is it once i can cut this out what can support what i'm playing what is the first one okay i had a moment there i forgot what the fourth one was this is why i need more coffee the fourth one is accepting failure accepting rejection i get asked all the time when is the perfect time to start job hunting when do i know i'm running while there is no perfect answer you're never going to know when you're ready and i'll tell you a little tip here if you are applying for jobs especially your first job in the tech industry and you feel ready it means you waited too long to apply for those jobs i want you to feel a little bit nervous a little bit scared when you start applying for jobs because you're on that cusp you're on that brink of greatness where it's you know you know what you're doing but you still know you have a long way to go that's where you should be when you are applying for jobs don't feel 100 wait till you feel 100 confident because a you probably never will and if you do feel 100 confident you should have applied a long time ago but i want to also take in in line with that that when you are applying for jobs you're going to hear no you're going to hear no a lot and it doesn't mean that you are a bad candidate or there's something wrong with you or your resume it literally means you're competing against thousands and upon thousands upon thousands of people often for one role and this might be they happen to know someone in the company or they have a friend who works there you don't know what's going on behind the scenes so if you get rejected or told no don't automatically go to well it's because i suck no there's a lot more to it there's a lot more politics going on behind the scenes often okay friends those are some of my top tips when applying and breaking into the tech industry the key to anything though is just persevere keep on persisting get excited when you get told no because it means you're one step closer truly i know it sounds cheesy but you're one step closer to a yes so really focus on that and you got this if this isn't your first tech role maybe you're just applying for a different position all of these
