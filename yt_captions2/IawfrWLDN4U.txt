when i was a kid this is all it took to cool a computer then came this this and finally oh my goodness intel succumbed to madness and gave us the 13900 k a cpu that cannot be tamed by any cooler challenge accepted while most people would think it's pretty stupid to spend more on your cooling system than you did on your computer most people are not these guys between the two of us we've built not one not two but four separate water chillers and this one is bigger than all of them combined meet the chill apocalypse a 5,000 watt beast that was designed to cool industrial lasers this is one of our rare opportunities to use purpose-built equipment instead of just janking it with stuff that we get from princess auto so we are going to be getting into the meat of how this thing works and of course we'll be hooking it up to intel's latest compact furnace unit to see if even this is enough we'll laugh we'll cry we might even uh leak some coolant on the floor if you know what i mean and we'll also tell you about our sponsor build redux looking to level up your gaming experience build redux is here to help they'll create a custom gaming pc that is tailored to the specs you set out while offering competitive pricing compared to building your own follow the link below and start building your dream gaming rig today while i could have paid $15,000 to an industrial equipment supplier for this thermoflex 5000 the story of how we got our hands on this chiller is actually a lot more interesting than that it comes from john an integration engineer and absolute legend who works in a large industrial plant this chiller actually spent several years cooling a 5,000 wt fiber laser until recently it started throwing up errors except that after they replaced it with a new one a kink was found in the hose meaning this one was actually totally fine the whole time but it was cheaper to just leave the new one in service and scrap this boy so our hero john took it home to use on a cnc machine except the plan didn't work out so he gave it to us so we could torture some computers huge thanks john because there's absolutely no way we would have bought one of these things new let's take a closer look at this baby and talk about some speeds and feeds shall we w look at that that's fun first up it runs on 208 volt power so we need alex's sketchy cord no not the sketchy cord fine bring the sketchy cord and while there are multiple ways to chill water below ambient temperature we've used evaporative cooling pelta cooling in the past the most efficient is of course phase change so down here we find a large compressor as well as a condenser unit with a fan on it yeah i know right look at the size of this condenser um and then for the cold side i guess the evaporator is over here embedded in the water tank that is a smaller water tank than i expected yeah there's a lot of not much in here yeah i sort of thought like they boast temperature control of just .1 de celsius which is super important for lasers where a two degree difference can cause visible banding during an etch but in order to achieve that i kind of thought that they would have a very large reservoir so that they wouldn't have to cycle the compressor all that often but if this had a 5,000 watt load in it with just that much water i kind of feel like it would be oh you know what i bet it's one of those more efficient variable compressors like you find on modern ac units at the cost of course that would make sense this is not okay i can't believe you still have this he just made a completely non-regulation cord that goes from this to this and just has this tape on it and then we're just using a standard pc power short i hate everything about this however they do it it seems to be taken care of by the controller hardware in here where we also find power distribution everything we've seen so far is pretty similar to other chillers we've set up in the past what isn't is the pump now most pumps that you encounter in everyday life are centrifugal pumps meaning that the water gets sucked into the middle and then an impeller accelerates the fluid toward the outside where it is kind of collected and channeled into an outlet and it works great in most situations the problem is that as either the pressure of the system or the viscosity of the fluid increases the flow rate of a centrifugal pump decreases while a normal d5 computer pump can push about 1,500 l of water in hour once you get up to about 5 psi nothing is happening the positive displacement turbine pump we have in here though looks a bit more like this no matter what you do it's going to give you 1,080 l per hour are you serious okay no but how does it how does it wake it looks like a centrifugal pump oh so it just goes at a fixed speed so if this motor is not completely overwhelmed by whatever it's pumping it just goes yeah period these are considered fixed flow rate pumps for the most part until you hit like you know horsepower and break it or half horsepower wow what's one of these boys worth 700 $69 i can see why companies who make equipment like this are so protective of their trade secrets because it's a simple as opening one up and you're like yeah with some sheet metal fabrication and a trip to home depot i could pretty much put this together yeah this came with an anti-corrosive thing in it it's mostly been drained out but there might still be some and i looked it up and it will absolutely destroy water blocks okay yeah we just flush it out we should be good do not operate chiller unless fluid diffuser is installed it's in there what the devil's a fluid diffuser uh you know like the little sponge that you put in ek pump yeah it's basically that so it's just to keep air bubbles from getting drawn back into the pump well and more so for just like vortexes and ah do oh ew that stinks is that the nalcool why are you doing that you're not even wafting i wanted to see how it smelled oh do you smell this h this right here smells pretty bad it's like ooh oh oh i'm going to go clean this off camera alex described the smell as spoiled vaseline yeah is this uh paint brush in here for like scrubbing things or what now it is what are you working on um i took a little trip to the plumbing supply store to adapt this which came on it with this down to like some computer tubing but these look like gas fittings and in fact they're colorcoded for gas i don't know that's what was on there if it can hold gas it can hold liquid right pretty much um you put a lot of teflon tape on here alex and i don't know if you wrapped it the right way yeah that one's the wrong way this one's the right way though okay well what what are you doing right now well it's just not working cuz i'm on camera and doing things on cameras hard is this correct no righty tiy oh yeah it isn't damn it here's my thought tube into distilled water wait you haven't checked the manual like you have no idea how to do this do you even know how to prime the pump we could definitely look at the manual n n well it holds more water than i thought alex based on the size of that reservoir there goes a gallon oh oh no it's not level the bubbles on the one side we got to tip her no i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding you can't do that cuz there's compressor do you know what's fantastic lin is we cannot kill ourselves with this oh that's mostly which way do these twist clockwise counterclockwise hold on give me a sec oh no it just doesn't twist that much okay fine hello 16.9 de c nice uh what is happening whatever it is seems really bad yeah that seemed really bad whoa she's going all right kill it oh i can't you have it yeah all right it works works great oh my alex what you know that momentum of water will cause that to like go erect right yes clearly you hav it peed and let it get away from you all right okay all right all right get it so what's your plan once you squeegee it i was going to squeegee it out the door but um okay i'm just going to spread it out yeah i mean that's basically what mopping does anyway now instead of having a small very slippery spot we have a large somewhat slippery spot i understand how the reservoir figured into all this but what i don't understand is why it didn't oh wait no i do understand that it did suck a bit and then it went back in what do we do now what even is this video we have two options depending on what we want to do i kind of want to see what happens if we just attach it to like a block like this but also like we just saw what happens when the pump gets run when the things are closed it's only half horsepower it's not as much as i thought oh okay the original plan was for us to kink one of these tubes and like blow up the block with the pressure or something like that we don't really think that's going to happen but we're going to do this anyway because it gives an opportunity to make sure the system works as we expect and maybe filter out some additional gunk before we hook it up to the corsair loop over there not that that's a particularly smart way to do that alex it's more fun though wow holy crap she rips dog yeah and immediately everything is purged of all possible air bubbles because she rips did i mention she rips i feel like this is going to work yeah i think it's going to work really well yeah is there a minimum specified load on this thing like air conditioner units for example are expected to have a certain duty cycle they're expected to turn on once in a while or like a car that sits in storage for 10 years for example just cuz it has zero miles on it that's not a good thing no goes down to zero it's fine like zero load yeah okay uh why don't we turn it down she's going going it's going she's going you know what i think it just took us second for the compressor to kick in she's going fast now this volume of water 0. one of a deg she's going now i can feel the change now look at this thing go wow this is unbelievable it's working now that's for sure this is getting hard to hold my hand on now this is getting cold we are below five uh not a thing i was expecting to happen 3degrees oh low temperature it goes down to three and then it gets mad and then it turns off yeah there's a low temperature warning on it it says in the manual uh so it doesn't chill things more yeah but i said it to five enter see it's going down more oh yeah why is it going down more you think it would just stop oh good oh i'm spilling water oh that's a really bad idea no no i got this hold on what boom here we go oh jeez alex i mean that computer doesn't need coolant does it there's a lot of copper in these blocks right can just absorb the heat we're going into windows now yeah all right so you i i i want to i want to see the temps in windows the fans are getting mad spinning up the fans okay i just i want to see these temps go down cpu temperature cpu package 100degrees here we go yep that's a pretty good grab see you later heat i actually want to use this in some projects just to get the arrow just see you later air done i think i know the answer to this question then can it tame the 13900 k gpus at 10degrees nice yep so what we're looking for is to beat 366 80degrees was also the maximum recorded temperature before mhm i i don't think we're going to get to wow we're still at 63 it's the ihs yeah there's only so much you can do if the bottleneck is the actual die transferring heat through the copper ihs wow that's a substantial improvement and that's over a water cooling system that has 320 mm fans on it and literally exactly the same block 620 mm fans and was that even a pre-warmed loop nope wow there's two ways to look at this then one is intel is actually shipping a cpu that nobody can run at its full potential or two intel shipping a cpu that you know has so much for you to unlock yeah that's another angle i'm just not used to seeing graphs like that up flat down no other cooling system we've used behaves like this they ramp up and they ramp down this has a ton of potential applications for us like imagine we were trying to test something like a water block for example instead of sitting around and waiting for the system to reach equilibrium we could just run a load immediately collect the data because we have a fixed coolant temperature so we can calculate the delta and that's it move on to the next thing now obviously out of the box that wouldn't be applicable to pc water cooling because the pumps we use are much weaker but what we could do is we could create a reservoir that has two inlets and two outlets so it's kind of like a water mixer and then we could run a regular pc cooling pump on the one side taking this temperature controlled water and this could just circulate water in there anyway what i want to do is cool the whole lounge you want to cool 12 computers with it yes 5,000 watts of cooling i mean i guess you could so cin bench ah these can probably do like five ah let's try 58 wait so what what on earth are you doing are you you're setting our best cor is to 6 ghz oh my god alex she crashed alex oh this has 6,000 megga transfer per second ram in it i believe memory controllers and overclocking on 13th gen bad time yeah let's try 56 all right 014 here we go some more voltage let's just do a quick run huh this might be a really bad cpu let's try just not as aggressive again apply who okay we're at 100degrees alex 38,000 points that's not bad so it's drawing 380 watts so that would be why we're uh thermal throttling this cpu is literally uncool we got 39 though 39,000 points i like this thing yeah this is a good chiller especially relative to our previous attempts 39,18125 man now i want to put one of these in my basement just chill the entire rack i think i might be in love yes thank you john we don't we're not sending this back no this is just ours thanks john okay shout out john's side hustle with the light box things have you seen that yeah it's really cool yeah it's pretty cool stop no no no no trust your first instinct no no okay okay no i don't want it to crash again let's give her more juice i think i know how to use this now oh he broke 40k really yeah hey can we run a gpu load real quick here i want to see what the gp run it is this forza horizon 5 running at 130 frames per at 4k absolutely cranked yes with r tracing'degrees on the gpu which is turboing to 2.73 and to be clear 409s pretty much universally have way over speced
