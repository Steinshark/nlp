all right so i'm gonna do something a little bit weird here uh we're not streaming this video got ruined while on stream blah blah blah obs but i actually really did want to just talk about this article because i think it is an amazing well-written article on why someone should switch from neovim to vs code if you don't know who this is there's me drinking milk just deal with it it's nexel go check them out follow him i'll put it in the description of the video great amazing death big fan i recently switched back to vs code from neil them as my primary code editor you may think this is weird because everyone seems to be going the other way around why would anyone want to move away from the most loved editor in this post i'll explain why i made the switch in my experiences so far why i used nivim in the past when i first started the code i used vs code because that's what i saw most people use i think this is totally normal i think everyone should probably start on something like vs code right your goal is to learn programming once you get past that hurdle it's great to just understand and learn your environment become an amazing programmer understand how your computer works great times but you know when you start off here's what you got to use you know but i noticed that on my old laptop vs code was too slow and lagging pretty much unusable while running a side process like a node server my laptop used to get so hot that i couldn't even touch it i was spending more time waiting for intellisense than actually writing code now this is something i i really do understand it actually in fact even to this day if i have enough like chrome plus slack and all that on my laptop it starts banging on all cylinders and you know i'm using a lemur pro from system 76 it's a good computer so even then there is problems just with a lot of electrons floating around on your computer so i do get this i i get this argument why you'd want to use something different especially if it's an older laptop i had heard of neovim as it was the most loved editor on stack overflow survey also from youtubers like the prime gen got em and tj oh i heard tj's as a youtuber and a twitch streamer did you know that it seemed like a really fun community in the overall vibe was very positive so i tried it out i learned the vimkey bindings lua to configure neovim created my own neo config and started using it as my primary editor i loved it i ran it ran on the terminal no electron apps no lag no waiting for autocomplete everything was as smooth as butter and i felt fast love that feeling it is why i continue to use neovim to this day learning them king buddings was one of the best decisions of my life i actually agree with this statement wholeheartedly if you do not know them bindings the thing is you don't have to know vim that's okay vim motions are something you can take with you to every editor it is something that can actually make you edit text faster and not only that even if you don't get much faster or not dramatically faster than it makes a difference you will find it fun there's like a strategy a game you can play it makes programming just fun i know people like to meme about how vim enthusiasts are always trying to convince people to learn key bindings okay i mean maybe this sentence a little on the nose right now but i truly believe that learning it will not only make you faster but also rekindle your love for programming it did for me you already know how i feel baby you know how i feel any of them had a great plug-in ecosystem almost all the things that i used in vs code were available in neovim it also made me realize that some things aren't necessary at all for example i use the file explorer extensively in vs code but i didn't even install the plugin for it on any of them actually this is one of my big things that i always tell people why it feels so strange to use neil vim or vim for the first time is that in a standard like editor if i jump over here and i go code what you see is a file tree is this necessary no it's not but when you open up vim for the first time what's gonna happen well you're gonna see not a lot this is my vim experiencing opening up netrw yours likely looks like this this is different it makes you feel uncomfortable you may not know what to do i started to understand the value of minimalism and how simplifying your setup can make you more productive absolutely configuring neovim was a lot of fun it gives you full control over your editor and how it looks and behaves it allowed to optimize my editor for me tailored to my specific needs i think this is a really underemphasized point why you should just do something like vim for even a little bit even if you go back even if you go back to intellij or anything else creating and thinking about what makes you good at your pro like at your system what makes like what inefficiencies exist and like how to solve them you will find even if you use other editors there's a lot of things that can transfer over a lot of things that will just make you faster because you took time to think about it there's also something really satisfying about using an editor you can figure yourself so for me i don't care about that part but all of this made me fall in love with any of him and i can confidently say that it is my favorite editor of all the ones i've used why i switched back to vs code which is i mean this sentence is strange given that sentence right before okay why here are the reasons why switch back to vs code in no particular order co-pilot copilot is an indispensable part of my workflow now i can't imagine writing code without it you know this is actually kind of a funny phrase because i've been thinking about getting rid of copilot lately like it's nice to generate some boilerplate but like a good lsp does pretty much all that like if you have a really good lsp setup you pretty much get the same experience except for you're in a little bit more control i actually haven't found co-pilot to be a big w i found it to mostly get in the way and if you feed it the right things it's pretty good it's it's good enough they have a neil van plug-in but my experience with it was not great i wonder why this is because mine is great it was slow and most the time it didn't even work mine is just fine no difference i can't tell the difference between vs code and neovim right now for mine i also use the t popo not the neovim specific one so that might be part of it the lsp used to keep crashing and i had to restart it every few minutes so yeah mine's not even an lsp it's whatever the t-pope thing is so maybe this is just a problem with my setup but i couldn't find a solution okay so okay so maybe maybe on the other hand copilot was built for vs code it works flawlessly and i haven't had any issues with it okay yeah i get that there's also this new github copilot x stuff currently invite only i got invite to test copilot chat which only supports vs code for now yeah yeah i mean copilot x doesn't look very appealing to me doesn't solve any of the problems that i want like i want i don't want something to write tests for me i i don't really need their features what i really want is for stat like good static analysis that's what i want when they have good static analysis i could find myself wanting github copilot more or github copilot x more i may even have vs code available just to do that tiring neovim plug-in ecosystem wait a second yeah okay i just didn't i just say it was a great ecosystem yes it it does but it's also tiring to keep up with it running pack or sync was scary because you never know what plugin introduced a breaking change that you didn't notice and all of a sudden you can't code as your whole config breakdown i i get that i get that i truly truly do get this and it can be very frustrating i'm on that team yep see there's a tweet he's just like what the hell happened right here oh and now there's this new plugin manager that everyone is using called lazy neil vim which is probably awesome but now i need to spend time migrating and getting used to it it's kind of like the javascript ecosystem there's always something new and shiny and you feel like you're missing out if you don't use it it's tiring to keep up with so this is like i have this whole rant i've always wanted to do called stop racing linux and this is like pretty much it in a nutshell everything i use is almost exclusively for me to be able to program faster so when i'm over here and i'm in my terminal if i want to open up something i can just go personal youtube right or react versus wasm you test data right i could just jump to it it is my project it's quick it works really really well and i absolutely love that everything i everything i've set up on my computer is not to make a prettier more amazing experience it is to make the most like creamy smooth developer experience and here's the other thing that i do i don't update i used plug much longer than everybody else everyone migrated to packer i didn't care i only recently upgraded the plug or a packer and now that there's lazy vid in the oven again i don't care i really don't care what i tend to do is about every six to eight months i restart my config and try to figure out how do i want to reorient it what don't i really like about it what do i want to change about it and spend like one day thinking about my dev workflow and kind of what has bothered me over the last few months and i do it about once every six to eight months in fact i'm actually due to do one here probably on twitch again in the next about a month i'm pretty excited about that so at first i was keeping up with the new plugins trying them out and making sure my config was up to date soon i was just tired of it i would be too this sounds awful it would never do that i just wanted the code exactly that's what i do i would never do that vs codes plug-in system is great installing extensions is a breeze and i don't have to worry about anything breaking i can just focus on coding yeah this is interesting because it is it is a great critique i think of just the neovin plug-in ecosystem which is neil vim has just been moving really really fast becoming an editor and maybe part of that is causing some problems i get that configuration as i mentioned earlier configuring nilvin was fun but but it also is tiring and time consuming as much as i love tinkering my config every day i realized it was a distraction i haven't touched my config in four to six months i was spending more time configuring my editor than actually coding yep again some people just aren't in control of themselves or they're just they're just so focused on getting something perfect that you lose the point of good enough and i i don't think this just stops at neovim i think that you can actually find this kind of behavior all throughout your life it's okay for something to be good enough there's things that i want to change about my neovim config that i just refuse to do right now because i just want to stay focused and that's okay like it is okay not to have awesome i did love that i had full control over my editor and i think vs code is quite configurable as well yeah but it sucks to configure anyone who's configured vs code beyond just like some basic stuff knows that like just gallons of json options just really sucks and when you want to do things that are custom it's like super not awesome and then their version of like they're text made or whatever they're highlighting rejects and madness is it's just super in superior too in in superior what's the condescending term for in superior super low bar compared to tree sitter you know probably not as much as neil van but it's enough for me and i'm still using the key bindings i have a nice theme i choose what i want in the ui where i want it and how it looks i have a few custom key bindings and snippets here and there but overall pretty minimal beautiful yeah i mean this is good i like i this what is this is that rose pine is that what i'm looking at what what am i looking at here also i never understood this plugin what are you doing with this plugin what are you doing also i don't understand this plugin either all right because i i don't want to have to go searching that's why you know that's why i have harpoon that's why i have telescope so i don't have to search with my eyeballs in that kind of sense right like i just want to be able to jump to the thing i got a new laptop i recently got a new laptop an m1 macbook air it's a beast uh so running vs code is not a problem anymore everything feels very smooth apple silicon is amazing and i'm glad i switched so i i don't like this argument because javascript will fill up every cpu cycle in a most inefficient way eventually it will take your memory it will take it you better hide your husband hide your wives kids they're taking everything right uh because this is this is only a finite argument that works for now in a little bit that argument stops working uh it's only gotten hot once when running some docker dev containers along with spotify and my browser which is understandable but other than that it's been great vs code only tools some exceptional libraries and frameworks uh so only support vs code which you could argue is a bad thing but it makes sense vs code is the most popular code editor of all for example uno css only has a vs code extension and it's my favorite way to write css this i agree if you love like there's some extensions that people love that only exist and they'll keep on using that i love fugitive i keep using fugitive despite the fact that it's written in vin script right and it's not really neil vim anymore it's it's back to the old vim and blah blah blah blah i just love it i think it's the best one i don't like neil get i keep trying to love neogood but i don't love it and so i totally get this absolutely astros and lsp but i found in my experience vs code much better than neofam i had no problems with astro but i get it awesome let's go i've also noticed that typescript lsp is a bit faster in vs code as well this i've measured it multiple times and i've done a lot of work on this and i don't think that there's anything real going on here there's something goofy probably happening with that one so why not use neovim distro i don't like neovin distributions high five i don't really like them i think they're great starter points if you don't want to start with vs code but the the point of vim is to have that like personalized experience right it's to have that personal one-to-one connection and so that distribution thing kind of like ruins it you're just learning someone else's connection what makes them like them and for me that's just that ain't it uh let's see i've tried many of them and none of them had the same feel as vanilla neil them set up most of them are bloated hard to extend and have a lot of things i don't need i don't want to spend time configuring a pre-configured editor i'd rather just configure it myself on that team nexel on that team conclusion this doesn't mean that i'm never going to use neovim again i still uh it's still my favorite editor and i'll be using it for a minor editing task tinkering stuff here and there on the terminal taking notes etc but for my main editor i'm going to be using vs code for now let me know if you enjoyed this blog post i did i really enjoyed it well done nextel this was very very good um i actually really i i really liked his arguments other than the cop pilot one um and i also just feel bad because i see this actually quite a bit right like this this thing where he said every day every day right uh every every what is it oh gosh um something about let's see there we go like every day there we go i feel bad because i see this a lot right like i see people that can't stop racing their experience they're no longer making it actually a better dev experience they're actually getting the the opposite effect and if you have that you know maybe it is just better to use neovim or to use vs code maybe it is just better to stop because you can't help yourself uh i use almost everything as default because default is usually the best uh that way i don't have to think about it it generally just works if i go use tmux on a server it's pretty much the exact same as if me using tmux on my computer you know just a thought i hope you like this video i know this was strange me without twitch hopefully it was still good i just really loved this article and i really really wanted to read it to you guys because it was just super well done so if you like this video press the like button hit the sub button if you haven't catch me on that twitch stream baby the name is the vimagine
