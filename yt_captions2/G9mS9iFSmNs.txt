okay flip i know you don't like to actually edit anything but if you could i i did a quote tweet that was maybe a little brutal i'm gonna go with an l take on this one you gotta get that then we'll continue from here okay maybe the quote tweet was a little brutal i'll give it for you i really don't like this take at all uh because i mean this take can literally this you could have made this exact same take with react when react came out right you could have made this take at any point with any software ever that's new right so why would anyone switch to react when there is jquery why would anyone switch to jquery when we already have you know javascript integrating with uh with the dom why would you ever need to do that and second off svelte first off it's corporate backed whenever something's corporate backed it just means that there's a lot more stuff to it right it means that there's a lot of people that are like that are putting in serious money there's multiple employees releasing like a ton of changes they're absolutely murdering it to say that react is the only industry standard is just out of this world right like the centric view that people have where it's just like there's only one world that exists and that world is react there is no other world there will never be any other world no i don't believe that and yeah i feel bad for flutter i mean it sucks you know flutter flutter is kind of sucky but here's the deal i want you to take something right here from this post which i do feel bad let's read it and then we're going to take something uh from this i have worked professionally in flutter for three years now the company i worked for recently laid me off because the difficult securing the next round of investment and i'm in the market for a job and and the major the majority of my recent experience is in flutter in my country canada i am finding basically zero opportunities one hiring hiring manager said it's hard to find a flutter uh flutter developers i'm observing it is nearly impossible to find flutter positions so it's almost like no one at all is using flutter i'm a bit uh let's see i have a feeling that by the end of 2024 flutter might be completely an afterthought okay so i want to throw this out here and i'm going to mean this in the most sincere and genuine way don't be a react dev don't be a flutter dev don't be a one-trick andy i mean this in the most sincere way learn things understand how a ui works build with multiple different perspectives so such that when react inevitably dies as the roman empire died as everything eventually dies you can just move on you can adapt you can go and do something so easy because you're like oh yeah yeah i'm vaguely i you know i've done a lot of ui work right you know how to say things yeah i've built users experience i know how these all these things work and yeah i'm pretty good with react i've used a lot of react but i've been using flutter professionally but i really understand these things it's just so wild this idea that you are just simply you are a representation of the framework you use if you like using svelt because you find it much better then use just use felt right like why what why why why does it matter here's the thing though it was felt inevitably dies like everything eventually will including the the heat death of our universe right it doesn't really matter no it doesn't matter because at the end of the day you can still deliver a great message about how you understand how the world works how servers work you can be able to answer any technical questions and then guess what if they're like okay but what about this in react you could say hey i'm not as familiar with react but i think it's something like use ref right is use ref does this work and they're like yeah this works that way okay this is how i do right you have enough experience to be able to talk about it okay i'm not i don't even like react and look at me i know about use ref okay i know about use memo okay i don't want to know about them i don't like them but guess what i still learn about it a little bit right and so i can answer any of these dumb questions just in case i need to answer them i'm not going to be great at it but i know a lot about it right because the bigger thing is that i studied the underlying things please don't be a frameworker this should not exist this entire tweet should not exist it's not people's livelihood it's not a stupid game guess what it's what you're interested in and it's what makes you employable becoming a generalist foundation and a specific master in one area will do nothing but help you become a generalist first before you become a master and the problem is is that everybody right now is just like reacts the standard we use react and so the only thing you are is a react dev because that's all you know your foundation is react your mastery is react you don't know anything but react from the tippity top to the bippity bottom and what happens when that happens you're very unemployable okay it makes it super hard to hire you because i don't want to hire a react andy in fact one of the largest problems i have when i was looking for some people to help me uh with some of the tools we're building at netflix i could it was so hard to find anyone that said they knew javascript and did years of javascript that didn't just simply that they weren't react andies i was like okay tell me about this in javascript well actually uh so in reacting i'm like no no tell me about this in javascript how does this work uh well i i just use you know the thing is is that you use redux and i'm like no just build an async queue can you do that for me like can you use javascript just javascript it's like 15 lines write me 15 lines right now and the the like very few people could sorry i feel very strongly about this because like this tweet is the antithesis or what i think is killing or making engineering so hard it's what i truly think is making this this the two level uh engineering which is engineers who went and learned the foundation built the generalist and is starting to specialize versus the engineers who just specialize and have no foundation and so like there's like these two class of people react andy or generalist andy i would rather be a generalist andy how to sort an array in jquery how to do math in jquery well there's actually the ad plug-in did you know that uh what's async you know what async is uh okay well i know you said something i did actually want to read this we're going to pull it up come on oh camel my camel i appreciate most of your messages most of them prime gen one thought here when i was a full-time back-end guy and hated front end but learned reacts felt and leptos and other front-end framers because it gives me a perspective i even contributed a bunch to flutter slash leptos oss project yep uh it has both for some reason look at that i once failed an interview because i said i know js and they asked me to implement async cues and i was stuck no wait wait did you interview did i interview you wait hold on did i interview you are you saying that i interviewed you there's a chance here i'm just saying there's a chance hate watcher oh my goodness what do they call hate watchers what i just heard the term this morning there's like so what's what's the term for hate watchers i know one of you i know one of y'all been watching uh aunties yeah let's go i didn't realize i got some aunties in the chat no yeah let's go i got myself an auntie uh appreciate that uh i deal bait watching okay go away baitan uh anyways really genuinely appreciate this i i by the way i want to make a clear don't dunk on adam okay dunk on a concept that's fine you can say hey i think you're totally wrong i think that's cool i think he will think that's totally cool what you can't do is be like adam you're an idiot if you do that you're not helping the conversation you don't change anyone's mind in fact the only thing you do when you talk like that on the internet is uh i did not call him an idiot i said this is a terrible take this is an l take l take is commenting on the take not the person i'll take i'll take is totally about the take the take is bad i do not like it i will never support that take but the real talk is that you don't want people stuck thinking because then people go with the with the what's it called they go with the idea of defending the person as opposed to the idea there's no way of saying i'll take well what else is it i i thought it was about to take tj wait time out are you telling me l take is about dunking on a person and not the take because it really needs to get fixed up then okay i didn't say l person it's a it's a it's an l take because the take is bad the name is the prime machine
