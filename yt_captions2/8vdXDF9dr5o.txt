you might have heard the saying that a filmmaking career is a marathon not a sprint and i've probably said that more than a few times on this channel myself i wish i could say that i found out i was wrong or that i found a magic overnight solution to get to where you want to be quickly in your career but there just isn't the good news is that once you've accepted that you need to be in this for the long haul it's all totally doable as long as you have a great plan you need to know who you are what you want who you're going after and how you're going to pay for it but once you do the rest is all just logistics but what if you don't have a plan like that in place and how do you know what you're aiming for and how you're gonna get it that's exactly what we're going to talk about in this video how to make a five-step career plan for your filmmaking future so that you can get to work without feeling lost i like to try and do these exercises myself at the start of every year and i promise you that if you do them too it's gonna make it way way easier to move forward so let's get into it [music] hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsyth and on this channel i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer if you're into that kind of thing do the whole like subscribe sign up for notifications whatever you got to do because i've got new videos coming out every week okay so why go to all the effort of writing complex career plans instead of just shooting and posting stuff online or maybe you have some good jobs under your belt but you know you haven't hit your full potential yet how do you break through to the next level or maybe you've been working really hard and you think you might be ready to quit whatever job you've got and go full time into filmmaking how can you know if you'll make enough money to survive the answer is to have a great plan in my opinion taking the time to create a solid career plan for yourself is one of the highest impact but most neglected business decisions that a filmmaker can make i think it's so important that i spend a whole week this year typing up my entire process for yearly career planning into an ebook that i was even thinking about selling but then i realized that it was actually better to just give this information way for free because as you guys succeed this channel succeeds so instead i turned it into a free five-day email blast instead that you can download through a link in the description but i basically broke these five steps up and every day for five days you're gonna get a worksheet with ideas and exercises to do on your own time but i also wanted to get the basic version out as a video for those who aren't ready to go that deep right now these lessons are modeled on how i do my own planning and if it works for me it can absolutely work for you too in the meantime though let me give you the short version the very first thing you need to do when trying to look ahead in your career is to ask yourself the most basic question of all who are you as a filmmaker you might think this is a stupid question and you know exactly who you are but if you are stuck in an elevator with like verner herzog or something i would just leave you alone could you tell him in 10 seconds exactly what you're all about without stuttering most people including me can't do this well without thinking about it beforehand and that's exactly what step one is all about before you can convince other people to take a chance on you they need to understand what it is you do and what you bring to the table what makes you unique what can you do that others can't why would they choose you over someone else in your area over the course of your career you're going to need to present this same information so many times in a bunch of different ways from pitch meetings or website bios time you spend answering this question will pay off big time down the line in the email blitz i give a couple exercises that i highly suggest doing but the simplest version is to write it out in three sentences or less if you can't tell someone what you do in three super clear sentences you really don't understand it yourself okay so once you know and more importantly once you can explain to someone else what it is that you do the next thing you have to decide is exactly what you want we all want to be successful filmmakers but what that means is different for each of us some of you might want to become directors on high budget productions and travel the world or others might want to stay closer to home and tell local stories that matter maybe some of you want to go after the money and get into like series tv while others might be more interested in going to indie route and retaining full control over their work there are a ton of ways to succeed in this industry and you need to know what that looks like for you so you can tell if you're making progress or not again in the guide i give a whole bunch of proms for you to work from but to keep this video from ballooning out of control the basic idea is to visualize your life and career one year from now three years from now and five years from now if everything went right what would that look like who would you be working for where would you be living what would your work life balance be like if you don't know what you're aiming for it's really really tough to take actionable steps so the more detail you can go into here the better next up is everyone's favorite topic and that's money hell yeah specifically how are you going to be making it a few years ago i read a massive biography of leonardo da vinci and it's one of the things that jumped out at me most was the fact that even though he was one of the greatest innovators and artists of all time da vinci pretty much always had a day job sometimes he was working for rich families doing portraits or statues and sometimes he worked for bloodthirsty nobles who had him designing military siege equipment but there were very few times in his life when leonardo could just do whatever he wanted and if da vinci had to have a day job then why should it be any different for us as filmmakers the reality is that out of all the filmmakers i know less than five percent or maybe even less than one percent support them full time by making their own projects alone pretty much everyone myself included has a day job of one kind or another my day job is working as a director and cinematographer on other people's productions they pay me a day rate then i take that money and use it to finance my life in the projects i care about like my own films and this youtube channel other friends of mine make commercials some do reality tv and others work for news outlets many many more people make their income outside filmmaking and then use it to fund their art and that doesn't make you any less of a filmmaker a filmmaker is just someone who makes films so if you're paying your bills by working as a dental hygienist and then taking your camera out on evenings and weekends that does not make you any less legit but however you're going to support your filmmaking habit you do need to know what that is do you want to earn your money with a camera or in some other way there's no right answer but you do need to know what that looks like in order to plan a future that's a pretty good segue into the next step which is also money related and that's to figure out what your cost of doing business is if you're hoping to go full time one day this is especially important because if you don't know how much money you need you're gonna have no idea whether you're ready or not the whole idea of just queen quitting your job and jumping in is a nice fantasy but it's not really a great business move so thinking this through will give you a much better idea of when you're ready to make the lead likewise if you're already working in film knowing what it costs you to stay in business every year lets you know how much you need to charge for your work it's not a glamorous thing to think about but a simple cost of doing business analysis is going to give you so much financial clarity it's well worth the time the cost of doing business analysis is pretty straightforward it's just a total calculation of how much money you need to support yourself in a given month or year you can try and base this off your previous year's tax return but if you're a freelancer that income can change from year to year the best way is to just sit down with a spreadsheet and calculate exactly what your life and business costs you until you get a rough total and be thorough here do you need new gear or the wheels falling off your car do you have a subscription to every streaming service there is put it all down there if you want to go all out with this sign up for the email blitz and i'll send you some more prompts and ideas and all sorts of things to think about but if you just want to do do this on your own try to remember that things always cost more than you want them to so be honest and save room for incidentals because like john lennon once said life is what happens to you when you're busy making other plans okay so now you have a good idea who you are what you want how much it's going to cost and how you're going to make that money the final step is to figure out who you're going to do it for [music] if you only want to make your own films and you don't care about collaborating with other production companies or getting hired on other people's shoots focus this on film festivals instead of clients but the majority of us will want to find people who have the power to pay us for our work that means making a big list of as many potential clients as you can think of and then reaching out to those people to set up meetings alright so i'm sorry if i've been plugging a lot in this video but i do have so much to say about networking that i also made a full downloadable guide a few months ago that's like 12 pages of exercises on how to network effectively as a filmmaker there's going to be a link to that in the description too i'll spare you most of the details here though and make it simple who are the people you want to work for and where are they do you want to shoot for a specific director or production company is there a brand you really want to work with or maybe there's a news outlet you think would be a great match for your latest short well if they've never heard of you it's going to be really hard for them to hire you the answer here is to make them know you the first step here is to make a list of 10 people minimum or filmfare festivals or outlets or whoever that you want to work with then in a separate column find out the contact information for the production manager festival coordinator senior editor or whoever you think is in charge then contact them i have templates and a bunch of other stuff in the guide and i promise that's the last time i'll mention guides in this video but that's the essence of it tell them who you are what you do why you want to work for them and then meet with them ideally in person that's how i developed relationships with many of the companies i still work for today and time invested in building out your network is well worth it and that all starts with identifying who those people are and figuring out how you can go from being a stranger to a known entity in their eyes so there it is five steps to making a long-term career plan that every filmmaker should do if you can revisit these questions every year but even just doing this once is way way better than never you can do the whole thing in a really long day or over five days if you sign up for the email please sorry i lied always be plugging however you decide to do it though having a plan is the best way you can keep on track and get to where you want to be in your career that's it for today i hope you like that video and if you did like subscribe all that good stuff it really does help me and if you did like that one maybe check out this other video i made about how to network like a pro see ya [music]
