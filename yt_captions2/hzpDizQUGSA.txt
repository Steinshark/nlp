i'm building a startup [music] ever since i first started learning the code around' months ago the angle was never simply to learn to become a software developer for someone else i saw the skill of coding as something different i wanted to be able to create my own apps to solve the problems and to bring my ideas to life so i've had this idea for this project i want to build literally ever since i started learning the code but i have been procrastinating with this for like literally a year now and the reason i've been procrastinating is because i never thought i was quite good enough to actually start building my own like big project my own startup i also like oh i still need to learn this one more thing do this one more course i never felt i was ready but the truth is you're never going to feel like you're already are you so today is finally time to take the next step on my coding journey by actually building my own startup so what am i building then the app i want to build is is a personal finance tracking application i've long believed that the first step to achieving true financial freedom is taking control of your finances but i never really found an app that had all the features that i wanted i've always just defaulted to using my own google sheets templates but they also still require so much manual work in sorting through and categorizing expenses and many other features i believe the right budgeting application could automate so i want to build my own and i'm not saying that this app is going to be like the next billion dollar startup or something like that all i know is that there is a problem that i want solved for myself and that alone is going to keep me motivated to actually go through with this point of this project and the point of this series that i'm gonna have on this channel at least if you guys want to keep seeing this is that number one actually building this project is actually going to give me the experience of building a large software system number two you are gonna get to learn that as well because i'm gonna be sharing all the lessons that i can learn from this journey number three i'm gonna use these videos to like try out different styles maybe like vlogs and like more cinematic because i'm also like really passionate about filmmaking and obviously yeah fourth i'm gonna get to monetize this app by making these videos even if it never succeeds speaking of which as i said the plan for this video is to talk about my plan of the startup what is this startup that i'm doing actually what is this personal finance dashboard and we'll be going through this in a mirror which is the platform that i'm using to plan for startup and this video is made in partnership with miro so this is miro miro is essentially this collaborative online whiteboard platform it's designed to be used to make project plans to create designs to keep track of your progress during your project you can also use a lot of the integrations to use things like video chat organized meetings create presentations and much much more so in this video i'm going to be showing you exactly how i use miro to plan my startup there's a couple of different things i'm doing here so first of all is my plan for this entire startups like what i want the app to be so sort of drawn a diagram so here's sort of what i have in mind first of all we have the user who is doing two things they can see they use a dashboard which is taken where they can like track their expenses create budgets calculate how much they need to become financially free and all these things that i have in mind and they will also be uploading their transaction data either by an api if i can find one i think they do exist from the dashboard it will go into my backend the front end will be written in react so that's what this node here is for and to implement authentication and authorization i'm going to be using something called oauth which is like this easy way to implement like essentially the functionality of like logging in and registering users then we will have a node.js backend server when the user enters data it will flow through the dashboard flow through the react from it into the pack-in server it will be stored in a database and here a thing that i will need to figure out is how to make it or secure like all of that essentially with the first version for the first mvp that i'm curating it's just for myself it's just sort of that it has the needs that i have but then in the future if i want to make this available to other people otherwise obviously there will be a lot more things and i will have to figure out so there will be one database for the user data another one for the transaction data and then from this database the data will be managed and processed which this arrow here shows by the backend server so this is sort of a very high level overview of all the different components that i will have to build for my starter so if you go into here actually let's go up this is sort of again a very high level plan i'm not a designer as you can see so it doesn't look very good but it's like we'll have a couple of these tabs and then on here i've created these diagrams that i will be expanding over time i like removing things if i decide not to do something just have all the features and the functionality that i want to implement for all these different parts of my app so yeah this is something that i'm doing and so many like templates that you can choose in mirror it has this templates folder if you click on templates yes all of these full of flowcharts mind maps so other than that i also use mirror to have these designs where i just have the design board for like all my designing stuff which is like the thing that i'm most afraid of because i am terrible at css then we also have competitor analysis where i'm going to be complaining some information about like different apps this this app called wallet that i've been using myself but just didn't really have all the things i want so i don't really use it anymore i just use my google sheets nowadays um so yeah i'll just come up with some like things that these have to well things they don't do well things that they do okay and this is also just a template that i chose i think i ever like compared me there or something yeah competitor analysis let's just use this template for this one and then there's mint.com which i haven't been able to use because one of the bad things about it is that it's only available in the us which makes me think i know that this app is very popular if i can just make something that's even as good as this one and i just release it so that it's available outside of the us that could leave a huge international markets that's like open and the last thing i have here is the ticket board which i plan to use but i keep track of all the tickets and this is also what you'll do in any software engineering job for example whether it's like backlog of all the tasks that will have to be down i haven't really filled this out yet but for example i know for the front end we'll have to be building a nav board and i'll have to first find a good design and then there's going to be a lot of individual items that i have to start creating for all these different pages i have a separate board for the back end like for example for now i have i need to find an api to implement logging and registering that will be much later again this was just based on a template which i think it was a kind of bomb board uh kind of a framework i think it was this one that i used for this so that is the high level plan for my startup so i'll make a couple of episodes if you guys enjoy it i'll keep doing it because my real plan was always to like become a tech entrepreneur not a tech employee i figured by actually sharing my journey from the get-go i could give you the most value if this ends up succeeding it's gonna be the coolest thing in the world if this whole journey is literally documented on youtube now to make this video because i want there to be something in 10 years when i know all about computer science maybe i'm the next mark zuckerberg i found out the new big tech startup probably not by the way but i have big dreams okay i want to be able to look at this moment and say oh there he was in some random forest in finland basically not knowing anything and i think it will just be really cool for me to be able to look back on my journey so where if someone finds value in this that's amazing but even if no one ever watches these videos i still wanna have them out because i think it's cool to document your journey i think more people should be doing this like but like i said the point of this startup series is not that this is gonna make me a billionaire the point of the startup series is to be a learning journey for me and hopefully a learning journey for you so thank you so much for watching this episode thank you for supporting this channel because it's your support of these videos that makes these videos possible that allows me to keep making and to put in a lot of effort into these and growing this channel is literally something that has completely and utterly changed my life and it allows me to do the things that i want which is create things both in terms of creating things with code and also create videos and it's this creative aspect of making something from nothing that got me excited about the idea of coding in the first place and i feel like i put off actually doing that and focusing on building something big from scratch for way too long when i was finally time to start i hope you're excited too i can't wait to fail can't wait to fail a lot of times because i cannot wait to learn from all my failures [music]
