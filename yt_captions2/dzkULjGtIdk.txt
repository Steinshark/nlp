for something we use every day it is shocking how little we know about steam did you know that you can install games that have been de-listed from the store share games with your family and friends and even play your pc games remotely as if you had your own personal cloud gaming service well believe it or not that is just the tip of the iceberg welcome to 10 steam features you didn't know about first up is remote downloads we've all been in this situation you're at trent judy's sixth wedding miles away from your gaming pc and you realize oh crap i forgot to download that new game even if i start it the second i get home i'll be in bed before it finishes whoa that is a really skimpy wedding dress you probably you probably already knew that you can buy games through the steam app on your phone but did you know that you can also use the app to tell your pc at home to start downloading right away just open your library in the steam app select the game in question and as long as your pc is awake and signed into the same steam account you should see remote download at the bottom of the accordion menu speaking of downloads did you know that you can download and play some games that have been removed from steam for one reason or another here's a cool example before there was half-life 2 there was half-life 2d otherwise known as codename gordon which was a little side-scrolling puzzle slash action game developed in flash by a third party then published on steam by valve but if you type it into the store you get nothing that's because the developer hard-coded a web url into the game that expired when the original owner failed to renew it after which it turned into a sketchy advertising website so valve removes the game from steam well kind of with this team client signed in open up either the windows run dialog or a browser window and just type in steam colon slash install slash 92 hit enter and steam should open up and start installing the game there's actually a handful of other games in similar situations some of which are still playable we're going to have links in the description we'll also have a link down there to our sponsor ugreen the ugreen 1200 watt power roam portable power station lets you power and charge up to 13 devices simultaneously ensuring that all your electronics are juiced up and ready to go check it out at the link below and use the provided coupon code for a nice discount now that you have a list of new things to install did you know that steam can save you time and bandwidth if you're installing a game that's already on and another device on your network just go to the steam menu click on settings and then downloads at the bottom of the window you'll see some new options that allow transfers between your own devices devices owned by friends or devices owned by anyone on the same network this is not only faster if you have slow internet but if you have a bandwidth cap on your connection it won't count against it truthfully it's not that different from the old trick of manually copying the game folder to another pc but it's way more user friendly while we still have the download settings open by the way let's click on steam library folders if you've used a steam deck then the storage manager window that pops up might look familiar to you this shows you where on your computer steam has games installed lets you uninstall things in bulk and lets you move your games between your various drives but you might be surprised to learn that this also works on external drives like this one ran out of space on your system drive no problem create a library on a usb drive or even an sd card and plug it in unlike in the past where you had to scan the files steam should recognize all of the games automatically allowing you to instantly play them right off the drive and while you might think performance would be an issue valve has assured steam deck users that they can expect similar performance off of the internal drive or the micro sd card slot and this is the same idea with that said if you want your portable library to run at top speed we would recommend a portable nvme enclosure hooked up to the fastest usb port you can muster we're gonna have a couple good options links down below installing games at all is so 2015. how about just streaming your games to devices where they're not installed or even to devices where they can't be installed like your phone or your tv remote play anywhere was first introduced as in-home streaming back in 2014 and was heavily promoted when valve launched the steam link and the steam controller which was a killer thin client and game controller combo that allowed you to cast games from the pc in your mom's basement to the tv in your mom's living room but while the hardware products were ultimately discontinued steam link lives on just in software form remote play anywhere works pretty much the same as it did before allowing you to enjoy the performance of your powerful gaming pc while streaming the gameplay and the controls to any device with the steam link app which is available for android and ios many smart tvs and even for the raspberry pi oh it's not in the script but obviously for steam os as well remote play anywhere and steam link work best with both devices on the same wired network but five gigahertz wi-fi is also fine in many cases and with a good enough connection on both sides you can even use it over the internet though you might want to stick with less latency sensitive titles if you're gaming on the beach in your stylish ltt swim trunks available in black or water block blue on ltdstore.com now this next one got a decent amount of attention when it first came out so it's probably less of a thing you didn't know and more of a thing you didn't remember but steam family sharing lets you share your game library with up to five other accounts on up to 10 total devices just go to steam settings family and look for family library sharing to set it up family sharing is particularly great for sharing single player games because why should you and your so both pay 70 for a game that you can't even play together now obviously there are some limits patients not every game is shareable only one person can play a game at a time and you'll need to log into your steam account on any device that you intend to share with at some point so you can't just spontaneously share libraries with that random cool dude you met in that epic counter-strike match on that note by the way if your match was particularly epic i'm sure you don't want compression artifacts messing up your screenshots thankfully steam lets you brag artifact free by going to steam settings in-game just check the save and uncompressed copy option and make sure that you specify a screenshot folder that's all there is to it uncompressed versions of any screenshot you take will show up in the folder you've specified and while we're in here let's do a bonus tip right next to that screenshot setting you can enable a simple fps counter that works in any game just pick which corner you want it to appear in foreign you're playing a good server can be hard to find and when you find one you like you probably want to remember it most online games have their own way to favorite a server within the game but did you know that steam has its own server browser built in go to view servers and you'll get a filterable list of active servers for all the games in your library along with tabs to view your server history favorite servers and more all without actually launching a game though you will have to do that eventually and when you do here's a fun new way you've almost certainly heard of big picture mode the steam ui scheme that's made for large screen devices but have you heard of small mode it's hiding in plain sight in the view menu right above big picture mode small mode turns the normal steam interface into a compact simple library viewer it's perfect for sticking on your second screen along with your friends list and your chats and if you click on anything that needs a bigger window it'll bring you right back to the standard interface which it calls large mode in the view menu which is not to be confused with big picture mode on that note valve has spent over 10 years working to make keyboard and mouse games playable from the coach with a controller and all of their progress has become a key feature of the steam deck where steam input lets you completely customize the input for any game regardless of what the game itself actually allows you to do and guess what steam input can be enabled on the desktop steam clients as well just right click on a game in your library and open up properties where you can enable steam input once that's done you can right click on the game again then click manage controller config to customize the steam input settings for the game this also works with non-steam games that you've added to steam though it's still a little buggy particularly if you try to use community defined configs for your non-steam game we're going to have a link down below with some more info what's wild is that steam is so full of hidden gems like this that we could easily do a follow-up video with 10 new tips so help us out by posting your favorite steam feature in the comments down
