oh i can't do this anymore there is so much to 
learn about ai i don't even know where to like   what is the point it's just consuming me it's too 
much i give up don't give up second tiff i got you   covered and i got all of you covered in this video 
we are going to go through some of the easiest   ways i'm going to break down for you how you can 
simply learn ai there's some tricks here i got   covered for [music] you all right let's get into 
it to start with there are many different areas   within ai that you can focus on depending on what 
your end goal is and interests for example there   is the technical understanding so things such 
as really understanding the fundamental concepts   programming concepts and then also to really using 
ai for a problem solving tool now this doesn't   always need to be falling under technical but 
just to keep it simple then we have the societal   impact so this is things covering such as ethics 
and bias jobs and the future of work privacy and   security this is i know of interest to a lot of 
you especially around the ethics with a ai and   the bias that it can create this is a whole other 
area within artificial intelligence that you can   spend time focusing on and then there's this third 
category which is really more generic depending on   more specialties where it be really having a 
strong understanding as to using different ai   tools or maybe you are more so understanding ai's 
current limitations different things like that all   right we just went through three big buckets 
at a high level as to where you can put your   focus when you are learning about ai and already 
it seems kind of like a lot so let's break down   what each bucket really entails because that will 
give you a good sense as to where you are most   interested and should put your focus to learning 
with artificial intelligence what relates most to   you and kind of the next steps into how to really 
learn and understand ai that best relates to what   you are working on your job and the future all 
right let's start by going back to bucket number   one more of the technical concepts and just hold 
on a sec even if you a non-technical person you're   going to want to hear this let's cover some 
of the basics within artificial intelligence   different terms that you should be aware of and 
know what they mean they often times get thrown   around interchangeably when in reality they 
are pretty different artificial intelligence   we really use a lot of times incorrectly we just 
kind of use it as this term to cover anything   and everything with you know under ai's kind 
of umbrella when in reality there is so much   more to it let's start out actually with a few 
of the basics all right let's get into machine   learning what exactly is machine learning think of 
it as training algorithms to learn patterns from   data and make predictions or decisions so you are 
feeding this algorithm some data and based on that   it is learning and getting trained to make better 
decisions and predictions and this learning can   happen through various methods through supervised 
learning unsupervised learning and reinforcement   learning now we're not going to dive into those 
three today but just save this video if you are   interested in it or write these down and you can 
i mean machine learning we could make for a whole   series of videos essentially next up let's cover 
deep learning so deep learning you can think of as   an advanced subset of machine learning so deep 
learning uses multi-layered neural networks to   analyze various factors of data so you can think 
of it deep learning is a really good task or tool   for things such as image and speech recognition 
really complex tasks then we have a subset with   inde deep learning which is neural networks stay 
with me here i know it can get complex fast but   this is just very high level to at least give you 
an understanding as to what these different terms   that people throw around actually mean neural 
networks are inspired by the human brain i mean   when you think neural obviously the brain so 
just kind of to keep that in your back pocket   neural networks though are a series of algorithms 
that mimic the operations of the human brain to   recognize relationships within a set of data and 
they are key a foundational part to deep learning   which we just went through all right the last 
one i want to cover is something that we often   hear get thrown around especially in the news 
or especially on social media which is agi or   artificial general intelligence and i think this 
gets thrown around because of the what ifs around   it like what if this actually happened with ai 
and and kind of gives this very futuristic kind   of fear mongering social post it can often times 
so this is a concept where agi has the ability   to understand learn and apply new concepts 
to solve different problems on its own and   it's really similar to how a human brain works 
okay so still under topic number one technical   concept or technical as a whole obviously there's 
the entire programming section of this too where   there are so many different courses you can take 
gone are the days where you would have to go to   school for computer science and learn everything 
the traditional way in order to become a machine   learning engineer now don't get me wrong i'm 
not discrediting that form of education it is   key and especially for very specific roles but 
i don't want you to get discouraged that if you   didn't go to school for computer science you 
can't explore these options the good thing is   there are so many courses online here are some 
courses though that really start with the basics   the foundation that i just covered and work their 
way up the first one i want to cover is a stanford   course that is on machine learning covered by 
or hosted by corsera really starts as to what   is machine learning and then breaks or works its 
way down to the nitty-gritty so this is a course   whether you are technical or not you can learn a 
lot from it okay another course that is offered   by corera they offer some amazing courses this 
isn't even sponsored by them but i i love them   so deep learning specialization and so this is 
actually a series of five courses to help you   understand deep learning and it will help you also 
not only understand deep learning and you'll get   more into the specifics around building training 
and deploying neural networks so it really starts   getting into the details especially around deep 
learning all right let's jump into the second   column which is societal impact so this is if 
you are more interested maybe in this side of   things when we start learning about ai and really 
getting into that world one thing you will quickly   come to realize is there is so much to learn and 
often times that can make you feel so intimidated   you just back away from it and be like ah this 
isn't for me that's why i really wanted to break   it down to these three columns and then within 
them there is still so much to lear learn so   really focus or hon in on one thing and then 
from there you'll just over time continually   gain information and educate yourself on others 
don't try and learn everything at once all right   so under societal impact we have ethics and bias 
in ai algorithms and it's no secret there's been   tons of conversations around this that there is 
some issues or challenges when it comes to bias   within ai and you know ai generated images such 
as the ones that dolly creates can raise ethical   concerns about bias discrimination privacy and 
even job displacement i mean when we look at   when ai was first starting to be able to generate 
art i think that was a huge concern and still is   and there's this really fine line or friction 
we are facing right now as to where who sets   the regulations where does the line stop and also 
too when the re regulations are set the line keeps   on changing as technology is literally changing 
seems like on a day-to-day basis and i think this   is really interesting ai ethics for anyone who is 
really passionate about legal psychology anything   around the more the human brain anything like 
that i think you will really find ai ethics really   interesting and something to start looking into 
as a place to start learning about ai and there   is such a need for ai ethicist people who study 
this really carefully because ai is the worst it   will ever be meaning it's continuing to grow and 
get better and better and we need to start putting   regulations and really thoughtful considerations 
into place as to what this will look like moving   forward then we have jobs or the future of work 
and you know this is an area that i love to   explore mainly because it's so interesting to me 
how ai will impact jobs not only today but in the   future as well as how we learn different skills 
our learning will change and even our skills will   change too because of ai now what can you learn 
under here for me one thing that i really focus   on is understanding as to how ai impacts us 
currently and then what it can looking ahead   so this kind of you have to put your futurist 
cap on or futurist hat on where you're making   assumptions based on the data that is available 
today as to what it could look like moving forward   and then taking that and educating others as to 
where to put their time and skills when learning   about ai as to how it will help them grow in their 
career all right the third pillar we have is what   i called kind of the generic or beyond the basics 
where it's more specialized areas this could be   things such as maybe you're passionate about ai 
but you really want to focus in on some ai tools   this could literally be you becoming an expert 
and learning more so about what ai tools are   offered what are the best ai tools for specific 
things all right and on that note you want to   know something really cool is you can now use the 
gpt store which just released to actually educate   yourself on all of these topics as well i recently 
was on the gpt store and i found consensus and   i was going through their gpt uh custom gpt and 
it is really impressive actually it goes through   uh it says your ai research assistant so you 
can search 200 million academic p papers from   consensus so you'll get science-based answers 
and you'll help you draft content with accurate   citations so i thought this was really cool i 
i just stumbled across it and i've been using   it recently to understand different concepts 
within artificial intelligence and it's worked   really well for me because you know it's coming 
from actual scientists there's over 200 million   uh copies or sorry data that's what is it 200 
million academic papers sorry that's located in   there so it's a great way as well to start your 
learning all right at the end of the day if you   interested in learning ai don't let or consume you 
just how much information is out there and becomes   so overwhelming you learn nothing take it step by 
step we went through some key concepts today also   too i shared with you some key courses to really 
lay that foundation and then from there you can   kind of branch off into different areas that we 
went through thank you all for watching i hope you   found this video educational inspirational as to 
where to put your focus based on your interest hit   that subscribe button and i'll see you all soon 
thanks everyone i always end the same way i got   to get more creative what's like a creative ending 
i should do leave in the comments help me [music] out
