good morning friends from new york city [music] even though you can't really can't tell that i mean well if you can that i'm in a hotel room based on the messiness we're we're packing getting ready to go to the airport today and i thought i'd take you along with me and do a q a answering some of the most asked questions around technology coding career i got a lot of questions around my transition from software engineering into developer relations developer advocacy so we're going to cover all of that and more in this video before we get into it though make sure to hit that subscribe button for more tech coding career related content and okay let's just get let's dive into these questions [music] so i have the questions here in front of me and one of the top questions was do you enjoy your new role as a developer advocate if so what skills would you recommend one bill to transition into that field it sounds like a nice role of being creative and technical yes i completely agree it's and that's what really struck me about this role is the creativity and technical aspects combined so for those of you who don't know i transitioned into developer advocacy into the developer relations world from software engineering i was doing software engineering for five years and wanted to grow in my career and for me looking at the different paths to grow as a software engineer one stood out to me was a developer relations way and that is because i love mixing creativity with technology with coding and and it's a really great role that combines them both you need to typically actually let me put a disclaimer here every company handles developer relations very different so what i'm saying is just being based on my experience and i feel like i need to qualify that because some companies developer relations is much more marketing focused other companies develop relations and roles within it is much more engineering focused but essentially the role is a mixture of both of the marketing side of things the engineering side of things the product side of things you wear many different hats and what it really entails is what it really can entail is you need to have very strong technical skills or an understanding of the technology that is being used because at the end of the day you are speaking to developers you are speaking to other engineers in how to best use your technology or product and as you know developers and engineers they can sniff out if you're like you know beating around the bush or not getting to the point quickly or you don't understand what you're talking about so you really need to feel comfortable and confident in what you're speaking about and how you reach out to other developers or engineers is through a variety of ways whether it be public speaking making coding tutorials uh documentation what else is it hosting workshops basically what you are doing is you are creating a community around your technology or product educating others to use it and get excited about it okay i feel like that's a lot but that's kind of what it is in a nutshell so i kind of break it down into three areas community content and education so that's kind of how you have to look at it is there are multiple aspects to it and i don't know that's what really excited me because it's very similar to what i do with tiffin tech where i educate you or share with you new technologies or resources i'm loving do some coding tutorials um but also create a community you know answer your questions like i'm doing now and connect with you all so i hope that brings some clarity into what a developer advocate does uh leave them in the comments if you have more questions around it or if you want to see a full day in the life vlog of what exactly i uh foreign [music] okay we are back different location um and we're back in actually toronto in canada we flew home last night and i thought i would finish the q a that i started yesterday while i get ready and um let's just okay the next question that i got asked quite a bit was how did you deal with the fear anxiety or any of that for your first internship or job as a software developer [music] sweetheart it's okay okay continue mug you gotta stop baby someone is being a crybaby because their dad just left and took harry to the vet it's okay we don't need to cry he's coming right back anyways if you hear a little bit of whimpering in the background he's okay he just um what a drama queen um how did i do deal with fear and anxiety i think for me one of the biggest things was finding a community or speaking about it because what i found was when you are alone dealing with this with this anxiety with this fear it can overcome you to the point where you almost like there were times i was like this isn't for me i need to not do this and that is very overwhelming so what i did was i just found people i could connect with and i didn't have those connections in tech i didn't know anyone else in tech when i started and that's really why i started to detect but okay we are back apologies uh mugsy ended up going with paul because he was just losing it anyways uh moral of the story is so find your community find people that you can trust to really have those candid conversations with okay this is a great question i'm currently learning how to code and want to know your thoughts about no code and low code should i keep learning on coding learning how to code that is a great question and i get that a lot too because there's of course so much more low code options coming up that a lot of people when they're starting out their career or learning to code they're like is there a point to it and my answer is this if you want to learn how to code or you're learning to code i think there is so much more value so much value you will get out of it that don't just look at it as will ai take over my job because the end of the day and it's going to take over a lot of jobs the skills you will develop learning to code can be so transferable into other parts of technology you can continue to grow like building blocks learning the fundamentals and then as you grow in your career you can specialize in ai in data science in so many different areas in the cloud that yes still learn how to code ai will take over parts of web developers jobs eventually they'll also take over a ton of other jobs and the key thing here is the skills you're learning today a will very much so be applicable in the future because tech really forces you to be a forever learner that you're constantly learning and growing so it's one of those things that yes still learn how to code knowing that it's just a forever learning process but it does get easier once you know the fundamentals okay another question is what advice could you give to someone who wants to be part of it but doesn't have a background instead specifically math that's a great question i think there's a stigma that you have to be a math expert to get into stem or coding in general and it's completely not true of course math is required depending on what way you specialize in or go in and and it's one of those things up for me anyways when i started my coding journey i really didn't know math like i was terrible at math but then as you learn to code and grow your technical skills skills your way of thinking changes and it's this whole new way of thinking and in turn i found myself slowly but surely becoming better at math or that way of thinking and it just organically happened so my advice to that is no matter where your skill set is at today don't base that on what you are or are not capable of you're continuing to grow continuing to learn and even if you're bad at math today in the future you might be really good at it or you might choose a role instead that doesn't require a lot of math which there's a ton of developers that don't use a lot of math there's a ton of roles that you don't need to do that so don't let that don't let that stop you i feel like i put stuff on my face and doesn't do any differences okay one more question let's wrap it up with a good question okay i got some questions about imposter syndrome which i'm going to answer in a separate video there's a lot of questions around making actions in the tech industry which once again for me was just like actually just reaching out to people i liked it i know that's very overused advice but you just have to rip the band-aid off and start doing it start reaching out to people that you want to connect with asking for a 15-minute call at their convenience and you'll be surprised just how quickly people how nice people are really they're just like yeah sure and especially if you have set questions you want to ask don't waste their time have a purpose for the call even if it's as simple as you want to learn more about what they're doing okay we are ready for the day gotta go do some work now and um i hope you enjoyed this q a it's a very candid relaxed q a so i don't know i just really wanted to a lot of you have been saying the comments to you really enjoyed my google chrome extension i made so if you want let me know what other ideas you want for projects i was thinking of doing my next coding project on here to be a uh like how to build your first portfolio for whatever you're in but like code your first portfolio um even if you're not going to a coding role necessarily but just showing back hey i made this really cool project so i think that would be the next project if you have any other questions leave them down in the comments make sure to hit that subscribe button and i will see [music] you soon [music]
