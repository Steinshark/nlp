hi everyone this episode is just to address three quick things before we move on to animating the character so the first thing i want to talk about is the character's toes currently he doesn't have any and initially i thought this would be okay but when i was working on the animation episodes uh i really didn't like the way that the walk and run animations looked without the ability to bend the character's toes so we're going to add that in now so let's select the amateur object and just press tab to go into edit mode and we can zoom in on the feature and just select the ends of these two foot bones and from side view just press zed uh to go into y frame mode so i can see what's going on a little better then press g and y to just move these bones back along the y- axis and then e to extrude them out to form the tone uh the toe bones now let's select each of these go over here and just rename this toes dol and the right toes will be called of course toes. r all right now selecting the mesh object let's go into the object data and we've got all of these vertex groups here uh each of these corresponding to one of the bones if you remember these were created automatically when we parented the mesh to the armature but now since we've uh just added these bones in now after having already parented it we're going to have to create the these tow vertx groups manually so just press the plus icon to add a new empty group over here double click to rename that let's call it toes. l make sure the name is exactly the same uh as the name of the bone otherwise it's not going to work and then let's add in a second group and call this toes. r all right quickly going to edit mode on the meshia let's just press crlr and add in a new loop cut somewhere over here just so we've got some more vertices to work with when we're assigning weights uh to the toe bones okay now let's select the ameter and press control tab or use this little menu here to go into pose mode and now we want to go into weight mode on the uh mesh so let's select the mesh and press control tab we're now in weight paint mode because we were in pose mode previously we can select the bones and you can see that the foot bone currently has all of the vertices of the foot assigned to it while the toe bone has got no vertices assigned to it so let's fix that let's select the foot bone here and then press tab to go into edit mode on the mesh and we're just going to select uh all of these vertices here and just remove them from foot footl so we can see now this only controls the uh back part of the foot and then selecting the toes we can go into edit mode again and assign those vertices to the toes so now uh we can waggle the toes a bit uh currently it's uh not deforming very nicely at this sort of split over here so what we can do if we go into edit mode again let's just select this edge loop that's alt right click uh to select the whole edge loop and then uh with the toes vertx group selected let's set the weight to 50% so just 0.5 and assign that there so that's turned green now and then selecting footl we can select the other edge loop and just assign that to footl with 50% so now if we try this out the deformation should be a little bit smoother it's not perfect but uh you can play with that if you want to get a little bit better but for our purposes i think that's going to be just fine so uh to undo the rotation we've made on the bones here let's just select them all and alt r okay so that was thing number one thing number two is specifically for those of you who want to import this character into the unity game engine uh there are a number of requirements for our rig to be considered humanoid and at the moment there's just one that we're not meeting and that is that the foot bone needs to be parented to the leg bone uh if you recall at the end of the last episode i made it so that the foot bone was parented to the ik bone which just means that we've got a handy way of controlling uh both the foot and the leg uh with just one bone so we don't have to switch between them so if you want your rig to be considered humanoid by the unity game engine we're going to have to relinquish that ability is select the bone here in edit mode shift right click to select the lower leg bone contrl p and parent connected same thing with the right leg over here all right so now if we want to rotate the foot we have to actually rotate the foot bone rotating the ik bone does nothing anymore now one thing i like to do in this case is to just uh go over here into the bone settings and turn off inherit rotation for this foot bone and for the one on the right as well this just means that when we move the leg around the foot remains uh completely flat or whatever angle we set it at that can just avoid some minor annoyance when we're animating but just to be clear if you're not importing this into unity then don't do any of that all right let's reset our bones alt r alt g and that concludes thing number two so thing number three is entirely optional uh it's just to add some color to the character i'd like to make the left side of the character blue and the right side of the character green this just makes it a little bit clearer when we're animating from the side which arm goes with which leg and so on so we're going to want to go onto the spanner here with the mesh selected in object mode and we're going to apply the mirror modifier and then going into edit mode let's just select everything on the left of the character or rather on the character's left uh so just grab all of these just selecting each thing with l and then in the materials let's create a new material and can set this uh contr if i said the left would be blue or green but it doesn't matter just assign that and then going to select the right side here okay create a new material for that set this to green and just assign it to those vertices all right we can maybe just make the rest of the body here and maybe some sort of red orangey red that's maybe a little bit intense and just tone it down ever so slightly something like that should be good yeah that looks nice so that is everything for this episode until next time cheers
