most seriously did they ever try this thing in the old days we could cram top of the line components into the tiniest of cases and still managed to cool them but sadly that is no longer the case because the pc industry has gone utterly bonkers to the point where you simply cannot fit a new gpu into a small form factor chassis let alone cool it that is until now hailing from japan this is the big ski 1080 external cooler an absolutely massive radiator that goes beside your computer not inside it and dick ski says that it can cool 2 000 watts worth of computer which here here there we go you know that we are going to be testing just like we're going to test your patience for my terrible segways to our sponsor build redux is building a pc not your wheelhouse no problem let the experts at build redux help you out just pick the parts and they'll do all the hard work check them out at the link down below i'm not sure where i got the idea but i thought it would be smaller while i've never seen one like this though the idea of an external water cooling system is nothing new and in fact back in the early 2000s external water coolers were more common than sticking radiators inside your case and most cases that had a water cooling capable sticker on the box simply had a couple of holes punched in the back with grommets that you could run tubes through by contrast modern cases are designed so that pretty much anywhere they leave space for a fan they also try to leave space for a radiator because well what else were they going to take up that room with three and a half inch hard drives so then you're probably asking yourself why in the modern era are we looking at an external water cooler and the answer is since nvidia's 3000 series we haven't really been able to pack the same tier of hardware into our small form factor pcs that amount of heat just i mean even if we could stick it in there isn't practical because even if we can keep temperatures on under control it's going to be super loud like sure the water block on this rtx 4090 does make it a lot smaller than it was out of the box but these things are so darn tall that in a lot of smaller cases it ends up interfering with the fans and i mean that's before we even stick a radiator on the things meaning it's basically impossible till you have one of these by using an external cooler we can still have a nice compact pc sitting on our desk while the heat and noise get chucked somewhere else so let's take a closer look at it bigski is one of those brands that i've heard of before but only in the context of super cheapo budget stuff on aliexpress so i've never really had a reason or an opportunity to look more closely at their products overall though i gotta say my first impressions are pretty good it's using what appears to be anodized aluminum pretty much anywhere it's got a very kind of industrial vibe to it but i like that function over form kind of design right like this grille is going to keep your fingers out sure but it is not going to interfere with airflow around front i've got what seems to be some kind of integrated flow distribution thing though it doesn't distribute water anywhere the fill line in out and i guess this is presumably fill now you were saying you wanted to do a leak test on it before we take it open i don't think that sounds very exciting but i can also see where you're coming from so why don't we do that real quick for the uninitiated we are pressurizing the system because if air can get out then probably water can also get out this looks really expensive uh this has a very hand-built vibe to it doesn't it on the one hand obviously these are all mass-produced parts i think i'm looking at a ddc pump over here with a custom top that's integrated into this distribution plate we've got what appear to be just off the shelf vix key rgb controllers these are clearly fans that are generally available outside of this system but the actual integration of all of these components looks very hand done and all of the individual parts of the enclosure are just either sheet aluminum or extrusion meaning that it's probably a pretty low volume product it goes in here pumps out to here the bottom of the radiator right that makes sense for bleeding the air bubbles out you want to push the water into the bottom so that the air comes out the top that goes way down to here and then up here and then out i feel like there could have been a more elegant way to do that me too one thing i really like about the design is that this radiator is designed with an extremely low density fin structure what that means is that it should perform very well with low rpm fans meaning i expect this to be extremely quiet we've got a simple adapter from 12 and 5 volt molex so it appears they expect you to simply run this inside your computer somehow to this four pin bad boy right here that screws on a little something like that it's great that they have this high security can't be accidentally unplugged connector here but if you were to trip over the cord nothing would prevent this from a pulling out and b yanking your computer off the desk my enthusiasm is a little dampened but if the performance is outstanding then i think i can get over it let's move on nice now let's take a look at the challenges we ran into trying to build a small form factor system with modern hardware will the 4090 fit this way no not only can we not fit a radiator up in the top we can't even fit fans and if we took the fans out of here and we just put fans on a radiator on the bottom there is absolutely no way that that would handle the heat load of a 4090 and our cpu which i'm assuming is crap i don't actually know i think there's a spec list on here wait also on the prompter bixke only accepts defects within 10 days of delivery yep that's cool a 10-day warranty anywho it's an i9 13900k in here with a strix z690i motherboard an 8 terabyte sabric rocket pcie gen 4 drive ek velocity 2 cpu and gpu blocks and an 850 watt silverstone modular power supply this is a top of the line rig and we're going to have links to all of these parts down below um alex i guess we're good i guess we're gonna have to just remove these fans then yeah they cannot live okay see you later fans gpu what the heck i think how is it even gonna close with the fans removed alex it's very close i see the power switch has not really been working so we want to plug that in okay so first of all the motherboard things come on little uh little daughter riser things so we're looking at that you know the external water cooling paradigm might feel inelegant compared to what people do these days but it's actually kind of smart like yeah you have to pay extra for the chassis for it but that's a one-time thing and it's the sort of thing that no matter how many times you change your cpu or gpu or your blocks here or even your case you can continue to use i can't say this makes me very comfortable do you see the angle this gpu is sitting at right now you can see the whole back of the chassis move oh wow we're just taking all that flex from the back and putting it on the bottom uh okay you said we could put fans in there but uh i want art i see what really it'll look yeah i don't want to be responsible for this david what no hold on wait what are you doing you're just gonna oh my god thank you so much for allowing that pleasure this is optional but i would strongly recommend using quick disconnects with any kind of external water cooling system just because it means that moving the system around is going to be a lot easier and you do it oh what seriously if we just power it up that might do it we're just going to power it on and power pour the worst part is i was about to suggest that too so oh no oh and if the power button works now that would be cool you closed up the side panels without testing it yeah bad gbs okay how much you want to bet i can plug in that thing behind the gpu i made the problem worse just just pull it out just pull it out i think i pulled the daughter board out oh geez this is going to be very difficult yeah i think we might have to pull the gps no no i got it i've got it oh it's probably turn on the power supply are you you're kidding me alex okay oh oh geez okay oh shoot here you go just never turn it off again why is it still spewing uh well remember how i was saying i didn't really understand their reservoir design yeah i still don't this is very wet i have no water in the system sir what no water that pump sounds so unhappy i'm sorry pumpy i'm i'm trying we are not getting any water to the system yet yeah this thing's bone dry right now i'm working on it i can feel water on my sandals toe we're gonna try something bold we're gonna crack a fitting oh there we go whoa whoa hey oh how you doing hey your computer might get water soon okay so there's water making to the computer now i don't see any yet uh for how much they're charging for this thing i can't say i'm especially impressed oh the computer set off excellent oh crap uh okay the power button works uh okay i'm going i'm going it's for testing come on come on come on do we have water yeah water's in the gpu oh heck yeah yeah it was going to be so much happier now jacob needs more water look david i am working on the additional water oh it posted yes yeah yes we successfully computer build uh okay uh power down this actually seems to be pretty effective where's all the water going where is all the water going david okay all right wait okay hit it again never mind did i lose more than i actually put in that time absolutely what on earth oh the babies oh seriously ah all that progress unprogressed i'm legitimately concerned we're going to kill this with how much water is going out of this and into all of the electronics it had it coming alex you know it is a question that we used to find ourselves asking more than we do now but it still comes up did they ever try this thing and like your fill indicator will always be full because the pumps pumping the water through it and out thumb to kind of control the acid reflux this poor computer is suffering from this deserve some babies too i'm changing the description of our channel to we build bad computers so you don't have to wait are you stuffing babies in there why are you doing that i want to get one in the fan no or i can just oh no you can't do that okay recently i said there's no such thing as a bad product just a bad price i attend entirely corrected oh okay stop putting babies in the computer okay we've got a bubble here but the trick is that we need to fill it like it's pretty clear that this is a do not buy big ski you aren't making a great first impression here i gotta say okay good now lower that and i'll get this above you come on bubbles that's working the issue that is that moving the bubbles around doesn't help us we have to get them replaced with water and we can't put more water into the system because there's no way to fill the reservoir directly this would take hours and hours and hours to fill a system fail big ski it's so freaking loud meaning i expect this to be extremely quiet i am outraged that i spent this much money on this thing from a content point of view i'm fine with it because this is hilarious but if i bought this thing what is it 700 us dollars 690. oh no i bet alex and i could design a better this in like an afternoon yeah we would try it once and be like wow that was the worst water cooling experience we've had in uh weeks at least we wouldn't need to because we put a reservoir in the bloody thing so let's have a look at the flow path in here and figure out why this isn't working so here's where we're filling this goes into the reservoir right but you can see see this this gluganation effect here i think the issue is that there's just there's not enough room for the air to travel up this if this was like a big fat like three quarter inch tube or something like that it might be all right but this right angle fitting here is absolutely killing it you can see here that even though the reservoir theoretically keeps bubbles from getting to the inlet of the pump right they should all rise to the top and then be replaced by this this fill here theoretically i see what's going on but in practice it's not able to clear the bubbles from the impeller so it's creating this like pressure on the other side of the pump that then shoots this water back up the fill port also the inlet for the reservoir is so close to the inlet for the pump that it actually sucks the bubbles even though they should float yeah should we try to fix their design yeah alex got any stop fittings uh yes what's up time hi don't worry what we're doing is fine i've seen worse although the babies are marginally concerning uh where does this go it goes where tynan's finger is because there's nothing going to be in there yeah okay so you cut it like i'm thinking like here okay don't cut my finger and then i'm gonna get in there immediately okay um this plate goes back there okay how's our cpu attempts doing alex 79 degrees 79 degrees okay wait for it i can fix that watch out for the baby no i'm not watching out for the baby they didn't even put any loctite on these stupid pass-throughs so they just spin freely as you're trying to tighten things okay i'm powering up the pump okay so now our bubbles go to the filter go to the fill port you're welcome big ski the fact that that's what it took to fix their design that's not on us that's on them the reason i could think that they would use that is because i don't know if we're going to be able to close this panel now that we've moved it to the right spot that's a really tight run there oh yeah we can't yeah oh yeah how are we how are we doing does it work 31 degrees right now nice nice also alex your concerns about not having fan control very valid these are spinning at like 3 000 rpm maybe more it looks like something we would have made no you take that back we would have made it better than this we're able to dispel 313 watts cool you can do that with a 360 rad yeah almost 40k in cinemas it's pretty good yeah i mean it's gonna keep your water temps down near ambient once once you fill it it should work you just can't ever put it back together again just like this segue to our sponsor guardio guardio is a browser extension designed to help protect you as you browse online it seems everyone in

enjoyed this video what did i want to throw to i want a third of the fastest xbox a small form factor build that was actually good and self-contained yes all right sure they can watch that but also watch the car radiator one that has the same chaotic energy this is great this is all the additional equipment alex was expecting to use while we tested the 2000 watt capacity claims won't be needing that i wouldn't hook that thing up to anything
