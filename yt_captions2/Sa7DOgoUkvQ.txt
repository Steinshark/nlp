ladies and gentlemen be honest with yourselves you like cheater content you enjoy cheater content in chess when a person is going into a game trying to do their best and they run into somebody who's playing not legitimately you like it when i play against cheaters you like it when i make cheaters play against cheaters you like the whole thing well in today's video six six cheaters get banned six cheaters this video concept came to me by a subscriber who sent me a game and then fell down a rabbit hole now i did it a little bit differently the subscriber played a cheater that cheater played a cheater that cheater played a cheater that cheater also played a cheater and so on and so on and so on enjoy the video uh here we go i got nothing else to say this is a very very funny video um every cheater has a different strategy we're gonna jump into them we're gonna analyze them they're very very funny this very first game as you can see subscriber with the black pieces excuse me uh was uh we'll look at it from the subscribers perspective started the game thought they were you know playing a trumpowski opening normal stuff d5 e5 jumped into the center by the way a little bit better to go back to the seven here and try to play for c5 knight e4 is not a terrible move the cheating begins in my opinion uh right around the early stages subscriber plays the move bishop d7 obviously not a great move but the idea of this uh is the fact that um after 94 de for bishop e4 there is queen b4 check so it's very natural to take with the knight because you want to preserve the bishop and miss queen before that was black's idea but white does this giving up the bishop which is weird and then playing queen g4 and then and only then managing to take the pawn successfully all right uh this first cheater uh then completely completely neutralizes the counter play of the position by simply capturing on c5 uh and then when black does not take the pawn back right away the rook arrives completely cutting the circulation of the black position and you know white is uh white is in good shape now again every single move when a person is cheating happens between uh this one of the giveaways is a consistent time usage so white plays this move in six seconds this move in seven seconds this move in seven seconds this move in five seconds uh this move in seven seconds six seven seconds eight seconds seven seconds you see what i'm saying so white is falling into that trap of playing every single move in seven seconds in seven seconds in another seven seconds in six seconds and the reason for that is some cheaters are well almost they're all stupid but some of them like have a phone right and so they see a move played and they put it in their phone and then there's a response and then they go back and then you know they make their next move and oh that that one took 12 seconds and it was you know it was it was not the top engine move it was maybe the third engine move they're like well i'm not gonna you know they they think they're very clever um and this cheater just absolutely mowed down this this poor subscriber every move six seconds couple of them were 12 but six five six and a cleared house promoted a second queen and you know um by the way you know what's funny um any normal person here with two queens goes and gives checks right like anybody who promotes two queens of course just gives a check but the move h4 here is also made in six the person playing white has absolutely no idea what they're doing this and this both lead to checkmate in six so they are both the top move of the engine uh and white plays h4 which is just like a hilarious like nobody on the planet does not play queen g8 here like i would play queen g8 because it's a check and you force the king out and you're probably i mean it's just very funny so this person uh was a cheater now how would this person do in a game where they also had to play a cheater both of these people were banned right so let's see um it was a regular king spawn game all right h6 uh trying to stop knight g5 and now after castle's black plays the move g5 okay so black volunteers themselves for a bad position you're going to see in this video how a couple of these cheaters in the opening stage because we don't actually know how good the cheater is like if the cheater is rated 700 elo they don't actually know how to veil that they are not cheating because you just 700 is a beginner okay uh but if the cheater is like 2 000 but they're cheating then that's like very that's tough because the 2000 will know when to throw the game a little bit right and of course we're also looking at uh the time usage so here white is castled and black does this there's a reason why white does not develop another piece when black is sacrificing development for very very unprincipled play the way to punish unprincipled play is to open up the center even if you've already made multiple pawn moves now you will notice black does not take on d4 black tries to close the center tries to make it locked okay now white plays d5 okay shoving the knight back and now knight c3 but now black plays rook g8 and knight g6 and actually it's a closed position and computers don't really understand close positions that well they will give advantages but right so a4 ya4 now because it's the you know it's one of the top lines of the computer like no beginner here plays a4 i mean it's just a you know a4 is basically like i'm taking space over here and i'm preventing a6b5 yeah a4 is top computer move so played by white uh black now plays knight f4 the third computer move now white plays h3 okay now h3 gives back some advantage um and and again every one of these cheaters could be playing slightly differently they could be playing uh you know oh i'm gonna throw in a move of my own right so now black plays a6 second line of the computer uh now we have knight d2 um which uh tries to get out of the way we have knight to h5 and also the funniest moment in cheater games is when they realize they're being cheated against because imagine you're cheating and you're actively looking at a cheating like at a stockfish and your opponent is playing all the best moves so this is now the top move of the computer uh taking is the third move of the computer uh and now uh and now g4 is the second line of the computer uh so everybody knows that the best way to respond to being attacked on the side of the board is to just play b4 complete i love that when the person the cheater playing with white every time they tried to make a move on their own they lost the game immediately okay black of course takes now white plays g3 what people don't realize is they're like okay i'm gonna throw in a move of my own right now just to throw chess.com off yeah now queen h4 and uh yeah h2 check and rook takes g3 you tried it was good you tried your best uh now of course white is completely lost queen h3 attacks the knight now queen f1 uh but now white starts cheating okay so now like any normal human here who obviously doesn't know how to play chess just loses with white very quickly what the computer does with white is it finds a queen trade and now keeps the game going a little bit all right so black is completely winning but it's going to take a little bit of time by the way what do we teach beginners when you're at material trade of course no rook h4 why rook h4 top engine move f5 top engine move you will notice by the way that black has a ton of time why because black is using a bot black is not transferring moves uh i think black is just all their moves are coming in one second look at this half a second or one second black is look at black's time is just not going down black is using a bot they are using some sort of you know thing that automatically plays moves um look at this black is just not thinking at all like how is black finding the top computer move in one second black stripes are just not going down at all rook a5 oh black she's not thinking look at this is insane black slowly out maneuvering white bishop c6 knight f4 look at this the rook is pinned so it doesn't even need to be taken bishop is just not taking the rook he's just not taking the rook bishop d4 he's still not taking the rook in in one second bishop f2 he doesn't even take the rook he's just refusing to take it look at this finally no he still doesn't take it rook g8 because he has this and now it's force made black played 55 moves in this game in 56 seconds insane right yeah okay so how can a person like that run into someone that they're going to lose to say hello cheater number three has entered the arena or maybe they won't you know maybe white just has a bot that's unbeatable um and i do think that the person playing with white uh i don't think they lost the game i think their bot was was very good now this person who has just entered the arena cheater number three this person would deliberately get losing positions in the opening what i mean by that is this so this strategy worked against many people just losing material that's what this is very funny like i told you every cheater is a bit of an idiot so they think they're very clever they're like i'm gonna sack a bishop on move three and then i'm gonna cheat the rest of the game and nobody will ever catch me well the problem is when you play somebody who's botting uh like white you know like knight e5 i mean like what what even is this um anyway since white is botting uh black is by the way playing all top moves like h5 you know c5 like these are all also computer moves but because black sacrificed way too much material early in the game they're just not going to be able to win look at this armada right white plays f4 in one second top computer move with the idea of anchoring everything and rook is on f1 king is on f8 so f5 in the future is going to be a good move like you know the top computer move here for black it's not developing any piece the top engine move here for black is the move d3 losing the pawn four different ways but again cheaters are morons like they have no idea what they're nobody plays d3 why would you play d3 white can't take this because you would get pinned to what even is d3 and then and then black just proceeds like nothing okay bishop c6 or okay seven of course now white plays d4 best move now black plays rook c7 best move bishop by four best move uh b5 second bet best move now everybody knows that when your bishop is attacked on one side of the board rather than retreating the bishop to any of these two safe squares you play f5 in one second on the complete opposite side of the board sacrificing your bishop completely because you've evaluated in one second time that this attack is strong i mean i mean it's just so funny watching this uh black plays knight c6 by the way uh black's best move ef5 or ba yeah knight c6 is uh not it it's one of them but it's not it white now disregards the capture in the center shreds open the position black plays knight g4 the best move hitting this uh just leaving the knight here now both sides are just leaving the knight there completely leaving the night there by the way now folks can i ask you a question would you rather move your king here where there are no obvious checks because rook c2 is not possible or king h1 susceptible to a monster discovered attack of course you would spend one sec less than one sec he played this move without losing a second of time and the reason is this is plus 10 and king f2 is plus four so he plays king h1 allows a discover check because he can block with the bishop queen f6 and now rook f4 hitting the queen and oh my god this is so stupid these people are and now white is obviously gonna lose the bishop but check here and uh is a rook up and yeah unfortunately white's bot was just simply too strong uh and uh cheater number two uh was unable to be slain however cheater numbers three cheater number three strategy was working against other people like cheater number four i am not making this up like this just went on and on and on all right so cheater number three against cheetah number four king's gambit okay knight f3 g5 one of the most aggressive responses to the king's gambit where white plays uh you know that like white for example here can play bishop c4 which is one of the crazy gambits there is also like knight g5 um it's called the algaier gambit and then you can play like this and this uh what white again white is trying to throw off the you know the the the the scent of the cheating in the opening so white plays h5 which is a horrible move and then white hangs the knight just completely hangs the night just queen e5 black is now up upon and a knight again remember what white doesn't know is that their opponent is also cheating so white is like all right terrific time to cheat d4 all right the only thing that white has going for him in this position is more development okay and the fact that he's cheating so queen a5 pins the knight to the king all right queen a5 is of course one of the top computer moves white now plays bishop d2 and black plays bishop before now any human being on the planet here plays the move a3 why because after this this you think i have this and this and if the queen goes to b6 you think i have d5 okay that's what you think yeah well he's cheating so he plays the best move which is e5 um now this is where it gets really goofy so like i told you every cheater has a strategy white strategy is sack in the opening and then win black strategy in this game is don't always play the top engine move any human on the planet sees the knight is hanging this is not saved this is not safe this is safe that's just the best move and it's safe however black is an idiot okay black is cheating like black doesn't black doesn't know that so black is like i'm not gonna play the top engine move i'm gonna play the second best move knight c6 is the second move of the engine just losing a knight just completely losing a knight like a free night but nobody even knows that because they're probably like 200 elo and white does not play this why does white not play that because this is the second move of the engine so both players make completely illogical moves completely because they're just trying to not play the top computer line what does black play here loses the knight again what what are they doing oh my goodness i'm gonna have an aneurysm this is so ridiculous and now black cat so so now black is castling now white plays 92 undeveloping the knight trying to trade queen f5 you kick this out but the idea was never to move the bishop because now hey oh my god g takes f3 any normal person on the planet here f3 take take right right that's what take take no the top engine move d what the top computer move for white is obviously to move the bit take the the top computer move for black is ignore the pawns and play queen e4 now white defends the rook by moving the king voluntarily i mean this is the stupidest thing i've ever seen losing the bishop oh but okay you lost the bishop but you can take this of course what the do you know what knight f4 threatens knight f4 threatens rookie one trapping the queen so if black plays bishop d6 white wins the queen because it's trapped so black plays knight takes d4 sacrificing the knight so the queen can escape to c6 and take on f6 this fork has just existed and do you know what the top computer move is here for white g5 what the f what what now white takes on d4 this is so ridiculous okay black's bishop is hanging so obviously black has to move it to d6 right in this position black misreads what the computer is saying the computer is saying bishop d6 you know what the computer you know what the cheater plays this completely losing the bishop she takes b4 is a free bishop white plays rook g1 all right so both sides and now black plays bishop d6 because we wait oh my god i messed that up now white plays queen f6 okay trying to trade queens and attack the king e5 the queen is trapped bishop and is now up in exchange so white is now lost okay why does losing and now we have an end game here's the thing though the cheaters start realizing wait a minute time is part of the game all right so white tries to create this barrier but black is playing you know five seconds six seconds every move 10 seconds blah blah blah look at this we almost had a repetition they repeated now black plays a6 because the computer doesn't want to repeat time is going all right looks like white is making a big comeback here but there's nothing black is down to two minutes and suddenly white just turns on the jets and despite being in it and by the way you can't take this because of bishop e5 a black doesn't know that though which is you know white black play king of seven uh now king g8 dancing around the pawn now this and again uh at this point white starts playing on his own why does white start playing on his own because he hangs a knight immediately like you can tell that white is completely playing on his own and black needed 11 9 seconds to take on h7 not not 11. and now you know again white is like oh my god he only has a minute now go go go go go go and black is cheating so black doesn't know how to play chess and black is completely winning by the end of this game but unfortunately he loses on time he loses on time and uh you'll notice that here black had like 10 seconds to secure a drug here black needed to take both pawns but he doesn't black panics starts repeating moves and uh cheater three defeats cheater for now if you thought that was the end of the video no i've got two more for you you're five now cheater five was a tank cheater five had one of the higher ratings and was playing cutting edge mainline openings this is a fried liver okay like a mainline fried liver the bishop is under attack now white gives a check on b5 this cheater from greece was a was a tank i mean uh now queenie 2 top engine move bishop e7 now knight c3 top engine move and after c6 you take take and castle and hear black plays castles as well now again we're in some wild theory uh white has played a fried liver this has all been played before um and the computers don't know theory as much as you know theory books no theory so white takes the pawn in b7 and is now up two pawns black plays rook c8 the top move of the computer now white undevelops the knight back to f3 e4 is a really juicy move but black is not trying to play all top moves black is trying to play this move so knight d4 now white plays knight takes d4 e takes d4 and knight out to b5 okay so that is why instead of knight d4 you're supposed to play e4 but these people don't know anything okay these people are just like i'm done making the top engine move so now i'm going to play you know this other move rook b8 queen c6 and what's funny is that this should be a draw rook c8 queen b7 rook b8 queen c6 rook c8 now it's up to white so if white wants to repeat he will repeat but he's cheating so he plays here the problem with that move is that there is d3 so it's a completely equal position and if you take on d3 why uh white is in trouble because you can't move anything everything is just paralyzed even though your two pawns up so something very funny here happens d3 okay queen a7 dc queen e3 they are both cheating 100 of this game so both of these players unstoppable force immovable object black plays knight d5 white moves his queen out of the way and in this position black who has cheated the entire game hangs their queen why does black hang their queen because the top computer move here is queen d7 attacking the knight and developing the other rook behind the queen and black mouse slips their queen and resigns and you will notice it still took quite four seconds to take it both players cheated for 20 moves and black instead of playing queen d7 and continuing this cheating fiesta hangs their queen either by mouse lip or i don't know by dyslexia because they think a c looks like a d i don't know you can't script this stuff folks i mean like this is just ridiculous like i mean but both players cheat and then one of them is like oh i'm supposed to oh no and they resign and that brings me to our final game of the day between cheater five and cheater six and this just kept going all right cheater five like i said big tank d4 knight f6 now uh no human on earth plays ed5 here it's either e5 or bishop g5 uh and uh if you're cheating you will play because again the computer doesn't know any openings now both sides develop all good bishop g4 now knight b5 gets the bishop uh black says i don't care if you get my bishop and white says i never wanted your bishop in the come on come on how are you gonna play knight b5 and then not take the bishop and then you attack c7 black defense c7 now white do you know what the top computer move is here for white it's not h3 it's not rookie one it's voluntarily leaving the black and rerouting i mean this is just ridiculous but now both of these players are cheating the whole game knight e3 top engine move bishop h5 top engine move knight f5 top engine move knight e6 top engine move bishop in a little bit i think it's the second computer move this is the best move now knight g5 applying pressure to f3 bishop takes f3 now black kicks out white's bishop white retreats now black retreats the bishop so it cannot be taken h4 is an attack now we trade and in this position of course queen takes f3 right auto you don't even think about it but every cheater tries to throw off the fair play team and in this position instead of queen f3 white plays the second move of the computer and keep in mind that black is cheating way more than white so what does black do continue to cheat at the top engine line knight e3 queen d7 one of the top moves a4 a4 this is how white is trying to throw black off h5 top engine move queen c2 king h7 defending the pawn now queen d1 back bishop h6 yeah black unfortunately not taking their foot off the gas you know the best move is here for black sliding the knight next to the king to open up the rook to open up the queen and to maybe play knight f5 now black plays a6 stopping white's advance now black plays rookie seven preparing to double and now black voluntarily gives away the bishop for the knight and now plays knight f5 and we have this and rookie 8 total dominance over the e-file opportunities to get in here and uh slowly but surely g5 the white position completely falls apart black is like the terminate look look e3 are you what this dude finds a way into the white position the second that white's rook went here 93 is a fork but then it would be taken so why not put the rook there the point is if you guard this pawn i get in i'm now in the position you will never get it you will never get rid of me so rook to e3 are you joking this is what happens when a cheater plays a cheater but one of the cheaters is cheating more than the cheater fe393 that's it and the knight can go to the corner and escape then i can go this way and escape you will never ever trap my knight and if you try h4 king h5 g4 and black like the terminator walks down white completely nothing you can do nothing you can do with my pawns and my knight is a shield for the king and the pawn there it is and white in dangerous shape gets walked down and brutally checkmated and uh yeah this last cheater who won with black and played essentially a 100 flawless game got a 97 cap score with zero inaccuracies zero mistakes zero blunders zero misses and um yeah rookie three was just unbelievable i mean this is this is oh man what a rabbit hole we started from this poor innocent subscriber of mine who was cheated against who played a cheater who played a cheater who played a cheater who played a cheater who played the final boss terminator of cheaters that played 64 top engine moves in one game i hope you enjoyed the video and if you're watching this on april 8th tomorrow is the world championship maybe you're watching this a year into the future but if you're lucky enough to catch this in the first 24 hours it comes out this is the last video i will be making before the world championship begins tomorrow get out of here
