okay tell me if this sounds familiar you found a great story you made a solid plan and went out to shoot the thing then you wrapped and headed home feeling like everything was right in the world but then that night you start pulling cards out of your cameras and realize that you're not really sure what to do next obviously you have to back things up every filmmaker knows that but the best professional workflow isn't all that obvious maybe when you're just dealing with a couple of cards things aren't so bad but as you progress in your film making career and start taking on bigger and bigger projects trust me you absolutely need to have an ironclad system in place for data wrangling or you're going to get yourself in trouble like right now i'm working on a big budget tv series and we're shooting with dozens of cameras every day which means an insane amount of cards to back up i mean there's an entire office in this building that's only dedicated to media management which i'll show you in a second and that should tell you just how important it is in the film making process and after a quick scan of youtube while researching this video i realize that there isn't all that much information out there on how to do this the right way so let's fix that the good news is that it's not really complicated to get a bulletproof backup system in place but you do need to start with the right foundations so in this video i'm going to show you how we manage media on a large production like the one i'm shooting now and then also show you a more scaled down version of that same system that's a little bit more realistic for smaller teams by the end you're going to have a solid backup pipeline from card to hard drive all the way through to your editing program that you can apply to your own shoots to make sure you stay organized while also never worrying about losing footage ever again and for anyone who's been following along the last couple of months we finally wra this show after 110 days in the field so this is going to be my last post from up here in the arctic meaning that if all goes to plan i'll finally be home next week so thanks for sticking with me through all the rough audio bad lighting and increasingly scruffy physical appearance for the last few months and now let's get right into the video okay so to start off i am in the media management room of the show i'm working on right now with hank who is our dit hank what well first off what is a dit dit can be multiple different things but the main job as a dit media manager will be to get cards from production and offload them so they're backed up and ready for post production um to begin their workflow so literally it means digital imaging tech right and it can be you know it can be anything from doing onset coloring to backing up media but generally in the world we don't have onset colorist so pretty much just refers to someone who's handling all the backups on this show how many cards would you see on a a big day well on the show we can we have about 30 cameras in our system um so on a full day of shooting we could see up to 11 cameras come in with multiple cards per camera uh so we're looking at upwards of 20 to 30 cards uh on the days that are the heaviest yeah so 30 cards a day if you were one man banding it without a dit you could be sitting there for i mean it takes you almost all day yeah just to get stuff backed up most normal people myself included when i'm not on like a $10 million show and there is no dit i'm not doing anything like this but this is an example of what things can be when you sort of balloon up to a certain level right off the bat i see you're running a program here shotput pro basically what shot put's doing is it's copying the footage onto multiple hard drives at once and then it's also giving you a report at the end to tell you whether or not there were any issues so it'll just say basically yes this was copied identically two or three or however many times you ask it to and when you're dealing with shows with massive budgets like this where you know there's insurance policies in place for losing footage you really can't take any chances and you're you know 30 cards a day for 100 plus days straight me personally do i use shotput pro every day when i've shot two or three cards probably not should i probably yes but it does take longer it's just if you have a high stake scenario where what you're shooting absolutely cannot be lost and you need to be 100% certain that what you copied is exactly what's going on to the drive then shop puts maybe a way to go is that a helicopter yeah helicopter coming in stand by so if you were a solo operator shooter mhm what could you do to create a good backup system if you don't have a massive post production department behind you a solo shooter you just want to make sure that you are organized and that you have a system in place once you're done shooting for the day you take your cards and it's the first thing you do you don't go to bed you don't wait till the next morning you offload and back up your cards you start with project so whatever you're shooting and then you go by date and then you go by camera and if you have an audio you know you put that drone and so on you just have everything for your cameras and you just go day by day backing up footage each day each night after every shoot um so that nothing fes up and that you don't shoot over cards basically you want to have everything divided by day camera and card number and how many times does a normal person need to back up having something backed up at least two times is a good practice three times is best practice and then last like for a lot of people out there they probably have never heard of the position of dit before um but this is like a paying job on large crews so how did you how did you get into this and sort of what opportunities are out there yeah so i think media managing is a great way for people to start to get into camera department you can make a career out of this you could make it your fulltime you could do it for tv shows for for movies for long periods of time and their ds who make and media managers who make good money you are constantly interacting with the camera department and if you want if you want a good way to get your foot in the door that maybe is a little bit higher than a pa then this would be a good opportunity it's pretty simple if you're an organized person it doesn't take a lot of kit to get into a lot of times they just ask you have a laptop and the software and that production will provide um hard drives and so your job is just to be organized and to make sure these things are backed up so i think the threshold of getting into it is pretty easy and uh yeah that's important and you need to pay attention though right cuz if there's technical problems happening through the footage if there's a dit onset it's not no longer really the dp's responsibility to notice these things you have to see that they're happening and tell us so that we can correct how could people go about trying to get a gig as a dit i think your best opportunity would be to find established assistant camera uh cuz a lot of the time in the role of in documentary a lot of times you won't they won't have they won't be budget for just a medium manager so if you're an ac get good at medium managing because crews are so small you want to be multi-functional you want to have you want to be able to do multiple different things so i'd say if you're already interested in camera stuff make sure you know how to back up and make sure you tell whoever's hiring you that you're interested in it that you can do it and that people are more likely to bring you on board so don't sleep on ditting um yeah a lot of opportunities out there especially on bigger budget stuff and it can be a great way to get on those big sets you get paid and it's an amazing network opportunity like there's been probably like a dozen times already on this show where we've been stretched in in the camera department and we've just like thrown a camera at hanon like shoot this uh so you are getting shooting time as well and who knows maybe even a camera operator credit by the end you never know you never know okay so that's sort of a big perspective on how you do things at a really really big level um but now i'll show you how i do things on a more sort of realistic level and how you can incorporate some of these ideas to create a bulletproof backup workflow for most normal runin gun solo shooters okay so we just saw what a really high-end setup would look like uh talking to hank but for most of you that's probably not realistic um even for me myself on my own projects i don't have anything like that kind of workflow so let's take a second we're back in my room bit dingy bit dark but uh we'll make do still up here in the arctic it's day 105 today so we're just doing what we can to get through it but a more realistic workflow for a oneman band or maybe a really small crew might look something like this the very first thing i do is get some sort of container it can be anything i'm going to use these little tiny cereal bowls you can use a tupperware container it could be an envelope it could even just be a big box of tape but you really want a a super clear way to identify where the cards for ingest is and when when you've already finished something so an in and an out pile so the very first thing i'm going to do is get a bit of gaff tape and put some in-n-out labels on these bowls um it might sound really obvious but at least if you do it this way there can be no mistaking you know it might be really late at night maybe you' been shooting all day and it's like 2:00 in the morning and you're doing these backups and you don't want there to be any doubt in your mind which ones are to be ingested and which ones are good to be formatted okay so we've got our super high-tech in-n-out bowls the next thing i'm going to do is take all of the shot media and just dump it in and i'm already making kind of a mistake here because best practices would be to label these cards like as soon as you shoot them into take them out of the camera put a little piece of paper tape on them and say what camera and what card number they are cuz you know right now i've got three fx3 cards here that aren't labeled and i'm going to have to go in and check each one and make sure that i have the right order so that i know which one is the first second and third shot cards just start out on the right foot and label them when they come out of the camera and you won't have this problem all the shot media goes in here and then the very next step is to plug in our hard drives and get a really solid fold structure kind of like hank talked about and we'll set that up here so that you see what it looks like so the very first thing i do when dealing with a completely blank hard drive like this is just make one root folder for the project that everything else is going to go into maybe this is the only project on this hard drive and you don't need to do this maybe it's obvious you don't need to name it but it's best practice just make a folder for uh the new project and then inside it we're going to put all of our individual cards so when naming a folder there's no there's no standard like there's no rule book that you have to follow but almost every editor i've ever worked with wants to know a couple basic pieces of information they want to know the date the camera and the card and so that's all the information that i'm going to put into each folder so i'm going to start with the date and i'm going to do it out long form so i'm going to do november 23rd 2023 there's the date and then the first card i'm going to ingest is from the fx3 which which in this uh hypothetical scenario is the aam so i'll do aam some people like to type out the name of the camera itself i do a cam bcam ccam if you are running on shoots with a lot of different types of cameras maybe it's easier to call this fx3 and the next one fx9 and the next one a7 s3 or whatever uh either one will work but just say what camera this is coming from and then the card number and that's it that's the basic folder structure if you're on a mac computer it's really easy and finder to open up different tabs and i find this makes the whole process a lot easier i'd open up a tab for each of the hard drives and then a tab for the media that you're ingesting and so in this case i'm going to go to this fx3 card i'm going to grab the clips which in this case are still photos but this just an example you get the point grab the clips and i'm going to put them into the the right folder and then i'm going to repeat when this card's done it's going to go over here into the out and then i'm just going to move through the cards one by one by one until everything is backed up you saw earlier on hank's setup he had like an entire rack of card readers and if you're dealing with you know 30 40 cards every day then you definitely want to be able to ingest more than one at once so in general just get the best card reader that you can ideally one that connects with usbc or thunderbolt so that you get the best transfer speeds use fast hard drives as well that's going to make this whole process go faster so now we'll jump forward a little bit to a time when all the cards have been copied and you can see i've got five cards ingested three from the a cam and two from the bcam um then i'm just going to take this entire project and commit heresy again and just drag and drop it to clone it i know this might make some people nervous do what you feel is right for the project you're working on to me the savings and time is worth it and i've never had a problem so we're just getting through this example quickly but use shotput pro if you want or get mad at me in the comments whatever makes you feel better okay so we've cloned the first hard drive to the second hard drive now just as one layer of added security i'm going to click get info on both of these drives and then compare the amount of data used to make sure that they are more or less the same they're slightly off but it looks like 900 bytes or something like that which is negligible in my experience it means nothing so for my standards this is a clean copy this is where a program like shopwood comes in handy because it's going to give you a detailed report and give you 100% certainty yes this is all copied over but it's up to you whether that amount of extra time is is worth that or not for me this is enough so it's cloned um you're going to do this every single day uh at the end end of the day before you go to bed and it might be really tempting to put it off and say i'm going to wait until tomorrow to do it but this is always a bad idea just get the data backed up get it copied twice and then you can have peace of mind and there's no way anything's going to go wrong after that okay so that's it a really simple but effective backup workflow you saw earlier it can be much more complicated like with hank hole setup but it doesn't have to be that complicated you just need to get the relevant information down and you need to stay organized so learning how to do this early on in your career is a huge benefit both because it's going to minimize your chances of losing footage and because it's going to make editors happy when they get hard drives from you but beyond that there are work opportunities here like if you're earlier on in your career and you can use shotput and you can handle professional backup workflows then that's something that's going to make you easier to hire or you could get a job like hank explained earlier as a dedicated media manager on big sets and that's going to get you exposed ure to large productions and introduce you to dps and directors who could maybe go on to hire you later and maybe bump you up to camera operator and just generally expand your network so there's a million reasons why learning backup workflows is a good idea they don't have to be complicated but they do need to be consistent see [music] you
