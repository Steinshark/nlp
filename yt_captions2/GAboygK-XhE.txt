hey what's up guys minus tech tips here footwear love it or hate it everyone's wearing it footwear has more daily active users than facebook twitter reddit and wechat combined so when a long time rival gets to market before me youtube's foremost apparel salesman you know that i'm going to be first in line to check it out so i've had these for about a week and i gotta say marquez you more than anyone know that it takes courage to change an industry courage and i gotta respect bold design decisions i mean black and red i wouldn't have done it but it's undeniably you and that is one of the coolest things about making clothes bringing a bit of yourself into the world i do feel like we're too close for me to lie to you though man i'm a little confused by the way that you've constructed this sandal i've never made footwear myself but i have made hats available at lttstore.com and what is a sandal if not the hat of the foot so i feel well qualified to provide you not only with praise for what i feel you've done right but also valuable feedback from my lab on what you can do to improve your spiffy new kicks that's right i can spend six figures on a robot too you know [music] i mean not my own money of course thankfully the knuckle draggers at dbrand who have dogged me for years making my devices more wrapped and my life more worse have agreed to open their purse strings yet again to give the community what they want prettier devices and the real story of the mkbhd x adams 251. give them hell boys the 251 is with the kids and i guess trendier adults would refer to as a high top sandal and is reminiscent of iconic designs like the air jordan ones the upper is made of recycled mesh and synthetic leather and the sole is made of rubber using a zero waste injection molding process kudos for aiming for sustainability embroidered on the heel is the number 251 a reference to the length of young mkbhd's first video it definitely lacks some creature comforts compared to what i'm used to i mean laces what is this rome it definitely screams marquez roundly and i've got to imagine that that's what his fans want let's move on to our lab tests though knowing marquez's reputation as the best tech reviewer on the planet we felt it prudent to focus on the tech of the 251s everything from the tops to the underbunds to the all-important tips first up is what we call don deficiency that's how fast you can put on or remove the sandal honestly speaking we're off to a pretty rough start here i alluded to this before for but the laces slow you down immensely and while it doesn't look that bad in a vacuum as soon as we add the leading market competitor to our chart it's clear that if time is of any importance to you this is the wrong sample next up is our swampiness test we took a heavily moistened sock and placed it inside the sandal recording the time to reach a dry state and unfortunately this is another bad showing for the pretending to be located in nyc high tops at this rate of swamp dissipation any puddle mishap could easily lead to wrinkly toe syndrome at best or trench foot at worst don't google that both of these results indicate a low beach compatibility factor and here's the thing i don't like sand it's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere but if i have to go to the beach then i want to make sure that i can efficiently swap between land and sea without bringing home half a pound of unrefined silicon and unfortunately the 251s fail here in a really big way but there's still room for them to impress to evaluate thermal performance we mounted one of our samples on our 13900k test bench and ran both cinebench and msi combustor for 30 minutes measuring the resulting temperatures and clock speed unfortunately compared to our nhd-15 reference heatsink the 251s represent a very poor value for cpu cooling but just because it can't cool a cpu doesn't mean it couldn't cool a foot so we devised a test to find out but the results were again extremely unfavorable this is by far the least breathable sandal that i have ever encountered which does not bode well for our olfactory test suite this one involved wearing the shoes for two days straight through my usual mix of badminton beat saber and sleeping in the nude then recruiting a panel of brave volunteers to assign an odor mitigation grade or omg the results were well it's kind of upsetting for me personally actually and it was clear that after just two days my unique blend of nerd sweat and sporty tryhard aroma were permanently caked into these unique non-removable side panels finally we tested out ground orthogonal locomotion distance which is an all-important stat for the vertically challenged and they did pretty okay here probably the best result yet but still fell well short of our control test with my daily driver sandals so it's clear marquez that with my history as a connoisseur and taste maker in the sandal verse i have a responsibility to show you how with just a few modifications you could turn these 251s into 10 out of tens i am so excited to unveil the all-new linus x marquez x adams xd brand two five foot one sandals minus sock this one-of-one drop represents the greatest design ideas from the past the present and dare i say the future it's just a whole new breed of footwear but look don't just trust me bros trust the numbers they don't lie our metatarsal liberation window massively improves breathability over marquez's flawed design decimating our swampiness values and as an added bonus they are completely hot stockable allowing the user to customize their style on the fly we've also snipped the tip freeing those crowded little toesies this not only boosts the effectiveness of our mlw technology but it also provides extra comfort and size compatibility for those with 11 or more toes and optionally exposes nature's most potent natural weapon the toenails giving our wearers a boost in their self-defense stats and now i'm really proud of this next part after extensive negotiations with nasa we've reached an agreement to use the same swiss designed hook and loop fasteners that are found on the international space station these are almost solely responsible intended for our record-breaking dawn deficiency scores and the weight reductions that resulted in massively improved gold scores ergonomics and sneak ability as for what dbrand contributed well nothing of substance like usual but they're overpriced stickers are available in every color meaning that you don't need to be locked into a red and black color scheme on the new two five foot one however effortlessly cool the red and black might make you look this not this is how you make a sandal s what it's supposed to be a shoe oh uh well that makes a lot more sense i guess that's pretty good then um congratulations marquez none i wish you nothing but success in this strange adventure who buys a shoe in this economy so much wasted material if you guys enjoyed this video why don't you check out the time marquez showed off our screwdriver in a sponsored pc build foreign
