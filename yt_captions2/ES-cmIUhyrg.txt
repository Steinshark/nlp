ladies and gentlemen welcome back to norway chess 2023 one of the strongest chess tournaments of the calendar year this tournament has had many storylines but the main one has maybe been magnus carlson struggling to win a game in classical chess being middle of the pack for the first time in a very long time and today even saying in a post-game interview that he's happy to be done essentially hailing at it like when a sports team brings out their worst lineup to run out the clock and end the game this is surprising stuff we will jump into this and some of the other story lines

but with a couple of wins in the last few rounds in classical he will get three points just like in the great sport of soccer or uh correctly named football uh magnus will make a comeback today he's got the black pieces versus of everything comes down to these last couple of games magnus playing into a queen's gambit declined you can play dc you can play knight bd7 you can play sammy slav you can play ragozen but magnus plays the classical which is solid i mean the queen's there's nothing wrong with the queen's gambit decline but if you're gonna play for a win with black it is virtually impossible it is impossible in these positions why white is just going to take all the pawns white is going to take in the center take multiple times in the center and then he's just gonna develop and then he's just gonna castle and magnus could take some risk in this position but he would be insane to do so okay this is like the equivalent of playing russian roulette but with chess and what happens is i don't know quite strange the pieces get traded knight takes pawn takes bishop takes queen takes the rook comes and after 20 moves of play this was the position this was it this is a draw and it took the players a little bit of time in shuffling queen's they shuffled back and forth and they made a draw magnus has had one other game like this one other game thus far in this tournament it was against hikaru and it's really difficult to take massive risk and play for a win with black if your opponent doesn't want to and chakra clearly did not want to all right just like well guys all right but now the good news is we have an armageddon but after this we're gonna debrief all right we're gonna debrief a little bit uh because and in this post game interview matt magnus even said as much he was like look after the game with alireza if you were watching round seven recap that was a big that was a big blow magnus was very close to winning that game and he ended up not winning it and he said i'm basically done right now the crazy thing about magnus is he is just like any great sports team you were just waiting for him to erupt all right he's like one of the tennis players down two sets all right and uh we got an armageddon game 10 minutes for white seven minutes for black magnus took on c3 he brought out his knights and bishop e6 and chakra are really playing some aggressive chess here f4 very edgy and interesting move playing a6 instigating over here we're gonna see how magnus can handle this position with all his pawns on the dark squares queen a4 what is this this crazy stuff here that mamidyarv is doing uh by attacking over there bishop is gonna pressure pawn is going to pressure all of these crisscross applesauce of a position um knight takes a queenless middle game white has a nice position but has no real targets and it's not really clear if this pawn is an asset or a liability personally i just think my major is trying to have fun that's it i just think that mamidyarov wants to have a fun game of chess when he sits down to play takes takes c4 rook a4 c5 magnus builds up a very powerful wall here and he has pressure here he has eyes on stuff this is the major weakness of the white position so magnus will try to just keep an eye on it as he maneuvers his pieces and here he does something very interesting magnus sacrifices the rook rook takes e3 all right this is a this is a massive decision rook e3 the idea is to bring the black king out and hunt him down in the center of the board with rookie 8 rookie two force him back into a corner and do this look at this insane position it's knight and two pawns for black for a rook for white magnus has all sorts of nasty intentions over here g g4 and i mean it just looks like he's going to be arriving here with knights of f3 check but he's not rushing he plays f5 it's a miserable position for white white's got absolutely nothing cooking for him here he's trying to trade the pieces trying to consolidate now it's time for magnus to bring his king but wait a minute wait a minute there was a moment here uh rook d1 magnus could have taken the pawn on c4 but instead he opts to bring the king and now after rook to e2 there are some serious winning chances serious winning chances rook and knight my mag just might lose the armageddon as well knight to b4 and here this is a fake threat in this position white should play king e3 king e3 is the move knight a6 rook a1 but shock plays a passive move to defend himself and magnus walks in eats the pawn and advances his c pawn and my friends that is the end of the game because white can not defend against the promotion and for a sixth time in this tournament magnus wins a game in armageddon as mommy dr resigns because this this this and this promotes this this promo um so magnus wins magnus wins the magic all right great um but he has no chance of winning first he's probably gonna finish in the bottom half he's going to finish fifth or six out of ten and you you just you just i don't know you just get the sense that like it wasn't his tournament and maybe classical chess just in general is like on the decline in the eyes of magnus you know because we've just gotten so accustomed to dominance for so long i don't remember the last time he had a bad classical tournament this for him is a bad classical tournament he is he hasn't won a game he hasn't lost the game either but but that's not the standard right and it's just it it might uh you know and he's had a great time playing these rapid games so that that might just be where the uh the pendulum is swinging so he's done and he said as much in the post game interview he's just happy for the tournament to be over which is just not that's not that's not what he's done for years you know what i mean it's just not what he's done for years so it's just we'll see what's next you know what i'm saying i'm not saying you got to win every single game you play like with wayne that's not what i'm saying i'm not saying that at all i'm just saying it's i don't think he said stuff like that in his career you know and it's um it's interesting to see but that's not the end of the story yes we had magnus well we have several other things going on number one hikaru like know your back your car is playing for first place you know who else is playing for first place fabiano caruana you want to stick around we'll stick around hikaru with white it's the armageddon they drew their first game it's a berlin main line the the new trendy main line not the end game all right hey carl playing a symmetrical pawn structure keep something in mind my friends cars playing for first place so he's got to win the armageddon fabiano is playing for first place as well tomorrow fabiano has the black pieces versus hikaru so that sets up everything all right that sets up the whole shebang we got ae a4a5 completely symmetrical position now folks here hikaru starts doing a little ritualistic night jump he like jumps the knight back to g7 brings the other night to if it brings that knight to h4 hikara just really loves riding around on horses queen h4 now he brings the queen back to d8 i mean that is some trippy chad gpt type of stuff here not your back attacks as rookie cargoes here now knows you're back clearly you know looking for some sort of nice stuff hikaru goes bishop f8 to trade the bishops so far so good queen c7 life is good king to g70 cars doing a great job like he's not he's not gonna lose this game you're not gonna lose me he strikes back with c5 and now knows your back attacks his rook and hikaru is nice and solid position looking very fancy but now nojew breaks like all right i'm here to attack i have h6 i have queen g5 uh and so on and so forth h6 wait a minute wait a minute wait a second f6 is played here excuse me f5 is played here by hikaru to prevent the queen from getting in and nordierbeck plays knight takes c4 which is a crazy move the idea of knight takes c4 is that if black takes the queen white is just gonna take black if black takes the rook white is just gonna say and at the end of the day the king is going to be forced to the corner and rookie 8 just wins because you pin the bishop to the rook and you threaten mate so this is what would happen and black would just run out of oxygen look at look at this oxygen tank depleting here as black only has several legal moves remaining not your back plays knight c4 wins the game just a moment later and hikaru resigns so hikaru loses an armageddon i mean uh he he he hasn't lost an armaged in a long time so now it comes down to whether or not fabiano how fabiano is going to score in his game now he drew against wesley so fabi's got the white pieces we have a queen's gambit declined we have takes takes this is a main line deep stuff here we're not gonna not gonna do a crazy amount of analysis take take knight to the middle kicking the night out of the center and um it's queen's rooks and night all right rookie two rookie one now 5v plays c4 looking to poke c5 looking to poke on the queen side a4 looking to instigate and now here comes wesley counter-attacking with g5 queen is rotating fabi's just trying to knock on the door here see what's up cb e4 cracking open the center a5 e3 counter measure hits the queen you can't take the pawn but white goes queen e1 with eyes on the pawn on e3 wesley counter attacking on d4 uh wesley actually got his knight trapped here by accident because he can't go knight d5 and if he plays a move like knight d7 white goes d5 and cracks through so instead of that we have queen d7 and wesley's lost his knight wesley here try to meet a5 with a counter attacking measure right try to just do something here with an e3 but the knight gets stuck and now fabi's just up a clean piece and he just cleans it up gets the king out of the way looks for trades stops the pawn creates a beautiful tetris piece and even in the eyes of getting mated in one move he trades the rooks he loses a pawn but this is game over defending everything checking winning pawns checking and winning more pawns checking and winning more pawns and it's just a matter of time as uh we need four knight d3 and in this position wesley resigned because you would go here trade the queen and make a new one bobby wins hikaru loses fabi wins his armageddon and there's one more game i would like to show you this game this game out of nowhere have some patience don't go anywhere we have we have a crazy situation brewing uh in india we have a crazy situation brewing in india something might happen in india for the first time in 40 years 30 years classical game between gukesh and orientare lukash plays a london that's not something that's happened for the first time in india that's not what's happening e3 knight f3 it's a london typical london stuff nothing surprising white oh never mind h4 wow okay that's clearly an indication of hostilities i mean i'm used to h3 and all this stuff but no this is just go cash saying i'm gonna play h5 tari thinks for a while and plays c5 tari thinks for 20 minutes here and play c5 tari can play h6 and h5 he can also play neither of those moves as he chooses in the game he chooses not to give the g5 square away and he chooses not to give the pawn as a potential target for white with ideas like knight e5 so he plays c5 and go cash responds knight e5 centralizing now knight c6 not possible knight bd7 certainly is possible that's exactly what tari plays now bishop e2 and it's very clear gokash wants to play h5 black should play h5 uh if black waits and allows h5 this is just extremely unpleasant there is absolutely no reason to allow this okay um h5 plate now knight c6 knight c6 looks like the queen is trapped but the queen can just go to e8 and now gokash plays b4 this is one of the weirdest londons i've ever seen uh the pawns have been you know walking over here why why does refusing to castle although he might he's just poking at the queen side and there's just a random horse just grazing around in the black position castles e5 counter-attacking measure all right counter attacking measure from uh from orientare b5 anchoring the night i think aryan probably should have tried to attack the knight with his bishop because when you try to do it this way because you have wandered into the center there's a really nice tactical defense here which is the move c4 and now we have a very tense moment you cannot take the pawn because i have d5 and if you take i fork you so wandering out here with your queen might actually prove to backfire okay instead we have bishop c6 takes and now the queen should take of course if you do this there is bishop f3 but tari gets a little bit spooked of all that and plays knight f6 and then here gukesh blows up the center what do you need to set off an explosion you need c4 what do you need to set off an explosion when you already have c4 you need e4 which is a new type of explosive both pawns are now staring at the pawn whichever pawn the pawn takes the pawn will push this is not a riddle you play e4 whichever pawn the pawn takes you push if you take this way then i'm gonna go here and my pawns are joining and black is completely lost you cannot stop two connected past pawns like this in the center of the board in the middle of a game you just can't do it you can't do it so e4 94 cd5 poking at the queen knight e4 luring in the queen d5 blue cash chops down all the chaos in the center of the board and even though he's a pawn down a clean pawn down these pawns hold hands and they are walking down the board together and now gukash can trade everything he could trade everything what he doesn't want is opposite colored bishops but he can trade a rook he could trade a queen and he's just got a police escort for these pawns spawns are very important individuals sitting in bulletproof cars okay knight f6 here comes the police escort with the bishops d6 look at this position look at these two pawns now it's not over it's not over but it's very unpleasant it's not fatal but it's very unpleasant like a canker sore okay i get those like you know once a month uh you didn't have to know that but you know you watch me a lot so you know it's all right if you know a couple of personal you know details uh the bishops are escorting the pawns all right now that pawns are gonna go down this way e4 good and now tari plays knight d5 counter-attacking the rook looking for knight c3 this is good if tari gets these bishops away then you know the pawns might be a little weaker rook c1 but my friends cash is coming cash is coming remember how i said the first thing that is happening in india that hasn't happened in like 30 years yeah you get ready look at this this is one of the strangest positions ever it's a seal preventing the white pieces from seeing the pawns but the queen just goes around queen doesn't need to get to the end of the cliff the queen just goes around escorting and when the pawn goes to d7 the bishop the what this man gukash has two pawns on the seventh rank in the middle of a game how did this position even happen how did the pawn sneak through how did they get past the security what the heck is going on b5 counter-attacking measure hits the pawn on a4 to catch sax the bishop now the queen on a4 not the pawn on a4 who cash sacks the bishop you know why go cash sacks the bishop because in this position not only does he sacrifice the bishop in this position he also sacrifices the queen the idea is that if this he makes a new one and it's a fork and after this he makes a new one cool cash gets three queens in one game that's what happens when pawn gets to the seven rank not only one pawns get to the seventh ring when they're holding hands together go cash one click two clicks and boom one click and two clicks like boom just like paypal honey smart look at that that was a callback that's what that's called remember how earlier in the video there was a there was a sponsored integration let me know if you appreciate that queen takes d7 instead because you gotta get rid of one of the pawns queen e4 knight a2 and when the dust settles here's our position problem is that white is completely winning why is white completely winning pawn on c7 even though one of them fell the legacy of the other pawn lives on and this end game is completely lost after bishop d6 rook c8 the final dagger bishop c5 if bishop here rook d8 check anchored by the pawn if the bishop goes back to f6 you still have rook d8 take take take check who cash wins my friends here are your standings after eight rounds of action at norway chess massive game coming up tomorrow all right just cover the whole screen you don't need to see me tomorrow hikaru has white versus fabiano hikaru is two and a half points behind fabiano if hikaru wins against fabiano tomorrow he is the winner of norway chess 2023. i hope hikaru plays for a win magnus is tied for sixth and seventh place he is just half a point away from being an eighth that is wild stuff and one more thing what has happened in india for the first time in nearly 30 years if not more than that gukesh is now up to 27.44 he is now up to number 13 in the world gukesh is 10 rating points away from being the number one ranked indian chess player on the planet something that has not occurred since the days of vishi anand in the 1990s for the first time in nearly 40 years india might have a new world number one by the end of the year that's crazy i'll see you for the round uh for the last round of the tournament tomorrow now get out of here
