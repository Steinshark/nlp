hello and welcome to mcoding! 
this is james murphy. i am doing another giveaway. so, if you'd like
a professional license to pycharm, which is the editor that i'm currently using, then
check the description. in this video, we're going over whether or not a bunch of 
built-in things in python make copies of your data. this is actually inspired by one 
of my previous videos. i had a lot of commenters, rightfully worried
that looping over a list this way in order to loop over it backwards 
might be making a copy. i got suggestions to use 
a slice of a list instead. and, in the wild, i've even seen people fall 
back to using error-prone indices just to avoid this issue. well, it's definitely clear this index-based
approach doesn't make a copy of my list. but it's so much less readable. so, i'm happy to tell you that reversed() does
not make a copy of your sequence. if you want to loop over 
something backwards, this is the way to do it. this isn't a foolproof method to 
tell whether or not a copy is made. but we can actually get 
an inclination that one is not made by printing out 
the reversed of the list. notice that instead of getting 
an actual list back, we get this list reverse 
iterator object. if you see something that says 
like an iterator or a view or a generator, that should be a clue that a copy 
probably isn't being made. just for comparison, notice that if 
we use this fancy slice of a list, then we actually get 
another list back. so although it's shorter in this case, 
it is also making a copy. so then how is reversed() able to loop over
the list without making a copy? well, here's an implementation of a class
that acts the way that reversed does. the key idea in all of these ways of iterating
is to define your own iterator. an iterator is just an object that you can
repeatedly ask for elements. the way that you ask it for an element is
by calling its __next__ method. this is also what's called by 
the built-in next function. if there are any more elements left to iterate
over, then next returns the next one. if there aren't any more elements to iterate
over, you signal that by raising a stop iteration. technically speaking, an iterator must also
have an __iter__ method that returns self. this is a little bit confusing because the magic 
__iter__ method is used to define an iterable, not an iterator. iterables are just things that you can ask
for an iterator from. whereas, an iterator you can think of
 more as an in-flight stream of elements. so all the return self really 
says is that if you want to get a stream of elements 
from a stream of elements, just return the stream. most of the important logic 
is in the next method. so all we do when we construct the reversed
object is store reference to the sequence. initialize an index to the last 
element of the sequence. and do some error checking. every time you ask a reversed 
for the next element, it gives you the element 
at its current index. and then subtracts one 
from the index. the last or i guess first valid index is 0. so, after returning that one, 
our index gets set to -1. so, if we see minus one, then 
we know there are no more elements. so as you can see this allows us to iterate
over the entire sequence without making a copy of it. the built-in reverse is actually going to
do something more like this that actually does things in terms 
of this next method. a common way to do something similar without
as much code is to use a generator instead. this generator code 
does essentially the same thing. and is quite a bit clearer 
in what it's doing. but the major difference here is 
that the error checking doesn't happen until you actually start the generator which happens when you 
actually ask for the first element. whereas, the class solution did 
the error checking in its init function. of course, doing error checking earlier rather
than later is usually a good idea. but this is an option. so then the question is: which of the major built-ins actually 
make copies and which don't? aside from sorted, most of the built-in
 that make copies are containers themselves. and that kind of makes sense. if you ask to make a new container using an 
old one, then you're kind of asking to make a copy. on the other hand, there are a 
bunch of them that don't make copies. so enumerate, filter, inter, map, 
reversed, and zip, any of the dictionary views and 
generator comprehensions don't make copies. once again, you can mostly 
tell by printing them out. the ones that make copies look like 
they've returned a new version of the original thing. whereas, the ones that don't make copies 
are returning these special purpose looking objects. as is often the case in python though,
 there are almost always exceptions. you're able to change how a lot 
of built-ins interact with your classes. for instance, slicing a list 
makes a copy. because that's the behavior 
that the built-in list shows. but you can define your own 
get item method for your classes. and do whatever you 
want with it. and that's exactly what numpy arrays do. things are not looking good 
if you just print it out. both of these objects 
are numpy arrays. so, you might think that 
reversed is a copy. but numpy arrays are actually 
just very thin views around raw memory. and printing out the data attribute 
of both of these arrays, we see that they're sharing the 
same exact memory object. contrary to the way that lists behave, 
no copy was made here. the way that numpy achieves 
this is by using strides. strides tell you how many bytes you need to jump if 
you want to get to the next element of the array. these are tuples instead of just numbers because 
arrays can be multi-dimensional. but for a 1d array, we basically 
just have a number. the `4` here tells me that from some element 
i need to jump four bytes to get to the next one. that's because numpy chose a 32-bit 
or 4 byte integer type for this array. so, all i need to do to get 
a reversed array is start at the end and jump by negative
e 4 for each element instead of positive 4. it's a very simple, clever and effective
 way to do things efficiently. i wouldn't expect anything less from numpy. and finally, we spend all this time talking
 about how to avoid making copies of things. but i have to say that copies 
are not always bad. sometimes you really need 
a copy. the canonical example of when 
you'd want to copy is if you're iterating over something and
 mutating it at the same time. for instance, here i have a, b, c 
mapped to 1, 2, 3. i want to go into the dictionary and add
 uppercase a, b and c with the same values 1, 2 and 3. seems simple enough. 
iterate over key value pairs. convert the key to uppercase and 
assign it the same value. it seems straightforward but we got
 slapped with this runtime error. dictionary changes size during iteration. if you're not familiar how dictionaries
 are implemented in terms of hash tables, this might be a very confusing error. why does python care if i modify
 something while i'm looping over it? the very short and simple explanation 
is that modifying the dictionary might cause the dictionary to have to
 move all the elements around. if that were to happen then the iterator
 might basically just lose its place. the solution is to manually make the copy. making a copy here means that 
we exhaust the iterator and collect all the results 
into the list. so the iterator is completely done before we ever start to modify 
the dictionary. so, there you have it.
