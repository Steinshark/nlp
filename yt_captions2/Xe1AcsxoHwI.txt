all filmmakers need to make money somehow if we can make a hundred percent of our money from just doing projects we love and believe in then you've hit the professional jackpot and i'm happy to say it i have nothing more to teach you but if you're like most of us you usually have to hustle in order to bring in some cash to fund your passion projects so i wanted to take a minute and talk about some of the different ways that i know of to earn a little extra cash using your filmmaking skills that's exactly what this video is all about five potential side hustles for documentary filmmakers to think about which i'm also going to rank in order of which ones i think will develop your skills the most i like the way the pros and cons of side gigs in terms of more than just money so yes i'm going to look at the potential earnings but i'm also going to give priority to the ones that i think are going to make you a better filmmaker at the same time [music] hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsyth and on this channel i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer if you're into that kind of thing make sure to hustle that subscribe button because i've got more videos like it coming out every week okay so like i was saying eventually we'd probably all like to get to the point where we loved every gig we had and that our career was just one amazing job after the other but in my experience at least at the highest levels it's rarely like that in the old expression one for the meal and one for the real is true for most people out there between photos and filmmaking i've been working at a pretty high level for over a decade and i still take jobs i don't really want to do all the time just to buy myself the space and freedom to work on the things i'm excited about like the feature film i directed this summer and this youtube channel because the truth is that if you're totally broke all the time you're not going to be in the headspace to do your best creative work so figuring out how to earn a little on the side when times get tough can be a great way to take the pressure off so let's start with one of the most popular and accessible options out there one that anyone with a camera and an internet can get into and that's stock if you've never heard of them stock archives are big websites where people who need video content can pay a one-off fee or maybe buy a membership to access a large collection of footage all you have to do is shoot some footage make an account on one of these sites upload and tag the footage and then every time it's used by someone you'll get a cut of the profits it's a great tool for passive income and i know lots of people who've had success buying and selling stock so why am i putting it at the bottom of the list well the first reason is because the market is already pretty saturated at this point and if you want your footage to sell it's going to have to be really good that means putting a lot of thought and effort into shooting scenes and locations at certain types of the day and applying really nice color grades then uploading it and tagging it all of which can be super time consuming so even though technically anyone can upload to these sites beginners are probably going to have a hard time getting shots that stand out enough to sell i also think that shooting stock really emphasizes the technical proficiencies of filmmaking rather than storytelling skills so if your goal is to become a documentary filmmaker you're not learning the most important skills at least in my opinion with all that said if you're able to put the time and have tons of high quality footage just sitting around it is possible to have passive income rolling in 24 7 while you work on other things so for the right kind of shooter it could be a great option i'm curious do you guys sell stock i've really never had much luck with it but i'm definitely open to having my mind changed if you have and think i'm way off and putting at the bottom of this list let me know in the comments next on the list is another hustle that's primarily based in the technical abilities and that's to get into the aerials game and by aerials of course i'm talking about drones but i don't mean that you should just go out and buy a dji mavic something or other and then wait around for money to roll in i'm saying that you should first get a legal license for whatever country you live in then get a drone and fly it for profit in a lot of places these days it's not enough just to own the drone and they're easy enough to fly that most people could learn the basics in an afternoon but by holding a license you solve a problem for people operating in areas where doing it themselves just isn't practical like where i live in vancouver if you want to fly a drone for commercial services the fine for not having a license is i think five thousand dollars on the spot no negotiations so for the average real estate agent or a small business owner or whoever needs drone shots it's probably better to avoid the risk and hire someone to do it you don't need to go all in and buy an inspire too but if you just make a squarespace site with your city name and drone in the title somehow and then join some marketing or real estate facebook groups i think you'd start to make money before too long and if you get some good shots along the way you can also add them to your stock library win-win you're goddamn right the next side hustle on this list strays into the world of narrative filmmaking though sometimes docs are big enough for these too and that's to get a job as a pa a pa or production assistant is a blanket term for general helpers on film sets most movies and commercials and even some larger documentary shoots need pas if you're within driving distance of a city with any film industry to speak of every time a new production starts up there's going to be an open call for pas depending on the union rules where you live pa's pretty much just do anything that's asked to them really from driving people around to picking up lunch to helping pack up at the end of the shoot the good part is that you get real time on set you get to hear how the systems work and usually you get paid pretty well the downside is that you're interested in mainly in documentary work most pa jobs are for narrative shoots and commercials not only that but as a pa on a big set you're probably not going to be allowed to actually use any of the tools and the bigger the production the less likely it is that you'll even be able to talk to the people in charge but there can be a lot of these jobs depending on where you live and also they tend to be for short chunks of time in a block so you can cash up and then go and do your own stuff while at the same time getting used to the way people talk on film crews which can save you a lot of embarrassment down the road pas can get promoted to junior producers or assistant directors and some people even stay pas for their whole career and do really well for themselves so if you're curious about the narrative world or live in a place with a big film industry don't sleep on this one the next thing on this list isn't just a ploy for me to find cheap labor i promise these days there's a ton of content being created every day but not that many people who know how to make sense of it and edit into actual stories that people want to watch if you're interested in documentary filmmaking then learning how to edit can be almost as important as learning how to use a camera because the reality is that in docs a lot of the story takes place after the shoot is done in the edit learning how to think like an editor is going to help you shoot more efficiently and tell a better story which is what it's all about in the end knowing how to edit and tell stories and posts isn't just useful from a skills perspective you can actually make decent money by doing it as well i'd probably start out by making a profile on maybe upwork or people per hour or one of the higher end sites even though something like fiverr could work if you're okay looking for starter jobs make a nice profile set an hourly rate that matches your skill levels and then put a bit of thought into your job bids and you should start to bring in some cash before too long that's actually how i found santiago who's the editor for this channel he took the time to write a really detailed and personal response to my job post and so now i send regular work to him every month and we collaborate on all these videos with just a handful of regular clients i think it's totally reasonable to fully support yourself just from editing gigs like this and at the same time you're going to be developing your storytelling skills so i like this side hustle a lot if anyone needs a great video editor by the way shoot me an email and i'll put you in touch with santiago he's the best okay moving on to the last side hustle on this list is one that you might not be expecting but has the potential to both earn you a good money and help you practice all the fundamental technical skills you'd need to shoot documentaries and that's weddings now before people get upset in the comments i know that getting good at weddings is an art form in itself and that you can't just do them casually because you need an extra buck good wedding videographers have to market themselves network and have tons of gear and editing capacity to work at a high level without investing a lot of time you probably won't be able to book big destination weddings on your own but what you can do is hire yourself out as a second shooter to the people who are at the top of their game and sometimes have more weddings on their calendar than they can handle at the higher levels wedding videos will have more than one camera on location and if you're a competent shooter this could make you pretty sought after especially in peak seasons i'd look into this by googling i don't know like the top 20 wedding shooters in your area and then doing whatever you can to get a meeting with them so that they'll keep you in mind if you want more tips on how to network i'll link to a free networking guide i made in the description which is like 12 pages of step-by-step ideas and exercises to make networking less painful for filmmakers so check it out if you're thinking of going this route but beyond just making money shooting weddings works most of the same skills as documentary filmmaking just in a slightly different way you need to shoot in a fast-paced environment you can't really control it all usually with a huge variety of lighting conditions involving a lot of high pressure situations documenting moments that you can't really miss you also have to sharpen your social skills get more comfortable filming strangers and learn all sorts of business skills like negotiating and invoicing my photography mentor once told me that weddings were the best training for photojournalism that he knew of apart from photojournalism itself and in my opinion the same thing applies to filmmaking so there we are five ideas for filmmaking side hustles we all need to pay the bills and like i said it is very rare for a filmmaker to only be able to do the projects they want to do but if you put in the time to make one of these side hustles work for yourself you'll be able to cover your rant and develop skills so that eventually hopefully just maybe you'll get to a place where you can focus on the things that you want until then hustle hard and put in the work and if you like that video think about checking out this other one i made that's about the most useful skill filmmakers hate talking about networking see ya [music]
