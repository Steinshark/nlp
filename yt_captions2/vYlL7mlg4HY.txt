ladies and gentlemen it is my absolute pleasure to welcome you back to the fiday chess grand swiss this is a chess tournament being held on the isle of man and the top two finishers of it will qualify to the candidates tournament and the winner of the candidates tournament will play for the world chess championship in 2014 fabiano carana hikara nakamura ali ruja hans neiman and many many other exceptionally strong grand masters are competing we are just at the halfway point of the event both on the open side and on the women's side this recap we will feature an incredible amount of top names uh sublime storylines and everything in between this video is being recorded late at night it's why the room looks the way it does normally there is light outside but i was uh away i actually went to the jets giants game today i've never actually seen a football match live football game i guess uh nf like this football sorry european i don't know why we call it football but i was invited by the amazing team uh at youtube uh and uh and i got to hang out with uh some amazing people so thank you for that and that's why i'm a little bit late game one hikaru versus alexis sra this is a matchup that has occurred probably like 200 times online i don't know if they've played many games against each other over the board alexi is of course a a russian grandmaster but like many russian grand masters uh over the last two years has uh changed federations and moved i think he now lives in serbia i suppose um the game begins with d4 knight f6 c4 e6 and hikaro plays a catalan knight f3 and g3 now black has many many options black can enter the open catalan or black can play bishop to b4 check uh allowing white to block and then often times dropping that bishop back to the e7 square or black can just play bishop 2 e7 and never take this pawn in any case if black takes on c4 it's an open catalan if black doesn't take on c4 it's a close catalan check bishop d2 the bishop goes to e7 both sides castle knight bd7 and now karo plays an interesting move which is bishop to c3 normally knight to c3 is played in just any queen's pawn position but bishop c3 is fascinating and bishop c3 gives away the pawn um and it just i mean it's just a pure giveaway of a pawn that knight bd2 right would win it would try to win back up b5 and then white would try to play on this diagonal uh and maybe undermine with a4 clearly hikaro comes for parro sran plays b6 san spent' minutes after hikaro played bishop c3 that is how you know look look at the time both guys just like okay we're going for a little o catan bishop b4 and castles castles knight d7 i don't know why they're both british singing the song it's just the first accent i always go to um yeah bishop c3 is a very very odd move and then after getting his opponent to play b6 hi cardu takes and then he goes here which is let me tell you you something right now if children are watching this make sure they don't play chess like this this dude went bishop d2 bishop c3 bishop d2 this is the type of stuff that works at the metal level and the super gm level you can't understand this stuff three moves in the first 10 with the bishop and at worst the position is just equal the position is never going to be worse for white because it's a queen's pawn it's a very solid opening black can't really take advantage with these kind of passive but you know solid pieces then karo plays knight c3 and a couple moves later he moves the bishop again cuz why not cuz why not then he plays rook c1 obviously trying to meet knight takes with uh rook takes c3 right that is why that is why he's doing what he's doing sra plays c5 sra has executed every single plan of a queen's pawn opening he has both d and c pawns in the center they are well supported they are supported by knights and bishops and everybody is happy but now unfortunately in chess the rule of thumb is nobody can be happy you can't just have everybody happy both players cannot be happy nobody can be happy in chess knight to d2 hikaru first move out of prep spends 36 minutes also 20 of that was spent going to the bathroom and having explosive poops uh i i'm just kidding he actually thought for 36 minutes unless that actually happened in which case that's hilarious and hikaro i promise i'm not spying on you i do always wonder like can you imagine these players playing at certain like what if right now you really got to go to the bathroom right then you go and it's just like you just you're you you ate something bad you're just sitting there just on or whatever noise you make when you go to the toilet like at some point you got to go back to the board right anyway diarrhea is hilarious diarrhea is like like is the great equalizer you could be rich poor you could live in a mansion you could live in a small shack you could anyway you could travel the world you could never leave your country but at the end of the day regardless of any of that diarrhea humbles everybody knight takes c3 rook takes c3 and right now my friends that is a hanging pawn but that is clearly iar's idea because he probably wanted to infiltrate on c7 bother the bishop and if the bishop moves to a6 he probably would have played knight f3 and tried to win the pawn i don't know i i haven't talked to him uh hikaro takes on c5 and now begins a very interesting assault of the black position right he's attacking all these different things but black is the one with the pawns in the center plays d4 and now hikaro trades the bishop and plays rook c4 then they trade bishops and it's just going to be like can hikaro break through this structure plays queen c1 poking at the c5 pawn which by the way cannot be defended but if you take on c5 then queen e2 is hanging at the end but that's what he he got of waits and then he takes on c5 now sensing that desperate times are coming sara lashes out with h5 which is a very good move the point of h5 is that if white plays h4 black in the future can bring his rook there and maybe even just play g5 not not right now cuz he would lose the pawn but in the future so hearu like look at sra sra is instigating karu now needs to consolidate in chess when you win material sometimes you need to trade some pieces let's do the math right white has six pawns black has five pawn end game white is winning queen end game probably a draw but white has winning chances rook end game probably the highest level of a draw knight end game probably winning for white but draw is draw is it it depends right depends like black has another weakness here so what is hikaru going to try to simplify right so hikaro makes sure he has no weaknesses no weaknesses this is just scary but there's no threats no no threats knight d3 look at san versus look at knight e1 hikaru trying to claw his way out he gets one pair of rooks off now hikaru is going to take the pawn on d4 rook d4 but look at sra so active checkmating threats the queen stuck back rank stuff queen on b2 hikaru consolidating sra dancing around him look at this move that's a mate hikaru blocks it hikaru defends with his king loses the b2 pun oh my goodness but goes for a a night end game goes for a night end game drawish but white can win white can win this pawn and also white can win a pawn race and now maybe stockfish can hold this but look at hikaru oh my goodness hikaru's getting there and he does that pawn that san used as a deflection mechanism from his position has suddenly made him lose a pawn and karu by the way if you're confused knight e6 check would be very brutal there so knight e4 check now karu might have to part ways with a pawn king f3 king e2 there he goes sra takes on g4 but here comes knight to c 6 and king d3 and e4 and hikaro can't be stopped he has a passed e pawn the knight is going to win this pawn that pawn is going to queen ladies and gentlemen it takes 70 moves dare i say a magnesian effort look at hikaru's night hikaru's knight needs to take this pawn and there has to be a buzzer beater the g pawn is going g5 g4 but hearu he failed he can't stop the pawn on g1 call an ambulance call an ambulance but not for me knight to e1 if you make a queen it's knight to f3 my heater wanted to celebrate so my heater turned on my heater heard me heard me talking about uh calling an ambulance knight to f3 what a wicked move now some of you might be keenly observing here that a knight stops this but it doesn't stop the pawn you can't stop both pawns my friends and hikaru wins the game in style picks up the queen the a pawn gets there look at talk about a buzzer beater the the knight cannot stop both pawns and ladies and gentlemen it takes 70 moves but hikaro defeats saana he gets a hatt trick that's three wins in a row this man is back up up there number three in the world very close to fabiano and he's in first place another person chasing first place is hans neeman ali resa fua versus hans neeman uh and and uh hans yesterday played an amazing game uh and i thought i was hyping him up then he then he said some nasty things to me on twitter and you know i feel like saying stuff on social media is it's like a badge of honor you know what i mean i'll wear it like a badge of honor i uh i realized like i got some feedback yesterday that uh saying that hans won with 100% accuracy could be misconstrued i didn't really i just kind of wrote that title cuz a couple weeks ago i made a title called magnus carlson wins with 100% accuracy it did really well 100% accuracy is really liked by the algorithm uh because you know flawless uh but uh yeah i i guess that could be misconstrued given the whole scandal thing but having said that if h is innocent then should be all right to say that he played with 100% accuracy right anyway if you have no idea what i'm talking about don't worry about it just you know the youngans always do knight f3 this is a huge matchup this is ali resa fua this is hans nean hans trying to win with black versus versus a 2780 rated player and ali resa plays a very weird line he gets real weird with it here in the opening rook to e1 he baits hans into moving the knight in front of the c pawn and then he plays d4 so alzo wastes two moves with his pawn and he catches h's knight a little offside and so what h does plays a5 he tries to take some queenside space and then he puts his knight here and plays a4 and this is a really weird game like hans is trying to open up his queen and aliv res is like i'm going to put my knight here because this stupid pawn you moved cannot go backwards and the knight here can be traded and very very obscure position bishop to f4 all right attacking the pawn here bishop d6 looking to give away the bishop and then maybe bring the queen to b6 for example knight to e5 take take the bishop now has to get out and aliv r is going to try to keep pushing right play c4 prying away the defense but hans nifty defending and now hans is the one striking back on f2 now ali res has to play this ugly move rook f1 one thing you might notice my friends both guys are spending a lot of time it's move 15 both guys have made 15 moves they have 25 more moves to make to get extra time that's how classical chess works and uh they have 30 minutes aliv resa takes on f6 and hans neeman takes on f2 my friends it's not a good idea to give away two pieces for a rook but hans is is 2667 he's not 667 and he's not 766 he knows what he's doing the reason hans is able to do this is because now white's king is in the open and e5 and g5 are threats g5 more than e5 because if e5 queen takes d5 or bishop takes d5 uh but both are probably fine king g1 and if you get out of the pin yo so hans gets a pawn on f2 and the pawn on b2 that's weak that's hanging that's under pressure that's under pressure that's under pressure now he gets this pawn as well oh my pawn takes d5 now queen is taking on c7 hans takes king slides over queen c3 for mly resa the game is on a knife edge it's dead equal but all this means is unclear this is not really equal this is stockfish out for a smoke break stockfish has given up okay stockfish is apparent with a really really bad toddler and he's drinking okay like this is what we're doing here rookie eight now ali resa says i could take this pawn or this pawn and i'm pretty sure my king is safe let me grab a pawn i'm going to grab a pawn sauce on the side okay rook e4 queen d2 offering a queen trade and if you don't trade queens with me i'm going to go take d7 that's a mistake ali resa makes a mistake he has one minute to make 14 moves ali resa fuja has one minute to make uh 14 moves hans takes his knight queen d7 and apparently black is winning apparently black is winning black is winning if he doubles his rooks and the threat is simply rook e1 that is the threat like for example you play h4 rook e1 check and i get in so the only way to defend here for white is to play bishop to d2 and stop rook to e1 completely then the best move is to hit the queen because the queen is pinned if queen takes c6 queen d4 check and white loses everything everything so rookie 2 is what hans plays he doesn't play rookie 8 he has a minute on the clock he plays this move with 30 seconds he misses his chance ali resa takes on c6 his king is being defended the king is in the corner look at this this is mate but ali resa slides back just in time rookie one check hanza still hunting him queen e2 queen d1 and in this position apparently instead of queen d1 a3 was winning for hans very very tough move to see because you got to take your eye off of this for a second that's still hanging if bishop d5 queen d1 check so a3 would have won apparently uh i imagine he was probably afraid of something like queen d7 but yeah a3 was uh a3 was the move and if queen g2 for example there is check you block and then we can trade and then i play this move g5 so crazy a time scramble game hans winning against ali resa he still wins the bishop but here's the difference this is a draw these pawns will trade against each other bishop and pawn the pawn will go the rook will have to sacrifice itself ladies and gentlemen a very tense fight between hans neon and the uh number four ranked chess player in the world ali resa fuja and um they make a draw what a game i mean talk about on the edge of your seat ali reza plays a move and is almost losing on the clock and is losing if hans plays rookie eight and just goes forward not easy to see not easy to see because rook to e2 looks good but it's not the best move and then there's no very obvious win apparently going back to to e7 is the right way which is uh which is tough to spot they make a draw very stressful game wow um i have another very fun game for you uh this is uh th this person is also tied for first after winning this game ar generi versus renad jumabay from kazakhstan uh and this one was a spanish it was an anti- berlin black played knight f6 d3 renad by the way 2585 is like a criminal elo like this man is really really good and he plays this really aggressive line with queen takes d5 but arjun fires right back plays b4 a4 looking to trap his piece rat plays e4 down 40 minutes on the clock sacrificing a pawn in the opening plays a5 to stop white from trapping his piece and arjun just takes gives a check forces the pawn to come up to c6 and just drops back and he basically says rat i'm up a pawn i have six of them you got five i got e5 when i want it rook b1 i'm going to create an attack on your king blah blah blah blah blah there it is that's a fork but queen e6 you can't take on f6 because then i'm going to take on e2 so what does arjent do he takes on f6 he doesn't care if he gets taken on e2 because after he takes takes takes this pawn has made it all the way rook g8 knight d4 and now he's just trying to put that bishop on look at that move oh my bishop to f8 what an anchor talk about an impostor on the home square of the bishop rook takes g7 rook e1 arjun is still upon pawn up renat never got his investment back rook e7 he's attacking arjun b6 look at the knight at some point black is going to oh my oh my a piece is hanging but knight b5 rook c7 is a threat reat plays rook d7 trading the rooks 40 seconds versus 15 minutes white has 15 minutes to make 10 moves and black has 40 seconds to make 10 moves bishop to a3 bishop to e6 bishop f4 oh my oh my here comes r here come rat's pieces here come rat's pieces bishop b8 bishop b3 trying to win the pawn we trade uhoh uhoh aragi is going to have to push his f pawn and he does and he brings the knight but now the rook goes to d8 aragi is going to have to rely on these pawns otherwise i'm not so sure he's going to be able to win meanwhile renad renad is going to try to get the c3 pawn he starts bringing his king and he zips around back this game is also hanging on a knife edge r not king is stopping the f pawn and now he's not even he's not even down a pawn arjent plays c4 rook who's who's stopping the knight the knight's got to move arjun just lost his c pawn oh my oh my goodness and white is queening that's it i mean it's a race it's like the hunger games these are the last sets of pawns remaining king here are we going to have a repetition arjun grabs the pawn my friends it is time for a race who is going to win win all the other pawns have fallen rook a8 check and here comes rat with b5 and here comes g5 and b4 oh my goodness g6 and b3 they're both two squares away from queening they're one square away from queening rook to h1 and now in this position black has bishop takes clearing the path for the c pawn and it looks like white is able to get back in time but after rook f8 who guards the pawn if you play knight to h6 i cut off your king that is unfindable that is not findable the point is if you just play rook d8 cutting off the king i have knight to d4 check this might still work but there's no reason to allow it instead of that reat plays this move and what that move does is it secures the promotion but what it doesn't do my friends what it does not do white creates a shield the pawn that is trying to queen is now shielded by the knight but the best move on the board bishop sacrifice and now rook to a1 dear lord it is still not over rook e one check rook to f1 to stop the pawn check and in this position king a5 f8 queen the only move that draws is check because then you make a queen if you just make a queen like what happens in the game knight d6 and mate is unstoppable there are mes now all over the board queen d8 queen a8 and the difference the difference why you had to give the check right and then this is that after knight to d6 there is this check and then the king even though he can run will constantly be checked and the rook is in a better position but what happens in the game the rook is not in a better position position knight d6 he gives a check the king runs and in this position re not resigned because you cannot stop mate you cannot stop these two checkmates what an apocalyptic endgame all the pawns were running down the board and argin ari prevails in the hunger game of the pawns and he wins and he is also tied for first now game from the women's side the winner of this game is also now in first place tanong y versus says bibisara asaba this is a kings's indian defense one of the most provocative openings in chess players do a little dance here with the knights bishop e3 knight f3 and white goes to attack g4 h4 attacking with her pawns g5 restricting the pieces on e8 not allowing anything to go to the f6 square f5 played by black looking to create counterplay white takes on c5 to try to poke a hole in the black position but here comes a4 and bbar puts the knight on d6 the position is opening up for black as well the knight undeveloped 2 e8 to reroute to the e6 square look at this to go side to side the knight has to go one two three but you have that luxury because once you get to d4 or f4 it is a beautiful position the black bishop is desperately retreating in the corner of the board rook g1 tanong is going to play g6 and black is going to be on the rop as with knight to d4 g6 on the board you cannot allow white to play g7 frankly you cannot even allow white to take on h7 because you will probably lose so she plays pawn takes g6 and the idea is to hide the king you use the pawn this is called an umbrella pawn it's when you use an enemy pawn to shield yourself from the attack white wishes that pawn did not exist if it didn't exist there would be a mate dam it so the pawn has to stay but if the pawn has to say now it is black who is going to try to trade the rooks and as the players reach the time control it is bibisara who realizes her opponent is stepping away from the battle when you turn your back to your opponent especially in a fight it is all over rook to g3 and in this position she lands the haymaker pawn to e4 opening up the bishop from the corner of the board which just about 10 moves ago was shunned was shunned by the h pawn booted all the way back only for it to blossom grow its wings and come alive pawn to e4 queen to d1 the rook infiltrates and paralyzes the entire first rank you try to kick the queen out it does not help and now the final piece is plugged into the attack b5 oh my god rook queen knight c4 and she finishes it in style knight c2 a deflection a removal of the guard you get the rook to come here you take on f1 and now bbis asaya the international master from kazakhstan the reigning defending women's world rapid champion i think or blitz i think it's rapid she is four and a half out of five four wins one draw a win over 257 rated tanong from china my friends the recap is over after this game is this a blank game yes the recap is over after this game it's the moment you've all been waiting for it is chess.com still not having a photo of raman janov although i think they have uploaded it i think it's just for some reason not yet live in this database i offered them a trade they could add a photo for ramazan but they would remove my photo i hope they didn't give him my photo my friends let me remind you this is the 2447 rated 21-year-old kazakhstan based international master who has beaten a 2650 beaten a 2680 drew ali resa fua 2777 and he drew a 26 82 and in this round he's playing a 2698 and i think you know why he is covered in today's recap he plays an open sicilian against sam seavon and they clash pawns are flying off the board he plays pawn to b3 he plays f3 stopping the queen they both castle there's no knights ramazan plays bishop c5 and queen f2 it's a very tense position a4 he takes queens side space black fights back with a5 looking to remove the defense but all that's given ramazan is a pawn on the a file black plays here bishop b6 queen a8 the pawns are the but look at a5 look at a5 anchoring the bishop and that's going to be a menace in every single end game savon plays bishop to h6 ramazan brings back the bishop looking for a trade bishop to f8 the bishop goes back to b6 the only way that black can make progress is d4 that is the only way you may ask yourself why is it not e4 it's not e4 because this trade benefits white it opens up his queen and he can actually attack the only chance that seon has is to play d4 but that's a massive commitment because then you have to calculate f4 which rem which would remove the defense of your pawn seon can he be the chosen one to take down the unbeatable ramazan jalah if they repeat moves the bishop's repeat moves again will seon play d4 he brings the bishop back to a slightly different square now d4 still looks good but he doesn't go for it sam seavon repeats the position against xal mahan and they make a draw ramazan jal mov is undefeated with draws against 2698 rated sam sean 2777 rated ala fuja and 2,682 rated alexa sana the cinderella story continues and my friends your standings after five rounds of the fid grand swis 2023 rs follows hikaro in first place four points out of five tied with yeno and arjuni tomorrow we will get the matchup iaro versus yip peno and then it is a tie from fourth to'th place of players with three and a half and let me tell you something those guys are going to have to start destroying each other if they want any chance at being a top two finisher if you get first place with a couple rounds to go you're going to make draws but 20 people can still compete for first place probably more the grand swiss will resume in round number six get out of here
