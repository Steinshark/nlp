oh hey internet i'm just kidding relax okay today i want to talk about something i get asked all the time and that is can you pay for all of waterloo off of just your co-op fees and i think you're going to want to stick around because it's actually a pretty surprising answer don't forget join the discord we've got the discord going we have almost 50 people in it now we've done like two or three resume critiques already like there's no reason that you wouldn't join this discord even if you don't like me that's fine join the discord man you're gonna get so much value out of that [music] clearly this is not a yes or no question i can't answer this for every single person there are a few things you have to consider there's how much money do you have to pay for school and how much money do you make and both of these two things can actually vary quite a lot so we're going to talk about all of those factors okay so when you're determining how much you're going to pay for school you have to think about these four questions first off we've got are you a co-op student co-op students pay a co-op fee are you an international student this is going to be the biggest factor it's going to determine if you pay 10 grand versus like 50 grand it's nuts do you always buy the useless textbooks i had a few friends in first year that would purchase the textbooks before the first class and then they would sit down and the professor would tell them that the textbook's either not used at all or they can find it for really cheap used or more than likely majority of the time there's a pdf floating around and maybe the second most important factor is what faculty are you in so today we're going to talk about engineering and math engineering is all one big bubble and in math we're going to focus specifically on computer science because the math faculty and computer science are slightly different for these numbers so let's go through some of the factors so we're gonna break this down in terms of two terms that's how they price it on the waterloo website so we're gonna say eight months worth of school that's what we're to price this at and that's what we're going to kind of extrapolate out from so let's get to tuition in a second let's actually first look at how much you're going to need in rent now when i was in waterloo i found good places for about 425 a month a lot of you are probably gasping right now because it's really really low you have to know where to look to get a good deal like that but the average person i would say pays between 500 to 600 a month so i'm just going to go ahead and say assume this person pays 600 a month for rent now since this is two terms we're extrapolating over assume that you have to purchase textbooks the waterloo website thinks that you'll probably spend about twenty two hundred dollars on textbooks and that is absolutely not right so i'm gonna assume that you only end up spending about a thousand dollars on textbooks per term so that's an extra two thousand dollars so now let's look at food and entertainment let's say food is seventy five dollars a week plus an additional twenty five dollars a week for entertainment so call that a hundred dollars a week times four weeks in a month times eight months that we're extrapolating out over waterloo actually has a calculator for this and their suggested amount that you spend every month is 385 on these two things so my estimation of 400 is actually pretty pretty accurate with being a little bit conservative of course that depends on how much you want to go to phil's which is where i spent all my money and then we've got the co-op fee which is dollars per term so that's 739 times 2 and remember we don't pay co-op fees on co-op terms first things first let's look at the case for a canadian citizen once we add in the actual fee so engineering is 17 100 for these two terms cs is 15 900 for these two terms that brings us to about 28 578 per year for engineering and about 27 378 for computer science um now let's multiply that by four because you go to school for four years giving us a hundred and fourteen thousand three hundred and twelve dollars for engineering and 109 512 dollars for computer science now i'm gonna assume that i missed about fifteen thousand dollars worth of expenses just to be conservative so that gives us a grand total of 129 312 for engineering and 124 512 for computer science now i want to look at the case of if you're an engineer or a math student that's an international student what is that going to do to these costs now even if you're a canadian citizen you might want to stick around just to learn these numbers because they're pretty surprising so let's look at this engineering and math cost the same for an international student and they cost 61.000 i need a glass of water we have the same calculation for your living expenses how much you're going to spend remember those are all variable but we're just going ahead with this estimation here and now we've got this sixty one thousand three hundred dollars per tuition multiply that by four we're going to add in our fifteen uh thousand dollars just to be conservative just to make sure we covered all our costs and that leaves us at two hundred and seventy thousand two hundred dollars for an international student if you look at those numbers that's actually more than double that it is for a canadian citizen so they got a lot of ground to make up if you're an international student but let's get into it how much money are you going to make at waterloo this is the big question so now if we go and look at how much you make in co-op if it's more than that number then yeah the answer is yes you can you can pay for it so when you look at the data that waterloo has on their website they have a canadian table and they've got a united states table for how much you're going to make when you're doing your co-ops they break it down by faculty so they've got engineering and they've got math on the canadian side the math average is brought down by non-cs jobs being included in that average and then when you flip over to the american side the engineering average is brought down by including architecture in that umbrella so what i'm gonna do here is get the closest estimate to what it would be if you got a software engineering internship i'm going to use the engineering average for the canadian side i'm going to use the cs average for the american side that's going to be the most true to your actual income another thing i'm going to assume here i'm going to assume that the first three co-ops you get are in canada and then the last three are in america now we're gonna break down the other numbers later we'll go all six in canada and then we'll do all six in america just for fun uh right here this is kind of the breakdown i had i actually did three in canada two in america one in ireland that was not so good for how much money i made but i actually had the opportunity i was really close to doing two in canada and four in america in which case i would have made a lot more money so it is a range depending on where you get in so let's say work term one you get eighteen point five dollars an hour that's the average or term two you get twenty point four dollars an hour work term three you get twenty two dollars and eight cents an hour now this is where you level up and you switch over to making american incomes you get your fourth internship in america great job you're so smart that's going to give us 44.60 an hour but wait we also have to factor in that that's american dollars so that's multiplied by 1.29 let's say work term five 48 dollars and 85 cents an hour again multiplied by 1.29 work term sixth forty seven point nine dollars an hour again with that 1.29 factor and then when we extrapolate this out to 16 weeks that's 40 hours a week 16 weeks in an internship that's gonna leave us with a grand total of 154 thousand dollars oh my god 154 916 that's how much you're gonna make so if you're a canadian citizen that is more than paying for your degree you're actually going to come out of school with an additional 25k one thing i did not include in these numbers is your living expenses when you're on co-op so let's assume that you actually don't make an additional 25 000 in your pocket that actually goes to your living expenses while you're on co-op so either way you're going to come out canadian citizen if you've got those three and three you're gonna come out debt free that's fantastic that puts you so far ahead of most people in the world you don't even know that's such a privilege now for international students this is where it gets tough because you looked at that and you go actually i've got 115 000 worth of debt i would come out of school with but that's way way way more manageable than 270 000 right 115 is still quite a lot so one thing i think you still need to consider is how much money you're going to get paid when you go to your first full-time job i'm going to share the offer at least some components of the offer that i got from my first full-time job at microsoft which paid all the remaining debt i had so you can get an idea of how big of a chunk you can get out of that 115 if you're an international student i was offered a 20 000 signing bonus and i knew at least i know now that that was negotiable up to 30 000 which i did not negotiate for so next time make sure you negotiate there was a 20 000 housing stipend which you didn't have to spend on housing i actually just pocketed the whole thing so now you're up to 40k of of signing bonus that's pretty good 120k worth of stock now that's actually worth over 215 000 now because the stock goes up over time but remember that vests over four years so you need to be at the company for four years to get that whole thing um and it's broken out over a year so you get i don't know 50 grand a year whatever it is and then on top of that of course you get your base pay which you can just find on glassdoor so if you get a position like me and you've kind of followed the similar pattern to the numbers i've shared with you already then you're gonna be able to grind out that debt in two to three years if you're really on top of it and that's actually not so bad like that's pretty good right remember i assumed that you got three in america three in canada but it's possible that you get six in canada zero in america which is going to leave you with more debt it's possible you get zero in uh canada and all six in america if you're like a super genius you know there's that 12 year old kid that goes to waterloo he probably falls into this category and majority the overwhelming majority of people do not fall into that category but who knows maybe you're really smart maybe you get two and four maybe you get one in five who knows let's go through those numbers just to see what the possible range of debt is so let's assume that you got all six of them in canada i went through the numbers i found that you in total made eighty eight thousand dollars that's much less than 154 if you're a canadian student that's going to land you in about 41 000 of debt not so bad like i said if you had my full-time job offer you would be able to pay that off immediately international students that's going to leave you with about'2 000 worth of debt so yeah that's a lot if you're an international student keep that in mind but you know maybe you can really focus on getting one of those you know american internships that's that are gonna pay a lot more uh there's no reason you can't do it now let's end on a more bright note and assume that you got all six in america that's actually going to give you 209 thousand dollars a lot of money so if you're a canadian student that would give you about 80 000 in your pocket remember i said that we didn't really factor into consideration how much money it cost while you were on co-op terms if you're an international student and you got all six jobs in america that's going to land you with about 61 000 of debt which is really not that much and let's say you went to facebook for example and you got a return offer facebook is known for giving incredible signing signing bonuses for their return offers so you did an internship at facebook you went back they gave you like a hundred thousand dollar signing bonus you have no debt now that again is like the best best best case scenario the chances that that's gonna be you are not impossible but they're definitely pretty low now remember that these things are are kind of amortized you're going to have debt for the first few years and then you'll really take the big chunks out of that debt towards the last three years so don't be so concerned that you're racking up debt because it's going to start coming down i think i peaked at about 30 32 000 of debt then my debt started to come down and i was able to get it down pretty low of course i did take that one job in ireland which actually took a lot of my earning potential away because they only paid half of what my current job was paying when i was on my fifth internship so uh remember keep that into consideration it's not all about money but if money is is important to you as it was to me i hope this helps your your finances uh when you're thinking about this i get this question quite a lot so thank you guys so much for watching this video i will see you next time have a good one
