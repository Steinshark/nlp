hello welcome to today's video since the start of 2021 i've been asked to make this video 46 times and before this year i've lost count of how many times it was but basically i've caved in i'm gonna be making some videos on how to use nuke so the first thing i want to say very very early on is nuke is actually free there's the full version of nuke which is obviously very expensive i think it's like seven thousand pounds for a license there's nuke indy which i currently use in all my videos and the foundry's very kindly sponsored my youtube channel i think it's 400 a year it's like a rolling subscription thing and then originally what i was using for my videos for about two years is new non-commercial and that's the version that's free and that i recommend everyone gets hold of immediately strangely i think lots of people don't realize there is a free version of nuke because i get messages on a regular basis saying i want to learn nuke but i can't afford the full license now you can and everyone can because it's free my goal with this is basically to make the videos i wish existed when i was learning nuke because i wanted people to say this is the button and after effects and this is how you do it in nuke but that didn't exist so i'm going to try and single handedly demystify all of that and with all that said let's get into the video to download nuke what you want to do is go to the foundries website and then come up here and under products click on nuke and then if you scroll right down to the bottom you can see that there's a non-commercial version of nuke so click find out more and then scroll down a little bit to this box here and click get it now basically what you have to do is sign up for an account once you've done that you can go to the downloads page choose the download for your operating system and then it will start to download one slightly quirky thing about nuke is it downloads all of them at the same time so if i search for nuke it's got new kindy and then the fully licensed versions of nuke as well the one you want to open is nuke x non-commercial so if you didn't know this is what nuke looks like the way i have mine laid out is slightly different to the default it looks something like this so you have the node graph down here and the viewer and then your properties and stuff on the side doesn't make any difference to the way it functions so don't worry about that for now the key difference between after effects and nuke is nuke is a node based compositor whereas after effects uses layers kind of like a video editor nuke has what's called nodes and these are these things if i add some basically each one of these allows you to do different things to the footage so you can blur it or change the color or move it around this is a really really simple nuke script from the render challenge that i'm doing on discord this month by the way if you want to get involved in that the link is below the way it works is like a flow chart so you start at the top with a piece of footage or something or an image and then as you go down you apply lots of different nodes to it which do things to change the way the image looks and then right at the bottom you have an output and this is basically the final image so a quick tour of the ui this is the viewer and this is where all of the footage will appear and if i read in something like a lens flare this is where the image will show up down here we basically have the timeline this is where you have all the frames of the footage and you have your kind of pretty standard play and pause buttons and there's a few others for like stepping through frame by frame and keyframes and all sorts some of these buttons are a bit overwhelming at first but to be honest a lot of these ones like down here i pressed i think once on my first day just to find out what they did and haven't touched them since in four years so bear in mind that a lot of these things you don't need over here is the node graph which i mentioned earlier and this is basically where all the nodes go and adding these nodes and changing the values inside of them will directly change how the image looks to add nodes there's a few different things you can do one way is to come over here to this toolbar on the side and these are basically all the groups of nodes that you can add in nuke i never actually use this i think it's a bit clunky to have to come over and click on these every time you want to open a node so what pretty much everyone does is just hover over the node graph and press tab and then you can search for a node here and as you start typing it will give you a list of all the nodes that start with those letters you can do things like add favorites for the ones that you use most often and there's also keyboard shortcuts for the ones you use most often like transform is t grade is g blur is b it's really handy to memorize all of these but definitely don't worry about that straight away one of the main ways that a node based compositor like nuke differs from something like after effects or hit film that uses layers is you never actually import any footage so you might notice there's no like media bin full of footage over here that i have in my project nuke uses what's called read nodes to bring in footage and that's what this is here and if you hit r on the node graph it will basically open up a file browser and from here you can search for a piece of footage and then double click it and it will bring it in and this node here is your footage so it has a file path here in the properties that goes to wherever this footage is saved on your hard drive and you can move it around put it wherever you want in the script but this is how you bring in footage and then at the polar opposite end of the script once you've added a load of nodes and finished working on the comp we use what's called a write node to basically render out the finished work this would be the equivalent of pressing the render button or export or something and inside the node is basically the same as the render queue and after effects so you tell it where the file is going to go somewhere on your hard drive and then when you have all the settings ready to go you literally just hit render and choose the frame range and everything you want to render and press okay okay so some of the most basic nodes in nuke obviously we've explained what the read node does one of the key differences between after effects and nuke is the way you combine images so i've got two bits of footage here one is of me and one is of an explosion but because there's no layers here like in after effects it's not like i can just take one and put it above the other and merge them together so to do this in nuke you use what's called a merge node the keyboard shortcut for this is m and i highly recommend just using the keyboard shortcut because you add merge nodes all the time the merge node has two inputs and basically the way this works is it takes the a input and puts it over the b input i like to think of b as the background so i'm going to plug b into my background footage and then i'm going to plug the a input into the new piece of footage and if i look at the merge node now you can see it's put the explosion on top and inside of the merge node there's an operation drop down box that has all of the blending modes you'll probably recognize most of these as lots of the names are fairly universal across all software so for example because this is fire if i said it's a screen then it will probably blend a lot better currently really dark so if i add a grade node and just punched this up to like 30. then you can see it works a lot better this whole time i forgot to mention the viewer node as well the viewer node is basically controls what you see in the viewer the shortcut for looking at a node instead of just plugging it in every time with the mouse is you select the node you want to look at and hit one so you can do this to anything and it will allow you to look at that specific node wherever it is in the node graph and you can see at the moment this input is called input one and the cool thing is you can use all of the numbers on the keyboard so for example i can select the read node and press two and it will create a second input that's going to the read node and then what i can do is hit one and two and flick between the two inputs this is quite handy for comp if you're flicking between maybe a reference image and then what you're actually comping or if you want to flick between the original plate and some cleanup to compare the difference and you can do this all the way from one to nine and zero as well so i can add an input for all of these and just flick between them like a madman the next thing most people will probably try and do if they're coming from after effects is try and drag this around in the viewer and if you click and drag you might be like why isn't this working to do anything in nuke whether it's moving around in the viewer or changing the colors or anything you have to add a node it's basically like adding a process each time and there are different nodes for doing all of those different things but the basic one for moving something around is called a transform node you can press tab and search for transform and it's here or the keyboard shortcut if you're really fancy is just press t and the transform node then brings up this tool that you can use to drag it around in the viewport you can rotate it you can scale it and the more common way when you're doing something a little bit more fiddly is you can actually punch in the numbers up here one of the things i really like about nuke is you can use the up and down arrows to change the values in these boxes the next most common one is probably the grade note so again you can either search for it or the shortcut is g and the grade node has a load of different sliders four things you can do to change the exposure and the color of the image a lot of these like lift and multiply and offset i basically never use anyway the main ones i focus on are gain and gamma similar to how you have highlights and shadows in after effects or premiere or something basically gain is kind of like the highlights and gamma is the darker areas of the image as well as turning these up and down to change the luminance values you can also click this color wheel and it will pop out all of the controls for the individual red green and blue channels and from here you can make it more red or more green or more blue and then there's also these three sliders on the side the far right one is basically just the luminance values and then the middle and far left one are basically what would be considered color temperature and tint in adobe products so this one makes it warmer or cooler and then the middle one is like a shift between magenta and green and you have the same for all of these so gamma has the same controls and obviously all the other ones as well and then the other ones that i use quite regularly for cg stuff is the white point and the black point this is basically the absolute darkest value in the image and the absolute lightest value in the image you may also notice that on some nodes there's a triangle on the side and this is actually a mask input and if i click and drag this you can see it expands into another input with a mask and the idea with this is you can plug in something that has an alpha channel so if i just draw a very quick mask and then i take the mask input and plug it into the roto then when i change something in the grade node it's only going to affect the area that i've drawn the mask unlike in after effects where you just grab the pen tool and start drawing on it if you want to draw a mask in nuke you have to actually add a roto node the shortcut for the roto node is o and once you add a roto node over here on the side of the viewer this popup will appear with some extra tools the most important one is probably the shape tool and this is the one that has all the different options for the kind of masks you can draw as you can probably imagine the roto node can be used for just masking out certain bits of an image so if i do this you can see it just cuts out the areas i've selected as well as the roto node we also have what's called the roto paint node and again you can search for it or the keyboard shortcut is p and the rotor paint node basically has a load of what could basically be considered photoshop brushes in it so there's an actual brush tool which you can use to just draw on the image there's also a clone tool which is similar to the clone stamp in adobe stuff and you can use it to clone parts of the image there's tools for blurring and sharpening and smearing the image and there's also burn and dodge tools which again are very similar to photoshop and these can be used to make an image lighter or darker obviously if you look at these lists you can see there's loads of other notes that i haven't mentioned yet lots of these even professionals will probably tell you they don't use very often or not at all i don't even know what bilateral does but the ones i've covered in this video are kind of like the bread and butter of nuke once you kind of understand them you'll be in a good place so if you made it this far into the video i hope you've learned something and hope this video was useful now that's the basic housekeeping of doing a quick tour of the ui and talking about the basics of how nuke works i'm gonna start releasing some videos on more specific topics like keying and cleanup and tracking leave a comment below if there's anything specific you'd like to see or know how to do in nuke and until next time thanks very much for watching and i'll see you very soon [music] you
