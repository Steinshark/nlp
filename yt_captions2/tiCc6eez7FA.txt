how could something be so beautiful and yet a total hot mess i don't know you'll have to ask my ex-wife hey disclaimer it's part of a growing trend in pc hardware to take the icky messy cables that have cluttered our gaming rigs for my entire life and hide them away by moving all the connectors to the back of the motherboard and i mean sounds pretty good to me it's not like we were using this space for anything else but not everyone's happy with this trend paul's hardware just posted a video criticizing rear mounted power connectors and he makes some pretty good points computers don't run on magic so you still have to run cables from your power supply anyway there's no cooling benefit to this whatever the marketing might tell you and this could turn out to be a compatibility nightmare if every vendor goes down their own proprietary path kind of like what's happened with rgb and that last one is my biggest concern about the future of zero cable solutions i mean i don't want to buy a new case every time i upgrade my motherboard fortunately i don't have to and the janky adventure that you're about to watch is brought to you by mexico they're iris 4k ai webcam features a large sony starvest sensor for incredible low light performance and wide dynamic range it's also got a 90 degree field of view and ai powered framing and tracking which automatically keeps you in the shot all without installing any software on your computer more about the iris later the development of the msi b650m ape wi-fi motherboard began as a collaboration between motherboard manufacturer msi and the billy billy video creator ape who has spent over half of the last decade lobbying for cable 3 pcs and who if this is anything to go by is finally seeing his vision come to life look at this no 24 pin no 8 pin no front connectors at all they're all on the back and if all goes according to his plans this am5 board is just the start of the diy ape revolution that will extend to many more components including redesigned gpus and power supplies only time will tell if this is going to ultimately catch on or if full end up seeing any of it outside of china but it's definitely something to keep an eye on i gotta say if i was looking for a starting point this is pretty much where i'd want to be i would describe this as a premium mid-tier board it obviously uses a b650 chipset but it's got really robust i o including 20 gigabit per second usbc wi-fi 6e two and a half gig lan and even a clear cmos button super convenient it's got a robust vrm design and cooling so as long as msi engineered the bios correctly any am5 cpu should run its best in here of course the star of the show is the rear mounted connectors which should give our finished build an extraordinarily clean look given the price of our board we're going to have links in the video description what we're aiming for today is a great pretty high end but also not overkill build so we've gone with the amd ryzen 5 7600x it's only twenty dollars more than the base 7600 now and i consider that a fair price for the nearly one gigahertz increase in base clock speed and it's just a great gaming chip with six super fast cores and support for the latest technologies including pcie gen 5 and ddr5 memory speaking of which we've gone with a g-skill flare x5 ddr5 kit at 6000 mega transfers per second we had actually planned to stick with just 16 gigs but at a hundred dollars this 32 gig kit was less than 20 dollars more than a 16 gig kit at the same speed lordy has ram ever gotten cheap lately and so has storage this two terabyte corsair mp600 pro would have been more than 200 at the start of the year now it's available for just 140 bucks or at least the not stupid air-cooled one is that that's the one we're using it didn't matter because we were going to strip the heatsink off it anyway to be clear there are a lot of good options out there for m.2 drives right now but we like this one's mix of price and performance along with course our solid reputation for being a trustworthy bro for their users with our nvme safely tucked away we can install our cpu cooler we've gone with the noctua nhl12s but instead of the normal low profile fan ha ha um ah we've gone with this you might have seen this in our recent computex coverage this is the alpha cool apex stealth metal fan it uses a patented decoupled design with separate housings o-rings and a plastic shroud that results in according to them anyway i haven't heard it yet a very low noise level they're totally modular and the zinc housing because this thing ever heavy is available in black white this gorgeous chrome that's going to look great with our build you've heard it here first a special edition gold finish that they just told us about this morning these aren't out yet but they're coming soon and alpha cool expects them to retail for 30 each stats a lot for a bang for the butt gaming pc but we're also trying to achieve a certain look here and that is just mwah uh oh here's something that didn't really occur to me we need an extension to plug in this fan which is fine but why would you have the connector for the cpu fan on the back then you just have to run it around to the back actually you know what a i still think this might be better i like it having the connectors on the back of the motherboard definitely um introduces some risk of stabbing now we know also i really want to rip off this daisy chain thing no there's no i'm taking it off no i'll do it properly though okay all right all right goodbye sorry goodbye daisy chain there we go hey nice and clean now oh yeah that's more like it not gonna have that daisy chain cable hanging off my cpu fan that looks this freaking awesome all of that brings us to our case the fractal pop mini air at ninety dollars is a well-built attractive micro atx case but that's not why we chose it see the thing is only a handful of cases are designed for the diy ape connector scheme like this one behind me from asus all those cutouts that's amazing so realistically then i would have taken just about any case that has ample space behind the motherboard tray where we're gonna have all those connectors coming out which raises a question why this you absolute madman you just showed us that you already have the perfect case for this build right there why aren't you using it ah the thing is that case like the other diy 8 ready models is china exclusive meaning that if you're watching this video on youtube you aren't going to be able to get one so the way that i see it it's only fair that i should share that same experience plus i've already got the dremel out jordan you're the one who mapped out approximately where the connectors need to come through is that right that's right do you really intend for me to remove all of this all of that uh there's gonna be like nothing left just a little sliver of metal holding the motherboard tray into place that's why you want uh the case specifically designed for this generally never have second thoughts [music] i'll take that face shield it's spitting a lot of steel into my face [music] it's not very white anymore is it you can fit so much clean build in this bad boy let's try blowing it out man just carrying it over here i got a nasty oh oh maybe there's hope for this yet that's how we do peels in the big time something yeah it's white again uh oh the motherboard tray surely there are no metal shards left in here that could short out our sensitive electronics and cut open our sensitive hands uh is there a plan for that yeah we got some gasket material to put around those holes so you're not going to cut yourself off this is not perfect it might be better than nothing though it's just this little kind of u-channel gromedy stuff here uh it definitely looks better than the heat destroyed raw edges screw it let's just put the motherboard in okay um yeah sure oh you know what that totally worked uh i yeah i didn't really like the sound of that either oh it could be related to my fan cable here hold on no no no wait wait wait hold on dude it's all good oh oh it's in this hole doesn't really line up which got me thinking you know gee what's up with the tolerances on this case because all these back ones do i think when we cut it it might have affected how it sits a little so we're gonna have these are gonna be uh structural screws attached to a structural motherboard and almost nothing else needs to go in here except the big gpu that's going to ruin everything of course what we haven't addressed is the situation at the back it looks like we almost have enough clearance to plug fan connectors in here almost i need to do some finagling there everything else though looks like we almost nailed it oh uh oh what's jfp2 here because it's covered covered in a way that has a rubber grommet and won't short out that might also explain why the um this screw was hard to screw in it'll probably work right yeah the only way to know for sure is to plug in our power supply and see how it goes now before you rush to the comments and tell us about how this thing is overkill we ran into some logistical challenges for this video okay so we're using a seasonic snow silent 1050 watt power supply which pairs perfectly with these custom length cable mod cables that we happen to have kicking around in the warehouse if you were to recreate this build for yourself i would strongly recommend something more in the range of 750 to 850 watts and i would also recommend picking up something that is compatible with custom length cables because otherwise you're going to take your cable management problem in the front of the case and you're just going to move a cable management problem to the back of the case we want to have something that's not so long that we've got a whole bunch extra to hide back here and this is actually looking like it might close uh how sure are we that this back side panel is going to close jordan uh 80 from here that is very low um i feel like oh what was that that was a motherboard tray that is not very strong anymore letting go i think wait what happened oh this screw came out like just totally came out maybe one of them somehow is 6 32. this isn't a brand new case it's been used before so maybe somebody screwed up and put the wrong standoff there that's what i'm hoping for and that is in fact what it was oh good okay sign up for a notification for when we get the knock to uh color scheme screwdriver okay this isn't the noctual one but you guys get the point editor cleverly replaced this with the noctua one in my hand hey that one two different color schemes you know what though this is great for making videos i was just standing here thinking now i have now i have to round and do this and i'll do that no now i have to just stand here and plug in all the connectors this is awesome that is a wow that is a very high profile connector yes they do make right angle adapters for that whoa no way no way no way past linus or realistically past alex probably bought this no way this way no no no no no no that's okay that's okay that's okay that's okay see we're gonna come down like this oh yeah not bad at all that just saved the day i mean how uncool would that be nice a nice cable-free system too bad none of the ports work not gonna lie this is tripping me out a little bit though i just don't know which way is up and which way is right and i'm in topsy-turvy land uh my front panel audio thing is here because that makes perfect sense yep in mirror reality and i don't know paul i think i might kind of like it how's the underside of that bus paul wow that is so clean and i didn't even have to do that much work on the cable management back here okay i mean we needed this special adapter other than that pretty easy okay wish me luck everyone how about good luck no it needs to be good luck you don't wish people bad luck luck of any form okay hey that is sick and other than getting your hands on the motherboard all you need to recreate this build is a few dollars in dremel cutting discs oh and you'll probably want to change the power supply to a more reasonable one and you'll probably want to change the gpu see the thing is we wanted to use a radeon 6950xt that thing is a flipping awesome value right now but again our choices were dictated a little bit by aesthetics this gigabyte aero rtx 4070 looks flipping awesome and that is the only real justification that we have for choosing this over the 6950xt truth is that it's kind of hard to justify any nvidia card right now at least unless you're spending over a thousand dollars which we are not oh actually before we put this in this is another really cool idea from ape instead of having this 16 pin connector out here where it's gonna stick out and look all gross he had the idea of hiding it in between the fins here so it just kind of like i don't know it was hidden kind of ingenious because of the ease of this build we haven't gotten as much overhead footage from our mexico camera up here as we otherwise might have but this is a pretty good opportunity the m.2 cover had to come off and the order of operations here is very important so about that's going to go there then this is going to go back on with this removed whoops this is going to go here nice oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah i mean as far as ugly cable messes go that's pretty acceptable hey that is not bad okay all right i'm okay with it if that's all the cable that i have to look at in my system forget about it check this out look how heavy that freaking fan is just hitting the tables like whoa it's as quiet as they say it is though i'm looking forward to hearing it or not hearing it what do you think colin is it gonna post oh that's a good sign oh wait what security violation but oh okay all our memory is detected cpu turboing over five gigahertz comfortably there is something we need to adjust we need to make sure that we have our xmp profile enabled but otherwise it's full builds and oh good that big security error was just because we had this plugged in and tpms enabled so it got really unhappy that we were trying to boot from this usb drive don't love the amount of work it was but i love this computer like wow i just want to do a quick cinebench here to see if we're going to get oh dude just freeze see that's the thing i wanted to do just a couple quick benchmarks and see if this thing performs as normal works as normal because small brand motherboards sometimes they don't turbo properly and stuff like that then again the whole bios was all msi msi branded and everything and oh oh it looks like it actually might have just been cinebench that crashed okay it's running again there is some weirdness hardware info is not reporting core temperatures for some reason but it's turboing just fine we're running at 4.8 gigahertz and performance here looks totally in line with what i'd expect for 7600x maybe just don't overthink it for now how about games i don't know what's more impressive the fact that this thing just immediately worked exactly as expected or the fact that it is so flipping quiet right now we are turboing to five gigahertz right now our gpus at nearly three gigahertz and this whole computer is nearly silent my microphone's right here just whoosh you know what i'm really curious about though how much of it is the metal fan wow that does not sound like a fan that is spinning that fast and this is really impressive frequency makes it really easy to block out even with a glass panel i can barely hear it i really want to do something about the power connector on the gpu whether it's an additional slot at the back of the card like we've seen from apple and asus in the past or whether it's just hiding the connector better like ape suggested but overall this is a pretty clever idea that does make a clean build a lot easier well easier at least it is properly adapted case design ultimately then with the combination of a new motherboard standard that requires new case designs from case manufacturers and piling on the potential additional innovations in gpu power supply and cooler design ape still has a long road ahead of him and getting this adopted but i wish him luck because paul's ultimately right that not everyone wants to mod their case and we need someone anyone who has a clear vision to push this thing forward rather than leaving motherboard manufacturers to just pursue their own independent paths i mean that's why we still have front panel connectors that aren't standardized just like we have this segway that isn't standardized to our sponsor mexico the next ago iris 4k ai webcam features a large 1 over 1.8 inch sony starvis sensor that delivers crystal clear image quality for streaming video conferencing and content creation even in challenging light
