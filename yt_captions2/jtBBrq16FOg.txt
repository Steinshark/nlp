ladies and gentlemen in this video we are going to do two things first i'm going to give you an update about the really strange and rather upsetting story about dingly ren the current world chess champion here in january of 2024 but then the second thing that we are going to do is i'm going to show you the most beautiful chess game that dingly ren has ever played and that game happened in 2017 it is a breathtaking game of chess frankly it should be considered art and the purpose of doing that is to hope that we get that dingly ren back at some point in the future that creative and inspired chess genius that he is and the type of incredible chess that he is capable of playing so here's where we stand in january of 2024 dingly ren is the classical world champion magnus carlson is the rapid and blitz world champion and also the number one rated player in the world across all the formats magnus declined to participate in the world championship cycle that ultimately culminated in april of 2023 dingl ren played against yan pishi he won the match then he played a tournament in romania like a week later that he had already agreed to play didn't do that great and then he vanished the world champion of chess vanished that is not an understatement he has not played a rated chess game of standard also known as classical long games rapid or blitz in eight months if not longer and he not only has not played a classical rapid or blitz game over the board he hasn't played online since december of 2022 dingly ren has played three rapid games on chess.com and that last one he disconnected due to internet issues lost basically on time and never played again he played three games in all of 2023 on chess.com in rapid format that's crazy that is uh that's wild i'm not sure when's the last time a world chess champion reigning hasn't played a tournament in eight months now listen i only hope ding is okay i hope he's okay mentally i hope he's okay physically and and there is going to be another world championship the candidates tournament which determines who's going to play against dingl ren for the world championship is happening in a couple of months it's going to happen in toronto canada it's going to feature players like yan ponesi prag nanda of india gesh hikara nakamura fano carana i mean i might as well just name the entire field and they're going to play against dingl ren unless he doesn't defend his title now dingl ren is playing in the tata steel masters that's a tournament that happens quite soon it's happening actually in a week we're going to see dingl ren back in action that's a tournament that happens in the netherlands in early january uh and it's mid january really and it's called the wimbledon of chess so we'll see what happens but ding l ren did reappear at a tournament in china something of a warm-up this was called the first ever chinese chess kings type of thing it was uh naturally was a field of some of the best players in china like yu yangi wanga wei uh jinai uh and uh there was some other uh young guys that had to qualify to play but the craziest thing about this event it was a rapid tournament just finished um d got fourth place he tied for fourth place he actually lost in the semi-final to wanghao and then he lost the third and fourth place match to wei and the reason for that is well he's probably a little bit out of shape like he hasn't played an elite tournament in8 months if any athlete sat out for eight months the same thing would happen doesn't matter if it's tennis doesn't matter if it's football doesn't matter if it's baseball which is not a real sport but you know you get you get my point like he's got to be active and i have no idea what the future holds for him but i do know what he was his whole career and that's the purpose of today's video obviously i will be covering t steel uh which is coming up but um today i'd like to go back in time i'd like to go back in time uh about 6 and a half years ago this was a game played in the chinese chess league every country not every country but many many countries in the world have a league they play like a competitive team format and um in uh in this event by the way i think the the the the names here are wrong like i think chinese and indian names are are frequently written with the last name first i think it should be byin shei so i'm going to i'm going to change that i'm going to uh i'm going to do it like this i think that's correct i mean i'm assuming that's correct i think his name is tech technically pronounce uh junai i think i think that's how you would you would pronounce it uh but and i try to pronounce all the names correctly so if that is incorrect then i apologize but i'm doing my best now uh jun shai has been a grandmaster for uh many years he's very strong even though he's very young he's born in 1999 so he's 23 24 which is uh which is pretty wild uh i guess he's 24 20 yeah 1 and 23 years 2 before maybe maybe turn 25 in january and this was one of the most incredible games i've ever seen so sit back relax uh put me up in the smart tv let me take a sip of coffee because i'm going to need i'm going to finish my coffee and then you know we'll take a little little break here i really hope dingly ren comes back i mean i i i hope i hope we get something out of him i i i don't know what's going on um i don't know if it's the stress of the situation burnout a hatred of chess but handcuffed to play it i don't know so uh jin started with d4 knight f6 c4 e6 knight c3 this is a very standard opening uh knight c3 is trying to play e4 this setup by black enables black to play a very quick bishop to b4 pinning the knight to the king uh knight c3 is taking on that challenge it's a very critical move because black plays the critical defense of the nmso uh and now we have many many many many lines the main lines being queen to c2 the rubenstein with e3 uh and uh you could play f3 which is called the sameish uh a3 or maybe a technically i think a3 is called the sameish but f3 e4 type of stuff white plays knight f3 though which is a sideline it's not the most popular move the reason for that is you could have played knight f3 without playing knight c3 and if black had gone here you would have never played knight c3 so that's kind of like you would go knight bd2 or bishop d2 or queen d2 um but uh the point is that this is you know this is still a move of course it's just equal ding castled he's not doing anything with the bishop yet because he wants white to waste a move attacking it white does not waste the move attacking it he pins the knight to the queen developing next he will play e3 finish up like this now ding plays c5 in the nso with black you choose which of these two pawns are going to be used to attack the center or you just go with both um c5 is fine sometimes you take take and then you play d6 you actually don't attack the center right away you play very solidly put a lot of pawns on dark squares and you fight against white's uh doubled pawns here and white says you're stupid those doubled pawns are not a weakness and for giving up your dark squ bishop you're going to give me the center and then a lot of space it's kind of like a silent uh conversation uh which is basically all the chess is now e3 was played by uh by jin and then he wants to play bishop here and he wants the castle c takes d4 and now white plays a sideline a sideline is a move that is by far less popular than the other moves uh e takes d4 and knight takes d4 uh well knight takes d4 is actually not a not a great move because queen goes here and there's kind of a a complete inability to defend your position so you would need to play bishop takes bishop takes takes takes king e2 uh and then be down a pawn with a with a really stupid king but then you could play king f3 and then meme around and lose uh but byin shik here plays queen takes d4 the idea of queen takes d4 is to put pressure and open the defile basically he just doesn't want to close the defile he wants to keep the queen here he's willing to take the attack on his queen to slide back or that way not to g4 but maybe to h4 f4 and then bring the rook so we have knight c6 queen d3 and now we see this position right white might castle white might just play rook d1 and try to castle this way uh now ding could immediately go for the center but first he asks jin shai like what are you doing here what are you doing with the bishop you know you're obviously not going to take so you're going to go down this way or you going to go this way and uh ding does not mess around here so rather than stalling at all with any more moves ding attacks the center and the reason he's able to do this move is because white doesn't actually have the ability to take with the knight meaning let's just say the position was uh something like this this would be a much worse situation because the knight actually does pressure the center and then you are threatening to take take and take again but with the bishop on b4 that's not the case and if you play a3 with white i will happily do this take quickly finish up my development i'll be in good shape but after rook to d1 dingly run like i said wastes absolutely no time he plays the move d5 and in this position he says i'm kind of tired of being pinned i'm not going to take i'm not going to play your game g5 so ding breaks a rule all right not like a rule like you know he didn't move his pawn three squares he breaks a uris in chess in chess we say you don't want to push pawns in front of your king because you're going to weaken your king which is a good rule for 99% of chess players but in chess rules are meant to be broken in chess you are taught something which is useful for a massive part of the rating ladder and then you get to a point where you can make exceptions you have to get good enough where you can break certain rules the reason why black is able to play a move like this is because it pushes the bishop backwards and immediately black is able to seize what's called the initiative the knight comes to the center applying pressure to the bishop and the knight which is pinned to the king white is two moves away from consolidating but he's never going to get those two moves cuz if you play bishop b2 i play queen a5 and all of a sudden sudden you cannot defend your knight if you play rook c1 i'm going to grab this pawn which you can't take because of the pin so that is why you are able to play a move like g5 also you're not worried about the open king you're not worried about the open king that's not you it's not good don't you know don't there's nothing there there's nobody can come help you so bishop g3 knight e4 and gin by plays knight d2 blocking the pin and trying to trade the knight now ding does what every good fighter does he fakes the shot he he fakes an attack with his knight to get a reaction out of his opponent to go backwards and he puts the knight on c5 attacking the queen so the queen moves out of the way and now he's really attacking white with this move d4 this is a really big problem you cannot take because that invites massive problems the queen goes back now i'll play e5 and get the bishop out it's a really really really bad position i will avalanche my pawns white is still two moves away from consolid and he's never going to get those two moves so instead of that byen sh plays knight f3 all right and the idea is that the pawn can't move because of the pin which is why ding plays e5 okay nice defending this but if you look at the position that pawn is capturable right in fact white might actually have to take it because if you play something like bishop here i'll get the queen out of the way there is no pin and you are still pinned so you're going to lose your knight so bajin takes a deep breath says all right you know what let's have some fun knight takes e5 knight takes e5 and now there are many many many head spinning complications black cannot just take back because then he will lose this pawn so he can't do that what he can do is get the queen out this way and put pressure he can also get the queen out this way and put pressure he can also play rook e8 and continue to attack white's king which is still in the center but instead of all of that the inspired dingly ren played the unbelievable move pawn takes knight this man sacrificed his entire queen he decided now was his moment pawn takes knight white has nothing better white has to take the queen and the idea for ding was before he would capture back he would play an in between move pawn takes b2 check okay pawn takes b2 check with an attack on the king this pawn is very menacing it's a square away from queening at all times white really would like to get rid of it but his rook is also hanging now you look at me here i think king is under attack rook is under attack of course you save both you got you got to save both you got to get out it's not so easy because then black immediately follows up with a haymaker put pressure on the pin piece white comes back to play defense black brings another piece into the game and at this point you would have to go for queen b2 maybe even knight e4 look at this i mean how do do you deal with all of this pressure the computer is not intimidated the computer always manages to find a way you know the computer goes to an endgame and thinks i'll probably survive but byin is not a not a computer he's a human being and he decides i'm going to bring my king up i'm going to give my rook up and then i'm going to take the pawn now there's no more headaches now there's no more headaches okay i'm safe which is what he thought dingler ren run though he he knew he had something up his sleeve so again black could get the queen right back but this is like investing in something and pulling it out the same day and i'm not talking about crypto pump and dump like i'm talking about you know uh actually before you take back better move is to go here first and then take that's not what we're trying to do queen takes b2 ding plays knight a4 continuing his initiative an initiative in chess is a series of moves where you attack your opponent but you improve your position so you attack the queen the bishop is defended by the knight but then the knight is going to come in here and force the king out that's exactly what happens queen c2 knight c3 king f3 right queen c2 knight c3 king f3 now it looks like there's a checkmate here there's no checkmate all right there's no checkmate uh g4 check doesn't work knight takes g4 look how quickly white can get a winning position by the way black has to be very careful black's pieces are nice but you trade a couple of them off black has no attack also dingly is down two points of material right so g4 knight takes now what if you play knight takes bishop takes and then g4 well king is safe king is out king is in danger in theory but there's no checks so you know like is it really is it good no no there's nothing no so what do you play here well ding len had planned ahead and in this position he played one of the most badass moves i've ever seen in my life king is trying to escape get to his vacation home you want to take the knight we got bishop e5 like black has to act now he's got to act now cuz white is going to play h4 white is actually going to turn the attack black uh back on black that's what you're going to do so in this position my you could pause here try to find it if you if you really want to you want to play like the uh the immortal game of dingly ren in this position not only did we stop the king's escape we rethread checkmate with black with the absolutely gangster move rook to d4 oh my god it seals the fourth rank shut threatens pawn to g4 which is m that's m if you take that's mate a damn you might as well m with the pawn and the other idea of rook d4 is the rook is untouchable because when you take the rook there's this oops rook d4 is crazy when you get hit with a move like rook d4 that's when you start soul surging you start wondering why you showed up to the tournament you start wondering how you're losing to a 5-year-old that's licking his fingers and eating chez hits at the board not these guys cuz they're really really good but you who plays a chess tournament and plays a child and is like i can't believe i'm losing to this tiny human being these guys are grown-ups but you still get hit with a move like rook d4 you're like oh yeah oh that's probably the end so byin plays h3 makes sense he wants to stop g4 dingly ren continues to push pawns in front of his own king because there's only one king right now that's feeling very uncomfortable now white tries to survive bishop h2 he's ready for g4 and he's going to play king to g3 now the incredible thing about this position it's still hanging on a knife sge dingly ren has to continue to find the best moves it's minus 2.3 but only we know that they don't know that so ding plays g4 check white plays king g3 and now there is one and only one move to maintain the advantage black wants to play knight e4 check but he wants to do it in a way that white cannot go there if knight e4 now i play here and then the knight is hanging and the rook is hanging so you inverse the order first you play the only move rook d2 and you realize that is the second sacrifice of the rook oh my god oh my god you still can't take it's hanging it's completely unguarded but you can't take it because of this not only is it a fork it's also a discovered attack disrespect to the max rook to d2 the queen goes out which allows the knight to jump to e4 the best move there was to take the rook by the way by she like any normal humans like no i want to keep my queen knight e4 the king runs out to h4 and my my man ding just absolutely slaughters the king on h4 zips back with his bishop forces king takes h5 look at the king this man went on a spiritual journey this man went up up up up up he's just going straight up the board that's what he's doing king g oh my god the best move in this position is not with the rook or the knight or the knight or the bishop or the bishop it's king to g7 stopping any further king advancement and setting up the threat of a bishop move and rook h8 the silent and embarrassing defeat of the white king so byen chin knows this and he's like all right i got to act fast bishop to f4 coming to help the king we're going to play bishop h6 and maybe we'll play c5 and get the queen in there c5 queen f7 is lethal absolutely lethal let's not forget white still has a queen black does not d the ren plays bishop f5 giving up b7 which would normally be a collapse of the black position but rook to h8 is game over white plays bishop h6 check he's covering up not only is he covering up he's forcing the black king to block his own h file well that's got to be good defense and now he plays queen takes b7 the rook is hanging the knight is hanging the bishop is hanging if the knight moves if you play knight takes knight for example i'll take and look at the advantage it's gone it's gone has somehow this this this absolute clown standing on h5 will survive the attack you come back to try to defend yourself i'll bring my bishop out how has white not made it i don't know i don't know stranger things have happened but it's actually not so clear unless you are dingl ren to dingly ren it is clear because in this position he chucks the rook he chucks the knight he leaves the bishop exactly where it is and he plays rook takes f2 which is a move that doesn't even look like it makes sense but it does it has a threat the threat is knight g3 mate that rook stops the pawn from guarding g3 so rook f2 if you take the rook this is checkmate oh my rook f2 so now byin plays bishop g5 and if you take this let's say you play bishop takes g5 oh oh it's actually your king who's in danger and if you take with a knight you no longer have knight knight here i get this i get that i get and and again by a miracle this king is surviving it's a it's a puzzle it's like a rubik's cube this position bishop to g5 dingl ren finds the best move now he brings his rook and now with the king stranded and the threat of a mate with a king move the white king is stuck but knight takes f7 knight takes f7 one last dagger attempt by white to get rid of the rook but the knight stops the defending the g6 square and in this position dingly ren plays bishop g6 check forces the king to go backwards and now black to move what is the winning idea if you take the knight i play queen takes knight if you give me check we just repeat the position a couple of times i'll continue to dance my way out of it so how do you win you can't play knight e5 because the knight will just take well as it turns out out that is exactly what you do you have to get rid of the knight the knight has to stop guarding the bishop the knight has to stop guarding the bishop so you play knight e5 check deflecting the knight from the defense of the bishop on g5 in this position byin resigned because knight takes e5 bishop f5 check let's say the king goes here king g7 is mate and if you go to h4 king g7 is m in one and the reason you couldn't do this right away the reason you couldn't play bishop f5 right away is because after something like king h5 king g7 i would have taken your rook so the rook has to be deflected off of and the bishop and the way dingl ren wins this game is by sacrificing his knight to deflect the knight from both of those positions this was one of the craziest games i've ever seen dingler play this man from the opening sacrificed the pawn sacrificed a queen proceeded to put his rook on an untouchable square rook d4 you get hit with rook d4 it's over a ain't bouncing back and then he continues the attack with the only move rook d2 deflecting the queen out knight e4 check hunts the king to the corner sets up this absurd checkmating net and against all odds gives away all the rest of his pieces to threaten knight g3 mate what a game what a game excuse me that is not what happened knight f7 uh that is what happened knight e5 check i mean he sacrificed every piece he straight up gave away like half his army in this game what a game and i and i just wanted to show you this because man i i really hope we get maybe we won't get this dingler ren back but we we just get a dingler ren back he's going to be playing in t steel um it's the biggest mystery of the chess world he wins the world championship doesn't elaborate leaves but i hope he's all right the chess world is anxiously awaiting his return and uh we wish him nothing but the best hope you enjoyed this game from 2017 what a game this was i mean just an unbelievable game of chess um and that's all get out of here
