stack overflow gets i a i i assume they've been planning ai because if you've seen their usage chart recently it's just it's not looking good for stack overflow okay they're definitely on a downward trend a sharp downward trend since about late 2022. i wonder if something happened late 2022 if only there was like something late 2022 that completely destroyed everything hmm if only there was well look at that they're fixing it the overflow a i announcing overflow ai ai that way you don't have to get on by just stack overflow moderation lords instead ais can do it at significantly better more amazing speeds let's highlight the new features and products we have announced today from the stage of a we are developers today marks the beginning of a new and exciting era for stack overflow we are announcing our roadmap for integration of generative ai into our public platform i know they've been talking about uh i know that stack overflow has been like trying to sue or something like that open ai and people for effectively scraping their platform like uh and using it as you know as the basis for these ai tools and they get nothing from it and now they're like wait a second you're telling me that when you develop a community of people so willing to be pedantic that their pedantry knows no bounds and then you make money off of it that that could happen that people would trade that out no way and now they're angry i know anyways let's find out stack overflow for teams what the hell this okay this okay my friend my friend this just shows why you're doing this okay this happens okay this happens because you make this type of decisions okay do you see what happens here you may i believe there's the old phrase uh round and out you know what i mean uh in a brand new product areas like an id integration that brings the vast knowledge of 58 million questions and answers from our community right into the area where developers find focus and get work done we're putting it all under the uh all this work under the umbrella of overflow ai i like how they state how many questions there are because the thing is it's not about the magnitude of questions it's about the quality of questions and answers i wonder okay real question if you train an ai on stack overflow and i start programming do you think it will insult me i mean that in a real in a genuine sense because it's meant to like mimic their users i would assume that if you brought in this ai and you're like hey how do i read standard input uh mark this duplicate you're like um i just need to i just need to know how to read from the standard end sorry that's a duplicate question go check out this link oh no like you just constantly get marked as duplicate or opinionated i think it would be really good if we could do it this way uh that's an opinion sorry closed you're like damn it just give me the answer stack overflow ai just give it to me what are you doing the link is 10 years old and about c plus plus as i promised when we announced our goal in investing in ai our approach is unique our aim is to stay true to the original promise of stack overflow keeping our developer community at the center ensuring that trust and attribution are the core of what we build and that people who contribute their knowledge are recognized for their efforts what's more pythonic uh let's highlight the new features and products we announced from a stage of we are developers after that i'll provide more detail okay search first we are working on uh to introduce some powerful new capabilities for searching on our public site until now we've relied on lexical search trying to match users with the questions and answers based on keywords they've supplied but as i have announced today we'll be adding semantic search in a private alpha that is like how many alphas do you need it's private it's alpha you can't use it built on top of a vector database so that the response is generated from search query can more intelligently align with the topics the user is researching our goal here is to create a conversational human-centered search we want to make it possible for our public platform users to receive instant trustworthy and accurate solutions to the problem using conversational search powered by gen ai i don't trust stack overflow i feel like stack overflow has things that it's really good at and things that stack overflow is not good at you know what i mean like sometimes i really feel like i don't know if i like stack overflow at least with copilot to be completely fair co-pilot somebody actually put that code on the internet someone was like this code's good enough for the internet whereas how much of stack overflow is someone being like yeah it should be just like this it can be bad yeah i mean cycle flow is okay i really found it useful when i was really just starting but also when i was starting it was like 12 it was like 15 years ago when stack overflow is also just starting it was like a great time right you know documentation was on the low it was a different feel back then so i don't know what it's like today uh we're looking uh let's see uh we are looking at ways where responses generated can be attributed and cited using the highly trusted knowledge from the uh from the more than 58 million questions and answers in stack overflow with the ability to query the knowledge database for more personalized results and unlike other ai solutions if you're not finding what you're looking uh for among our public platforms large corpus of data the stack overflow community is there to fill the gaps that ai is unable to address enhanced search for stack overflow for teams again again shall we shell the graph uh the enhancements to search will also be coming to stack overflow for teams customers will be able to quickly find the most relevant answers and discover related knowledge uh leveraging trustworthy sources such as stack overflow for teams stack overflows public platform and other places as customer store knowledge such as confluence the world's worst wiki ever and github with more let's see with more added over time i confluence is the only place where as you start typing in the search bar you get answers and the answers are okay and when you hit search the answers get dramatically worse how did you build a search how did you build a search that gets worse when you process the final solution than the intermediate steps i do not understand that how did you do that how how how it is incredible to build a product that gets worse with more information the fi oh gosh come on the final solution you know what i'm trying to say the final input string don't even try that it's ridiculous um confluence sounds like an illness changed my mind it is uh enterprise knowledge ingestion uh overflow ai will also add a new capability to stack overflow for teams enterprise knowledge ingestion when creating a new instance or bringing on new teammates users can uh curate and build a knowledge base in minutes by leveraging existing and accurate and trusted content aiml will create the first drafts of tagging structures and recommend questions and answers by identifying the areas where your team is most frequently asking for good documentation or solutions in essence the ai efficiently bootstraps your stack overflow community allowing you to take advantage of key documents in the repositories that are not being discovered and reused this is where you accuse the chad meme where uh the guys like did you write documentation and the other chad's like no good luck bootstrapping good luck uh this frees up developers to focus on adding value by curating and refining the content uh to validate accuracy all knowledge will be discovered and reusable by the internal community and it'll include the quality slash accuracy indicators to make sure it stays relevant and accurate votes edits comments yep that's sure that these all sure help as your organization and tools evolve this capability allows users to easily integrate new documents in the future slack integration there we go to make this information easily accessible we integrate our stack overflow for teams knowledge with the bay let's see base with the stack overflows new stack plus one chat bot okay so when it said stack overflow for teams i'm not going to lie to you i thought they were talking about microsoft teams until right now i literally had no idea until i read the statement i feel stupid right now m night shaman milan plot twist right here i did not see this one coming at all the integration gathers generative solutions for the most technical challenge instantly okay this would be great i guess i could see this being really cool having a little i think just any chat bot ai powered word calculator would be great to have to give you uh to give you that honestly it'd be really good i would actually really like that uh visual studio code extension losers you should have done a neovim one honestly if you just do an ls if people you know what you should just do write lsps because they work in all editors you know what i mean just write an lsp why write a custom bespoke thing when you can just write an lsp just do that that's all you got to do it's like literally that simple um anyways it's probably an lsp honestly um uh ai community discussions uh developers will now have a new dedicated location for unbiased technical resources and responses from experts [applause] really really that that's what you're going for me where confluence where where do where do where do we define where do we define where do we define authentication rules completely random page unlike the one that appeared while typing this is confluence this is confluence to a t this you've actually created confluence oh tj that is beautiful this is beautiful oh let's see okay anyways uh jen a gen ai stack exchange will serve as a place for a community that is centered around knowledge sharing posting questions and answers about things like prompt engineering model training and broader field of machine learning okay i'm just i'm just gonna i'm just gonna i'm just gonna move over this section because i don't i i honestly i don't need any more community discussions honestly at this at this current moment the ai hypers if just they give me really they give me heavy nft feels right now okay i just need a moment i need them to go and do all their things once they solve all the world's problems with ai and then realize they didn't solve any of the world's problems with ai then we can have like a really awesome discussion about what we should do like i love the idea of word calculator getting into my editor and helping me with a lot of things i really like that i like co-pilot but i find i can also just like if you know your lsp and you know how to type in clever ways you could also just use an lsp and get the same work done almost instantaneously so it's like do you really get any actual benefit from co-pilot other than the occasional query which you cannot do uh like you know i like right now if i opened up go and i said how do i read from the standard in i don't know where the standard in is i assume it's like a reader or something like that how do you read light by line how do you do all these things right i don't know so having co-pilot yeah it's nice it's like google inside your editor okay fantastic but if you're asking me if i'm reading you know line by line from a file in rust it's not helping me right i already just know how to do that i just it's just not doing anything for me other than giving me suggestions that may or may not even be useful at all i don't want to have to read other people's code while i'm trying to code i do not believe copilot's a learning tool no copilot is fundamentally not a learning tool co-pilot is an extension of your knowledge tool whereas uh uh chat jeopardy that's a learning tool you use chat jeopardy to learn use copilot to execute they're very very different one's a push one's a pull model right copilot's a push model right it takes everything you're doing and just tries to constantly guess and help you jeopardy is like you you have to pull it hey i have this problem what do you think like i used it this morning to get multiple executables in my uh oh camel thing because i didn't know how to use those oh camel dune files and then when i tried to do it it was i was getting all to all these errors so i just had it explain to me of how to fix my dune file and i i mean i don't know if i fixed it well but i fixed it you know maybe [music] um but i still did something and so that's cool and so that's kind of how i look at it is that you got to look at the difference between a push and a pull they're very very very different models cody on the other hand i'm very excited about cody uh the uh source graph has been talking to me not tj by the way cody uh i'm actually excited about cody because i think cody is going to be like the ultimate if they do it right if cody is if if cody is nailed well and they do it i don't even know what that means i don't talk to prime yeah we don't talk about that we just talk about like kids and stuff if that actually happens and we do get it and cody is has good tooling yeah i'm gonna nail cody so hard it's gonna be so good i'm very excited about cody stack overflow is going under i think stack stack overflow is going under i'm sorry stack overflow i'm sorry but um you're done the name is the primogen and i'm not that excited about stack overflow ai honestly last thing i need is is an ai telling me i have yet i have asked a duplicate question it's honestly i don't need that in my life
