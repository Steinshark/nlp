a little over a month ago i gave you guys the first look at our upcoming land gaming center badminton center and i have some really exciting progress updates to share with you guys check it out the server room is now one dan wider so dan here here here show the people stack it stack it i am a server wreck look at me being a server wreck and watch this wow dan can go all the way around this um this really would have sucked let's show them what it would have looked like before here's me a server r yeah that's a real problem enough about that though let's talk about what we're going to put in it starting with ah yes ubiquities udm pro we're going to have one of these for actually we're going to have two of these oh god jake's not getting redundant internet again is he i don't know i hope not i it's probably two lines sure so we're going to have two because they're going to be bonded together so that we have redundancy and failover i mean we're going to have 300 people here so you know we kind of don't want it to fail right that's fair enough and speaking of things we don't want to fail our security system we're going have how many of these 48 port poe switches we're going to have 10 of these just to deal with all of the poe that's going everywhere cuz remember that every single door needs like two of these and every access point acc god the speakers dozens of cameras everything and sorry dan we're going to have i think it's two of these enterprise xg 10 gig switches with 25 gig uplinks so yeah i believe these will be our aggregation between the downstairs and up here and then on top of that we're also going to have another two of these but instead of ethernet they're laid out with sfp ports which means that we can do 10 gig everywhere this is so overkill okay so much more to show you guys and this video is brought to you by narwhal featuring their fro x ultra combination robot vacuum and mop that will leave your floors looking spotless without you having to lift a finger and look at that it's got edge detection these trenches were here before but what's new is now they have the conduit that is going to house power and cat 6 and now these openings are much larger which was a costly expense thankfully not for us because they underestimated the size of these boxes and the reason i bet mr daniel besser knows is because power and networking don't mix don't mix and the boxes needed to be bigger why even these are the ones i'm actually way more excited about each of these is going to have cat 6 and an armored six strand fiber uhoh actually those are just duplex recepticles but dan still right we're going to be using the same style of conduit in fact you can see all of it is run up in the ceiling to run power cat six and fiber for every one of these rows of tables that is so overkill you wanted it come on man we'll talk about that in a minute first let's have a look at that fiber dan assures me that this is armored so i can just go to town with this i'm i'm kidding i'm i just love seeing the look on his face i know what you're like i'll be careful it's fine soe just relax dan i can tell rela we're going to cut it fiber doesn't need to be this thick well it's as easy to run six as it is one ah so we've got six strands in here even though we will be using two but that's for redundancy yeah well i mean they're going to be public in there and if they get kicked or damaged or broken then we can just keep terminating them instead of having to pull new stuff right for now why don't we just take a look at the inner guts can you yeah sure if i can cut through it the nice thing about having the armored fiber as well as you can see it's like corrugated tube it really protects it from that minimum bend radius as well it makes it really difficult to kind of go past that uh and because this is the uh the nice stuff it's pretty flexible too uh okay cut cut away from yourself thanks dan it's good stuff oh yeah yeah okay i've seen people do this hey there we go right we have a plastic sheath on the outside which kind of protects this from scratching other things then we have our armor which is this nice corrugated metal really really tough then we have our inner layer which is kind of the actual fiber part you can see it kind of moves around in there there's a really tough plastic sheath on top of that as well and then we have our pull cord so this wraps around the entire thing yeah and you can really heave on that yeah you can really heave on that when you get pre-made ones they tie it off to a big eye and then you can you can give her and then inside we have our six fibers beautiful and these these can co up to i believe it's 24 or 48 and again it's the same size no matter what you get so it's just as easy to do six as it is one and because it's glass and not copper it's not really that much more expensive doing this in copper would be like two or three times the price right speaking of copper we also have all of our ethernet all right let's go look at it two or three times the price oh on our way this is fun bonding adhesive um and that is for this guy right here dan mm did you notice that uh still pretty bad yeah this yeah is all of the sprayon acoustic treatment that is going to do the ceilings of both sides meaning that when you're on a cord or at a land party you're going to be able to actually talk to each other over a distance without it just turning into a bunch of standing wave garbage this right here is pretty much your bog standard cat 6a solid twisted pair okay it always blows my mind how how much of the stuff you end up putting into an installation like this it's really really hard to make sure that all the runs are done now to be fair cuz i think i'm getting called out right here there was still 90 runs that i had to do uh and then we changed it all no it's not you no no no no i no this is everyone oh i thought you were calling me out cuz i ordered like 2,000 boxes of this stuff and then only used four it's a very real concern when you're running ethernet cable because while you could take that half box and it'll probably make it if you waste the time of running it and you're 2 ft short that costs so much more than just grabbing another box and making sure that you definitely have enough these all came from phantom cables and what is the total damage we got 40 so we have 40,000 ft 40,000 40,000 ft can you imagine coming from that end of the court all the way back to the server room over there yeah it's a lot of feet and then there's two in everything there and then there's going to be aps and speakers in the ceiling and then it's a lot of runs i hope we're going to have enough dan's going to have all the runs all of them they're mine i did have food poisoning last week i did not tell him to do that we're going to talk about the paint splotches and we're going to check in with chase who's working on a proof of concept for our giant screen gaming setup that we're going to have here but first we need to check in with adam oh don't mind me i'm just here filming our sponsor narwhal we brought the freo x ultra here to the badmington land center to see how capable it is in an absolute worst case scen scenario and i got to say while initially we had some concerns based on that it took about an hour to map out the room in fairness to it this room is a disaster area it did do it and it actually looks very accurate and we set it a zone to vacuum and then mop not only did it figure it out get it pretty clean it has dirt detection so it went back to its base station rung itself out and it is now doing a second pass i mean i think the before and after kind of speaks for itself here guys the frio ultra x is equipped with 88,200 pascals of suction power that will make easy work of any large debris and thanks to the cone-shaped spiral rubber heads and 50degrees tilted bristles on the zero tangling floating brush the freux ultra has an sgs certified 0% hair tangling rate the dual spinning mops are made of microfiber to better absorb stubborn stains without scratching your floors and uh i think the performance of them really does speak for itself the all-in-one station where the foo parks includes water exchange for both dumping dirty water and giving it fresh clean water auto drying for the mops heads auto detergent filling self- cleaning of those mob heads which uses the same ai dirt sense feature that is the reason that it's doing a second pass on the floor super cool so it make sure the heads are cleaned and checked during the cleaning process using multiple sensors and while the docking station doesn't have a container for dust you don't need to worry about emptying your vacuums bin all the time thanks to a special dust processing solution that compacts the dust in your bin so you can fit more in without clogging and it does this at a surprisingly mild 71 db now to answer your pressing questions about the paint chase this is why we couldn't use this wall for our projector setup because we had to do 1 billion paint swatches to determine the optimal color for the walls in here we needed something that hopefully wouldn't impact the cast of the light too much but we needed something that was high contrast enough that you'd be able to easily track a moving object against it so what do you guys think what's your favorite color what do we go with i like uh bwf blue i think we should go with toronto blue thank you the decision is already made oh and it's neither of those it's going to be this one what that blue doesn't even have a name bwf blue when we mocked it up and i think he used maya it looked like cartoon land oh yeah it's it's a lot you want a serious blue for a serious sport yeah and serious gaming absolutely i get serious gaming we have the projector set up let's go have a look projector gaming corner the point is last time we did an update chase gave you guys an okay idea of what the console gaming corner is going to look like but we've got a more detailed view or that's what we're trying to figure out that's what we're trying trying to figure out today so we actually have the projectors we have the screens we don't really have the best equipment as you can tell but we're going to get there this is a quality inflatable couch i mean it's going to store so small we really need that storage space lonus happily kept that for like a month i don't know if i was that happy about it for our projector we've gone with the epson ls 1200b which was recently liberated from my theater room when i replaced it with the world's largest television it's not a commercial project by any stretch of the imagination but for a residential projector it's pretty darn bright it's laser so it offers excellent contrast and it is 4k 120 hz which uh makes it fantastic for gaming i just misaligned it didn't i probably yeah i think we're going to have to give some thought to our mounting mechanism for this if you guys if you guys move the couch then we can just go between us yeah so during the actual land we're going to have a much taller projector cart that way it doesn't actually no one's head is going to get in the way plus we're going to have it mounted to the wall using the typical mounting system so what we'll be able to do is just get it a little bit higher so it won't interfere with anyone so it should be good kind of looks like ass but i have an idea why do we have printer paper here i don't know i was going to ask you i think we were using it as a mouse pad oh well why did you ask me why we have it then i don't know all right hit it boys hey that's more like it man okay biggest tv a little better this pretty freaking awesome still all right let's go oh god oh i just nated everyone oh wow just killed two of our allies the only real reason that we designed the projector gaming corner around a 120in screen is because we happened to already have one the one that used to be in my theater room but it's possible that if we just didn't use this screen it might look fine anyway honestly i'm not really convinced i see that much of a difference hey do you mind hitting the lights i mean that's freaking awesome of course throw them back on for a second that won't be the case once the walls in here are all blue so what we've got to decide today chase is do we need to invest in bigger projector screens should we do a quick test and see if we've got the lumens for it yeah we'll give it a try okay lights off again let's see how big we can make this adam you ready i mean chase let's get this table out of here yeah start start rolling adam okay whoa whoa hold on a second you know what that's pretty usable still it is pitch black in here though it is but that's i mean it's going to be pretty dark during a land okay question for you this is not a lot of knits but with your eyes adjusted to the dark is this usable at this size this is like super usable especially since the land is probably going to be a similar darkness anyways so i don't think it's that big of an issue how many inches are we okay what are we at uh 195 195 in i think we can go bigger let's go larger i mean you saw the size of this wall right while we're going bigger we're also going to go with a bigger batter gaming system this is packing oh my god is that a 4090 yeah okay all right cool well we've got that you want 4k gaming huh oh that is a solid double the area we had before i got to say guys still kind of usable in it at this brightness yeah it definitely doesn't have enough brightness for convincing hdr at this size yeah it's really you can see it capping out with the highlights it just like everything's just kind of white as it can get it but it's still pretty yeah it's still pretty good looking how big is this like 400 in at this point probably about 300 it's not even completely dark in here like when we've got the ceiling black which we will you're going to get less reflections like if we want to cast you know whatever is happening on you main stage or whatever you're going to be able to see this from the entire facility i'm not going to lie i was really really skeptical of this projector's capabilities when you were like oh we'll just use our home projectors for the commercial space i was like it's not going to work but uh laser yeah i was wrong which doesn't mean that we can't amp it up a notch i don't know if you guys noticed but we kind kind of have two of them let's get bright brighter and bigger the first thing we're going to do is we're going to try to go brighter by aligning the outputs from two projectors simultaneously without software and rigging this kind of thing is honestly probably not going to work but hey i want to give it a shot do we have this sitting on anything or like i brought pizzas of paper oh is that what the ream of paper is for yeah making fine adjustments i see hey there we go yo this looks like that time i got drunk here we go here we go here we go here we go this is really bizarre oh it looks like watching a 3d movie but it don't have glasses on um that actually is so weird it does have like an actual 3d effect almost if we were professionals and we were able to align this thing it could be significantly brighter i mean that is a lot better maybe even hdr but we are not professionals and that looks awful and it's funny cuz this screen's so massive but on this big wall it doesn't really look that big oh i think i see where you're going yeah ultra wide that we can do let's do it a scoot to the side oh wow okay i mean i guess when you have a 300 in screen you got to move you know 300 in to the right freak okay i'm working on it of course the point of this isn't to watch the same movie twice side by side but rather to use envy surround for ultra widescreen gaming this is by far the largest screen that i have ever played do maternal on dude this is surprisingly usable like it really still looks quite good you know what i will say though is i think this is about as big as we can go unless we could go brighter oh do you want to try it absolutely just sitting you're hogging in here we go you know what this makes me think though this is a fraction of the size of this wall what if we could have a screen the size of the entire wall that looks amazing okay okay now all that remains is to check in with our friends from naral who sponsored this video the fro x had no issue mapping this room with those tr laser sensors as well as its bumpers you can learn more about the fre x ultra at the link in the video description or by searching them up on google or amazon and if you take advantage of our link below you can get $300 off the frox ultra if you guys enjoyed this video why not check out the world's largest tv okay it's not as big as those projectors but it's still pretty big you can just sit closer
