hi hi tom how are you the weather has 
been great it's about 20 20 celsius   right now what about for you oh fahrenheit yeah cool i hope you wear a winter 
jacket oh it's really warm okay   i'm so tired i'm going on different team meetings 
to spend what feels like hours in reality maybe   just minutes converting what fahrenheit is to 
celsius and different things so in this video   we are going to be automating our lives making our 
lives much more simple with python by building a   desktop notification that will notify us every 
single day at 12 pm what the temperature is in   both celsius and fahrenheit and this is a fun 
project even if you this isn't an issue of yours   it's a great way to build with an api build 
with python build with rebel build a project   that you are using to run a job consistently and 
send notifications that's that's a mouthful but   you get a lot out of this project even if it's 
something that you might not use in real life   but maybe you're like me and you will i'm going to 
do a challenge i am going to pin the craziest the   wildest idea of what we should automate so leave 
it in the comments let's get let's like get really   creative with this because i feel like i need some 
fun things to automate also before we get started   hit that subscribe button give this video a like 
and share with you when i was first learning how   to build with python i python is something that i 
never used a ton in my day job so as a developer   i used a ton of javascript i worked with node a 
lot php unfortunately just kidding but i never   built with python professionally i've always been 
to tinker around and i love it because a it is so   in demand for jobs right now it's evolving with 
the jobs meaning so many different areas are using   this technology that it's so amazing to learn on 
that note though i want to share with you some   courses if you are looking to level up your python 
skills learn more projects all that great stuff   the first one is 100 days of code the complete 
python pro boot camp for 2023 and this is a course   by dr angela and she is an incredible teacher 
honestly i would fangirl if i met her i think some   people are excited about celebrities i'm excited 
about people who teach amazing coding courses and   she always keeps this course really up to date 
which i love it's almost at a million students   1 million students and the rating is 4.7 so you 
know it's a great course and i really like this   because you really learn about python in a fun way 
where you're building unique projects so if you   are looking to build projects this is probably the 
course i would recommend taking also too i linked   them down below so you can go check them out the 
next one is the complete python bootcamp zero to   hero in python this is by jose portilla portilla 
and i really like this course as well there's   actually almost 2 million students who have taken 
this and although this course has been around for   a while one thing i love about it is he keeps it 
up to date so you know when you are going to be   taking this course you will be getting the most 
up-to-date technology and knowledge about python   and two what i really like is it's he starts with 
he teaches you different projects i took this one   a long time ago actually when i was first kind 
kind of building with python and it stood out to   me because he teaches you different projects but 
also really dives into object oriented programming   with classes uh talks about jupiter notebook 
and you kind of get a full spectrum what you   are the python environment what you can build with 
python what is possible so if you are looking to   really dive into more of the theory-based theory 
meaning yeah the theory-based side of things this   is the course i would recommend the next one 
is complete python developer in 2023 zero to   mastery so we went from zero to hero and zero to 
mastery now and this is really cool too because   you can build machine learning models so for 
people who are interested in more of the machine   learning side of things this is a great place to 
start also too one thing i like about all these   courses i'm listing is you get a certification 
and as you know nowadays with ai always sifting   through our resumes to start with getting that 
certification and that text on your resume of   building with python or building with this or that 
is a huge benefit not just to please employers but   also to to please the ai which sounds really weird 
to say but it's true in the sense of when you are   submitting your resume ai is taking a scan over 
do you have these keywords and with these courses   especially with python you do another little 
tip on that note is include some keywords of   things that you've learned through these courses 
on your resume so for this one that i'm sharing   with you right now include things such as machine 
learning model uh include things like function   programming make sure you do even the versions of 
python that you are learning how to ensure you're   up to date with it get specific with it because 
you are learning so much knowledge within these   courses it's really important to showcase that now 
these are just three courses that i really really   enjoy i have taken in the past and really helped 
me on board with python quickly that being said   though if you are interested in learning python 
javascript web development data science whatever   the case is udemy has always been my go-to 
place like if i showed you my course list on   udemy i think i might as well like be employed 
there at this point i spend so much time on   udemy because it's really i like it because it's 
reliable meaning they always vet who is teaching   these courses they are experts in their area i 
also like it too because you can see the course   ratings and see the course schedule very clearly 
how it's broken down so aside from python you   can see here on udemy they have different like you 
can literally learn everything we're talking about   python but there's this guy is the limit and also 
too you can start by taking one python course and   then building upon it so taking a machine learning 
course then like the possibilities are endless and   the best part is most of them come if not all 
most of them come with a certification which   is a huge benefit too once again i linked all 
these down below so you can go check them out   let's get code [music] all right you can see on 
screen here we are going to be using ripple for   this you know already if you've watched some of 
my videos i am a huge fan of rebel um rebel can   you like sponsor me or send me t-shirts or 
something because i love you you're amazing   um anyways i i just think it's a great tool 
because a you can share projects b you can   start coding right away building interesting 
things see other people's projects um it's   just really great all right so let's create a new 
rebel and for this we are going to be using python   also to my mouse died this mouse died 
so if you see me like going like this   like a dj it's because i'm using my trackpad 
instead and this project it's called weather   easy simple all right so first thing let's do is 
get some packages installed so rep will install   them for you so we just need to import them 
import requests what else do we have here import   schedule there's a lot so 
i will speed up this part [music] all right we just reported a lot of packages that 
we will be using and i want to know one thing here   when you see that there's this code coming up 
like these suggestions for code it's because i'm   using uh rebels paid version which entails their 
ghostwriter so think of it as like kind of like   their internal ai tool to help you code i don't 
use it a ton because i just kind of tinker around   with rebel i don't use it for work or anything 
like that but it definitely is very accurate kind   of creepily accurate as to what i'm typing and 
also to i think it's really interesting i got it   initially for a video when i was rating different 
kind of code helpers but i just kept it so far   because i still use it quite a bit or kind of 
anyways it's really interesting so let's start by   writing this weather get our weather and for this 
we will be using an api which will need to get the   api key in a set here see how accurate it is url 
responds open weather map you know what honestly   it's not that far off as to what it is saying 
but let's just do our own so api key we will need oh my gosh this is accurate very gaggy yes correct 
no no no stop city name we're not doing it yeah   we're doing same all right uh url yeah let's just 
call this base url to be consistent is this crazy   how accurate it is let's delete all of this i 
feel like i'm getting a little too much here   all right we have api key then we have our city 
name base url which we're using open weather map   which is weird that it knew that uh city name and 
api key for this actually i'm going to take out   you know what let's do it my way this 
is just you know what it's nice thanks   ghost rider but i might even turn off 
ghostwriter it's a little annoying okay no seriously shut up [music]   next up let's add in some base url [music] 
which will be open ai weather yes oops   and we will also add in our city name which for me i'm going to be doing toronto toronto i know my i'll tab everything over in a sec here complete urls entails of why is this okay 
this all right we're having some issues   with ghostwriter so i just wrote some codex 
kept on like overwriting what i was writing   um and i tried to disable it but i didn't have 
much luck anyways so you can see here we have   get weather which we will put our api key here 
our city name base url and then complete url and   then also too we're going to get the response 
to the complete url and then of course create   that in json form so i have here on the other tab 
the api we are going to be using open weather and   you can find it here you need to sign up and at a 
certain point if you're doing a ton of requests a   lot of these keys will not be completely free 
so it really depends on how frequently you are   using them but for our purpose using it once 
a day totally fine and then you go to your api   it gets too tricky when i'm not sharing it with 
you so let's just be oops what the heck come here just signed up for you [music] 
why are you being difficult no it's taking a long time those days 
where everything just isn't working all   right this took me a minute but you can see here 
here's our key so let's go ahead and copy this   coffee you can also give it a name and go back into our app 
and we'll put our key here   and our city name i'm going to use toronto because 
that's where uh all right so then we are passing   in our uh base url api key and city name next up 
we need to create a job so this will run every day   at 12 pm eastern so you can do it every time you 
want but i'm doing 12 p.m eastern alright so i'm   just going to continue writing the code and then 
explaining it to you because it's just getting too   tricky with ghost rider uh but anyways so what i'm 
doing now is cod is checking is uh coming from the   response of the api and ensuring that it's not a 
404. from there if it's not what we are doing is   taking the current temperature in both celsius 
and also to fahrenheit and then these numbers   here are converting it so that's the difference 
between the two um and converting it so then it   will return the temperature in celsius and also 
to in fahrenheit so taking this main temperature   and making it both of those this honestly is so 
helpful for anyone who works remote or works in   various time zones where there's different well 
not time zone necessarily but different countries   where some people use fahrenheit some people 
use celsius this honestly that might be biased   because i'm making this project but i think it's 
really helpful all right next let's write a job   and essentially what this job will do is check it 
will run every day at 12 pm eastern and then also   to send a notification for what the temperatures 
are alright so then i also added in to run a job   which is getting the weather and then i made a 
simple title weather update but you can make it   whatever you want and then also to schedule every 
day at 1007 uh this should be i was just testing   it out because it's 1007 right now but this should 
be 12 p.m based on whatever time you actually   want it to be but let's put it back at 12. the 
problem i'm finding is when i'm running this   job for whatever reason i had this before in past 
projects when i use desktop notifications when i'm recording okay i'm recording when i'm recording 
my screen i have trouble sending the notification   never comes and then i stop recording and it comes 
so anyways um you i'll link this rubble down below   so you can tinker and play around with it as well 
and run it on your machine to see it working in   action and one thing that i really want to note 
is how do you keep this job running so there's   various ways to keep this job running honestly i 
know this isn't perfect and you could write many   different things but if you're just tinkering 
around and want to build this the easiest way   is to uh run this script in your terminal and 
then just keep your terminal open or minimize it   down below and that way it will run on the daily 
now this isn't perfect there are tons of better   solutions to doing this but this is more so if 
you're looking to just tinker and then if you want   to take it to the next level you can do different 
things to really keep it running consistently all   the time actually i just asked chatgpt classic 
what other ways there is to keep the python script   running continuously so yes terminal screen 
session they have so many different cron job   of course task scheduler back ground service the 
possibilities are endless which i feel like would   be a whole other video for this to do but at least 
now we have completed our project of getting the   weather and then also to get displaying it in 
a notification in both celsius and fahrenheit   all right we have automated our life for the day 
another automation done i need that on a t-shirt   i think thank you all for watching i hope you 
found this video helpful but also too enjoyable   and fun to watch leave down in the comments other 
video topics you want me to cover things that we   should automate with our lives like all right 
i'll see you all soon thanks everyone [music]
