all right here we go let's talk about typing speed with theo now i do want to give like a quick preface here i'm going to do something unusual okay so normally what i do is i watch a video and as we get to these different spots i'll say something i'll pause the video and that's that due to this very triggering nature of this video i'm gonna let theo make his complete argument so therefore i don't argue against anything he changes his mind on or says it differently later on that helps me correct or understand it okay this is purely gonna be me listening to just what theo has to say for three minutes and 14 seconds hey nice time on the video by the way i feel that's really good and that's it and then afterwards i'm gonna give my opinion on this because i i have exceptionally strong opinions about this this territory exceptionally strong opinions and i want you to know that now typing fast is fun i have a horrifyingly bad penmanship i almost got held back in elementary school okay so i actually can't even make it through the video without saying something i have very excellent penmanship i take payment tip extremely seriously uh your writing is your perception to the outside world and you know if someone sees your stuff and they go well look at that crappy writing no i want when someone sees my writing they say well you know he's a thorough person he's always trying to be as good as possible because of how bad my penmanship is so my mom had me typing early i was playing keyboard typing games when i was young i played this game show me where to put my hands like the first time i ever typed and they kind of stayed there the result was it's always an okay typer there were points where i could break 150 i think i even broke 160 a few times saying you're an okay typer and also saying that come on theo come on you know you're not an okay typer okay and okay typer is like 60 words a minute a moderately fast a statistically above average is 80. okay a banger is like 90. a blazingly fast is like a hundred s but i never cared too much it wasn't my focus and honestly one of the funniest moments for me is when i got my first macbook and thought i was going to need my mechanical keyboard and miss it a bunch and i started typing on my macbook air it was slightly faster than i was on my fancy mechanical keyboard i built myself broke my heart here we are to this day the wireless magic keyboard faster than i've ever been i don't practice my typing i honestly do most of my typing on my laptop on my couch i don't do it sitting here at a desk what i'm going to do right now is a typing test with a kind of jank stream ready setup that's going to have a bunch of latency going for speed which i haven't done in years to see how we do so let's see how fast i can go and i don't have enough desk space to put my keyboard where i want it for this got the latency is killing me so i'm not using my laptop screen because it's too dim i'm using the mirror here and there's a ton of latency whenever i make a mistake it's going to drive me insane uh gotta try looking at the dark screen that was awful i would pause when i made a mistake but like i peaked at 155 god damn restart doesn't do the same one i hate this one [music] on the other one if you hit replay it will give you the same one on quote it doesn't like to do that somebody else point out the lag yeah i definitely am feeling lag as i'm typing on this and i did it last time i tried y'all want to see me try on my desktop with my mechanical see if i'm faster or not yeah i hate typing the mechanicals now i hit this one i hate mechanical keyboards well i see people in chat who are not trying on their macbook keyboards and are surprised at how fast they are so we broke 171 on their macbook that's nuts yeah i can barely break 130 on a desktop yeah i'm not gonna talk the point i'm here mostly to make is that your typing speed kind of stops mattering after a point even 100 words per minute it basically stops mattering after 80 you're going to type as fast as you can think it's fun to do it's fun to flex like i'll sit here and make jokes about it sure but just because i can hike faster than you doesn't mean i can code faster than you in fact those things have nothing to do with each other if you're not quite 80 yet i'd put the effort in to get there make sure your hands are placed correctly on the keyboard and put a little bit of time into practicing once you're confidently at 80 plus it really doesn't matter that much everyone should be able to type fast enough to not feel hampered by their keyboard but nobody needs to type so fast they can type like beyond the speed of thought stop caring so much about your keyboard typing speeds focus more on your speed to deliver things after you've thought of them some of the best programmers i know are still pack typers it really doesn't matter too much hope this was helpful youtube seems to think you're like that video so check it out if you haven't and thanks we'll operate everything we're holding this whole video because god damn i hate this typing fast okay so many thoughts there first off theo it kind of feels like you're ripping me off for the last couple weeks i keep saying over and over again 80 is kind of the minimum amount of typing speed theo come on where's that shout out theo come on yo uh so i i do completely agree with the take in the sense that becoming a good typer is an a is a massively important thing you can do with your life um you spent in an inordinate amount of time interacting with your keyboard this is just very very important and you can even extend this notion into learning your editor really well uh is also very very important being able to just bring up what you need when you need it as fast as possible with as minimal amount of thought even if it takes an investment to begin with is a really good thing to do i am completely and will forever always be on this team it's just how i operate that's that's just i i just don't i don't get it right because even if you're not coding so let's just set the coding aside you're sending slack messages you're sending emails you're responding to things you're jumping on twitter you're responding in discord you're doing a bunch of other ancillary tasks that all interact with your keyboard now if you're slow on those things damn it why is this thing so loud shut up all right sorry cut that out uh but it like if you're slow all of those other things are just gonna add time and second off if you don't know how to type without looking when you're programming you have to do two things you have to think of the task at hand or actually you have to do three things you're thinking of the task at hand you're having like your current little ram being occupied by the exact thing you're typing and then you're also double checking by looking from your keyboard back to your screen if you're even typing it correctly now those are all things that obviously copilot helps a whole bunch good lsps help a whole bunch where you don't need as good of typing as say you once did but nonetheless you're still gonna need it always like it's always going to be a part of there at least anytime in the near future now the distant future 20 years from now i can't tell you what life's going to be like but i can tell you right now it's just completely nuts anyone that argues the difference and you see this all the time i get i've gotten roasted on tick tock more than anything else with people telling uh people that i'm completely wrong saying typing fast is a good thing that you just think most the time well let me tell you this let me let me just do a little side story here let's uh let's just think about it in this kind of perspective if you were to go and just try out a coding idea you've been stuck on this problem for a while me personally i explore with my hands you know what i mean i go out there i have an idea i sit there and i put all my effort into it and i go and i try out an idea and i just did this yesterday i tried out an idea it's about 200 lines of code in rust i typed it all out got all the way through it got done and then i go okay let's try a different idea coded out a second idea that one was about 350 lines of rust got them both out yesterday and i chose one over the other because i took what i learned from the first one things i did and didn't like about it and rebuilt it into something better and guess what it made a massive difference the fact that i could go and explore these things it wasn't just that i theoretically put it upstairs i put it on paper and started typing it out and became good at the thing and then was able to go okay yeah yeah no no no i hate that i love this and able to redo it again two different prototypes solving the same problem and coming off like with complete slightly different results and guess what the speed i could type allowed me to get through both of these examples within like a half an hour where if i was just constantly looking up that would have been like a two hour adventure i still remember when i changed from clarity to dvorak there was about a month and a half that i only typed 50 words a minute and it was super painful because i knew what fast was i was always typing 120 130 uh and clarity well quarity is actually the fastest that's about 140 150 in clarity and then i was all the way down to 50 for like a month and a half well actually has that 20 then 30 then 40 then 50 and it took me about a year to get back up to a hundred and so during that entire year i felt what is the cost of typing slow versus the cost of typing fast not many people have gotten that advantage to be able to go from fast to slow to fast again and to understand the difference and honestly it was a huge productivity hit yeah i couldn't i couldn't type as fast i couldn't you know i i had the backspace more i had more errors things were just so damn slow and that taught me a very important lesson this was about seven years ago now at this point that typing speed does matter because it's this up here that really matters what's up here needs to get out and it gets out by your by your fingers and if you can't get it out fast you spend more time in the process of getting your thoughts out than simply exploring if your thoughts are correct now i personally am never going to be a person that can just think of a solution to a problem a big problem first try right away it's going to take me several iterations it's just who it's just it's just who i am right it's just who i am and and i and i have this strong feeling it's how most of you are i think there's very few people that can once good design every single time i just doubt it i just doubt it thoroughly okay hey guess what thank you for watching that uh overall i think theo did a good job i agreed with most of his points uh also monkey type hey side note on monkey type the reason why monkey type is not representative of typing speed it's just thorough nonsense right the erroring is really goofy the spacing is goofy there's weird lag spikes that happen every now and then there's like a lot of things that are very weird about monkey type and of course absolutely hands down you're gonna get goofy results uh you're not going to be as fast so if you're if you're 80 or 90 on monkey type you're probably more like 90 to 100 typing what you actually like you know what i mean like typing what's up here down here so okay that's it hey i also i love this keyboard i know i can't type as fast i agree with theo also i can't type as fast uh on this keyboard as i can on a mac because you know why the key action is like this big it makes it super easy to bounce off of right you can just go super super fast but i don't type on one of those small keyboards because if i start doing that within one week i actually have tremendous pain down the side of my arm right and so i had to back away i learned dvorak such that i could reduce my pain and then after learning dvorak i still had pain but it was greatly reduced and then that's why i got this keyboard gosh eight years ago it was a version of this keyboard and then after about four years this keyboard this keyboard company starts sending me keyboards because they're like you're really fast at using them i was like hell yeah brother so i love them um so i got them long before it has ever sponsored anything just in case anyone's wondering somehow somehow that happened i don't know hey the name is the primagen
