ladies and gentlemen chess is a very serious game but this is going to be a very stupid chess video the reason for that is i'm bored okay i've been making chess videos for about four years now that's a lot of chess i cover low elo games i cover intermediate chess i cover top level chess i cover a chest that isn't even chests things like spell chess atomic chess and so on and so forth my goal is to entertain you and educate you and i try to give you a fun lens and an accessible lens into the 64 squares some of you watching this right now might be children some of you watching this right now might be 90 years old and if you're older than that i apologize i was not trying to be ageist um today's video is going to be stupid because i recently discovered a chess opening known as the potato yeah i didn't i don't know how i did that you know how you play online and you play something and then it tells you the name it said potato variation so immediately i thought i've got to make a video about this i'm going to try to play multiple games of the potato variation today and i might lose every single one of them this might just be a video where i donate rating points to a chess charity or i'm going to win games the potato is very simple you start with knight to f3 and no matter what your opponent does you play the move a4 next that's the entire thing okay when you play white it's easier because obviously you get to play a4 next black will play d5 you play a4 technically this position is the potato variation however if you play it like this it could very quickly transpose to a potato variation and one very important thing you need to play knight f3 first if you play a4 first this is just called the wear opening and this is technically an inaccuracy if you're trying to play the potato variation because black could play e5 now you are basically playing the ayogen the alakyn's defense and you would need to move your knight so i'm preventing the move e5 by playing knight f3 and only then a4 and we're gonna try to just expand on that side of the board we're gonna put our bishop over here now you may ask how do you play the potato with black i don't know do this be this and then we're gonna have to just improvise all right we're gonna have to play some i hopefully i just don't play any games with this is about to be really really bad all right uh i'm gonna boot up for some blitz games i might play some grand masters i i don't know where we're about to get ourselves into uh let me refresh the page uh mychess.com decided to to start lagging as i was trying to record my video um all right looks like chess.com is just lagging period all right i'm playing a pretty strong international master please he's getting potatoed now the question is do i expand like all right this is all very principled we could of course turn this into a normal thing um here we go all right we're copying him except we have a pawn on a4 for some reason uh is he gonna respond with a5 okay no uh nope no no mirrored potato um let's go for a giga potato this is of course inaccurate because i'm allowing the knight in but i can yeah i think i can just slide my rook up a square this is really nothing special and i can trade that bishop off with my bishop and then i can play pawn to d3 so i really don't mind and i feel like you know the giga potato here with these pawns are maybe doing a little something i think this was a bit of a dopamine move if i'm being honest okay ponto c6 is interesting let's offer this exchange now that's obviously a good bishop for my opponent so my bishop being traded for it isn't particularly good i could play pawn to d3 uh and kick the night out that looks pretty smart takes rook takes of course this is attacking that but the knight hanging is a bigger problem okay now i have a couple of ways i could just push should i justify my potatoism what am i doing this is so stupid i feel like the queen could still go here i feel like we can get take taken than queen before okay pontoon but more reasonable than my suggestion i can play bishop here i could also put the knight there also knight bd2 let's go bishop e5 this almost wins the night it doesn't quite win a night it almost wins a night but you know almost still counts it doesn't now if this i'm just gonna go all the way back uh incredible and i'll keep advancing all right bishop f5 makes sense let's hit the bishop because i you know i want to activate my bishop mm-hmm onto c4 maybe we're like really justifying this this queen side play and we can always bring the bishop back and actually be in pretty decent shape uh now i'm hanging here so let's go back to a1 which is just utterly hilarious this is completely not how you should play chess and i actually don't mind my position at all i mean of course there's some good pressure here but uh maybe queen c1 the defense here and i'll bring my knight back and i guess i'm just gonna go target the bishop i mean ultimately i think this game will be just you know decided the way most uh blitz games are decided which is a insane time scramble where nobody plays any logical moves um but so far i don't hate my chances it's kind of hard to like talk through the game as it's going on but just a5 just advancing i mean i really don't find this position unreasonable in the slightest and i'm up quite a bit of time so uh potato op let's bring the knight back i'm glad i got my queen off the c file off the d file rather uh i can also play a similar preparation move maybe king h2 all right we're both doing the same thing rook d1 maybe i'll reroute rook a4 is also interesting to unpin and keep myself defended yeah i might do that wow could the potato be the next addition to top level opening chess i feel like black is going to play b6 at some point i feel like there's you can't really do much else okay finally the bishop is going to get traded and now very important question of what is next and maybe just come back make sure everything is defended here on the back rank slowly slide forward i feel like my opponent is going to play like knight e5 okay that's not an unreasonable move let me play queen b2 i need to keep my time advantage 40 seconds is quite a bit of time and maybe i can knock on the door here with pawn to b6 at some point they're also going to take i feel like they're not going to be able to withstand the tension of the position uh do we offer a queen trade yeah i kind of like that and then we're gonna try to get into c6 um night takes looks very reasonable applying more pressure and then this knight is going to come here we are fully justifying the potato by the way i can take the queen or i can take this first my opponent's idea is to win my pawn that's what they're trying to do they're trying to take and when my pawn but i feel like this is not that scary onto g4 restricting that enemy knight the double pawns really don't leave a strong impression but what do i know onto e3 making sure the knight can't come in in 29 seconds and now now i just kind of have to step on the gas a little bit takes and i'm gonna go here uh that's a reasonable move um quite reasonable how do i avoid maybe i can't really avoid all right let's start bringing our king opponents doing a nice job fighting back here oh i hung the pawn that was why did i do that okay discover check boom now i'm gonna get two pieces and i'm gonna i think i'm i'm just crashing through here let me take this to go b7 and the b-pawn made it oh my goodness that's insane that was unbelievable the pawn that started the whole thing and now i think i can just very easily win you know what i'm not gonna sacrifice you can of course sacrifice there but i think i'm just gonna slowly methodically march forward and uh let's go king g2 what am i doing getting nervous youtube content is being made the the the milking factory e5 king f6 oh that's easy oh that's easy yes oh read it and weep the potato variation on fire incredible stuff let's analyze that game that was actually exactly how the potatoes should be played that's crazy the a pawn and the b pawn and i mean this position is you know like look obviously this is a meme opening but that is exactly the way you are supposed to play it i just took a bunch of space on the queen side and i just advanced that was actually that was really fascinating how i did that i wonder what my game review was obviously it went down somewhere in the middle game i did a a couple of stupid things but you know i'll take a little 85 percent you know well 85 28.50 estimated elo um yeah ponto b4 this is all very funny this is kind of exactly the way you're supposed to play this opening of course it is stupid make no mistake but uh um knight e4 little rook a2 try to trade the bishops and i got myself into a little bit of trouble uh uh i think in the middle game as i started crashing through i think i got a little bit greedy like around here i definitely had my biggest advantage um and instead of playing queen e5 trying to trade the queens i should have just moved in with my knight that's what i should have done but it's blitz and i'm trying to talk the whole time it's not so simple the point is that the knight is trying to go to c6 so black trying to fight back against my pawns actually gave me access to a square that i shouldn't have had b695 and the knight c6 is a borderline completely winning position for white because you just crashed through rookie 8 rook a5 is like you know rook a1 and like look at this position i mean just an avalanche and i mean the way it happened in the game it was still you know completely fine but it was my queen side i mean i i got in on my queen side you know rook b7 was a mistake in time trouble and then i managed to give my opponent two pieces but i i got in with my pawns my opponent could have played knight d8 and defended against that but uh that was very unpleasant and um hilarious welcome to the welcome to the era of the potato that is exactly how you're supposed to play this opening uh let me x out of this game let me start a new game maybe i'll get another game with white that was exact that's exactly how you're supposed to play that opening all right martin knew i've played this person a lot knight f3 two games with white well and there we go potato g3 bishop g2 we're gonna try to you know advance over here um okay he played it like this which is uh annoying i guess i will play d3 and i'm i'm it's like a springboard i think he's gonna play c5 which is kind of annoying yeah uh uh how do we want to handle this position maybe bring the bishop out to f4 he's gonna try to want to develop like this right so let's try to play a little bit more kg he he might yeah he's gonna try to win the battle for the center of the board e5 type of stuff how do i want to do this i think i'm going to try to replace my bishop with a queen he might play e5 e5 is fine e5 softens up his position over here a little bit maybe he'll play queen c7 okay he's trying to play e5 but he's not exactly doing it the way i would have expected playing rookie eight which is fine i guess now he's gonna try to play pony five i have one last chance by the way i can take with a pawn which could be interesting um but i'll take with the queen i don't mind and now where do we put the queen maybe h4 a little pressure over here pressure from this angle pressure from this angle the position is definitely you know better for black considering i played a4 on the second move but overall i don't know i can't really i feel like i can't complain too much pawn to e4 is interesting probably shouldn't get my queen trap can i play a5 and sneak my queen to the other side of the board that looks really stupid but maybe um e4 here we go okay plays d4 he's trying to maybe go over here i should speed up also this guy's very fast one of the reasons i actually don't like playing martin is he's uh he's not like the martin bot that's a very unfortunate namesake he has the same name as the martin bot is he gonna take with the queen is that the point interesting okay so i have a weakness but i feel like he also doesn't have like the most uh straightforward position uh rook c1 targeting the pawn my queen is really stranded i've got to get my queen back in the game maybe f4 but i gotta also guard this pawn which i weakened deliberately but maybe knight c3 knight d5 but then this pawn is so weak let's go knight a3 knight here i guess he's gonna play pawns he's got a guard his pawn probably gotta speed up i'm spending too much time analyzing the intricacies of the potato martin's not a good opponent to play if you want to make youtube content he's just too quick i don't know what he's in a rush to constantly maybe he has appointments maybe martin's a businessman you know he only has time for a couple of games and then it's off to do business did he blunder this pawn or is he threatening this great question let's double up my uh my potato has not been very fruitful this time around offering me a trade interesting i'm gonna do it like this i need to hide my king i feel like the back rank is quite exposed and also it was really a bad idea to put my queen where i did it's really stranded i'm having severe difficulties actually getting the queen back rook c2 this hangs everything so that would be kind of nice i'm gonna lose my potato upon moment of silence the potato pawn is gonna fall this is a terrible moment in my life but maybe i can bring back my and he just won't leave me alone martin i'm trying to make youtube content can you please lose to me on purpose yeah i just gotta speed up oh oh save the queen there's a nice trick i have he didn't even let me play the trick what is wrong with this guy why is he such a buzzkill i had like one trap remaining yeah i'm i'm just playing too slowly this game but never say never check check that it's all bad this is a good check this is also winning i have this but oh a terrible game a terrible showing for the potato i'm just gonna resign two pawns down not good all right what did we do wrong let's analyze let's improve our potato for the next game so this entire plan was not that great giving him the center and putting the queen here was not a good move what i should have done from this position uh is i guess i should have played pawn to d4 i should have kept things a little bit more symmetrical i gave him too much space so when they take a center approach the difference between this game and the last game is in the last game my opponent did not take a center approach i gave my opponent too much central space and i tried to do all of this fancy stuff and even here if i had gone back to let's say c1 i'm fine i mean i'm worse but i also played a4 on the second move and you know this is still a little bit annoying but just the general approach by me was what was not was not that great and you know if black had played c5 right away then i could have played e3 and then d4 and then this bishop would have gone over here and i would have expanded a bit more but interesting the way i did it i gave up too much space all right you know what fine fine you know you you win some you lose some i'm getting white in every game this is incredible it's like they know potato all right let's learn oh we're getting potatoed okay tough stuff we tried to potato we're getting potatoed um all right looks like he's fighting back with me over there very interesting stuff if i do this i'm gonna block my diagonal so it looks like we are going to get a completely symmetrical position maybe he will play h4 h5 as well um very tough to decide what you know i'm not even going to commit one of my pawns i think he's gonna copy me though okay d5 interesting let's play knight e5 trying to open up this bishop versus that bishop vis-a-vis or something like that i think that's what that means queen c1 defending my bishop from any pins very weird position so we we got mirror potatoed some people will do that because they are very unoriginal this is not a good move i think by black c5 because you're just allowing my knight to live here now now my knight is gonna forever threaten to jump into the position which i don't think for my opponent is a very good move uh that's reasonable uh i kind of like queen b2 i like this pressure maybe f4 as well this knight is very strong whoa oh my i'm i almost got trapped bishop c3 doesn't work on to d4 meaning because i can take that bishop but i did not expect that i guess i didn't expect it because it's such an ugly looking move i was like my opponent's not gonna play that okay but now i have f4 i feel like i'm really playing with fire here but the point is that d4 is just completely not playable so i'm just gonna target this right and now i thought of playing d3 but maybe i should play e3 to stop d4 first very weird position where i'm fighting over there now my bishop is closed out but i have pawn to d3 i can always play i can always take the diagonal too but then f you know i'm expecting f5 interesting position and this knight is still living here but i guess he can trade it i don't know okay god that move looks so ugly how about we play bishop e5 this is one of these very stubborn moves like i want you to take me but i don't want you to take me uh rook d1 to try to play pawn to d3 and then pawn to c4 that move doesn't do anything right yeah his move doesn't do anything so i'm gonna try to carry out my plan i'm not really worried about this because it gives me a pass pawn which will be useful in the end game and then i can even anchor it if that pawn gets powerful of course now we have 90 seconds per player so i kind of want to try this opening with black but i i'm i'm not so sure it's a great idea uh rook d2 maybe just slowly build up of course he can take at any point and then it's a really big question of whether my ponder is an asset or a liability uh pawn to h3 seems reasonable defending against knight g4 king h2 will guard this pawn i did that also against the chameleon guy now i'm up 20 seconds which is definitely good also there was a fork i think not really because the bishop would come hit me whoa that is looking very spicy let me take okay take maybe i take this one taking this looks a little too dangerous for me let me take this first uh-huh and can i take that and then that and then maybe come back for this i don't know i'm not thrilled with how this is turning out but maybe it's fine you know maybe it's actually not so bad whoa really oh because he's gonna go here is that the big idea he's gonna take with the rook but then i can take this you're gonna take with the king oh he plays that first king h2 he might play knight f3 h1 he has to take my okay i'm just gonna play king i don't have that much time to to dilly dally over here on these little little details i really don't like how unsafe my king looks this this one might end in a draw just based on how weak my king is he plays queen f2 okay uh i can give a check and i can play queen c1 i'm not sure about this move that is that does not look great okay i'm covering the checking squares he's trying to get in with his rook rookie 2 looks really brutal oh man i might have to go here play this ugly type of defense queen g1 rook d1 maybe [music] oh i'm losing everything oh i'm losing everything oh i take oh oh i lost the thread there and the complications it wasn't that bad i actually had a pretty decent position with the potato in this one i guess giving up too much central space was was the mistake again see twice i had to take i really i got too fancy there and then in this position i should stop the advancement of the pawns second time so the lesson in this is you gotta not give up this much of the center all right i'm giving up way too much central space in some of these positions um and and that's kind of the reason it got so bad it's because uh he just kind of stormed down the center of the board and yeah i mean this was just a big mistake and uh i just got slaughtered just totally totally crushed um don't give up so much of the center gotta respect the center more okay lesson learned maybe we have time for one last game well i get another game with white that would be kind of insane all right i got a game with playing petite bob um oh i'll get a reverse potato potato there it is all right my opponent played a trumpowski so i'm gonna play this in a very reserved way there it is i'm trying to trying to throw that potato that way all right um now i don't know what to do c5 d5 b6 bishop b7 this is the uh the the mega potato oh who's gonna defend that pawn who's gonna defend that pawn not so simple the way he played this onto g3 maybe ponto f5 he could go here and try to trap my rook if i take but wow aggressive giving away the g2 pawn i guess for my h7 pawn indeed um all right i guess knight c6 i mean i'm not trapped so i can always come back now he's threatening to trap me so i'm gonna win a tempo on his queen and then continue to carry out my ideas i think my idea is to go queen e7 and castle queenside because i really don't like i also have rook a5 which is a really stupid looking move but that's exactly my type of chess rook to a5 and now ponza f5 opening up this even though my bishop's not even defended which technically would make this a really stupid plan um queen g5 looks interesting on takes e4 and f5 again i have backup bishop takes i still have f5 and if this i guess i can take no i can't because this we gotta be careful i think he's gonna go h6 and i'm gonna go rook h7 he might give me a check and i will block with my queen we this is crazy how the potato with black contributed to putting the rook on a5 this is wicked stuff this is chess beyond the level of understanding that any human can can can attest to like this is some sublime level chess the bishop is hanging there's a pin on the queen to the rook that pawn is falling every major asset in white's position is falling apart and the potato pawn which we pushed restricts the enemy pawns going into the end game what that doesn't work at all i'm sorry am i missing something is my opponent trying to okay i i get it i guess we have seven stopping queen g6 and i'm just gonna win that pawn knight to g5 is a fork but i pin the knight to the queen so i'm not exactly sure what we're doing here and my potato rook is coming and if you play long castle i take with check uh or i just take on h6 with the rook right looks like it i'm not gonna lie looks like it and i always have backup that's check and uh something like rook h5 right this is so crazy look at my potato rook go i am so proud yeah i saw that move but i just assumed i would get out of this danger rook h4 i mean i'm i'm blessed by the potato gods i played the best opening known to man 97 look at this just getting out of the way here i think my opponent's gonna go queen c2 and target my potato pawn or go to b5 or something like that um now admittedly i still have to be a little careful getting careless here could straight up lose me the game because my king is in the center of the board but i am definitely feeling pretty good about my chances i guess there's queen g2 never too late to do something stupid all right brooke all the way back fine i gotta speed up i'm a piece up right like i can't knight c5 what am i thinking about i'm spending this time i don't even understand on what it's got to be just the stupid positioning of my king that's really what it is it's gonna take and now i just need to speed up a little bit and i should be in good shape check the queens also rook h1 is just dominant looking that's protected that's protected check defense check bring the king here to the lord this is a little bit closer than i would have liked but fortunately i think i'm still winning 12 seconds any hunger queen that was good that was good that was fun we played the potato with black incredible again potato was a lot harder to play against the king's pawn uh because you're gonna get run over by two pawns but if you play it against the king's pawn try to play like a french or try to play a karo khan because the faster you slow down your opponent's center the more this is gonna matter the way it happened in this game that pawn actually played quite a role because it controlled a lot of squares and then my opponent developed on this side and uh yeah we we justified the potato pawn by bringing our rook up and over that was so funny and then it supported everything and we slowed everything down that was amazing um potato variation my friends not all chess videos have to be serious uh i hope you try this out and uh for legal reasons i am not responsible for the loss of any rating points the potato was not in my book the potato is not in my courses just have some fun with it and uh see if you like it and also get out of here
