ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the travel vlog series over here on the gotham chess youtube channel i'm currently traveling uh in europe a little bit i'll be back home on april 29th so we will go back to the home setup at that point uh but in today's video we're going to be talking about cheating in chess a lot of cheating in chess and a lot of talk about a lot of cheating in chess which all sort of got started over in 2022 uh with the magnus carlson hun fiasco um as of late vladimir kramnick former world chess champion legend of the game has been in my opinion mildly reckless uh with the things that he is uh saying in particular about guys like grandmaster hikara nakamura um although i do agree with some other points that vladimir has been making over the past however many months um now the thing about cheating in chess is that it doesn't really happen over the board and it probably happens particularly online and being asow chess.com is the largest platform by far where people play games online uh they posted a report we're going to get into that report today we're also going to get into the the vladimir karnick response to that report and then i'm going to break it all down for you i'm going to show you couple of games that i've won and lost that sort of reflect on this report and essentially in a one- sentence summary if you don't have the attention span to watch this video um the report basically says underdogs lower rated players defeat higher rated players more uh in live tournaments than they do in title tuesday and since cheating is really impossible in live tournaments what this means is that underdog success rate is lower online which is where cheating is supposed to be higher which means there's really not that much cheating going on that is the 2 seconds uh summary now i'm going to get into um i'm going to get into all of this all right and then i'm going to show you some chess uh that i played recently some couple of games that that that i've played uh and um we're going to break this down we're going to look at the kick response it's going to be great also a lot of you have been asking me where i am and to come to your city i'm only in europe for a week this time but i promise you and i will say this on full screen mode so you know it's serious i promise you that i will do a europe tour and i will come back to the uk as well uh i've gotten a lot of love here in cologne uh in brussels now in amsterdam so uh yall have been amazing and it is very cool to run into people who are also traveling uh in these destinations so the chess.com fairplay report are there too many upsets in title tuesday this is the first of several plan reports from chesla comm's fair play team on cheating we try to answer are there too many upsets in title tuesday possibly suggesting widespread cheating to answer this question we use publicly available data from chess.com blah blah blah um and their analysis compares the rate of rates and over theboard blitz games to the rate of upsets in title tuesday games we used fay blitz ratings to determine underdogs because they are completely independent of ch.com ratings and best reflect this uh and they are within 5% of each other essentially the results for example when 2200s play against 2400s we see an upate upset rate of 33% over the board blitz and 30% in title tuesday um now one of the highlights of this was vladimir kramnick literally like immediately responding um and i'm just going to read it to you because i i i love when he types fantastic work but before reading it in full i can even read it in his accent but that would you know few things we must know to make it sure before checking it at all uh what set of over the board blitz games was chosen and by what parameters since comparing with title tuesday it must only be 3 plus 1 or 3 plus2 uh and only those games played by title players if this obvious condition was violated the whole research doesn't make any sense uh it is obvious to any chess player that contrary to to your opinion the games played online on chess.com must be calculated using chess.com rating but not fed ratings um i found this very funny he wrote a bunch of stuff and then he wrote i would appreciate to get the answers to these questions from just.com before reading this report otherwise it will be just losing time he also i don't know why my account is not activated but i just found it funny that he clicked this wrote this comment and then left and was like somebody tell me if they did it the right way um so the truth is uh we're going to get into this report right now um yeah the truth about the ch.com fairplay report is you know um fay blitz rating is or classical rating are both kind of weird to compare to ch.com and i'll give you an example before we read this like this is my fay page with a profile photo from like 10 years ago back when i thought i was going to have a corporate career and now i'm unemployed you know my my my blitz rating is 23 76 but if you look at my games history on the right side of your screen i almost never play blitz events i played one event in the czech republic in the summer in 2019 and before that i mean i would have three events and then i would have a year of no events so blitz rating there's not a lot of events to get your feed blitz rated there's also no real comparison between classical chess and blitz so it's a little bit tricky like i and and and i appreciate that they did you know their best and we're going to read it um and uh introduction cheating is a challenging topic to address properly historically chess.com maintain a cautious approach quietly investigating significant resources into its fair playay team in tech and yeah chess.com does not tell us a whole lot like the drug testing agencies and sports kind of tell you what they test for but you know they might not tell you the methods or whatever because then the athlete will be able to game the system etc so now that their team has grown to 30 people including 10 title players as well as a suite of researchers data scientists analysts monitors engineers we thought it was time to public publish some research into question in particular some members of the chess community including some of the very best players in the world they could have just named karnick it it is a bit strange that all of this recent stuff is like basically at the hands of one person uh but many grand masters as we see from social media do think a lot of cheating is going on have recently called into question the integrity of our title tuesday events speculating that anywhere from 25 to 50% of players in these events are cheating without being caught um and cheating happens in title tuesday but at the same time based on the information we have we believe cheating in title tuesday is limited and does not meaningfully impact title tuesday from week to week um is there widespread cheating in title tuesday to get at this question we need a set of games outside of title tuesday that we trust are clean and a set of ratings that we trust are clean so then they establish the baseline of fair play uh and uh compare what happens to title tuesday in that baseline so what they used this inperson game so games played at like world blitz championship or wherever and actually part of me saying or wherever is the problem there is not a lot of places for grand masters to play blitz like there's the grand chest tour events but really old for the most part chess is just classical chess but you know nowadays especially with the younger players they will play 10,000 chess games in a month on the internet and they will play nine in person that is really the problem that is the problem where a lot of this happens there's a huge disconnect between your offline rating and your online rating so let's acknowledge the important differences between over theboard and online play like pre-moving mouse speed internet connection 2d and 3d visualization this is a really big one i mean a lot of you know like coming live to play at a tournament is quite different i don't know what type of impact this has on like professionals and people who are title players but longer time controls in over theboard blitz which is generally 5 plus 3 or 3 plus2 which for this like again 3+ one nobody plays 3+ one that's another problem with with this report it's not the problem with the report is the problem with trying to get kind of a level of stability is that nobody plays 3 plus one the standard over theboard chest time control is 3 plus two because you can't pre-move so you get 2 seconds bonus just in general um also there is a higher level of pressure and focus over the board like nerves psychology etc um so um before we start you know they talk about average scores and how it's used and that's just wins draws losses so let's start by comparing the average score of underdogs in title tuesday games and over theboard blitz games where an underdog is any player who had a lower feed a blitz rating than their opponent now i suppose this means by even one point um which again i don't know if i love but fine let's do it underdog average scores title tuesday overs over theboard blitz this many games this many games so over theboard blitz um actually the the underdog wins more so the underdog actually wins 37% of the time uh when they have a lower rating which could be by 10 points which could be again i would have loved to see that range but fine um and uh we see underdogs actually perform worse 32% than underdogs and over theboard blitz so but it might be surprising that they actually perform better in over theboard games and i think the basically the hypothesis is if there's no cheating in live games and they win more in live games well then they win less when there's technically much more ways to cheat because the argument is that you can cheat a lot more online okay interesting um if lower rated players are actually underperforming in title tuesday does that mean title tuesday has no cheating or could it mean that higher rated players are the ones cheating in the event right higher rated players are the ones that cheat not the lower rated players like the people who are like 2900 3,000 because why do you cheat in title tuesday you cheat to win money or you cheat cuz you're a i i don't like this is the other thing i mean a lot of cheating happens at your level watching this video right now um and those people are just stupid i don't really know why they do that but you know if like you're going to cheat you should cheat to win something probably so um then they compared the average rating disadvantage of underdogs and title tuesday versus over theboard blitz so they compared the ratings obviously they're different because in online you could be 3,200 um so in title tuesday you have a bigger rating disparity right on average when you talk about an underdog um generally it's 225 points and what this means is title tuesday matchups tend to be more lopsided right average rating difference of 225 than over theboard blitz matchups and that's because of the rating system that's because of the way it works like uh a majority of grand masters are concentrated right here in over the board which is like 2600 to 2800 whereas on chesc i've played grandmaster sh 2500 and i've played hikaru 3200 and that's 700 points it's a much bigger range um so that's another problem is that the range is much bigger uh and because um over theboard blitz tournaments are invite only they have a tighter range uh and also uh the title tuesday is an 11 round swiss tournament right so there's going to be a lot of lopsided matchups okay so clearly we need to compare the average scores of underdogs while taking rating differences into account all right let's compare the underdog averages by a 50o point rating bucket so if we look at the leftmost bucket the two sidebyside green bars tell us that when someone is anywhere from 350 to 400 points lower rated than their opponent they score 24% in title tuesday games and 22% in over theboard games so if somebody is playing somebody else and they are an underdog by 350 to 400 points whether it's fed blitz or online the score is roughly the same they score maybe 2% better in title tuesday and then what they did is they separated them into these buckets right let's take one step further previous section we treated all rating differences the same group group but that's not always accurate because if you're 2,000 like again go back to my account right if if i'm if let's say i'm a child and i'm not a 20 something year old man if i'm a kid and i don't play a lot by the way great example foso oro the most talented player in the world right now international master norm earner like you know messi of chess look at his blitz rating and that blitz rating is after gaining 200 points in the span of four months he was 19 100 blitz he was 1,900 blitz while his classical rating was 2200 while his chess.com blitz rating is 2,885 and it the highest that ever was is 29.91 so there was a period in time foso oros blitz rating on chess.com was like a thousand points higher than his fedi blitz and he is not the only one like with this situation it's it might for him be more lopsided but it's a common thing so um so here we go this is a pretty gnarly matrix uh it took me a second to understand it let me just make sure i'm not getting in the way of my own crop here so they're going to summarize all of this but essentially higher rated players feed a blitz rating you go over here right and then you go over here and um you you you start talking this is the underdog score using f blitz this is over theboard blitz and if you observe the matrix which they have sort of highlighted here it's the exact same number um and the average score that one person would would would score right from losing games to you know holding a getting a 50% and so they unlock it here for us heat map on the top left shows the average score that underdogs entitled tuesday uh where they are split into 150 point buckets so if we say for example right this one what it says is the square with the violet outline shows when the lower rated player in title tuesday is rated between 2150 and 22 f blitz and the higher rated player is rated between 2600 and 2749 the low rated player score 177% on average that is insane so what this is saying is that just under like around one in six games will be won by a 2150 to 2299 player is that a typo no what so a 2180 will be a grandmas in blitz one in six games that is actually shocking and it is the exact same statistic in over theboard like title tuesday honestly i would have thought it would be more because i my hypothesis is people do cheat in title tuesday more than they would cheat over the board i don't know i don't think it's 25% but i do think more people cheat online listen it's happened to me like i've i've in my five plus years of playing title tuesday i'll play a random you know player and i'm like but they're playing way too strong like there ain't no way i also have my preconceived notions but this literally says that in over- theboard games or online games a player with this rating will beat somebody between like can you imagine a 2180 beating a 2700 in blitz it happens that's what the data shows now the heat map on the bottom shows the differences between top left and top right right so if we look at the square with the violet outline which is right there um and it's literally 0% it says that lower rated player is this and higher rated player is this which is a monster feay rating by the way the difference in title tuesday underdog average and over theboard is zero now if a square in the bottom heat map is positive that means those underdogs are performing better in title tuesday than they are in over theboard blitz so we go back right the biggest discrepancy is a 2600 to 2749 no but that's negative i thought that was positive so i hypothesized let's say people are cheating to win money okay let's say people are cheating to win money that means that their fay blitz is probably lower than their opponent but they're beating their opponent who's an established grand m right does that make sense so a player that doesn't have a high fay rating classical but has a pretty decent blitz is defeating a very strong blitz blitz player right so yeah apparently that doesn't really happen like the underdogs don't score particularly well um and they're performing worse than title tuesday compared to over theboard blitz so that's interesting right so if they're performing worse than title tuesday that means the over the board performance is actually stronger and then my question would be does that mean that when you run the results uh a 2600 to 2749 player right here is lower rated than their opponent and they actually perform worse in title tuesday now if they were performing better in title tuesday than an over theboard i could see that being a problem but they're not so that's interesting right because if they were dominating in the title tuesday of of those two r like then that would be an issue that would mean that they're winning more in title tuesday than then but they're not they're actually losing more entitle tuesday which is what the data unless i'm completely wrong and that's interesting okay now the bonus here is the classical ratings because again you go to a kids page like foso massive discrepancy not the only one there's also other players that have these types of discrepancies all right so they use f blitz for two reasons right and they're talking about blitz strength now again the caveat is there is not a lot of opportunities to play f blitz events okay that's kind of the issue and that is one of the things that mr kramnick was so eloquently arguing here uh he was saying the games played online must be calculated using chesomg with that so it makes little sense examining using fed ratings often people inactive since only yep right right so they use both which i think is correct um empirically we looked at how differen is in feda classical rating maps uh to over theboard outcomes and compare those to f classical ratings map to over theboard blitz um and yet even though we don't think feta classical ratings are the best ratings to use to predict what's going on in blitz chess we still made a comparison and if you look here it's pretty similar so underdog average scores en title tuesday using fay classical ratings so they gave you fay blitz and they gave you fay classical so basically they compared people who play against other people in title tuesday and people who play against other people in over theboard chess both in classical and in blitz i am not sure you can be much more thorough than that and overall results are relatively accurate and they're relatively comparable like the map here shows that over the course of a lot of games and a big sample size the results don't really change the underdog scores the lower rated player scores consistently whether it's in title tuesday or over the board whether it's fed classical or fay blitz which is interesting uh that is that is definitely like this was an interesting read for me because i actually thought it would be more um now they don't believe that there's no cheating in title tuesday bad actors do exist uh in 2023 they closed 150 titled players as well as over 1 million non-titled accounts which is completely nuts but i mean a lot of people are playing chess so a lot of people are cheating also like a massive percentage of this is is like kids and teenagers uh in my opinion now this is nuts 150 title players close for cheating is kind of nuts because you got to wonder there's no way they were cheating to win money right because the same people win title tuesday like every week or two weeks h and a handful of those grand masters get accused of cheating like jose martinez has been accused right like um other players by karnick uh i can't remember off the top of my head like lvic right they get accused they're not banned because they're not cheating according to ch.com and $150 title players have been banned you got to wonder for what like when did they cheat why did they cheat like why are they cheating now some people have theories why this many people title this many title players cheat it some people say it's like you cheat to beat a strong player and then put it on your account that you like beat somebody so you can get students like imagine being a chess teacher and saying oh i beat fabiano carana and blitz you know take lessons for me that's a theory i'm not saying that's my theory but that is really fascinating that this many people have been banned for cheating um and their report does identify small discrepancies between underdog scores and um yet without much more research we cannot quantify how much of the discrepancies we see are explained by cheating and then they made an addendum um now one thing and this this is me now talking completely out of my own backside um i'm a statistics major some of you may not know this i got a degree in statistics and quantitative modeling uh that was before i became a chess teacher and when i read this i was like where are the p values i was like my basic understanding of doing a statistical report is like where is like the probability and the correlation and the this and that and i do wonder if there is a way to let you know in a subsequent report like this was all good and this was definitely interesting to read but it's still to me like there's this open-ended question of what if i'm a what if i'm a i'm a grandmaster who's like number 130 in the world or something and i'm just going to cheat a little bit entitled tuesday like a a tiny bit and i'm going to win some prizes right like this is the big theory like what what if like i'm really smart with my cheating like oh how would they catch that i'm really curious like actually how would they catch that um and and and and who knows you know maybe they will tell us the methodology maybe they won't um but if they do i will make a video about it now before i sign off um i wanted to take you through a very similar you know experience of mine this it's a very funny story so first of all the best win i have against the fay rated blitz player is probably my win against peter sidler i beat peter sidler right when the pandemic started um and uh i mean god maybe he had co and brain fog when he lost to me but he lost to me and you know sometimes uh broken clock is right twice a day and peter fidler is an absolute legend of the game you look at his fed profile he's like 2700 blitts 2734 rapid you know and my i don't remember what it was then but uh i think i have the same rating by the way so this was an upset of you know three 310 points it's a lot it's really big 310 points and if we look at um this was a game actually i'm going to show you a bit later uh this was a 300 and i don't know i don't think it was maybe it was this big but it's like a 400 point upset which is you know what happens um most of the people that i beat the strong grand masters and title tuesday like i have a couple of wins recently you know they're like 25 2600 feed blits 200 points right but we know from this report that generally the underdogs are bigger in title tuesday now recently i lost to a to a player from el salvador i never heard of this guy in my life i was just like actually it was here i was like playing on vacation and i i lost the game and he was rated 2400 and i was like i don't know who this is and i clicked on his account and it's uh you know his name is carlos morales subon naal uh el salvador uh i was like who is this guy right so you know i looked at his fed 2100 2027 but if you look at you know he's a much more active player and i think he's probably stronger than his rating because if you look at his fay like he gained 50 points and he gained 24 and like again people have unrealized level right and then i went to carlos's page i found it very funny carlos if i scroll down carlos lost the game to a person from colombia he lost the game to el elias guzman compo and i found a a page for elias guzman who's 70 it's a 70-year-old dude and he's rated 21 he's rated higher because it's his best it's his the best thing he does he's he just likes to play blitz so he's the he's the stronger he's the stronger in blitz and he actually beat the guy who beat me right so my point is like it's all over the place like all this stuff is completely all over the place like the fay blitz the fay class class there's got to be a way to standardize it i think that's what they were going for in this report right and like i said i beat sidler i mean it happens and i think the underdogs do score on a relatively consistent level and the biggest surprising story is stories like fao i'm using foso as an example because he's very popular right now very strong player and all these ratings are going up but i have played so many people i've played so many people i go to their fed page their classical is going up but don't play any rapid and blitz so i've played kids who are like 22 2300 here 1,00 here and like 1,800 here because maybe if you grow up somewhere in the world doesn't matter it could be anywhere south america europe africa asia like you could grow up anywhere if you don't play a lot of blitz your blitz is going to be super low so they tried to do their best to standardize and um long story short it seems like considering all things in a way that makes sense and a way that numerically you can account for certain differences and variance the underdogs win at a consistent rate in over the board and in title tuesday whether you use classical rating whether you use fed blitz in fact they perform uh they underdogs perform better in over theboard play which is surprising now um is there a way to do a report like this just for prize money like we don't care about the 2100s we don't care about the 2100 uh feed rated guy that beats gotham chess who's 2376 we don't care about that only grand masters and only grandmaster games and only in prize money events maybe that's the next report but this is a big update um and uh vladimir you know gave his you know kind of gave his take and um vladimir like once a week once every couple weeks will say something very nasty about me on social media so i've i've just sort of uh i don't particularly engage um been trying to be pretty even keeled but i i do take issue with his whole approach of like here's a bunch of statistics that i think are suspicious and should be you know explained but i'm not accusing anybody so um the way he goes about it you know i kind of am confused about but um he you know he makes some points uh some good points here and there so a pretty big uh update uh for chess cheating over here from europe it's late now i'm going to go it's actually king's night so maybe i'll run around with like in my underwear on the streets of amsterdam holding chest pieces um and that's all i have for you today get out of here
