ladies and gentlemen in this video i'm going to tell you the funny story of how i was selected for a scan by the chess.com anti-cheating fairplay team how i had to play under monitored proctoring during a chess.com tournament and how i played a game that if there ever was a game they would probably ban me from chess.com for cheating and this all started on on a tournament that i played on november 28th i played a tournament on chess.com called title tuesday title tuesday is an 11 round tournament where only title players play against other title players i've had some good runs back in my day all right i've beaten some very strong grand masters most recently i beat ali resa fuja i beat the number one rated player in the world in blitz chess i made a video about it obviously well this is what happened on november the 28th november the 28th was one of the worst title tuesdays i have ever had i started it by beating a 2,300 then i lost to a 2300 then i lost to a 2500 i was one out of three then i beat a 2300 then i lost to a 2509 i lost three of my first six games it was crazy and i couldn't win look then i lost to a 2490 and by the end of the event i did manage to win two games in a row but i went six out of 11 and i lost five games i lost 1 2 3 four five games when title tuesday began i was 2698 and when title tuesday ed i was 2653 i was even as low as 2645 i lost 53 rating points in that title tuesday it was one of the worst title tuesdays of my life i was getting clapped left and right i was losing to these players who were uh i was actually outplaying some of these people and i was still getting terrible you know i was i was still losing that's all to say that one of the next days i got this email title tuesday fair play check dear levy you've been selected to participate in our fair play checks this is standard protocol you can't see it cuz i'm in the way to protect the integrity of the event for your next title tuesday you'll be asked to play on camera which is ironic because i stream the entire thing please join the following zoom link 15 minutes before the first round starts and essentially the rest of this email said this protocol that we have is so that nobody is above the law and regardless of your stature you know everybody is subjected to this now this was a crazy experience i wish i filmed it i joined a zoom link okay where a vague eastern european voice started talking to me in russian because they recently watched my interview i recently interviewed dennis lazovic in the russian language that's on chu and uh and then they told me i needed to turn on that webcam i have a webcam right here which is hanging on my computer there that's the that's my second camera and then they told me i needed to share my screen so i had to play the whole event with my whole screen shared they needed me to do something with this other monitor that i have that you can't see cuz you're there and i'm here there's two monitors in this room i don't have one of those six monitor setups and then like they they had me proctored monitored i had to they made me open task manager and then in the task manager i had to delete discord slack team viewer any app that could have some sort of communication and that's the way they made me play uh the event this might just be how it works my friends like th you know this was funny obviously but but it's um it it this is good protocol this is good protocol like the truth is there is really no way to ensure that random people across the world that are actually playing to win online prize money tournaments like there's no way to ensure whether they're cheating or not unless you do something like this yes there are stats and there are numbers and all that good stuff we all know that but this actually is a good initiative and i was very curious to see how it would go and i was in a room of a bunch of other title players some i knew some i didn't uh there was a there was grand masters in there and it's not that they suspect anybody of cheating maybe they do not me cuz i suck but uh some these people right nobody's above the law that's not the overlay that i wanted to open but now you get to see my stream overlay here we go i managed to play a game in this title tuesday under strict supervision that was a monster performance and it was one of the coolest games that i've ever played and uh my opponent is a uh is a ukrainian young man who's actually 13 years old so i'm showing you a game where i beat up a child who was half my age but i still managed to play a very very nice game with all the anti cheat on and it was it was i just wanted to show you this game and and that that was very interesting how i received that email and i do think it is very important i do think it's funny i was selected uh but it just goes to show you nobody's above law all grand masters are subject to it nikita played the move d4 against me and i played the modern defense uh i played uh actually my course i have a g6 modern course which you might want to buy after you watch this game i'm just saying so g6 bishop g7 and the major question when white plays the dnc pawns is if whether or not white is going to play this pawn here you can also play this move order where you not not not not that you can also play this move order where you prevent e4 for a little bit with your knight uh but i like to do it this way i actually like to delay the development of my g8 knight now my opponent took the entire center this goes back to a completely traditional kings indian but in my opinion the entire purpose of playing the slightly different move order is the fact that you don't need to go back to a kings's indian and instead you can play this move kn c6 and this is in my modern course and i i really like this move because you immediately put white under some pressure you either force white to move the pawn here or white develops the knight which is to me an inaccuracy because you have bishop g4 pinning the knight and then you can play takes and then i really like these positions i really like these positions where you damage your opponent's structure and white can get in a whole lot of trouble very quickly if they're not careful they could try to chase your pawn and you know they think they want a pawn but queen a5 check and they have to go here and that's just just nobody's very happy about that situation black is doing very very well so there's these very nice lines but my opponent the young man he um he knew what he was doing he played bishop to e3 i played this move e5 i don't have to play e5 at any point i can kind of go here i played e5 he played d5 and the entire purpose of this opening is to jump that night p vault all right like a track and field athlete into d4 and the point is that if wers develops i'm going to play c5 and once i can anchor in my knight like that it's going to be very difficult for white to get rid of which is why nikita to his credit played knight to e2 and now i'm in a bad situation because if i play c5 he plays on pass and then i have to go back with my knight and it's very ugly so i took and i played this move f5 just trying to get a little bit of space and trying to play this move f4 in these positions white is going to try to attack on the queen side because white has more space that's what white tries to do in kings indian structures black is going to try to go over here and maybe bribe white not to attack on this side of the board now now here i played an interesting move here i played a a move that if you don't know this line you probably will not know this move obviously bishop f5 looks natural but g takes f5 is actually the better move allowing your opponent to check you and not just check you you actually have to move your king normally this is very very bad but actually for white this is a slight waste of time because white is going to have to move the bishop back and black is actually pretty safe i mean this looks pretty ridiculous and i would say don't try this at home or if you don't have a minimum elo of like 1,200 don't do this but now like what does white do i mean if white just castled i'm going to play f4 right and then i'm going to play queen h4 and position is actually not that unpleasant at all so my opponent plays g3 i play knight f6 just trying to target the bishop my opponent now has to get out of my position and now what what what black really wants to accomplish is probably prevent some expansion here consolidate like along the seventh rank and figure out what's next i played this move h5 i didn't actually remember what the move here was but i but i i thought h5 was very logical i will explain why it's not that i want to go attacking it's it's actually that i want to trade this bishop that is a very powerful bishop which simultaneously supports the expansion on the queen side and also actually can come and pin me whereas this bishop is sort of stuck like that bishop can't really do a whole lot so i thought in the future i will go here this is also good to take some space and if my opponent plays h4 i will happily put my knight on g4 but h4 is probably the best move uh but my opponent here played f4 and lost his advantage right he definitely has a little bit of an advantage because black played a provocative opening i already can't can't castle but f4 is a bad move f4 is a bad move because the idea is very simple he wants to open up my king but he's allowing me to get a pass pawn which is a pawn that is only stopped from going to the end of the board by other pieces not by pawns so i get a pass pawn which is blockaded but he's never going to open up this plus e4 opens up my bishop in the long run and on top of that i have a way right now to secure a bishop so knight g4 so suddenly l he is going to justify my entire play he's going to let me put the knight on g4 he probably should take it like between these two bishops white should definitely lose the light squ bishop for all the reasons that i just said the dark squ bishop helps the attack right but if he takes like this then he just justifi like look at my rook my rook's a beast now right and if he waits any longer i'm still going to play e4 so i'm going to have all the pressure on his position so instead of that he went here that's not a good move this is not the trade that he wants and it's very important that you understand understand which of the bishops you want to give away for the knight that's a very sophisticated kind of little decision there so f4 knight g4 he gives me this bishop i take right away now here i made a mistake i made a mistake i didn't want to play the move e4 right now to open up because i thought c5 was annoying but the computer is really not afraid of c5 it it it does not think that this is scary it wants to trade the queen it's completely not worried about knight b5 it thinks i'm just defending everything and now i have the two bishops i have a pass pawn i have two bishops i can use my h pawn to attack so my position kind of go you know goes together very well i played b6 which was a little bit a little bit not the best because i allowed him to take and i thought that i was fine in this position but the truth is he might get a little bit something and the computer is not scared the computer but this looks a little shaky i should have anticipated the closing i should have anticipated the opening of the center would have been bad for me i should have played e4 right away but he gave me another chance right and if you think about it nikita's move rook f1 kind of doesn't make sense i'm not trying to be mean or dismissive or just respectful but if he wanted to start an attack i feel like he should have just taken my pawn and then played rook f1 maybe he was worried about this right and that would be very tragic my bishop comes alive this move is only made possible because i actually played h5 a while ago right if my pawn was still on h7 i wouldn't have been able to play that move um but maybe that's what he was concerned about but in any case now we have this and now we have to battle from this position so i have the two bishops um he has to decide where he's putting his king like he could still walk the king over there he could play king f2 um i also have to worry about where this knight is going to go so i was worried that he was going to play knight b5 i thought he was going to castle in this position and then i was going to play something like queen f6 maybe he would play rook d2 to protect against mate play knight b5 i would stop knight b5 by playing a6 and we would just have a very tense game i would play here i would play here he would try to break apart my pawns and try to get after this it's a very very very tense battle but he played h3 first so it was very clear to me that when he played h3 he wants to go g4 right that's the he wants to break apart my pawn structure so i have a big decision to make g4 looks very scary do i play a6 stopping knight b5 knight d4 and the knight is getting in there you know do i play queen f6 do i play bishop d7 very very tough decision by me uh i don't really know what to do so i played um i played queen f6 in this position i played here i thought about bishop d7 but then the question is what am i doing here well i guess i can take right i can take in a worst case scenario for me the worst case that could happen for for black is i let him castle and then i i allow the knight to get to d4 where it will then promptly go to c6 obviously in this case i guess i would also just lose this pawn so i would need to defend myself before that so queen f6 here he played a move that really confused me here he played a move that made the alarm bells go off in my head he played rook b1 and as you can tell from the evaluation we go from equal to minus point6 why the idea of rook b1 actually is very logical the idea of rook b1 actually makes plenty of sense the idea of rook to b1 right is to move the knight that's it but then the question is why did he not castle and the answer is i don't know you technically still cannot move the night but at least you have rook d2 two right you have rook d2 which defends mate you can play like this and i don't know what i would have done here i mean i probably would have gone here maybe i would have walked my king to b7 like a6 king b1 king e7 and then like i literally would have walked my king there who knows maybe that's you know an interesting plan um but instead of that he went rook b1 and i realized wait a minute he's never going to cancel so nikita is deliberately leaving his king in the center of the board and i had to think like wait a minute is that is that good for him so i played bishop d7 in retrospect i probably should have played a6 i probably but cuz he could still play knight b5 and this is definitely the best move so chess is all about thinking what you want but what does my opponent want and the truth is this is the only piece that can pose me any problems i'm a bozo and i definitely should have stopped knight b5 um i played bishop d7 just because i was like well i'm developing a piece but you are going to see in a moment that bishop d7 actually proved to be the the greatest move that i played in this game how like how does that even well now nikita decided it was time to open up the position as you can tell from the evaluation bar sliding into my favor and removing white from existence there g4 was not a good move uh it was not a good move to open up because the king is actually pretty weak for white doesn't look that way because i can't take anything but i promise it is um he should have went knight b5 he should have went knight b5 hoping for this trade at which point i i think i promptly lose all of my advantage cuz it's now very hard for me to move and i only have pressure on a pawn which he can just go to b3 and then play rook c1 so i'm not going to be able to get my rooks in the game because i can't make pawn trades right that's going to be the problem every trade has a winner and a and a loser this trade black is the winner why because after this i get on the h file now apparently i should have just taken this pawn because him getting this is only good for me why cuz his king is a whole lot weaker than mine that is a shish kebab of chess pieces if i have ever seen one not to mention i'm coming in on both sides right so it's really really dangerous i actually thought losing that pawn was bad so here i play this move rook h2 i don't have a threat yet but the threat is to follow up with a queen shack now some of you may be wondering by the way why that's not the best move cuz in chess you don't always give a check just because you can you have to think queen h4 king d2 do i have a follow-up you need to ask yourself this question more often in chess do i have a follow-up the answer to the question is no and you don't want to lead with the queen because all of a sudden you might get hit with a rook move and now you're getting punished so rook h2 first okay rook h2 lead with the queen from that angle and then rook e8 is next defending the pawn and then i'm going to take on g4 here he played g5 so he stops my plan of queen h4 check he also gets a pass pawn but i offer a queen trade and i thought this was a major moment in the game because what i anticipated happening now and just in general how do you decide when to trade queens you have to think about what's going to happen and and what the situation is when that trade happens okay so in this position who has benefited probably black because black has a very powerful bishop right you start looking at white's pieces where can they go this bishop literally has no forward moves the knight can go to b5 but then will get taken and i will plant my bishop in his territory and then i will bring my other rook rook g2 rook a like it it's a very difficult position white cannot move at all so who does that trade benefit probably me but he actually doesn't really have a choice because i realized he can't move his queen to g3 like why not it's attacking my rook it's attacking my rook and i actually have to move my rook back well i'm going to turn off the evaluation bar queen g3 was played in the game now queen g3 is the best move for white except black has one move that is winning now you may say well how is that the best move because at a certain level of chess at a certain level of chess the best move is the best move but it's really hard to see if the best move is the best move but no low rated player is around to see it right well as it turns out right now i have to go back h8 h7 etc but as it turns out i can threaten checkmate danger levels what how where is the mate pawn 2 e3 utilizing the square that he just came off of i can play pawn 2 e3 but that move doesn't look like it works because the threat is queen d2 but that's very easy to stop how do you stop queen d2 not only is it easy to stop i actually give myself more problems i'm in some really bad shape now my friends my queen is hanging and so is my rook so clearly e3 is a massive mistake because what am i going to i i have to go back it's the only safe move after queen c5 he takes my rook and uh i am completely lost so what have i done well let's put it all together i told you a long time time ago that the move bishop to d7 was the best move that i played in this game well that's because in this position i played queen takes knight and i saw that from a distance i saw when i played queen d4 that he would move his queen attacking my rook thinking i had to retreat and he would stop his thought at queen g3 e3 threatening mate you got to think of danger levels and after rook d1 one it is actually a very bad situation for black if not for this move queen takes knight and the craziest thing about this position is he is blocked in by both of his rooks the rooks that are supposed to defend the king have actually smooshed him he plays rook d2 and now the move that makes all of this possible the bishop on d7 goes to a4 and the king is smothered and it's checkmate when i saw this i was so hyped i saw this back here like when i played rook h2 i thought oh okay queen d4 and i'm going to have a and then i went if this e3 threatening mate rook d1 take take take the the pawn blocks the king so the rook's got a block i take the king takes the and and oh my god and bishop a4 is possible because i took the knight the hardest thing about visualizing this is that the bishop can go there at the end and the knight can't take it and that the pawn smooshes in the king oh my goodness this game got me a game review of 97% this was a brilliant move and an estimated elo of 3250 while playing on ches com's fair play uh after this game they might call me in every single time i wanted to share this with you because it was a very interesting game i think there's like a lot of things to learn from games like this you know like the fact that black's king is a little bit weak early on white tries to open the position now knight g4 it's the question of which bishop to trade i like sharing games like this cuz i i do think there's you know four to five teachable moments um and you know creating the right exchanges and preventing the opening of the center which i didn't do now closing the center down so he's not able to attack me and these kind of moments of disallowing the knight infiltration which i should have done a little bit faster but the infiltration of the rook the trade of the queens and i mean oh my i could replay it a 100 time what a move i will relish in the victory over the young man uh and uh that's how i i got summoned for chess.com fair playay checks and how i pass them with flying colors i beat seven players lower than me and i lost to four players higher than me so everything is balanced in the universe um on a bigger note this is obviously something that the chess world will have to battle for many many years players playing from remote locations without any proctoring they're going to have to play with multiple webcams they're going to have to open up their microsoft task manager or whatever it's called on mac i don't know what task manager is called on mac cuz i'm a normal person who uses windows uh no just kidding i'm just not a photographer or a musician or a creative person or a coder or anybody that has taste that's all i have for you today hope you enjoyed the game and uh tomorrow i'll probably make a video about all the crazy stuff going on in the chess world here in late 2023 with the candidates so look forward to that till then get out of here
