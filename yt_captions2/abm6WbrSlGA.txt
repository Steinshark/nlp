as a software developer one of the things that 
has helped me excel really quickly in my career is   having great mentors and this is something that i 
do not take for granted is having people who i can   rely on when it comes to my career when it comes 
to advice around it and even technical advice but   this brings up the question and that many of you 
ask me is how do you find a mentor how did i find   my mentors today i'm going to be sharing with 
you some of my tips and tricks around finding   and building that relationship with a mentor 
and not just any mentor but a mentor that you   really look up to that you really truly want to 
emulate their career that can help you build yours   and you know me i'm a data person i like to know 
around uh statistics and numbers so i researched   how important are mentors to other people to see 
if there was a survey done on this and there was   and it's actually really interesting 30 say it's 
very important to have a mentor but a total of 47   almost 50 percent of people say it's important 
for them to have a mentor or they want to have   a mentor that's a huge percentage of people 
who recognize and understand the importance   of mentorship but what's more interesting is 76 
of people consider mentors important but less   than half have one right now so why is that we 
all know mentorship is so important but why do   so few of us have it well in my experience one 
of the main reasons is because people are scared   to ask in the first place a lot of times you are 
too scared to ask will you be my mentor or can i   take you out for coffee and that fear i think it 
comes from the fear of rejection fear of someone   saying you know what no i don't want to be your 
mentor or i am too busy but when you really take   a step back and look at it is it really that 
bad okay let's get into my thoughts around this and on the note of mentorship and forming 
relationships i really wanted to share with   you about a conference i am so excited to be 
part of which is the interact conference 2022.   it is happening october 25th it is virtual and 
the best part it's completely free i was part of   their last conference and honestly hands down 
it was the best conference i've ever attended   listening to some incredible industry 
engineering leaders was so inspiring and   getting to interact with them getting to ask 
questions be part of this community it was   one of the best opportunities i've had to 
develop relationships with people for potential   mentorships and i think you can really benefit 
from it the same way here are some of the panel   topics that will be covered connecting your 
dev team's work to the business bottom line   being a leader in uncertain times 
how to treat devs like human beings   and the science of building products for emerging 
industries and yes i mentioned learning and   listening from some of the top engineering leaders 
some of them include carolyn voe who is partner   and head of engineering at oliver wyman james 
stanier the director of engineering at shopify   and rukmini reddy who is the svp of platform 
engineering at slack and more make sure to check   their website for more announcements of upcoming 
speakers okay so we spoke a little bit about the   speakers but some other top companies who will be 
attending include stripe shopify slag and more one   of my favorite things about this is it gives you 
access to the dev interrupted discord channel and   this is a discord channel that is filled with 
engineering leaders who bounce ideas off each   other who have questions for each other and it's 
a great way to really connect with other leaders   in the industry last thing that needs to be 
mentioned there is giveaway and prizes so i need   it's free it's virtual there's giveaways and 
prizes i don't think i need to say more anyways   make sure to join me there there's a live chat 
to make sure to say hi to me the day of the event   and here is some more information about it it 
is an all-day event and yes it will be recorded   but make sure not to miss the real thing 
as there will be so much opportunities for   networking and virtually meeting other people 
also don't forget to tell your colleagues and   your friends this event is for everyone it's 
completely free so make sure to register i linked it down below go sign up today   the first thing that you really need to ask 
yourself is why why do you want a mentor and this   is really important because there can be so many 
reasons why you want to mentor whether it be for   to help you with learning something new for 
example you are learning a new programming   language and you need the support that a mentor 
can bring or maybe it's for the purpose of a   career you really want that support and guidance 
when it comes to your career what are the best   steps to take what are the best companies to go to 
there is so many different reasons that people get   into relationships get into relationships yeah i 
guess it is a relationship with a mentor and it's   really important to establish the why as to why 
you are getting into a relationship with a mentor   because that will really determine or dictate 
as to how you approach them in the first place   and your why can change over time too so what you 
have for a why today don't feel as though you have   to stay committed or set onto it it can change 
as you continue to grow as well but when you   initially reach out to a mentor it's important 
to have the why why do you want to meet with   them why do you want to build this relationship 
with this person after you have established why   why it is that you want to mentor in the first 
place the next step is to reach out to them and   i'm going to add on screen here a little 
snippet that really helped me when i'm   looking to reach out to someone and connect with 
them and maybe build a mentorship relationship   so pause here and you can screenshot this or save 
this for next time you're reaching out to a mentor   okay now that we got that part out you have the 
why you have reached out to them now how do you go   about building this relationship how do you just 
straight up be like be my mentor this is what i   want from you no it has to be a two-way street and 
the best way to do that is it takes time it needs   to develop over time in an organic way and on that 
note of building a relationship it's something   that takes time it doesn't happen overnight and 
the reality is you don't want to start reaching   out to mentors or contacts when you actually need 
something or you really need their advice you want   to build that relationship prior because there 
will come a time where you will need their help   where you will need their advice and rather than 
doing it right when you actually need the advice   do it ahead of time and what that will do is we'll 
build a genuine relationship they're not going to   be thinking oh this person's just reaching out 
to me because they need something again or oh   here goes so and so needing something no you're 
building that relationship over time and that   is one of the biggest tips of pieces of advice 
that was given to me and that i always do is   look at your future self how could this help 
you in the future and obviously you don't want   to build relationships just based on what they can 
do for you you want to build a two-way street but   don't just think about the now don't look so 
narrow think so narrow-minded think about your   future self and how what you are doing today the 
relationships you're doing today will help you in   the long run and on that note of relationships 
developing naturally and organically over time   i did a little bit more research around this 
so i searched up how did mentee and mentor   relationship start and it's really interesting 
i'll pull up a graph here and it says 61   of the relationships developed naturally which 
i think is really interesting because it doesn't   have to be one of those things where you come 
right out and say hey can you be my mentor   no it can start out with that i'm interested in 
your career path i want to emulate your career hey   i saw you worked x y and z i saw you work here i 
want to work there or having this organic approach   will really make it more of a two-way street to 
the mentor versus just hey can you be my mentor   like if that's a very take take take mentality and 
i think it needs to be more of a two-way street   and on that note i think it goes without saying 
well i think it goes without saying but yet so   many people don't do this is after you have a call 
with someone or even if you meet them in person   take time to send them a thank you note it goes 
such a long way and it's such an easy thing to do   yet so many people take it for granted how far it 
goes i know for myself if i meet with someone or   have a coffee with someone if they take the time 
to actually send a thank you note it makes me feel   so good like wow they really appreciated my time 
i went out of my day to speak to them and they're   acknowledging that so send a thank you note and 
send it in a timely manner send it right after   or the same day that you meet with that person and 
for those of you who are worried about constantly   meeting or i'm not saying you have to meet every 
week or every second day actually according   to this survey here they surveyed over 3 000 
individuals who are incorporate around mentorship   and the frequency of in-person meetings is less 
than once per month so it's not as though you have   to be meeting on a weekly basis but the important 
thing is keeping the communication open keeping   the relationship flowing by letting them know 
what you are up to or asking different questions and all that notice i don't think you know another 
thing that's really important is to maintain the   relationship it's not one of those things that 
you go for coffee once send a thank you note and   expect them to do the heavy lifting no you were 
the one who reached out to get this mentorship   to form this relationship so you need to put in 
a little bit of work and that needs to be on an   ongoing basis one of the things that i like 
to do a lot for maintaining or nurturing a   new relationship is i will actually some of the 
tips that they gave me throughout our coffee or   our initial talk i will of course put them into 
play and then let them know when i have done so so   for example if someone says oh you should really 
read this article or check out this resource i   actually will do it i mean that's the whole point 
of this mentorship is two-way kind of mentorship   and when i do do it when i do read these articles 
or whatever it is the tip they have given me   i'll send a little note to them i'll say hey 
so-and-so i took time read this article here   are a few thoughts i have on that and what 
it does is it keeps the dialogue open and   the conversation moving and it really makes the 
person who you are building that relationship   up with to mentor you feel like hey so-and-so 
tiffany or whoever it is is actually taking   what i'm saying and listening to it they find it 
valuable and that makes it almost feel like it's   worth their time to meet with you more and 
i've been talking a lot about this two-way   relationship but what exactly do i mean by it 
at the end of the day mentorship can become a   life-changing opportunity i know because it's 
completely changed my life in the sense of   really helping me establish a sense of career 
a sense of direction and i really think he can   do the same for you it's it's takes time 
and it takes effort but with both of those   things combined like anything you will find a 
great mentor and can really shape your career   thank you all for watching if you haven't already
