do i really want to work out of fang or men 
company or is it what i'm programmed to think   based on what i see people online saying how 
amazing it is these are the most amazing companies   to work for you're only successful if you work for 
one of these companies this is something i've been   thinking about recently as i've been getting so 
so many questions about why don't you work out   a fan company why don't you go work at facebook 
or why don't you work at netflix or google and   it really surprised me at first how many questions 
i was getting related to this because it's not   something i had even really put much thought to 
and to have so many people be so passionately   asking me this really got me thinking today 
i'm going to be sharing with you my thoughts   on working at a fang company or mang for this 
video we're just gonna say fang to keep it simple   but before we dive into it make sure to hit that 
subscribe button for more tech and coding related   videos give this video a thumbs up and also leave 
in the comments other tech or coding or career   or personal just let me know what videos 
you want to see okay let's get started also i want to say a huge shout out to 
formation.dev for sponsoring this video if you   are a junior to mid-level engineer who wants to 
find a job at a fan-level top-tier company their   fellowship program is meant for you formation has 
a really unique program that's recently helped   engineers land roles at facebook google twitch 
lyft airbnb and many of the top companies in   silicon valley and one thing i really like about 
formation and i thought was really interesting   is it was founded by staff level engineers from 
both facebook and nextdoor who have interviewed   thousands and thousands of different candidates 
and wanted to make that process better you can   apply directly on their website at formation.dev 
for this fellowship and get set up with a training   plan that is personalized to you for your 
specific skills gaps direct mentorship from   super senior engineers and referrals directly 
into top companies in the industry that's pretty   amazing and one thing i'm really excited about is 
to hear directly from the ceo of formation sophie   hi my name is sophie and i founded formation 
after years of interviewing just hundreds of   engineers at facebook and nextdoor and after 
years of mentoring people trying to bridge   the gap i learned that people did not need 
access to any more instruction you know the   internet has made it such that people have 
virtually unlimited access to material online and   the overwhelming amount of it is actually making 
it such that people just have no idea what they   should be studying or how good they need to be at 
what topics um and what people need is not just   more videos or more leak code but rather access 
to real practice opportunities where they can   practice solving algorithms and talking through 
system design decisions and get feedback on   how they are performing and so we designed the 
entire fellowship around this model of unlimited   practice and feedback directly from current 
engineers at the world's top tech companies   you know technology is having a game-changing 
impact across almost every industry and   it is my hope that you know if you're ambitious 
about making a positive impact on the world   that there is a pathway into 
the tech industry for you i remember when i was first starting out in the 
tech industry i often would think that working at   these companies was the end-all be-all that if you 
work at one of these companies one of these fan   companies you have made it and my thought process 
on that or my take on that has definitely shifted   a lot as i've grown throughout my experience 
in the tech industry but before we even really   dive into that i want to kind of highlight 
that yes there are some amazing perks that   come alongside working at these companies but as a 
side note to a side note a lot of these perks come   with working at a lot of other companies but we 
really correlate them directly to fang companies   and that's fine so today i want to share with you 
some of the pros and cons uh as someone who has   been in the industry now for almost five years as 
a software developer and has worked at both a big   company and a startup have friends that work at 
fan companies have friends that work at startups   and just what i've heard and where my thought 
process is on that i've seen recently a ton of   videos on this topic about do i want to work out a 
fan company or videos really saying how amazing it   is or how unamazing it is and i really wanted to 
share my thoughts with you so let's kind of take a   second step back and look at what are the benefits 
of working at a fan company well for starters pay   usually working at a fan company results in 
high salary high benefits high stock different   kind of things like that the entire package it 
often times more than not you are going to have   a really cushy salary and i would say actually 
cushy full compensation everything that comes with   it another thing another benefit of working 
at one of these companies is the side perks   from free gym memberships to gyms in the office 
to unlimited learning resources to these amazing   mentors to just the potential of the perks are 
it's kind of all-encompassing maybe it'd be free   lunch free snacks free food uh different things 
like that that definitely make it really enjoyable   another thing that i don't think is talked about 
enough at fang companies and this is just from   what i have heard from friends as i mentioned 
i don't work at a fan company but is there is   this community you're working with other amazing 
people and this sense of especially when you're in   office and you're meeting these other people and 
connecting with these other people that you get   that sense of community another thing with working 
at fang companies that is often spoken about is   career growth yes working at a fan company looks 
amazing on your resume it really helps you whether   you leave a fan company to start your own company 
or move to another company that that kind of what   is it clout is that what it's called is that 
what the young kids are calling it nowadays   uh that being able to have on a resume will 
really help you and elevate you in your career   journey okay so those are just some of the perks 
of working at a fan company but my question to you   is and something that i've been wondering is can't 
you get that at other companies can't you get paid   well can't you get that sense of community that 
learning growth can't you get all those maybe   some some are more than others for example maybe 
pay isn't quite as high as working in a fan   company as it is at some other companies or maybe 
uh that career growth or career trajectory isn't   quite as high but can't you get is it really 
just only these few companies that offer that   and that is why i was always so 
hesitant when people ask me about   what company is my dream company or what company 
in fang do i really want to work for or will i   make a switch to a fan company and my answer is 
for me it's not about what company i work for   it's about aligning myself and my values to a 
company who has very similar values as well now   is there ever going to be a company that 
is totally aligned more often than not   no but overall things that are important to me for 
example are flexibility good pay good community   learning growth being able to grow my career 
taking on new challenges feeling like i have   mentorship and support so these are all things i 
just said fang has to offer but i also know from   my experience that this these are all things that 
a ton of other companies have to offer as well   which i think is really exciting because 
it means that you're not limited to   five companies or a few companies in order to 
get these things so here's my takeaway after   kind of my summary or my takeaway out of all of 
this which is do i want to work at a fan company it doesn't i'm neutral i don't have a 
yes or no i absolutely love where i'm at   now and what i am doing now and it's not something 
that i strive towards but rather i strive towards   just continuing to have my values and my things 
are important to me met which they are and   that's kind of where i'm at so i don't want 
to say a yes or a no but i want to say having   that specific company on my resume is completely 
unimportant to me and actually one thing i often   see well not often but i see some friends or some 
ex-colleagues or anything like that and i caution   to be aware of is too many people align 
their full identity with where they work   and oftentimes this is elevated when you work 
at a very popular company it's something that   you should definitely be proud of and 
you know let the world know of but it's   there comes a very fine line when it becomes a 
little too a little too much and i've definitely   had friends who just like they they align 
their entire identity with where they work   and i think it can be easy and turn to to get lost 
in that context then and not really know what are   your values your specific uh things that you find 
important different things like that but rather   focusing more so on what the company finds 
important only spending time with people in   the company and that can be a very slippery slope 
so i do feel back in the day maybe i need like a   cane or something back in the day when i was young 
uh no but back in the day fang companies were   the standard they had a ton of amazing perks 
that other tech companies did not offer at the   very beginning but do i feel like that is how it 
is today absolutely not and i really feel like   people should set their goals rather on working 
for an amazing company that meets their values   versus working for a company just because 
they heard it's really cool to do so   and there are so many amazing companies that are 
focusing on really interesting technologies that   are not part of fang i know there are amazing 
companies working on blockchain web 3 the cloud   different things like that and that's so exciting 
and they have so much to offer as well the summary   of the summary of this video i would say is really 
focus on aligning or finding a company that aligns   with what is important to you versus finding a 
company that is a fan company just to put it on   your resume just to say you have done so okay oh 
i'm glad i got that off my back this is a topic i   really wanted to talk about for a while because 
i can't even tell you how many dms i get a day   about do you want to work at a fang company 
and it really took me off guard at first so   that is my take on it i hope you let me know
