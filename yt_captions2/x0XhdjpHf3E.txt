ladies and gentlemen what is the greatest feeling that comes out of playing a game of chess is it chess.com telling you you got a brilliant move or a 98 accuracy maybe you beat one of your colleagues or co-workers in real life somebody you really despise and now you feel intellectually dominant well for magnus carlsen greatest chess player of the last 10 years and potentially of all time it might be difficult to find the same emotion but in today's video i will share with you a game that he played on chess.com that broke their game review broke stockfish and gave the highest estimated elo i have ever seen in my life he played such a game of creative brilliance and he did it with just three minutes on the clock so without further ado i would like to show you the magnus carlson online immortal game uh his opponent for this game uh it was chess panda123 that is not a panda that learned how to play chess uh although i i can imagine like it's going to become a whole thing like animals playing chess i've been thinking of recording footage with my dog playing chess chess panda123 is none other than yu yang yi who is the second highest rated player in all of china which is a really big accomplishment because their number one is the world champion so listen being number two that's like scottie pippen on on on uh michael jordan's bulls um magnus had the white pieces and magnus opened the game with e4 which in and of itself uh should get him the estimated elo um so how did magnus carlson play like a 4 000 rated player essentially well his opponent played the move e5 uh it is it is the toolbox uh of the chinese players to play the petrov defense in fact the petrov uh mirror image counter-attack in the center of the pawn uh is probably played most exclusively by the chinese players and fabiano caruana and more recently yanyupomnishi so those are kind of the big names yuyengi has been a massive proponent uh of uh of the petrov dingly wren certainly knows how to play it although he prefers to go for the spanishes uh and the idea is after knight takes e5 black kicks out the knight and then black takes back on e4 uh if you're feeling edgy you can play the stafford gambit yu yang yi was not feeling edgy he played the move pawn to d6 kicked out magnus's knight knight e4 and now there's no less than a million options in fact um even in this position there are multiple options white can play knight d3 knight c4 but he just uh magnus plays the main line and now uh here there are uh two two major branches and then many branches after that white can play what's called the classical variation doing this and then developing and castling queenside looking for some attack magnus plays this in a principled way puts his other pawn in the center and black here commits yet another pawn move which is pawn to d5 because he needs to control the center and he also needs to open up the bishop now the funny thing about this position is that uh the petra of defense essentially looks like it could be this like knight f3 knight f6 and now black gets an extra move and that extra move is playing knight to e4 that's essentially what it looks like um now that's not a great move like it was if it's black's move here black should develop one of the bishops in castle so it's very interesting that the extra tempo is spent moving the knight into the center because that knight is going to be a target like that night it theoretically does not really benefit uh black moving in a second time now again here there are many many options bishop to d6 and more recently black is putting the knight out putting pressure on the center and potentially jumping here to get the bishop but black now cannot play pawn to c6 magnus castles we have bishop e7 this position has been seen thousands and thousands of times and now we have c4 trying to undermine that pawn which would undermine that knight and normally black has a pawn there so since black moved his knight here and now cannot move that pawn there it would look like it's an inaccurate setup if not for the next move which is knight to b4 you are justifying putting your knight on c6 to play at night to before an attack magnus's bishop on d3 uh magnus moves the bishop out of the way this is still pressured and now if you try to do this you should have done that a long time ago because now the knight is going to get booted to the outskirts of the board so that's not the plan black castles and here white can choose between one branch of moves and a second the second branch of moves is much more popular it's to go knight c3 at which point uh black develops the bishop and then in many lines uh white can play like uh cd5 and then black will like take here and then and then get out with the knight and i i suppose you do not want to allow the move knight to c2 so uh maybe you you after bishop 5 you actually play a3 first and then the knight backs out and we get to this position uh you also don't even have to take you can play the move rook to e1 so that's what normally happens in this game magnus changes the move order he plays that first then he takes and now we have this position where black can play the move bishop f5 just like i just showed you but yuyengi plays knight a5 knight a5 prevents the move pawn to c4 which is a very logical move because white would want to take as much central space as possible magnus now plays rook to e1 which is always a good move lining up the rook and now we have bishop to f5 okay here's the problem with the move bishop to f5 in this particular move order and why probably you yankee should have played something like bishop to d6 rookie one re-enables the move c4 what how well it's a deep idea the point is that if you go c4 it's just take take but if there was a rook here the rook would take the bishop so the idea of moving the rook to e1 actually sets up the move c4 which is why it would have been good for black to play bishop d6 however just develops his bishop uh he spends like eight seconds please bishop fight but now this gives magnus this pawn to c4 move goes back to d8 but of course it's not so simple i mean white spawns are still very much under fire now magnus thinks for a little bit he could play a handful of options here uh he can offer a trade of light squared bishops which definitely looks like it improves his position uh he can maybe try to rotate the rook instead he plays bishop to d2 after some thought which in case you are not paying attention is a very very clear attack on the knight on a5 uh you can defend a piece two different ways well three different ways the third way is just creating a threat of equal or exceeding nature danger levels you can defend this by playing pawn to b6 but that would be a really bad move because even though you've defended the knight as you get better at chess you learn mini lessons such as three for three is not always three like in math it's very simple okay three three not here that's three points that's three points back but the damage that you've done to your structure is irreversible and you will lose all those pawns so uh uh let you know i'm gonna write that down as an idea for a youtube short later i'm gonna write three does not equal three there you go um c5 that's another way of defending and if bishop takes a5 there is not going to be a damage to the structure magnus plays d5 and now has a very solid formation in the center yuengi attacks the rook in the corner of the board and we have rook a2 so far magnus has not done anything from a generationally creative standpoint uh i mean they're just playing relatively natural moves but magnus has good pressure on that knight on on a5 which by the way really cannot return home that knight is sort of a goner he hasn't connected he has a connected and protected past pawn but yangi has some very menacing situation going on here and he plays rookie a he plays rookie 8 making it quite difficult for white to move um but here magnus begins uh his genius so i'm going to turn off the evaluation bar as i sometimes like to do when i don't want you to be distracted with what stockfish has to say about the game and i just want to show you the genius of the idea so magnus plays bishop f1 spends eight seconds on that move bishop f1 is inviting an exchange of rooks and you yankee captures now white can take three different ways taking with the knight according to the stockfish the stockfish according to stockfish is the worst it's the worst way uh taking with the bishop of the queen is fine um if queen takes c1 is played you have an attack on the knight however the queen no longer covers the b3 square so the knight would gallop in and be safe i don't think magnus like that if you take with the bishop you're not doing anything to the position also there is an incredible move knight c6 and you cannot take and the knight would once again get into white's position so seeing as though neither of those moves did anything substantial and therefore potentially could even cause the knight to escape magnus decided to take with a knight it'll turn back on the eval the computer doesn't like that move why does the computer not like the move knight takes e1 because as it turns out there is another idea lurking here and it's actually the move you yankee finds which is pawn to b5 pawn to b5 is a very nasty move because it now attacks the pawn on c4 threatening for the knight to escape again and if you take the pawn on d5 false and you don't want the pawn on d5 to fall because the rook is trapped or you're just going to lose all your pieces suddenly black's pieces all come alive so magnus's position is under severe existential threat so he thinks for 40 seconds and he comes up with an idea that even stockfish isn't able to appreciate unless you let it run for a little while magnus in this position plays the move queen f3 first glance the computer is utterly unimpressed you know why because the computer finds one idea here and it's a very simple idea queen f3 attacks the bishop and potentially wants to fight on that diagonal and it is the justification of the bad move knight takes e1 but this shows you magnus's genius he plays queen f3 but now the queen which hits the bishop no longer protects b1 and the rook is trapped magnus accidentally got his rook trapped on the edge of the board or has he well it turns out magnus had an idea what was going to be the follow-up of this move when the bishop waddled into the position and took the rook in the corner because this bishop covers the escape scores it was to play d6 and now the knight is hit the rook is hit and the black queen is overloaded okay well i can just play knight takes c4 right no because after i take take bishop a5 the queen has to stay guarding the rook and my rook is able to escape for a moment furthermore i have a pawn i can use my pawn to deflect the queen from the defense of the rook that my queen on f3 is hitting oh this is some nasty stuff pawn to d6 is a ridiculous defensive resource so you yankee plays rook b8 now the queen no longer has to guard the rook because the queen no longer hits the rook and the knight can leave well magnus finds bishop a5 and just in time escapes with his rook just in time manages to escape now this still looks like bogus his bishop is blocked and his knight is on the back rank and not to mention yu yang yi is going to have a passport of his own he plays d7 the id of d7 is rookie a check okay simple enough rook cafe now you cannot play the move rook to e8 because that doesn't even do anything you're not all right so what you're not queening there's nothing you can do so you yang yi plays pawn to c3 he is now two squares away from queening himself pawn to c3 magnus here who come and collected brings the queen forward i still don't see the threat what is the threat you can't queen and you also could not play rook takes an infiltrate on the back rank because i would just block so what's the idea of queen d5 yu yang yi plays bishop back to g6 he has now just two squares away from queening this is why it's very important to have no evaluation bar because it would spoil the fun in this position magnus plays queen to d6 and you yankee resigns he resigns because checkmate is unstoppable queen hits the rook if you take i queen if you try to escape i take and i mate you your own bishops suffocated the king the king's house was on fire he was trying to break out the bishops standing guard in front of the windows accidentally held them shut how did that happen and then i will do the big reveal of his elo being 38.50 well first of all the idea of taking back with the knight and queen f3 was not fully appreciated by stockfish ponte d6 was a genius counter-attack it only failed of course to stockfish who knows everything stockfish is like the kid in the class with the test bank in this position to get out of this what black has to do is sack the knight for free then attacked the queen make it move after bishop a2 bishop a5 black needs to counter-attack the queen bishop d8 rook a7 take take take c4 there was like a seven move sequence for you yankee to find to refute magnus's idea if he refuted magnus's idea maybe he would have been uh you know he would have been the 3850 in this game but magnus finds a sensational counter-attacking measure here and then after you yankee plays rook b8 he's just immediately worse and here he needed to stop the move pawn to d7 it's like in basketball or football stop the ball so queen d8 because rook d8 doesn't stop anything and the other reason that you yankee lost so quickly is because he he uh his rook got sandwiched so his rook got sandwiched near the king and magnus just went like this now what if yungi had played something like queen c7 you know you know what magna soda played he would have went queen a8 look how disgusting that move is and then he would have done this he would have just bulldozed the rook bullied the rook trying to get it to take to get him to promote instead rookie eight queen d5 queen d6 and my friends magnus carlsen's game review was something so heinous i i've never seen something like this this man magnus carlson uh played this game uh at a 38.50 estimated elope this man outperformed stockfish in this game according to chess.com's game review stockfish is 3 700. i've never seen that before now if you actually go back through his moves game review runs on a low depth so it doesn't even fully anticipate uh like the counters counter-attacking measures but it still gave him a couple of inaccuracies and even with two inaccurate moves relative to his opponent's elo magnus performed this game at 38.50 the backwards night move disallowing the black knight from escaping queen f3 inviting bishop to b1 pawn to d6 counter-attacking the knight which is supposed to be defended by the queen which cannot fully defend because it's also guarding the rook so a very natural move by yungi to move allowed this and the escape followed by the promotion the threat of the promotion rather followed by queen d5 and the suffocation of the black king and his accuracy was 97.5 yep guys tough to beat 3850 estimated elo according to chess.com's game review what more can i say now get out of here
