i don't know about you but over the last few months for me it started to feel like ai is impossible to ignore a warning from elon calling for a pause turning to a chat gp tower of artificial we've got to be cautious here one minute it was just theoretical ideas being mentioned on some podcasts and the next everyone was posting drawings of themselves being made by a computer and screen grabs of high school level essays generated by chat gpt and it's all gonna get way way better very fast so as filmmakers should we be freaking out is ai about to take over film production and fire us all should we be getting out of this industry as fast as possible and learning to code that's what i've been wondering anyways and in this video i'm going to talk about how i think ai is going to change the game where the biggest changes are coming to the industry and then at the end i'll get into whether or not i think there's any future for filmmakers in an ai world [music] all right so now we're in for the big surprise which was that whole intro was actually recorded by ai recorded no i'm i'm just kidding that was me maybe it means i'm out of touch but ai really did seem to come out of nowhere in the last few months i definitely knew what it was in theory and i've been playing video games against ai opponents since i was a little kid but when computers started beating people at chess and go and pretty much everything else it still seemed really unlikely to impact my day-to-day life in the last couple of years i've also listened to dozens of people on podcasts and youtube talk about how ai was coming and how it would impact everything but i still didn't really see how that applied to me as a filmmaker the next thing i knew i want to say it was in like early december all of social media started sharing avatars and artwork made by lens ai and coherent articles written by cha gbt i did a bit more research on my own and i suddenly understood that even as a freelance creative this stuff was absolutely going to impact me in a bunch of ways and just to save you some anxiety my takeaway isn't that we're all doomed but we really need to pay attention to how these tools are evolving so we don't get lost in the churn so what can ai do well and what will it likely do well in the very near future well if you can give ai some solid prompts and references it can already make some incredible stuff those lens ai portraits look great if you give it good examples to copy and if you learn how to give chat gpt the right instructions it can churn out a 1500 word article on any topic in no time that's pretty impressive and i can't imagine how teachers are going to stop this stuff from doing everyone's homework all the time things are about to change around i was actually hoping that chat gpt could take my video scripts and turn them into blog posts to save me the trouble of having to write copy for hours and hours a week but it's not really there yet the writing doesn't have much character and it does feel like a machine wrote it most of the time it doesn't really have a personality or a voice it's all just information i know you can also run that text through more ai like quill bot or grammarly or whatever and it does get a little better it can write a stellar breakdown of how a car engine works but for the moment it's not really ready to speak in my voice quite yet i do think it could easily get there in a very short period of time though like in just a few years or so and honestly that sounds pretty good to me since launching this youtube channel and getting into the world of online business i have to put out an unbelievable amount of text copy for everything from bio pages to descriptions to scripts and pitches if i could outsource the most mundane of those to a computer i'd personally be up for that the stuff that really matters though like where my personality and experience are what counts so like the scripts for these videos or thoughtful responses to comments or coming up with new projects that stuff is probably going to have to be done by me forever or at least during my lifetime anyways i think but i'll get into why i think so in a minute i could also see ai being used in a bunch of other ways as well something like tome which is an ai presentation generator could save me hours of screen time by generating pitch decks for me the information and ideas would all still have to be mine but i'd no longer need to be physically making the deck one slide at a time depending on the type of project i could also see it generating the reference imagery based on my inputs as well saving me even more time tools like color lab ai can also do some crazy things when it comes to color grading projects and if you haven't seen it you can basically tell it whatever movie or tv show you want your footage to look like then it can do a respectable job of it assuming it was well shot in the first place there's definitely a bunch more of ai programs that i don't need to get into but it definitely seems to me like a lot of work is going to drop out of the filmmaking world in the next few years based on where these tools are heading this is going to be specifically true in the low budget world and for people who are just getting started where they need their stuff to be good but not necessarily world class an indie dock where one person is writing shooting and editing the theme themselves those people probably aren't going to hire a professional colorist to go over their footage when they can get 70 of the way there with just a few clicks why would you spend money you don't have on a graphic designer for a release poster or higher sound mixer to balance your levels when computers can do it for 10 bucks a month the reality is that you probably wouldn't and i mean i probably wouldn't either this means that at least in my opinion there's going to be a substantial drop in work on the low end the people who are servicing very small operations or maybe working on platforms like 5 for our upwork anywhere people value cost efficiency over uniqueness and mastery or where the content just needs to be good enough i think ai has the potential to take over where it won't take over at least not for a long time anyways is when creativity and uniqueness are valued over cheapness an hbo director will probably want to work with a human colorist over a machine because they'll value the relationship and creative input of a person i also don't see it taking over the actual idea generation and key creative roles either and that's not because i don't think ai will be able to come up with a list of interesting ideas but there's a few main reasons why i think that human filmmakers are safe for a while still the first reason is physical ai can't actually go out into the world and act on any of these ideas at least not until robot technology evolves a long way what am i ai can also easily develop human relationships like a documentary filmmaker would need with their characters if you want to tell a heartfelt story about a difficult time in someone's life you probably need to be able to sit down and have a coffee with them not communicate through a screen and i'll be basically things like holding the camera and changing memory cards and all that stuff too but honestly with some of the boston dynamics robots i see on youtube that might not be true forever the bigger reason why i don't think filmmaking is going to be taken over ai which also applies to the arts in general is the fact that humans just won't value it when i was in school i remember i took a communications class and the professor was explaining the power of branding through a study about knockoff purses the experiment was basically to give a bunch of people counterfeit purses and tell them they were real and then they asked them a bunch of questions about how they felt about it it was a luxury brand and most people were super happy to have it they thought they had an expensive bag and they were pumped then the researchers started telling some of the people that it was actually fake and asked them if they still felt the same way almost all of the people said they no longer valued the bag in the same way and that overall they just liked it way less the emotional connection was totally lost whether or not it makes any sense for someone to like something more when they think it's expensive whether or not they can tell a difference in quality isn't the point the point is that it's the emotional connection the story of the thing that gives art value saving up your money for an expensive purse handmade in italy by craftspeople is a great story whereas getting a great deal on an industrial item from a sweatshop in bangladesh is not my prediction is that the same thing is going to be true in filmmaking and the arts more broadly just because in 30 years ai might be able to theoretically come up with a story generate the visuals edit the whole thing into a really entertaining package the emotional connection won't be there once you find out the movie is made by an ai you're not going to care as much and it won't be special maybe for things like infomercials or instructional videos it's not going to matter as much but i think for people to really invest in a story they're going to want to know it was made by a human now i could be wrong about this but i think as soon as people find out an ai made the film they were watching they'd see it as kinda cheap where it's going to get really interesting is if you didn't know it was made by an ai and thought it was a human director which i'm sure will happen at some point but that's honestly beyond the scope for today's video so for now my conclusion is that ai is absolute absolutely going to change things up and in the next five years we're going to feel those impacts in the industry but at least for the foreseeable future i think people will still want to be told stories by other people and so if you're the filmmaker you're probably not going to be out of a job for a while that's just me though and i'm really curious what you guys think do you see ai taking over everything are you using ai and your filmmaking workflows right now let me know in the comments that's all for today though i'm sure we'll be talking about this stuff again before too long because we're living through wild wild times right now hope you like that video and maybe it got you thinking about ai in a different way if you did like it think about subscribing or liking or all that good stuff or maybe check out this other video i made about how you can leverage the power of networking to supercharge your filmmaking business this year see ya thank you [music]
