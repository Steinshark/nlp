oh heck yeah i've got some brand new gpus in the oven let's see what mr jensen has in store for us wait it's just yep yeah nvidia finally announced the rtx 4090 4080 and also the rtx 4080 but slower to be clear the rtx 4090 looks freaking incredible and gamers have a lot to be excited about here but nvidia has also left out a lot of key details that have me very concerned about just how much of a performance increase you're gonna get if you're not willing to sell a kidney i'm always willing to sell stuff though and that's why we're talking about today's sponsor zoho crm zoho crm is a 360 degree solution that offers an intuitive ui ai predictions and a design studio to help you get your sales done faster get fifty percent off with code zcrm 50 using the link down below [music] out of the gate the rtx 4090 looks like a monster and not in the way we thought it would either although the details in jensen's announcement were light he did mention a doubling of rasterization performance and a quadrupling of ray tracing performance and the specs back them up but the rtx 4090 having 16 384 cuda cores and a boost clock of 2.52 gigahertz even without architectural improvements this thing buries the 30 90. going into the event there are rumors that the 4090 would draw up to 600 watts of power but impressively nvidia has been able to have this huge bump in cuda cores and clock speeds while maintaining the same 450 watt tdp of the rtx 3090 which to be clear still a lot of power but it's not an asinine amount of power given how much of a performance uplift the rtx 4090 offers i'm impressed they were able to keep the price to 1600 and yeah that's a stupid amount of money for a gpu but the hundred dollar increase over the rtx 3090 is less than half inflation in the same amount of time and before this announcement i was very concerned it would cost closer to two grand that said apparently you can get a 3090 ti for a bit over a thousand dollars so the actual value proposition on the rtx 4090 is a bit more difficult with a release date of october 12th hopefully we'll be able to properly test one out soon and figure out if it's really worth it now we get into the more questionable side of the announcement the 4080s there are two different rtx 4080s a 12 gigabyte model and a 16 gigabyte model what is strange though is that these are completely different cards with completely different specs now nvidia did not give us any non-ray trace performance data nor did they share with us the crucial memory bandwidth spec but what we do know isn't promising with thousand six hundred and eighty cuda cores the 12 gigabyte rtx 4080 has a thousand less cuda cores than the rtx 3080 ow while the 16 gigabyte model falls behind the rtx 3080 ti score counts the saving grace here is the clock speeds at 2.6 and 2.5 gigahertz respectively on paper these gpus are still ferocious and that isn't even taking into account the raw architectural advantages that they get thanks to tsmc's foreign node compared to samsung's eight nanometer you just get the faster 16 gigabyte 4080 then right not so fast in nvidia's own performance data it shows the 12 gigabyte and 16 gigabyte versions are nearly tied in flight sim while in warhammer and cyberpunk the 16 gigabytes pulls and amount ahead given the 300 price difference there is a good chance the 12 gigabyte model will be just the better buy over the 16 gigabyte because you're already in it for 1200 you might as well just save up a little bit more for the much stronger rtx 4090 i am deeply suspicious that the 12 gigabyte 4080 was supposed to be the rtx 4070 but then the gpu market crashed ethereum proof of stake and they're sitting on months worth of stock of the rtx 3000 series so they cannot justify a 900 40 70. easy fix though just call it a 4080 instead all this though is me speculating about the rasterization performance of these gpus aka how it performs and non-ray traced games if you care a lot about ray tracing though rtx 4000 series looks damn good nvidia claims a two to four times increase in performance with ray tracing on and they achieve this through a couple different methods first throw more hardware at it like so much that people might start actually turning ray tracing on next you make it run better with shader execution reordering nvidia didn't get into as much detail about this as i was hoping so i'm just gonna make an educated guess and if i'm wrong correct me down below ray tracing is naturally a single threaded task because you can't calculate like the third bounce of light until you've already calculated the first two this can lead to the shader engine which figures out how light and dark various pixels should be just kind of wait around while the ray of tracing is being calculated but using the magic of shader execution reordering apparently nvidia can make the process more parallel leading to a two times more efficient ray tracing and fps boost of about 25 the third way nvidia improved ray tracing performance is by giving us dlss 3. in the past dlss would use ai to turn a lower resolution source into a higher resolution output with dlss3 nvidia is able to create a new fully ai generated frame without the intervention of the cpu by just using the motion information that was already there in dlss 2. i'm not totally sure how i feel about this in cinematic games like cyberpunk or flight sim i'm sure it works great but i'm not totally sure i want to turn it on in a competitive shooter since it kind of sounds like motion smoothing through the magic of ai instead of actually adding more fps but i know what a lot of you are thinking right now ray tracing doesn't matter because the games you love don't support it and the performance hit is just way too much and honestly i agree with you the best ray tracing experience i've had is in minecraft and i didn't even use the rt cores for that which is why i'm super stoked for another thing jensen announced today rtx remix in the past adding ray tracing to a game that was developed on say directx 8 or directx 9 was basically impossible for modders unless they had access to the tools used to develop the game and a metric butt load of time now using rtx remix modders won't need access to specialized tools and will only spend an imperial butt cheek of time to remaster your favorite old games rgx remix works by capturing the textures geometry lighting and cameras by intercepting the draw calls interpreting them as distinct assets and then reassembling them all back into a scene nvidia went ahead and remastered portal into portal rtx using this tech and it'll be available as free dlc in november honestly this is probably my favorite thing it has today also if someone could give valheim the rtx remix treatment you'll be my hero what creators will be excited about though is ab1 support and nvidia didn't even mention it in the presentation but it's there r.i.p arc you never even lived one thing i want to circle back on though the pricing i've seen a lot of people in the comments respond to the pricing accusing nvidia of being super greedy and honestly i don't think that's the case we know that tsmc's prices have risen by at least 20 maybe even 30 percent nvidia's 40 80 and 40 90 dies are massive i think they plan on releasing these at potentially even higher prices but had to rethink it after the whole gpu crash do you really think if this was a super profitable release evga would have jumped ship what these prices definitely do though is leave the door wide open for amd's already in a3 because nvidia probably just can't make them any lower i highly doubt team red will be able to take on the 4090 but the rumors suggest amd could be very competitive against the 4080s in performance and destroy nvidia and efficiency we'll have to wait until november 3rd to find out though but what you can do now is find out who sponsored this video freshbooks freshbooks is an easy to
