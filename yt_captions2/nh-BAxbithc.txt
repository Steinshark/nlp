kinesis keyboard for sending me such a beautiful thing but right off the rip they did oh i just took the box right off of it they did send me this right here just on top just on just on top of the box they sent me a key they sent me a mouse and the guy literally in the email said hey by the way i know you don't use a mouse but here's a mouse look at that it's a mouse look at the mouse ah wait that's the box we don't care about that oh yeah oh yeah that's pretty good i give this i'd give this a look it's highly lickable vertical mouse boys this mouse look at this little mouse it's a little little mouse and you know it feels good um please wash before using yeah this is nice this is nice is this i can i get down on this bad boy three fingers vertical all the good stuff even got like a little little thing right here and look at this look what the mouse has little look are you ready for what the mouse has a little a little where is it where the hell is that a little usb just in case you need to be on the go okay that's pretty nice i'm not gonna lie to you that's pretty nice okay uh again i don't use the mouse so i'm not really sure what the hell this thing is but imagine if i call that usb called it universal suck my butt all right let's get to the box that's in this box okay okay this box this box about to have a bait this box this box just had a baby okay this box just had a baby oh this ain't just any this just this ain't any just any 360 advantage okay this is something a little different okay are you ready i haven't seen it yet but i did i did send some specifications here okay hey they didn't put my colors on it would you send to me hey my colors aren't there they didn't send me my colors it was supposed to be all white i wanted 100 white keyboard

there i don't even want to see it but still i'm just saying if i don't got i i asked for some sweet switches okay so let's find out do i got that you had one job i just wanted a thing all right here

up i'm a great millennial okay okay first off oh it has it's like light blue interesting we got ourselves like a light and blue okay interesting interesting interesting but now here's the real question i wonder where my keyboard my little my little edge because i i have like a little tool to eject these i wonder if it came with one i have a tool right now what does it smell like you know what it smells like oh all right let's uh let's make it happen let's see what's underneath this bad boy hey hold on it didn't come out i'm not very good i'm not gonna lie to you if it's just if it's just browns in there i'm gonna be a little bit oh it's not brown's boys it's not browns it ain't browns yeah oh yeah oh why yes it ain't red it's not red it ain't red it's the pinks boys we got the pinks okay we went with the pinks uh it was either the box pinks or the navies or the jades but as far as i could tell did they send me the silent ones i'm one of those loudest ass ones i wanted the loud ass ones did i get silent ones did i get silent ones i wanted ones to i actually wanted to peel the paint off my wall i wanted it so loud i wanted it so loud pre-watched it's not pre-watched i wanted it so loud that it ripped it ripped it clean off the walls silence is better no it's not all right feels solid feels good now hold on plugging it in we're plug we're plugging in the new keyboard right now stream numbers plummeting i know people are just like this ain't this ain't it this is not even it at all switched uh dude i i are pinks heavy uh they mostly feel like a horse's mouth all right i oh all right let's i'm gonna turn up the volume i'm going to turn off the ac i'm going to turn up the volume and we're gonna listen to it okay it's off now i'm gonna drop this gate boys we're gonna drop some serious gate okay we're gonna drop some gate hey so guess what kinesis keyboards they're going to be back in stock they're gonna be fully back in stock you can get your percent off using my code prime 360. that's right prime 360 50 off right there bitly prime 360. let's back they're back in stock starting tomorrow i believe so tomorrow this is uh it's kind of an ad maybe i'm not sure is this an ad probably lick it kick it lick it yeah yeah that was good that was real good this is awesome i'm gonna use this keyboard for the next while we're gonna test it out see how it feels it feels really good feels very i like i like this like in some sense i really like the sounds i wish i had a bit more clack i wanted more clack this one is it's all it's all thunk no clack i wanted a bit more clack you know what i mean as far as heaviness goes it feels really light um it definitely feels different uh it looks different obviously it looks different i really liked the look of this one i think this one was my favorite looking keyboard that i've had yet but i think i'd like to try it in all white i think that'd be fun um and so yeah can you show it again yeah look at that so there we go we got some we got some box pinks in there anyways i just want to stream the new keyboard i just got in the mail yesterday super excited about it i'm gonna use it all this week uh i just got in the mail yesterday work called it and uh the 360. you know 360 is back in stock because i get like a thousand messages being like it's never in stock it's never in stock it's never in stock so it's back in stock they told me this thursday starting tomorrow they'll be back in stock no problem uh prime 360 if you want it they don't actually pay me any sort of monthly thing to do to do this uh i've been i was using i've been using i've been using a kinesis keyboard since my my uh second son was born so it's been a while when i was 28 my my son was born i've almost been using a kinesis keyboard for 10 years and then they started sending me free keyboards three years ago maybe four years ago so please we can show it one more time basically bribery very very good look at that look at those nice little usbcs right there they use usbcs which is really the way to go uh they have a pro version that's uh zmk and bluetooth i've never been a bluetooth zmk kind of guy you know what i mean you know what i mean i i've never been that kind of person it's just not for me i don't know why but i never like it because every zmk keyboard i've ever used kind of like disconnects every now and then you know and i it just is a little bit flaky of like i've never had i've never had a good well even uh bluetooth is flaky it's it's flaky on pretty much every zmk thing i've ever seen i've just never had a great zmk experience so i just i've never loved it wireless is always finicky i just never i just never love it so i just i i just like the reliability of wired you know what i mean for a mouse it seems less it seems okay to be more fault tolerant right like if you're moving it and it just doesn't quite move as well but it's still you just keep on going but when it comes to typing you just get effed up and so i just i just i like wireless mouse yeah wireless keyboard nah uh why would i want to charge my keyboard and this too dude this is just the worst thing i end up having to have chords no matter what if you have a wireless keyboard you have to charge your keyboard anyways so you still have to have the wires you just have to hide the wires every day it's like why would i want to play the game of hide my wires you know what i mean where's a with a mouse if it has um what's it called if it just those little those little the little chargers last forever because i never touch my mouse anyways so there you go that's the new keyboard i appreciate it and it looks like most people would i'm glad to see that most people would it's very thock very thoughty talk talk absolutely love it i'll do oh the box is right there the box is in the way look at look at that look at that boys look at that look at that it has keys on it this time i actually have keys on it i mean i type in dvorak so it doesn't really matter like does it really matter it doesn't really matter right it doesn't matter so we'll see anyways hey thank you for watching
