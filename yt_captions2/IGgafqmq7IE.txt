oh it's not a fire hazard no this is a firehouse actually this is really bad too it's a solid 6 out of 10 firehouse in this box is a power supply that can supposedly provide 3450 watts of power how did they do that you ask evidently by bolting two power supplies together how on earth are we gonna test a 3450 watt power supply oh don't worry we've got some ideas and it involves putting not one not two nothing not four not five but six rtx 3080 is on the line so i really really hope this thing doesn't blow up like this segue to our sponsor kiwiko kiwiko sends out crates that contain hands-on projects for kids and teens to help develop creative confidence and problem-solving skills there's something for all ages and all interests so learn more at the end of this video or at the link down below [music] first of all strictly speaking this is not two power supplies bolted together because it only has one input which is actually kind of terrifying there's a lot terrifying about this how could you possibly expect to get 3450 watts out of one c13 power connector yeah that's a good question how much do i pay for this thing 300 canadian do you want to know something that's kind of fun i mean other than the like sort of bitcoin logo ripoff yeah do you want to know the number one thing that was bought with this at the same time it's got to be a mining rack no yes again pillow oh uh fire extinguisher this hat okay i guess i have to wear it for the rest of the video then right obviously wow it's definitely got ample cooling on this bad boy you've got dual 80 millimeter fans in the front dual 140 millimeter fans on the top and actually what looks like a pretty decent amount of heat sink in here it's almost like the platform was designed for a considerable amount of power but then they just didn't put a lot of it in here yeah do you want to open it up it is two power supplies i thought the pcb went all the way acro what the [ __ ] i always get concerned when companies make up their own certifications 90 plus platinum not a thing and if it was it would probably be platinum colored not gold which makes me wonder how much of anything else on here is actually real it supports'0 to 200 volt ac input which makes sense there's no way you'd be i mean you'd blow the circuit before you managed to pull 3000 watts out of a 120 volt circuit is it time to open it yeah all right let's do it where's my ltt store screwdriver if you're not already make sure you sign up for the wait list because one day this fine man will deliver a finished screwdriver oh are you opening up a real power supply yeah so this is a 1600i you would kind of want two of these to get over 3000 watts yeah kyle's our lead creator warehouse engineer and he apparently spent the last few weekends learning about power supplies after being put on the spot last time we opened up a sketchy power supply so hopefully he's able to provide us a little bit more insight this time around we'll see how good his studying skills are so kyle you've already opened this right uh yes uh be careful yeah yeah yeah this is the part of the video where we say don't do this we do not recommend opening up any kind of ac to dc power supply there are capacitors in here that will store enough power to throw you back across the room maybe not quite that much crt tvs yes these maybe not quite so much but you could die what it looks like to me is we have a single power input that has been simply pigtailed out to two discrete power supplies but what i think has happened here is the second power supply only contains the bare minimum required to produce 12 volt whereas the primary one has all of the other rails that would be required to run a pc so your 3.3 volt your 5 volt and that's what all of this componentry that's missing in here is doing over here what i have no means to evaluate is whether this is a quality 12-volt power supply now or a pretty junk one i would hazard a guess that at 150 each they're not really anything special kyle tell me more i would like you to draw your attention to the power switch that's on there and tell me how you think that works good god okay what does the green on a 24 pin mean well the green on a 24 pin is your power on wait it just goes straight to the power switch that's not normal yeah what do you think's on the other side of the switch if you were to take a guess what would be on the other side of the switch well a switch is normally in a closed position to allow current to flow and in an open position does not allow current to flow what would you expect to go to one side of the switch a ground and then on the other side you'd go the la for the other lively to the board right wait holy sh this switch doesn't actually turn off the power supply this switch turns on the power that is not how you are supposed to do that just to validate that let's have a look at our ax1600 this should kind of be all you need to know though because this is what a quality 1600 watt power supply looks like next to a random banggood.com 3400 watt power supply look at the size of this primary side cap holy bananas we've got our live we've got our neutral we've got what seems to be a fuse okay so that's basically what you call an x-class capacitor it goes across live and neutral live and common and then right next to it are two wide class capacitors that go from your line to chassis or earth ground it's for emi and without going too turbo node into it emi is bad and those help in some way they transform a very ugly voltage into a nice cleanish sine wave depending on how many you have and how good quality they are oh we're missing uh we're missing one of these boys who was supposed to be on the board here well and you just missed the other thing that's missing oh wait what is that what's supposed to be here wait is this just bridged what's supposed to be there something called a common mode choke wait they just they just soldered wires across it yes and that's not a common mode choke i can guarantee that from there we go into a standard uh full bridge rectifier shout out to our electro boom then we go into just a regular smoothing capacitor and then this is pretty interesting it's an ntc but it doesn't do anything with temperature it's actually a inrush current limiter so it's when you plug this in you don't trip your breaker by charging these caps this along with a power mosfet a diode and some control circuitry that exists is your active power factor correction okay so it has it whether it works remains to be seen we can't do anything right now until we take this board and re-solder this resistor over here wait what why because it's not connected oh my god it's not soldered yeah well how many other things are not soldered i i do not know that's the only one i saw oh my word the um yeah okay so where will be careful so the ground wire of the low side here is connected to this board as well and there's a very sketchy heat pad on the bottom that i took off to see what it was and now it won't go back on can you poke can you poke it a little for me well it did not well you won't be able to find it because it's got solder in it you have it it doesn't have solder in it though it does it's just it doesn't have the lead in it oh okay oh my god i don't think either of them are through the board no i thought the other one was nope through the board doesn't matter as long as it's making connection to the angular ring that's good enough yeah okay now well there's there's loose and there's like loose with three elbows they're both loose loose okay look neither of them are attached at all i didn't break anything i broke nothing it was broken don't i think we should teamwork this it's really easy to find which holes we're targeting because they are this one and this one where there are no legs coming through compared to this one and this one which are the other sides and you can clearly see the legs coming through the bottom okay uh this one this one this one should we do this one for these two yeah we can do the top one first one sec are you pushing it in the hole how's your aim i know it i'm okay minnie number one oh freak i don't know if i trust my hand so close to linus and the soldering iron i'm fine oh oh oh oh oh i see it yes yes yes okay it's crowning okay yes oh no the resist is the wrong way around shut up it is not in order to know how much the power supply is drawing normally you'd use something like this unfortunately those only work for 110 volts so i bought this thing right here wait you just put the cable through here and then you get a readout sort of yeah but wait how do you get this around the cable well that's the sketchy thing that we have to do oh my god you're just gonna cut it yeah now viewers i'm sorry that this is what we're doing but there is a good reason we're buying cheap crap like this because we bought a very expensive tester that's going to be arriving soon but not super soon because shortages so we don't want to blow a bunch of money on something that we're just going to replace like immediately yeah when's that arriving in the middle of the seventh month of the year somebody sent me the date and it was like 07 and i didn't convert it to names two months just engineering two months i don't know if we should even show people this but this is what we did for the record don't do this yeah really though a lot of the time we say don't do this this is like for realsies do not do this this is 240 volt then well we spliced in these leads but which ones do they go in uh these two these two boys here okay no what are you doing what okay i'm going to plug this guy in just to find out you don't have the power cable that lightness is working on plugged in right no and if you did have it plugged in i would be totally safe see that everything insulated we grabbed an older x299 platform for this and asus figured this was a cool way to do m.2s back then yeah i'm not saying that someone accidentally knocked it over and had to put it back in with pliers today but uh don't don't hit it again please what's broken the border the drive nothing i put it back in with pliers okay here's your gpu power connectors oh no okay this is scary should we just test it like this you know nothing plugged in just to make sure oh yeah we should all this thing work let's take a sketchy power supply turn it on with no load 209 volts so we're like right smack on the 208 volts we're supposed to have in here you might say don't touch it you might say this puppy has a lot of energy good luck everybody i think the system's gonna oh interesting it didn't fire up what what okay maybe we just leave it in the on position yeah it's in the on position well let's go ahead and bridge it wait wait what the [ __ ] i pressed the power button oh those 80 mils those are goers i wonder how much they're fighting with these 140s for moving airflow around in here it works of course it does oh yeah well what do you mean of course it does we had to solder a resistor back into it now how much power can it provide 7.2 watts yes does seem to be working all right let's power this boy up you ready i can't i don't know where the switch is here we go man that's annoying and loud i am surprised that at idle it is doing like 200 watts it's a lot why yes kyle we do still have the camino system i'm assuming you agree that we should try to power it with this instead of the three 1000 watt power supplies that are in it i had logistics take it out of here and hide it i don't know where it is i told you i wanted to try it i know so i had logistics take it and hide it i don't know where it is you dick for sampling i'm thinking render samples 10 000 okay let's hit it hey that's more like it 400 watts okay yeah maybe just don't hold that you have one piece of electrical tape between you and 208 volts something rattling in there let's add some more gpus yeah only 3 000 more to go let's get this power supply completely unplugged notice how the system is power oh wait is it not powered down what is it doing is it windows updating where's the graphics cards physically going i don't know over the table oh my you're just putting them everywhere well they have to be within the reach of this which is not that far because they cheaped out on the copper okay so our primary goes here then sure yeah that's a good spot oh uh do you have some zip ties alex wants to file down the backs of these slots here so that we can fit a 16x card in a 1x slot got a handful of these basically you just power up this little board there's your 16x slot this usb cable just plugs into a little pcie 1x i don't think these things will do more than gen 2 speeds but that doesn't matter for what we're doing why doesn't one of us do data and the other one do power here i'll stand there and look uh you can stand there and look imposing i'm so sorry everyone that sent these to us like i'm sure msi thought that this would be in like you know the ultimate gaming pc instead of this this is all of our 30 80s in the office if the power supply blew these up we would have no more 3080s left what's the worst that can happen this power supply has a freaking lot of 8-pin pcie connectors on it so credit for that i know i say i've said this a lot lately but i think this is the worst thing we've ever done that's the pattern it's this alex character well it's you know you have to have variety a lot of people in the what was it called desk made of radiators they were like i miss how janky you're visiting michael you don't have to one-up your last feature every single time it's time yep shall we bit lunch and how much the power is going to be closest without going over oh [laughter] uh unplugged unplugged what's up uh we did not do eight pin power for this one on a scale of one to ten how much of a fire hazard oh it's not a fire hazard oh this is the firehouse yeah that yeah yeah this is bad actually this is really bad too oh okay i'd say it's a solid six out of ten fire hazards okay we're done there we go now all the fans are spinning this is a thing motherboards flipping out about having too many pcie devices and not being able to boot up oh where's the camino no what about we unplug the two that are in the one slots and see what happens sure and then we'll go get the camino i don't know where the camino is yes you do [music] mutiny what i asked for the render server to be brought out here and instead i get this yeah it's every 30 80 we have plus one i mean plus one well we have seven now oh i found another one hit it oh okay 550 watts at idle it occurs to me we need to redo our guesses we've got an additional card oh yeah oh here we go we're going into windows 918. 900 watts just to fire up the desktop what i mean this is clearly a high octane desktop here holy crap wait this is a threadripper pro board yes okay hold on a second now i was willing to risk a bunch of rtx 3080s but do you have any idea how hard it is to get your hands on thread rippers these days yes also what is this boardworth this has got to be like a thousand dollar motherboard a 1400 1400 i think the motherboard is the least of your problems gpu zero one two three four five and six they're all in here holy crap this is an aux power connector there's two more aux power connectors and then there's dual eight pins for the cpu this thing is ridiculous we have a total of 23 a-pin pcies running to stuff uh what could go wrong kyle in theory it's isolated so nothing should go wrong if the power supply dies but if you if the isolation's garbage high voltage goes through and then yeah do the 400 volt caps just dump into this or potentially to be clear this can happen what he's talking about is not purely hypothetical this is the point where it maybe goes pop pop the fad is starting to spread oh whoa there we go whoa we got anywhere from 230 to 300 watts per gpu i was way under i think what did i say damn i need oh 24 19. no 24 22 24 40. i think i went too high yes yes my boys i said 2501 i wanted us to i wanted us to break okay wait can we appreciate how much heat is coming off this thing can we appreciate that it's still running 25 20 yes i win thank you kyle damn it so does it work i mean we haven't made it to 34.50 necessarily but we sure as heck got to 2500 we also don't know exactly what the efficiency of this is so 2500 from the wall sure according to this thing but it's clear that we need some more sophisticated equipment in order to really put this thing through its paces now tell me can our power supply tester do this kind of load yes really so we got the good one i got 3 500. so like 50 watts more than what this can do is out limit okay we're throwing in the threadripper pro we also might just need more ram how much do you have in 64 32 we're not saying this thing is good or safe no we're just saying that didn't blow up we will tell you in two months yeah yeah maybe three and what we'll tell you now is about our sponsor kiwi co kiwico is a monthly subscription service to help introduce and make stem topics
