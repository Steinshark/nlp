your organization probably doesn't want to improve things last week i had a fascinating conversation with a reader around frustration and unhappiness at work much of it was totally obvious to both of us but it occurred to me that this probably isn't to everyone which is why almost all of my colleagues in a very cushy non-stressful jobs nonetheless need therapy i have a completely orthogonal thought why this happens but we'll let them cook okay let's let bro cook let's let tim cook can we let tim cook if it isn't obvious to everyone it's worth writing about i think it would have been after a line like this i think it should have i think it should have ended with and if this isn't obvious you are probably in therapy now i believe that this stems from a failure to recognize the gap frequently vast between what is being said by a person and what is being felt and how this discrepancy applies to the organization too it was sparked by reference to a concept called home tat tatame tatame divide the hone tatame divide h div i don't know what that means uh which are japanese concepts related to the true feelings of an individual and the front they present in public i don't actually know anything about japanese context beyond uh this one wikipedia article that is so good so this has been dropped entirely so that i so that it seemed on let me do this again so this has been dropped entirely so that i seemed worldly and to give us vocabulary less honorous than what you really think and what you are forced to say okay tatame tatame uh i have never met a single manager at any large company that has not said they want to be data driven i have also never seen a single one of them take any steps that could actually move them in this direction my boss does this all the time we're very data driven uh nonetheless the average annual salary for a power buy developer a power buy develop what what is a since it's capital p capital bi what is this uh developer places them in the 90th percentile of my country's annual income for those of you unfamiliar with power by you connect it to data sources and then it makes visualization for managers to gaw at and it is so simple to use that it is not uh inconceivable to me that you could actually train a monkey to make a bar chart with the correct application of positive reinforcement and peanuts okay there are a handful of people who do amazing things with power bu but the hard truth is that most people who work in it are really just dragging and dropping bar charts onto a page after connecting it to a spreadsheet being paid absolutely exorbitantly and then if they if they are smart going home and despairing this is because power by tracks usage metrics and almost all dashboards are completely unused oh i i don't even know what this stuff is my current organization has 8,000 staff members and i used to glance over the usage metrics of the dashboards my old team produced i believe three dashboards were used out of somewhere around 50 to 100 wow that's a lot of non-usage of those power by is the bottom a power bottom which can switch to top i read that out loud i just read that out loud thanks ryan winchester for the you you know what you made me read that i read your name out loud so figure out that one twitch youtube youtube video of those being visited it usually turned out they were being visited by members of our team checking to see if the data had refreshed for the day i' as estimate the cost of maintaining our team was approximately $1 million for with an extra comma at the end for an organization that supposedly can afford to waste money why management had no choice but to say they want to be data driven it's not like they can just come out and say that it's all [ __ ] so they say the only thing is uh that is available we are going through a digital transformation and that is why we all all these efforts don't generate any revenue and drive staff to misery oh no and it will be better once this current initiative successfully completes even though we have never demonstrated the ability to successfully complete a similar initiative at any point in the past two h h i'm feeling a little h if you know these two pressures that drive the garbled stream of corporate uh corporate of nonsense at organizations okay i think i read that wrong but we're going to keep on going sounds familiar let's see sturgeon's law uh the first one is very simple and i sometimes lose sight of it while i am deep in the theory minds of incentives and other smarter uh takes 90% of everything is c crud and that explains almost everything most managers have never had an independent thought on how to manage people effectively hence the agile parting most programmers don't know what an ab let's see what an abstraction is etc etc these are overwhelming factors even though it is not it isn't a satisfying answer but it has done more for my own peace of mind than anything that follows i don't know how i feel about this you know when i read these kind of things you know i i i don't like the take and this is a very common take that is just this look that everybody else is stupid and i have just reached some plane of enlightenment now he may not be realizing he's saying this but that's how i read this is that like i have realized i have realized the problems but n out of 10 people too stupid to realize what i realize maybe i have too much faith but uh but i just don't believe in that i don't like that i've never liked that style of thinking i never think it's good i don't think it's healthy i don't think it's something that you want to do right i think most people if anything have just never had the chance to do something more than they are just told right and so they act that way right it's a form of more like learned a learned helplessness than anything else it's just like well i just do what they tell me to do that's what what i do right they don't have any control anyways i don't like yeah i don't like the look down on other people i don't know i used to be pretty good on the fencing circuit as in olympic fencing with the swords oh wow olympic fencer it never occurred to me even for a goddamn second that we could win competitions without having good smart people that understand the sport and trained hard if we lose because derek it didn't turn up for practice for 6 months i might be pissed off and upset but i am not spiritually confused about why my efforts aren't uh rewarding me okay i have no i mean i i actually really like this analogy uh i have no idea what possesses us to turn up at work and think we can accomplish anything with [ __ ] derek over there calling the shots while slamming their empty head onto a keyboard as rapidly as jro will allow him to create cards we won't finish but for some reason it's a thing that happens so somewhat fair let's kill derek let's just murder derek um i'm not sure if i feel uh feel good about that but okay uh derek will repeat whatever brain dead thing is in vogue but they are very stupid and will repeat literally anything that sounds popular plus will never question uh that they have never heard an unambiguous success over their entire career this means they will inevitably become promoted over time because unlike the rest of us who have put in effort and pay what a friend of mine terms soul cost to act like a sick aent they believe it sincerely again i just don't really like this take again you know i i feel like it's pretty smug you know i feel like if anything you could literally invert this argument onto the writer of said thing you just look at everyone as brain dead smashing their head against the keyboard and creating uh jira tickets they're just that person that thinks everybody is too stupid to understand and they just create and that all we do is create jer tickets they're the person that right like you could literally invert this you could invert this argument i mean i i like what he's trying to say right like i do like this idea but i i i'm failing to see it through so much just belief that everybody's a just a just a turd here's the pressure if you're in the 10% of people that aren't crud at their jobs you're surrounded by people that are crud don't get me wrong i am that terrible person at many things there are fencing teams where i'd be absolutely dead weight my piano playing leaves much to be desired last week i managed to stub the little toe on both feet on the same day on two separate occasions and i have on at least one occasion absent mindly dropped a teaspoon into the trash instead of the teabag these are just totally normal human problems right uh however i don't do again i also hate this statement uh anyways sorry i'm actually i i am actually having a really hard time with this article i really dislike just full degradation of people anyways however i don't uh do any of that professionally in professional settings approximately all of my time goes into solving problems introduced by people that are just incre uh indescribably bad i personally find that it only takes one bad person it's never i don't believe in this 90% rule right i think that this is what happens i'm going to give you a different take on this okay i'm going to give you a much different take you have one person who does believe what they're doing is the right way to do things and i do not think that they're wrong they think they have the best way to do something again the continuous drive towards dx this continuous drive towards what feels best for developers this continuous drive for this madeup idea that somehow if you just do things right it will be best if you do it my way my dx is better than your dx right and they get into this position where they actually are able to argue about something because they invented something that really works say falor at netflix okay this is a great example and so now you have somebody that's in charge of these developer tools these developer experiences right and they've made something that was semis successful so we're like okay this guy knows what they're talking about let's do this and so so what ends up happening you have one person who spends all their time thinking about a problem they know all the vernacular they know all the pitfalls they know all the common complaints so you the layman in this case come up and go hey i really don't like this maybe you don't have the ability to express why you don't like it you just simply are more ignorant to all the vernacular and words and everything they start dropping terms like iden potent on you which sounds very confusing or they they dropped the term idempotent because they're from canada and you you don't understand what that word even means um and all of a sudden you feel completely ins superior arguing against this person because it's their job to learn argue and understand every minutia it's your job to build something with it and when you're building something with it something feels off you find that you're constantly fighting against it it just feels really difficult but you don't know how to express it you just simply know something is wrong so what ends up happening you go you argue you fail this person's smart to me what ends up happening is that it's not that there's somehow this thing that they're describing in which there's 90% of people that are [ __ ] no there's 90% of people who are woefully unprepared to argue against one person's bad ideas and maybe they're not even that bad maybe they're just not great maybe there are better solutions does that make sense i think that that really makes a lot of sense i'm not you think i'm overthinking this vent r no of course not of course this is called being critical at thinking you should argue both sides of this is 90% of people literally stupid or is it actually just one person really good at arguing you should make these critical thoughts in your head you should try to read things critically okay you should try to come to the point of like arguing with yourself this is why why we read this is why we try to become smarter is that you try to come to the closer version and the better version of reality i just think most people don't have the ability to describe the problem they're facing because they don't think about it all day they don't have the time luxury to think about it now i i i we've had two people at netflix that rose up and made some ideas that we've been trying to undo for a long time i may have helped with some of them maybe i've introduced a bad idea maybe i actually made falor who knows but i'm just saying i'm just saying that you know these things do happen you know no one ever talks about my image no one ever talks about my uh ensuring product quality with image automatic alerting in production for all the different languages and all the different box art okay why does nobody ever nobody ever comes to me and say hey congratulations on creating an entire system that allows all of production to run that runs on every single system syst not a single thank you from that one i get put on a requirement to make autoplay and test it and you all watch it longer and then i get played for autoplay okay you make one amazing feature you did something congratulations you make a test where everybody else chooses autoplay you're the autoplay guy gosh what is this you kiss one you steal one heart you're not a thief i work on a platform that costs my organization an eye watering sum of money to produce over the span of 2 years and the engers responsible for it elected to use spreadsheets to control the infrastructure i mean that's your fault so we now have spreadsheet with 400 separate worksheets that power uh that powers but one part of this whole shambling mess uh can you imagine the kind of havoc such people could wreak upon infrastructure and code if left unchecked uh is there any chance a team with people like that is going to produce good results so again there's a lot of missing context here when we first started was this like a gorilla operation did you just want something to get off the ground you already had a little quick spreadsheet we could make a couple quick changes just do something really quickly here and then it involves into that you know how you make something and then it accidentally becomes productized it's not maybe not the plan i doubt that someone's like hey we got we got to quickly make 400 separate worksheets for every last thing because that's what we're going to do right it more starts like hey we just want three things in a spreadsheet we did that for originals at netflix we had like three things that we read off a spreadsheet and reported it in production right just because that was just easier to get started instead of setting up an entire vertical data storage blah blah blah blah it's just like hey let's just prove this actually is real and it took us like two years to get off okay it took us literally two years to get off but we still did it at one point it's me i'm derek yeah is there any chance a team with people like that is going to produce good results obviously not i i i actually don't even know do teams at large let's see do most teams at large organization have at least one person like like that sweet merciful christ in both of my uh first second and perhaps even third uh hand experience whatever that means it's possible that half of the teams consist entirely of that person oh i really don't like this guy's take i really think he should maybe permanently condescend down you know anyways uh let's see uh can my manager uh keep their job if they honestly say there is no chance this team will ever hit its objectives [ __ ] no if they didn't uh if they did that they'd be gone uh so that system is constantly selecting for people that are either too dumb to realize it's hopeless or too perversely incentivized to be honest or too deep into despair to admit themselves it is hopeless i mean i guess i've worked at places that we just don't do this i don't know maybe i've gotten lucky but i've pushed back on plenty of timelines without getting completely [ __ ] on and not just at netflix at plenty of other places too uh ignoring the bliss from the tow of programming uh a novice asked the master in the e let's see in the east there is a great tree structure that men call corporate headquarters it is bloated out of let's see out of shape with vice presidents and accountants it issues a multitude of memos each saying go hence and go hither and nobody knows what it uh what is meant every year new names are put out onto the branches but all to no avail how can such an unnatural entity exists the master replied you perceive this immense structure and are uh and are disturbed that it has no rational purpose can you not take amusement from its endless uh gyration do you not enjoy the untroubled ease of programming beneath its sheltering branches why are you bothered by its uselessness we're going to do a little chesterton's fence right after this uh i quote the above because it is very funny and because the only thing that has brought to me clarity is the total ignoring anything management says unless i have a very good reasons to believe the person i'm speaking to has intelligence integrity and has come to terms with the fact that the large organizations are inherently dysfunctional which happens rarely you know what i'd love to see this person do i'd love to see whoever this is start your own company show us that it's it's true show us that the endless intelligence that is being you know pontificated here can somehow create their own structure that doesn't have this prove it to me create a 10,000 person organization that doesn't have this i have a friend that was denied a raise after working at a company diligently for 5 years there is there was no budget he was told he was up and ended up spending a year traveling the world on a sabatical i would be pissed too i don't think i i mean i believe in a life of responsibility and maturation so i probably wouldn't have traveled the world for a year instead i would have continued to provide for my family and find a new job or something different but i understand the sentiment of becoming super upset oh while he was away a new position to open up uh in the same department for the same job title and it was a permanent role theoretically exactly the same job he was doing in an identical team with the same managers they gave me that job all the money he asked for plus another hefty sum on top of it management saying there's no budget means nothing yeah you're working for deceptive people at that point you got to get out uh i'm also surprised you would take the job fully does he does he know that uh it is purely a thing they are f uh forced to say and if the person saying it was not uh practically insightful they even believe it uh they're even believing it the only thing an organ organization can do means any let's see on the only thing an organization can do that means anything is actually solving your problem and any words to the effect of well we'll address your concern soon or we'll just need to do some planning around this etc should be just ignored wholesale these days i ignore everything they've said about salary i just state the number and i don't budge and they usually just give me what i want despite saying it was impossible i ignore everything they say around work culture and the teams they want to build i don't factor it into my decisions around whether it's uh a team i'd like to join because i know it isn't trustworthy and frankly sometimes i just ignore them because [ __ ] them why not i do i mean there is a good piece of advice here which is you have more power in negotiating than you realize okay like you do have more power in negotiating than you realize and people often don't take that advantage i think it's a little bit harder once you're at a job versus before you uh before you join a job when you're at a job it is much harder to negotiate your position but once you're at a job you know you kind of you kind of get to if you negotiate your position in there's a certain tenor that you get to kind of maintain it's a little bit easier similarly i let them talk as much as they want about work culture or whatever these are endless gyration of the great tree structure rustling in the wind actually remove the staff that no one works uh to work with or who terrorizes their subordinates and i'll know you are serious about performance reward people for staying and i'll know you're serious about valuing people anything short of that is less than worthless because you uh you've wasted valuable time i could have been listening to music it's much more peaceful to solve a few problems not wast it wasting not waste a single iota of my energy on creating system systemic uh change unless we're going to try uh curing cancer then log off to touch grass realizing that no mere words can demonstrate an appetite for true change was necessary for me to make that change in my life hopefully it does the same for someone else i think there's a lot to this that's really good and i do mean that that i think being a stronger voice at your company being someone who does fight for the good things and being someone who stands a bit more firm in your positions good things touching grass good thing dude i do it all the time i literally do it all the time look dude touch dude it's very good you know but i think the thing is is that if you really want to be successful even if you never financially get successful even if you never rise to a position of power successful i think not looking at everyone as just incapable and stupid i think can make the world of difference if you look at every single person as an opportunity to like help effectuate this change and that just providing good reasoning will help get them excited for something then yeah now you're going to run into a few people who completely disagree with you why do they disagree with you what do they know that you don't is a great question to ask yourself um it's really really good to ask yourself that because you could just have this like small misunderstanding of something and when you know that it could change a lot of your perspective on that person and you're like oh wait a second okay i see why you're doing that now and here i actually have some things i need to correct let's fix this together two people people right two people are much stronger than one what's the what's the phrase i forget what it's like something like two two sticks together are hard to break a three strand chord is impossible to break or so i forget what it goes it's in ecclesiastes i know that just a thing to think about so that's kind of how i think about it is instead of looking at every person as some stupid crud the biggest systemic changes that have ever happened are rarely top down like the biggest worldwide systemic changes often happen because a you know people were convinced and so you can do that as an engineer you can make gigantic changes right that's why grassroots are so strong anyways just
