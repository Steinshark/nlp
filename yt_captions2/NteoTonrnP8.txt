finally the pc of my dreams or it would have been in 1998. that was the year that google was founded the first module of the international space station was launched and microsoft became the biggest company in the world propelled there in part thanks to the success of this operating system windows 98 that was so long ago that many of our staff weren't even born yet let alone using computers so since this sucker still boots up and i want to know what they think of windows in the 32-bit era we are gonna go for a little ride back in time but not before we take a ride on this segway to our sponsor build redux they make it easy to configure your new build with support guides to help you along the way we're not all linus they also offer competitive pricing as compared to building a pc yourself so head to build redux dot com lioness and start your new build today anthony has generously allowed us to borrow scale once before when we tried out some questionable game controllers and we don't know the actual origins of this pc but the piece of paper on the front gives us a pretty good hint at its history we suspect though we have no way of knowing for sure that it worked for decades in an offline environment likely exclusively running the software for a way station for trucks next to the highway or waste at a landfill before being retired that's all speculation though as whatever software was once on here is now long gone leaving only the os this particular windows 98 installation is not an entirely fresh out of the box experience some software had to be installed for the joysticks and usb didn't work without first burning drivers onto a cd but it's otherwise good old windows 98 exactly as i at least as i think i remember it all that remains then is to see how quickly our whipper snappers adjust to an operating system whose exciting selling features included things like support for dvd playback multiple monitors and the fat32 file system i'm gonna be awesome at this my elementary school ran windows 98 until like grade six i think and then we upgraded to like windows 7. it was like whoa this is quite the upgrade i think my first windows was seven yeah i didn't start using computer until i was like i don't know 10 12 or whatever so i was two months old when this operating system got released windows xp was my first system so back in the day this was my daily driver windows 98 se i spent a lot of my life using windows 98 se and windows 95 all of my schools had windows 95 or 98 i did pretty much everything that you would normally do with a computer on windows 98 man is it clunky today like i can't right click the task bar to get task manager i can't right click the start menu to get anything it's just very bare bones there's something charming about that man i swear this runs better than like windows 11. so it's so responsive honestly like okay all right so oh man look at that leg oh you can actually change that oh menu animation yes yes there you go now it pops up windows update holy is it just as bad as it used to be i don't know this kind of looks pretty cool to me that whole vaporwave wave kind of came in vaporwave wave vapor man network neighborhood the amount of time i spent fighting with this back in more the xp days you know you'd click entire network and it just it wouldn't be there and you'd go into all the different settings for it and try and get file sharing working it was it never freaking worked properly my briefcase okay no clue that's not in any of the windows that i've tried given that it says briefcase i assume it has something to do with files can i open it or no i was gonna say files but there's a my documents thing right there i don't know important files maybe yeah okay i remember opening this reading this and being like whoa and never touching it not understanding what this did at all when i was a kid and i was like using windows 95 i accidentally like dragged my briefcase into the recycling bin and i was like oh crap i just broke something contains files you want to work on at a different computer oh that was for syncing with pdas and other things that you could uh pull out from your computer and then take along with you so like you'd have a personal digital assistant like a small little computer or a handheld device so you you put files in here it saves on to whatever floppy disk you have you'd have files that you could drag into your briefcase and they'd be synced to your your device for the next time that you left and then when you came back they'd be synced back into your computer i guess that's why it's called briefcase that's kind of cool who uses briefcases though that's a real question is that 90s thing or do people still have briefcases i i don't know i never used it not a single time i would use a floppy disk to transfer my files until i was in grade 8 and my friend tiger brought me my first usb thumb drive it was 16 megabytes not gigabytes so it could only hold about four times the amount of a floppy disk at i just had to install drivers for it on the library computers all the time because they would wipe every time you use them so i had to redo it every time all right what's next flashy desktop background come on i know this i know this okay this is how you change your background i see all right oh this is easy i remember being in an elementary school they didn't have the software to lock this stuff out we would change the backgrounds on all the computers and play with the screen savers you had the little pipes going oh you can change the color let's make it something stupid oh my god i remember these oh they're all so awful here let's do clouds and i want it stretched there we go yeah look at that that's easy there we go that's horrible he's the size of the font oh man right blocks pinstripe stands to oh is that flashy enough for you or do you want flash here i definitely had a bubbles background at some point what let's turn on active desktop why not active desktop is really weird it's always been kind of a crap shoot what we're looking at here is actually a web page i can copy this link here i can click on it it'll open a web page that no longer exists and we can add stuff to it like widgets and stuff you can have weather traffic reports news and any other web page data at your fingertips you could actually set it up with uh like a full web page that you built yourself i did that once had a habit of crashing a lot please tell me we have uh after dark where's my toasters after dark had the flying toasters yeah 3d pipes yeah there we go we would just sit there and like watch it fill the whole screen hours of entertainment for like an 11 year old jake yeah like that now there's a multicolored one hold on a second did that come later you can do multiple pipes they might just be different colors yeah there they are yes i remember this being a lot cooler that's actually faster i like that better than like going all the way into your settings and like changing it why don't they have these features on modern computers this is so much fun audio recording yeah there's a sound recorder program oh they're right there's no search hey you accessories yeah communications um nope oh entertainment dial up can you record in windows media player what's dialoft virtual sound canvas okay this has got to be it here no [laughter] no i don't want to get stumped sound recorder there it is jesus christ i looked at it earlier i totally missed it sound recorder yay i did it okay yeah here it is man i'm good this application so much time spent in it it's the default wave file player in windows 98. all right here we go this microphone doesn't seem like it's from 98. this looks a little advanced i'm not going to lie hello okay but we gotta create a voice recording is that right that's cool oh yeah it shows up a little bit i think i'm gonna talk really loudly we on window 98 i'm feeling so great high anonymous writer who set up this video you suck this is probably going to sound like absolute ass now the thing about sound recorder is that it limits you in terms of how long your sound recording can be because it asks you how long it will be so once i hit the 60.75 second mark it'll no longer be recording and i'll have to play it back and listen to my voice in a very scratchy and honestly probably very quiet manner oh it's really bad let's try it reverse typical that makes this matter okay that sounds awful at least you get audio and you get a nice little update of the waveform as you're going through with sound recorder i can't read this i changed all the colors cool don't wave that's gonna be a big file we gotta compress that man i still know how to use this play it through the front jack well see you said cd drive and i thought i was getting familiar with this and then you said plug in the headphones to the cd drive and you've lost me already i don't think i ever actually tried to use the three and a half millimeter jack on the front of the optical drive it's not playing through these now hot changing my audio device probably won't work is the cd already in here or and my sound settings just went away oh playback digital or analog use error correction speakers do i have to go to a different program to actually listen to it what's going on here this is definitely like more tedious than it would be on a modern operating system multimedia devices it has to be in here what even is this a wind groove okay so not windows media player volume control oh my god my audio thing went away it's not down there anymore did i break it oh cd player let's go okay [music] crap i even saw it in there yeah that makes sense all right this drive is in use okay get out of here windows media player that actually sounds pretty good oh that's kind of hard i like it i'm messing with this you and me baby this is a sick groove man they just have so much control and it's like immediately available it all just works this doesn't work actually but this is not front panel audio in the traditional sense what that is is dedicated to the cd-rom drive so it's obviously on the cd-rom drive because the way cd-rom drives worked for audio is that you had a little cable that came off of the cd-rom drive that went into your sound card that either piped out analog or digital audio because windows just couldn't do like digital extraction or at least not all drives could do digital extraction back in the day yeah that's that's just how that worked so it's smart enough to know i never used that functionality and i feel like a lot of people didn't because it went away very quickly but yeah old tech man no one can figure that out how is that hard okay what else do i gotta do here oh where'd you check your system specs goodness gracious me hold on no i know how to do this settings control panel that seems right of course they changed all the colors so now this is just horrible task manager right is that even a thing on these i don't remember i feel like yes printer regional settings sound system telephony what the what is that oh my gosh you can make calls on this thing that's wild system there it is yes wait the cpu is not in here crap how is it not system 256 megabytes of ram i love it that tells me we got to be at least pentium 2 era pentium 2. there it is to find out the hardware specs of this pc completely within the operating system without opening it up you'd think that you just go to uh device manager here which would help but it's not going to show you everything like the processor's not here we got the network adapters we've got the monitor i have a cd rewriter fancy you want me to find the cpu megahertz no dr watson with some kind of utility that i remember using at some point for diagnosing something but if i recall correctly it was not actually included in the base operating system so that's probably why i didn't come up with anything accessory is system tools hardware info utility which i believe is still part of windows believe it or not ms info 32 i believe oh genuine intel celeron processor 256 megabytes of ram wow windows managed swap file with a i guess a 6.4 gig or yeah gig hard drive am i just dumb yeah probably i would love a hint the writer for this project also suggested top row directx directx maybe dx diag oh you i didn't want you to tell me i was actually going to guess that which you can still run today celeron mmx oh i gotta wait for it to load i see not that anybody actually uses it anymore oh god it's so frozen crucially for us it tells us that okay we're running an intel cell celeron celeron celeron you celeron jeez i've seen this word so many times but i do not know how to pronounce it i hope it's one of the cool ones like 300a 330 megahertz that's pretty small pretty slow i don't know much but i know that this is a troubleshooting step that you'd go through anytime you had trouble with the game they'd ask you to run dx diag and then save it and send them the dump i don't remember how we even sent dumps back then maybe email i guess it's an attachment i have a rage 2 agp gpu yes this is a rage 2c the rage series is so weird to me because like they they changed the naming scheme so many times this came out before the first geforce before the first radion at least all right what's next real-time hardware monitor oh yeah we can monitor our system that's task manager no control alt delete oh that is not it see anything i actually had to do back then no problem stuff i didn't do big problem device manager hard performance yes now this tweak ui thing this i never saw back in the day so maybe there's something in here no resource meter that seems right there it is i did good i mean it's not a great performance monitor but it's there that's monitoring our system right here on a monitor okay there we go this is the very early version of our modern task manager so our file system we can see the amount of data being read or written to memory manager how much memory is allocated and we can see that that caused the cpu to work a little bit to show that oh yeah you can connect to another computer to log that computer's information yeah this is actually pretty useful seldomly used because you weren't multitasking that much because windows 98 was unstable what is any of this i only play the real games here it's got it it's got to click somewhere right games okay sip two i'm with it wait an illegal operation we keep dennis here we're gonna play siv yeah we're really living the retro life here gdi resources i do not know what a gdi is i know you need more deep background but we're up against if only i could get to the task bar it's a barrier it's stopping me i've probably clicked like a hundred times on a frozen screen and i know clicking on a frozen screen does nothing but make it worse so assume it's run game.exe oh i love commanding cocker this is probably going to be the ms-dos version even though yeah that's a dos window there dos games don't have any concept of drivers or in fact they do the problem is the drivers are on the game developer so in order for any kind of anything to work we need to set it up first this setup actually has a pretty good sound card selection sometimes they could auto detect but a lot of the time you had to choose now none of these say crystal but the crystal card is supported via sound blaster pro or pro 2. so i'm gonna go ahead and enter on that now we can run the game and we'll actually get audio oh oh we're in the game command and conquer i've heard of that game but i've never really played it oh my goodness yeah sorry for your loss i ain't reading all that banana cocker's so good i don't know what i'm doing am i the boat what's happening okay wait wait what's going on here i don't really need the barracks but if i build it there it's rts i'm guessing something's being blown up i don't know if it's me or if it's something else i should probably wait for the humvees to get in wait there's more people wait who are that oh those are my guys okay let's go team i don't want any damage i'm like oh i got a little bit of damage on my humvee no i didn't cool whoa that moves what is that oh they really just throw you in here with like no explanations intelligence is still coming in so we can't tell you a lot everything's just like a pixelated blob yeah so this is like 320 by 200. good old westwood ea did an ea and killed them oh this looks fun okay i'm super down single player game here we go boys i used to love these kind of 3d blow everything up video games terminal velocity is a pretty good one i wanted to play quake so i'm kind of disappointed this is kind of wild you know because i couldn't afford to play 3d games back when they were in their early stages like this this compared to the games that i had to play this is awesome it reminds me of this game that i would play at school on the max called i think it was like spect vector vector it was called vector it was freaking awesome wireframe tanks oh it's it's running way too fast unless this is supposed to be this fast on the link battle cycle many of these early games actually had their physics tied to the cpu clock speed so there were some games that i would play on our old windows 3.1 machine and then i would try to play again once we upgraded that simply weren't playable anymore because they would run far too fast and i'm told this is actually one of those games yeah it's like speeding up and slowing down depending on what's on screen oh rocket now i got rockets oh alt is rockets okay cool rocket launchers boom yeah get kaboomed [laughter] this is actually kind of fun this is way better than that other game i wish this heads up display wasn't taking up like 60 of the screen you can see how the the textures are kind of warping wow the scale's pretty messed up stuff looks real far away from you on the mini-map and then it turns out it is very close the terrain is kind of cruddy this is from the days back when 3d was still kind of new and uh how exactly you should render textures in relation to the camera at any given point in time wasn't entirely a hard and fast thing yet doing it correctly as we do it now costs a lot in terms of computational power oh my god except i don't know where the walls are they just appear right in front of you and then you die this is uh an interesting experience and that fog drawing in it is pretty interesting as well it's like dithering whereas usually you'd get like a banding effect instead it's hard to gauge if you can actually drive over something oh and i'm dead all right if you flip over you die what is that that's not fair that was not bad not bad for first run man i would have played the crap out of this i want to play internet games did i get the internet working hold on holy  it works okay this is the website we played on in elementary school it was called oh it's still there no way wow this hasn't changed a bit have they even added games dude this this this game this is what we played quicksand hell oh my god oh man it's really slow why is this computer so sh ah wow all right shout out andicon arcade this was a lot of my childhood a lot of these things are pretty similar to how they are nowadays honestly it might look different but i don't think it's really come that far in terms of wow i have to click 17 different times to change my refresh rate that's still kind of the case in windows 11. i like this we should all run windows 98 instead of 10. i'm already a windows 98 pro freshbooks i'm going to go ahead and guess that you're not an accountant and if you are
