ladies and gentlemen the most famous person in the chess world right now is named frank it's not magnus not hikaru not danger not hans demon not gotham chess not gary kasparov it's frank is a teenager from england and he has absolutely taken the chest world by storm he began as a screaming meme and he has recently gained several hundreds of rating points in rapid chess and i've been covering his journey and i've also done a few lessons with him now frank is either beloved or some of you are completely disinterested but the reason why you should not be disinterested is because he is the embodiment of a improving chess player a lot of you want to get better and yet you refuse to watch this content because you think it's silly or it's beneath you no i have covered his growth for the last several months and i will continue to do so because not only is it inspiring many of you can learn from it he is up to 750 elo he was 500 like a month ago a lot of you have been 500 for years well hopefully not not years i mean months is fine in today's video i will show you four games of how frank has ascended his chess elo these are really sensational games first the game of how he crossed 700. frank plays symmetrical queen's pawn all he does is he knows some openings pretty well and he also uh if he doesn't know an opening he just plays principal chess so he gets a lot of londons when he plays black naturally he's from england after all that was a terrible joke uh now i've sort of been letting him freestyle i'm not like correcting him with things like knight e4 you see i went to a boxing gym all right i had a older russian sensei shout out to greg and um he used to not correct everything i did sometimes he would correct and sometimes he would leave it to me to notice i'm making mistakes and correct on myself 94 is not a good move for long-term chess development for short-term chess development it's not that bad um because it doesn't damage your position that much it's just kind of a waste of time like you should be finishing your development and his opponent plays bishop d3 and frank immediately moves the other night as well and tries to get the bishop now his opponent plays pawn here and immediately frank grabs that bishop and already is not even worse and then he plays bishop f5 lining up the bishop to the queen which looks good but he should have looked for check and so for his future chess development he should probably play first to move like c6 and then he should do that um he went here and his opponent did this and now what frank should have realized which is very tough to realize this bishop is hanging so he moved it um but this move is devastating it's a really nasty tactic because now both pieces attack the queen when the queen goes here uh you can take the rook and also you can play pawn to e6 which would attack the knight and it would attack the queen in fact you can play pawn to e6 right away so this is all tactical stuff that frank will improve as he gets better but just sticking to the principles yes he's making some mistakes in fact he's making some fatal mistakes he has lost the rook all right his games are not perfect queen c6 though queen d7 and his opponent takes the rook and now frank is down seven points of material and would you know this is the game that he crossed 700. a lot of you would resign a lot of you would rage frank juice plays f6 probably wants to play g5 his opponent plays knight d2 and frank does play the move g5 and now his opponent gets tunnel vision and thinks well i gotta simplify no his opponent actually should go here why because when you go here now frank has a choice take like this or take this and if you take like this this knight is locked away in jail it now cannot return home which is a jarring development for his opponent now of course his opponent is still winning and should go here and should just push these pawns all of them because they're all past pawns instead of that his opponent does this and now loses the knight in that fashion now frank is still dead lost he's down five points of material he is down a rook for a bishop but his opponent has three extra pawns uh i would play a6 franco's here though uh the the bishop can still take on a7 and now frank castles his opponent is trying to bash over here but completely forgets that there is a hanging bishop alright people sometimes capture pieces on the other side of the board and completely forget they exist even if they're rated 700 and that is exactly what happens in this game frank plays rook b5 playing defense not the best move he could have played rook takes b2 which would have been better but he goes here now good rule of thumb for your uh for yourself as you improve you do not want to pin yourself to your king you do not want to pin yourself to your king because after this what will white do to take advantage of you pinning yourself to your king white will play the move f4 and that's the end of the game but his opponent doesn't see that now frank again blunders f4 but his opponent misses it and now rook takes f2 and now it's game on now frank's got two bishops for the rook and bishops are tricky pieces all right frank sliding his king over his owen for some reason i mean his opponent panicking panicking seeing the pawns and all this gives this up and now frank's up now frank is winning the only chance this opponent has is to pin the bishop he misses it frank runs backwards and even though the pawns are coming down they're not going anywhere and it's just a matter of time frank's g-pawn looking mighty strong he cleans up he cleans up by hanging his bishop but you know such is the life of a 700 rook c4 picks up the rook and then he runs the pawn down the board and it's clean from there bishop g4 the opponent resigns and this is the game that frank fought back and made 700 elo now you would have thought he stopped there he did not next one of the very next games he played i told frank to learn the fried liver because this opening is nasty nasty d5 look at frank pure fried liver queen f3 knight c3 beautiful stuff now his opponent plays knight d4 bishop d5 and here frank needs to play a queen move that simultaneously gets the queen and c2 out of the way out of danger not out of the way um he played a perfect fried liver by the way can i just give this man credit this man this is why he's 747. looking airplane flying through the sky homage to frank queen f3 perfect fried liver this is not a perfect move but knight c2 is you know it's still winning for white if you play 94 mate it was almost perfect knight to e4 the geometric checkmate instead frank gallops in and takes on c7 it's pandemonium this is anybody's game but i'll tell you one thing it's not anybody's game because in this position frank's opponent's king is on c5 all right his opponent's king is in the center of the board rook b8 frank thinks this is winning a queen it's not because of bishop takes but all frank has to do is get his dark squared bishop into the game queen e7 he brings the queen back it's a very scary position for black queen f6 played and now in this position frank plays an absolutely sensational tactic panza d4 check and the idea is that black cannot take with the pawn he needs to run backwards but the king is too tempted too greedy and gets caught with his hand in the cookie jar king takes pawn and frank plays bishop e3 checkmate game over chris cross apple sauce done you can't go anywhere with the king the pawn covers this the queen covers that and the queen the king is locked away in the center of the board and that's game over look at that absolute brutalization oh my god sensational game from frank i mean oh my goodness now it wasn't even it wasn't even that that i want to show you two more games first i'm going to show you a game that frank lost not always rainbows and butterflies then i will show you the best game that he's played in the last few weeks a game that he won at 90 accuracy uh which is uh which is nice right uh so he had a game against an 800. now once you get to the big leagues a lot of you experience this you get to a big rating threshold uh and then you panic if you want to get to 1400 you panic when you play 1600s okay if you want to get the 700 you panic when you play 800s and so on so frank plays a person that doesn't play a good opening uh queen e7 is not a good opening all right uh now d4 unfortunately the move d4 kind of plays directly into black's hands but it's fine because you have moves like knight d5 which can attack the queen you also should block the attack like this uh frank unfortunately here panics he has never seen this opening before of course queen e2 bishop e2 bishop e3 is all completely fine he plays bishop g5 bishop g5 is bad uh because it blunders the bishop just completely knight takes g5 here uh is the best move and then it's discover check but i think frank thought my opponent wants to go here so i'm gonna take his queen and then he's gonna take my queen and then i'm gonna take his bishop i don't know uh so his opponent does in fact do this the 800 does not find the best move which is just taking the bishop with discover check uh and uh now frank takes the queen his opponent takes his queen and this is something called a capture chain so you are down what you are down knight queen queen right so you've lost two pieces so the question is which of these two pieces do you want to take if you take the knight what will black do black will take the bishop right so you will get the knight back they will get the bishop and now you'll be down a bishop but what if you take that if they take that you'll get this which is why bishop takes f8 is the best move in this position because this knight of stock bishop takes if the knight escapes you escape this is the only way to preserve getting material because black is already up a piece this gets you a piece back and allows you to take this this doesn't because when this happens you ain't taking anything you're just down a piece so unfortunately frank gets off on the bad foot here on the wrong foot against the uh the strong 800. and he's fighting back a like knight b5 but his opponent plays knight a6 frank tries to develop opponent plays a nice pawn move and activates in the center and oh this is yeah this is high level chess bishop now hits the knight and this bishop is stuck frank's king is on the back rank frank tries to gallop in boom yeah unfortunate rookie one rookie eight i mean eight hundreds are just sharp tactically it's gonna be very tough and he's just taking everything right b4 passanteed and it goes from bad to worse rook a5 bishop back to e6 and frank frank loses yet another pawn and he he just gets forked i mean brutal stuff here from the 800 who gives a check shows absolutely zero mercy this is the position after 20 something moves frank's got no pieces on the board so sometimes you know you could be very strong but as you move up on the rating ladder you run into people who are experienced his opponent happy llama you know very very strong player and uh clearly experienced simplifies down and just pushes the pawns down the board frank made no effort to stop it black took absolutely everything and frank ended this game down 22 points of material and worse than that uh he also gets mated with the two queens in resounding fashion sometimes you get murked and there's nothing you can do about it and um frank will hopefully bounce back from this i'm sorry my allergies are just oh my god my nose has been itchy this entire recording it's ridiculous i do not normally rub or pick my nose to this degree this is just seasonal allergies this year are insane um anyway it doesn't always go well and to bounce back from a game like this you just need to stick to your principles in the opening all right bishop to e2 block your king and castle but frank also played a game at nearly perfect accuracy and he stuck to the basics this is against the 700 the level difference is very clear look at frank playing in the center all right posing problems look at this position for white this is perfect stuff and now that the opening is finished you can start asking questions to your opponent's king just like in the last game one mistake dictates the game here black has to play knight d7 a backwards night move instead he goes here and miscalculates and that's it the game is over frank is completely winning because after pawn takes you don't even need to do this you can just take the free night all right but his opponent makes it even juicier for him and allows him to do this discovered check and the rook is hanging so opponent plays this move and the best thing would be not to even take the queen the best thing would be to take the rook and make a new queen but frank simple chess rook b8 knight takes d6 bishop takes d6 and he picks up the knight and picks up the rook just sensational stuff from frank i mean he has been on an absolute tear and before i sign off on today's video i would like to show you this hold on give me a moment all right don't go anywhere what frank has been up to over the last couple of weeks is is just absolutely mind-blowing so before you go click on another gotham video or click somewhere else look at this okay just look at frank's journey frank started as just your regular chess bozo he has still lost more games than he's won look at his stats the last 30 days look at his stats the last 90 days this man was a 100 elo player in february february he was making tick tocks and memeing and losing all his pieces he didn't cross 200 until march in the last week he has gained like a hundred points in the last 30 days look at this 400 to 744. i mean it's linear at this point it's insane in the last month he has nearly doubled his elo reaching the highest ever rating of 756 with white he's winning 49 with i mean with black he's a murderer he's one of these people that for some reason wins way more games with black than white it happens with whitey's a little bit shaky and his best win is against the 778 i mean it's it's ridiculous really really ridiculous and um it's currently may 15th and he's got to play his games for today uh but this is this is crazy stuff and let this be a lesson to all of you i mean it's just a matter of the grind with frank that's really all it is he does some puzzles just like any normal human he does some puzzles doesn't do a whole lot of puzzles he just plays and analyzes his games look at this last few puzzles were done april 27th so he doesn't do that many puzzles he just plays and learns from his mistakes and tries to get better just plays every day 20 games every day you know and he just gets better he's played like 600 games 700 games he's played so and he is now up to 750. amazing now get out of here you go play some chess
