referring to myself and my cooworker steve of course hi how's it going steve you know i pay him minimum wage but he does his job he gets by okay sorry i'm so cheesy today all right in all seriousness though this week was one of the biggest weeks that will go down in tech history history i'm sure you all know at least i hope you do what i'm referring to which is what happened with open ai aside from that though there were some other really big things that happened this past week in tech that we will be covering right now oh and if you haven't already hit that subscribe button give this video

we launched takeoff which is a platform where you can go to level up your career your knowledge your learnings all centered around tech one of the biggest reasons for me to create takeoff was i really

people who were actually in the tech industry i felt everywhere i looked there were courses and courses on top of courses but so what where are the people where are the stories that i can relate to

about how to grow and elevate your career to stand out how to get that really high-paying salary we're also going to be introducing workshops which will cover coding public speaking resume building and so much more so make sure to go sign up today and i will see you on takeoff oh by the way we have a slack channel as well which is private to all takeoff members founding members let's start with open ai the biggest tech news of course and what i thought would be interesting as i'm sure so many of you are already familiar with a lot of the bits and pieces from the news with open ai is to give you a full timeline a full breakdown because i don't know about you but for me i felt like every day something new was coming up i kept on hearing different things so let's take this step by step starting with november 16th which was thursday it was last thursday which feels like forever ago at this point so last thursday according to a post from one of the co-founder greg brockman g mentioned in his post which was on friday that thursday night sam got a text thursday evening about a scheduled friday noon call this was a call where the news broke fast forward to friday right after the meeting another big news broke which was brockman announced that he is going to be quitting open ai as well if they're letting sam go he's not staying as well so now we've lost sam mman greg brockman all to open ai in a matter of 24 hours now as a side note a lot of people are speculating why did sam get let go in the first place this was the board's decision and i don't really want to share one speculation or another because there is no 100% answer at this point and i don't want to spread false information but there are a lot of skeptics saying it was because of some different practices going on that he was partaking in some employees were saying that it was because i don't know it just let's just say it was cuz of the board for now i don't want to get into all that now still on friday sam alman tweeted this i love my time at open ai it was transformative for me personally and hopefully the world a little bit most of all i loved working with such talented people okay so he's announcing it very classy announcement i must say then let's scroll to november'th which is the saturday so i guess 24 hours since he was let go he tweeted today was a weird experience in many ways but one unexpected one is it's kind of been like reading your own eulogy while you're still alive the outpouring of love is awesome so at this point open ai employees were furious over 500 out of the 700 employees were threatening to quit and i don't even think it was really threatening i think it was the are going to quit if sam didn't come back it was very there was so much tension in the air and it was around this time though that alman actually agreed to go on to oh sunday night alman agreed to go on work for microsoft now with him going to work for microsoft greg as well said he would join microsoft too so microsoft at this point is thinking this is amazing this is great uh you know they they're loving it now i remember waking up tuesday morning and looking at the news and thinking this can't be right this is old news sam alman returned as ceo to open ai something i thought would happen i mean we've seen this with so many incredible uh tech founders of companies from steve jobs jack dorsy the list go steve you know my steve over there uh but the list goes on but i thought it would take a few years i didn't think he would return this quickly but this really shows the power of community employees really really routing or rooting for you and coming together if it wasn't for open aai employees threatening to quit at such a mass scale i don't think he would have been back this quickly he tweeted or open ai tweeted theyve reached an agreement in principle with sam alman to return a ceo for open ai and also too i'm sure sam had so much leverage in that meeting the board did a'0 as well for a lot of their members so new boards include brett taylor is a chair larry summers and adam d'angelo what a wild under a full week for open ai and i think it's just going to get wild to be honest i think this is the beginning imagine sam in that room the negotiating power he had to get back with open ai at this point they knew they needed him back everyone was threatening to quit he has a lot of power in his hands right now most importantly though i think this is going to make for an excellent movie one day all right next up another big thing that happened in tech this past week which kind of well definitely was overshadowed by everything with open ai is going back to the world of crypto we haven't spoken about crypto for a while feel like it's kind of fallen into the shadows but there's still some really hardcore crypto lovers this though i found really interesting binance and ceo cz i think i'm saying that right cz cz pled guilty to federal charges and agreed to pay 4.3 billion in fines so where did things go wrong for him cz pled guilty to multiple charges and the crypto exchange admits it engaged in anti-money laundering unlicensed money transmitting and sanction violations that doesn't sound too good and then i think this is is really interesting here one of the attorneys states this the message here should be clear using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor it makes you a criminal and that kind of sums it up 4.3 billion does he even have to pay that that feels like you just be working your entire life to pay that off i don't know what do you think it's really interesting they say here that the crypto exchange company collected 1.35 billion in trading fees from us customers according to the chairman of the ftc now to me this is just wild when you think of how quickly crypto rose to the top everyone was all about it you know these companies were making so much money and we've seen the rise and the very hard fall of some other people in this industry this is the latest victim to no not victim that's wrong word latest person i should say to crumble because of it actually on that note i'm curious are you still in crypto blockchain world like what are your thoughts around that last thing i want to cover with you today today is not necessarily tech or trending tech news but something that has been in the tech news this past week which is this new tool cool tool called tl draw and i've been tinkering around with it i'll share some videos that i put together for it on screen here but essentially what it is listen to this listen how wild this is you can draw something so a calculator in my case i drew a snake game or uh a url shortener literally just sketch it sketch it in their notepad what this will do you put in your open ai key you select the image you just drew generate it will generate full functioning code of what you just drew i was mind- blown i was like there's no way this is possible it is possible it is here this is the direction we are moving in i was it really blew me away for example in the snake one i drew a snake g i put in here you got to be specific and a little bit actually the the programmers the way they made it is you actually have to be a bit cheeky with it so you have to really encourage to the ai that it's a good coder it has good skills ridiculous but kind of funny and once you do that you highlight the game that you just drew or whatever you know full functioning website and it will output the code for you and this is really wild i think this is the beginning of seeing how transformative ai will really take uh software development it's not going anywhere but it definitely is changing at a very quick pace these technologies right now are great for little games tinkering around starting a side project but this is the worst technology will ever be and i always remind myself of that when you really think this is the worst this tech will be it's going to continue to improve get smarter faster better and it did so so quickly it's pretty mind-blowing so i just want to share that tool with you it's open source i'll link it down below as well so you can go tinker around with it it's just a fun thing to do and see what's possible out there all right those are the biggest the top biggest news in tech this past week obviously with a huge focus on open ai and leave down below if you like these tech news videos what else did i miss is there anything you feel like i missed from this week i feel like it was mainly open ai all right i'll see you all
