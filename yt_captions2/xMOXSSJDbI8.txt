ladies and gentlemen welcome back to tata steel chess 2024 this is the first major chess event of the year and this is round number 11 out of 13 we are very close to crowning a champion and it seems like every round brings additional drama this round was no exception in this round we saw the violent violent behaviors of one hans neiman looking to get back to his winning ways also chess is dead i wish i could i could show you two games as the opening game of this video i can't i got two incredible games i need to show you right off the bat chess is dead as you know it rest in peace i've got missed opportunities i have big decisive results in other games and then i will tell you all about the standings uh and as you can see i'm not currently home i'm currently in toronto uh i've got a big chess book event here tonight i'm super excited over 400 people have bought tickets so i look forward to that and one more city that you should know about is charlotte north carolina which february 16th to 19th in 2024 will be hosting the chess kid national festival it's an amazing event i'm going to be there uh going to be a ton of different chess activities uh tickets are selling out fast so there will be a link in the description to that uh also people like the bas sisters will be there i don't know if that you know makes you want to go more or less but maybe andrea bas and i will get in a fist fight in a hotel lobby i don't know i'm just kidding um i'm i'm i'm just kidding about the fact that uh about the fist fight but uh they they will be there i have been informed as well as uh many of your uh other favorite uh content creators okay here we go chess is dead hans demon is back and all sorts of other fun end games uh i'm going to give you the hans demon game first and then i'm going to show you why chess is dead i i really couldn't choose which way i wanted to start this video so hans's opponent is um stefan bkma who's uh uh belgian international master playing in this event he won the qualifier section last year so he gets to qualify to play at 2700 and hans neiman hans plays this cutting edge line against the english opening with pawn to e4 making white's knight bounce into the center it looks a little bit silly but it's actually very good for white white will then play knight c3 attacking the queen a move here that looks possible is pawn to e3 with a discovered attack on the rook i'm assuming that stefan would not have blundered that and actually after even something like trading the queen white is just completely fine and probably slightly better so um the move e3 while it does look uh like promising and you know you you might you know you might win that what was that by the way did you see that glitch why was there a glitch there that said uh the move e3 is a brilliant move that was super weird anyway knight f6 knight c3 queen e5 they're developing and then here hans nean does something fascinating see stefan attacks his pawn on e4 which i mean hans put there like five moves ago well what ends up happening in this position is is hans just gives it away hans is like i don't want the pawn i'm not interested in the pawn just take it uh okay i will i mean i don't want to lose my queen i attack your queen but there's no way to defend the pawn if you put the bishop on f5 i just take the bishop but this is h's this is h's idea knight e4 take take we have a big trade e4 and i mean white's just a pawn up like if you if you do the math white is just a pawn up but what hans is going to rely on is the weakness of the king right that's what he's going to try to do so bishop f5 takes the computer here likes bishop f6 i'm thinking that from hans's time usage this is not the most accurate move but he keeps a very good poker face gives a check his opponent plays king f1 and hans goes back with his bishop and basically hans is saying i'm a pawn down but i'm going to castle i'm going to get my rook to the defile my queen is active white's extra pawn is not fail because the king is so weak and white's pieces five out of six of them are on the back rank right bishop f4 is played well as it turns out bishop f4 is a horrendous move i don't know why i mean the computer is screaming for white to play h4 and put the bishop on g5 h4 if black plays h6 you can't even put the bishop on g5 but what the computer prefers is it doesn't want the bishop on f4 it wants white to play f4 then put the king up and then play e5 and that's how white should proceed to claim the advantage we don't get what did you see that again what is that glitch that is that is the pawns are just okay i guess we're going to have a glitch throughout this entire video chess.com events page has a glitch where you just get awarded brilliant moves for not playing brilliant moves so what hans does is he just parks the rook in the center of the board he's looking to get the rook over here and at some point he's going to have to start using his pawns right white plays e5 this is as you can see from evaluation not the right approach by the time that stefon actually does play the move h4 which does get him a small blue exclamation mark hun just defends himself and is just ready to start barreling down the center of white's position if white gets a couple of moves to centralize his pieces and defend himself then he is going to be in good shape but hans is not going to let that happen you know you see stefan is like very you know he he's he's trying to kind of secure black's position with his pawns he's trying not not not not to let black have any activity you know but here comes hans with a brilliancy you can't take the the rook because of bishop d3 you try to get your queen out of the way hans chases the queen over to the queen side like this and the queen is just locked away you can't take because i play rook c1 check as a discovered attack on the queen and uh you'll notice that white never got to safeguard the king and because white never got to safeguard the king white never got his rooks into the game rook w rook c2 hans prepares everything queen d5 is yet another threat on the rook in the corner e4 queen takes e4 f3 and hans ends the game in style by sacrificing his queen and with a 43 minute time advantage to boot white resigned actually not because he's going to lose the queen back but because bishop takes f4 check his forc checkmate king e1 bishop g3 king f1 and rook takes d1 is mate so hans demon wins a game with two brilliancies a queen sacrifice and uh this is uh this is the hans nean that we are used to seeing so hans nean gets us going and now i'm going to show you why chess is dead this is a game between wey and max vadam in the master section i have nothing else to say just watch these moves e4 e5 bishop's opening two knights knight c3 f4 so we plays this like a vienna he it's it's as if on the on the second move he played knight c3 bishop c then bishop c4 then d3 then f4 right but you'll notice black never developed his knight to c6 so he plays a very quick c6 and d5 right there you go now you'll also notice that max vadam spent 14 minutes so he's thinking on his own we takes on d5 and now max plays knight to g4 now both of these guys are spending time so either they have the best poker faces ever ever or what i'm about to show you was all of their preparation meaning they had memorized this before they showed up to the board chess is dead watch knight to g4 threatens knight to f2 white could defended by playing knight to e4 or knight to h3 no no no no no no no he plays knight f3 playing like the'th century chess players allowing knight f2 which purely forks these pieces max farmer doesn't even do it instead opting to safeguard his king and then busting open white's position in a moment we says go ahead and you'll notice from we spending 45 minutes on knight f3 i think they're thinking on their own black castles white takes allowing a fork but his logic is he has a lot of development and the rook in the corner is not worth as much it's not worth saving it's better for him to get all of his pieces out queen e2 knight h1 and wei plays bishop g5 5 playing like an'th century romantic chess player look at this max feram thinks and plays queen a5 now the crazy thing is they are not you would think that they are discovering something new right and this is why i say chess is dead these guys are spending 30 minutes a move 20 minutes a move 40 minutes a move all of this has been played before if you check the database this has been played before by people who play correspondence chess correspondence chess is a type of chess where you think for you know it's the original daily chess you play your friends in daily chess you play your co-workers your relatives in daily chess in correspondence chess they used to have weeks to make a move and that would involve analysis nowadays it just involves engine analysis so everything that you are seeing this ridiculous sacrifice in the corner everything up until this point despite looking absolutely brilliant has been played before until now which is why it's given a big fat question mark but this is the position after 14 moves 12 moves i apologize 12 moves wei is down a rook wei is down a rook for two pawns literally one pawn he took that pawn you saw that second pawn and while black was taking him he just pushed this pieces forward and he said you know what max i'm put my bishop put my bishop let's go way he keeps going forward look at this position i mean it doesn't even look it doesn't even look real it it straight up looks impossible how did these pawns get through well that pawn is an f pawn and that pawn is an e pawn it went take pushed max faron plays bishop a3 oh my bishop to a3 prying the defenses apart from the pawn in the night that's crazy wei plays pawn takes f7 check max plays king h8 and my man wei castle queen head he didn't want to take the bishop because there was this winning his rook so he goes here now he can take the bishop black goes here you can't take the queen because of the pin but you could take the bishop which is what he does and now apparently the top computer move here for black is to not touch any of these pieces and to just play a freaking five if anybody can explain to me why a5 is the top computer move i'll be super impressed but i would also accuse you of cheating like if the idea is b5 why don't you just go b5 how how can you possibly so max plays bishop takes knight which apparently is a mistake for reasons i can't really explain to you gf3 is a beautiful move from wei who will now use the g file to target the g7 pawn max plays knight e5 which is given two question marks apparently he should have played queen a3 and then we would have gotten queen a3 king d2 queen b4 c3 queen b2 well that would be nice queen b2 king e1 queen c3 king f1 of course the king gets evicted from his home and goes to eat the horse obviously i don't know why max missed that instead of that we have knight e5 and now way king is not going anywhere queen d4 rook h1 and he's just winning he's just winning because what the right it's like offside you know football not like the one with the that we throw not the american one the the real football football it's like offside how how are these three players just behind the rest of the team knight c4 dc4 way he's just winning i mean he's winning because he's going to win the end game and uh that's what he does he converts the game black has the sac material right he's got to give up the rook and uh way he's just up three pawns dude went from being down a rook to up three pawns make it make sense y'all i can't make it make sense i mean this game was so bananas i was looking at this while flying here like what is going on how is that possible how is it possible what even is what even was that opening and the most depressing thing about chess is you think these guys are playing romantic chess they are i don't think either of them had this prepared but this is has all been played before if you check the database by correspondence nerds ridiculous here's another game for you this game featured a queen sacrifice the fun never stops so in case you have like a flashy fortnite video in the sidebar just watch this for a little more and then go watch your fortnite or your basketball or your prank videos or whatever it is you watch on youtube be curious to know actually if you wrote in the comments what you do watch on youtube this is gcash versus fua this is a matchup of the of the titans of the of the next generation both these guys are uh last uh last minute candidates players right like gukesh won that awesome tournament in shenai ala fua getting in through the rating spot these guys go for a grunfeld defense we have take take e4 and in the grunfeld black fires away at white center with pawns bishops and this type of pressure all right c5 bishop to e3 and bishop g4 rook c1 and uh i think they played a bunch of theory gukesh went d5 to push you can see ali rzo had a major time advantage there and now we have the following position gkes is going to try to use his d pawn all right alyza is going to try to create some counterplay uh down the center and on the sides f4 knight d7 castles knight b6 you see alza is trying to target the pawn and try to target down the sides of the board with moves like knight a4 b5 b4 etc rook d1 and then gash combines his central play with a very nice pawn sacrifice trying to break apart black structure which would be weakening his king rook d8 bishop g5 and he forces he doesn't force i mean all res didn't have to do that but he wants to kick out gash's bishop which is why he plays f6 and now total pandemonium breaks loose as ali resa takes the pawn this pawn unclogs everything and either black will win or either black will lose queen e1 king to f8 it's crazy your king has to move to avoid getting checked queen e6 knight f f4 and suddenly gukesh is winning gukesh is winning because he can give up his queen knight e6 f6 and this position is much better for white apparently because white will play something like bishop to g4 and try to promote the pawn instead of that gukesh sacrifices his queen like this which is apparently incorrect but then fua plays queen takes pawn and knight takes pawn trying to open up gash's king gukesh plays king h1 and suddenly al resz is winning again knight to f4 and now rook e1 is the critical idea to try to get control of the e file apparently rook e1 knight e6 rook d7 and white has a major major major advantage because the idea is that if the knight ever moves you get to the seventh rank and then you just start bulldozing kukesh with six minutes on his clock tries to bring his b bishop into the game now alira re blunders the position because after bishop takes f4 queen f4 white can again get rook to d1 right white can again get the rook to the file gcash plays this which is a miss alza goes here now rook e one and now black is better if black plays bishop takes pawn ali resa doesn't he pins the bishop to the king and targets the rook but now the rook gets here and now ali resa takes and now gesh again has a winning advantage if he plays bishop c6 trying to threaten rook e8 may winning advantage might be strong because black can maybe sack and you get rook takes king takes bishop f4 bishop d bishop d4 and maybe black will survive the end game but white obviously has very good you know winning chances black can't win this end game instead of that after all of that chaos we have rook takes h7 we have queen e1 check and bishop e5 and uh king g8 rook e7 queen h4 and a draw is offered and a draw is agreed because they're just going to repeat back and forth while white just stands there threatening checkmat so white has a latter checkmate a moment ago but a a a frozen moment in time and the checkmate will never land as the players shuffle their pieces and make a draw crazy absolutely insane game super super super chaos like absolute chaos just unbelievable right like total nonsense oh my goodness um what a game so next game noir abd satov is winning the tournament so he's in first place right now he's trying to build his lead okay plays e4 jan june plays e5 knight f3 knight c6 and this one starts off as an italian nobec playing a little bit of a sideline this is a very weird italian you really rarely put the bishop on c4 slide the bishop to b3 and then put a pawn on c4 it's just weird but he's trying to get a fresh and unique position right so he plays bishop b3 and then he puts that bishop on a4 so clearly the point is to trade the bishop right and then and then replace it with pawn on light squares now if i'm playing black here i'm i'm just going to start firing with f5 all right cuz then you're trying to basically say white is trying to focus on that side of the board so i'm going to attack over here that's going to be my idea right knight b4 a3 she reroutes her knight and she tries to create counterplay with her pawns no plays b4 nock has got a very interesting type of setup where his space advantage is pawn dominated which is very rare for e4 e5 positions but clearly from the 25-minute time advantage this type of deliberate transformation of the position is what he was looking for knight f6 knight a4 take take jw and june begins opening up the position but is she equipped to do so right because after takes takes it's white now who is threatening a lot of nasty things this pawn could be a weakness if a knight gets there something gets to over here if white ends up playing d4 i don't know bishop b7 and she continues to try to clarify matters she plays d5 all right but noyre a step ahead that bishop is under a lot of pressure d e4 knight takes e5 the position position is opening up and now again one and only one move can pose black any problems and ner finds it immediately knight takes f7 a pawn in the midst of the black position and without it the black position will disintegrate you have stripped the defense of the knight the only way to regain that defense is to take with the king and when the king is the number one defender of the position you might be cooked it's like in five on five basketball when there's a bad defender on the other side you seek him out because it will tire him and you will score on him quite a lot not me i was always the best defensive player on a 5 on five basketball court because i had zero offense i was a hustling young man on the basketball court but then i stopped playing because i couldn't wear contacts and you know i can't see the basket so but i was uh i was all hustle and i was pretty bad queen a2 though was a mistake apparently apparently what he should have done is gone de so the followup to knight takes f7 was incorrect he goes queen a2 and now j and jun has to find rook d8 losing the knight completely with a check and then just putting her king on f8 and nbe cannot capture because of mate so in the midst of all of this that is what she had excuse me she had to find she had to find rook to d8 getting a lot of messages i'm going to check them in a moment i'm not going to tell you what's in the messages um and uh ah my wife is updating me about walking benji why am i so i'm so oh my god let me let me turn the dust light on here i don't know what happened but all the light went away um anyway that is what was supposed to be found queen to a2 rook to d8 that was not found that was she played queen c6 and unfortunately it's just one of those positions l plays rook b7 cultured man sacrificing the rook quasi sacrificed because queen can't really take queen b7 does but and now noj ends it in style knight d5 i don't really know why this move got a brilliant because it doesn't sacrifice anything uh i guess it was because the bishop is hanging i i don't know and you can't really take the knight because i take and then i play queen a8 but a very convincing win from nerb who again gets a brilliant for i god knows what you know what god bless him uh chess.com events is just feeling very generous today nock wins a convincing game from start to finish uh swoops in absolutely ruthless he's going to take everything he's got bishop c5 on the way j and jun put up a fight but nerc was sublime today really he just showed up he showed an excellent preparation showed a very interesting opening idea and uh he gets a ve a very very very well-deserved victory so very nicely done by him what more can you say what more can you say i'm not sure there is anything more to say he's in first place this game was bananas pam makulu is showing up to this tournament to put on epic fights they are not always going in his way but he is showing up for epic fights he plays a queen gambit declined bishop f4 line against vidit who is just playing solidly he's playing this kind of approach pan plays this queen c2 and uh he invites a lot of aggressive play from vidit early kind of coaxing uh vidit into playing this d4 line the queen goes back to b6 the knight goes to a4 bishop before check this might all look completely deranged to you but i promise to you this has actually been played many times before just like the max vadam game this has actually been played much more it might look like they're both you know potentially high while they're playing this game or drunk i mean they might be i haven't spoken to them but this has all been played before as you can see from vid's time management right knight c5 bishop c5 and now the players are on their own so black is actually down upon pawn but white's king is on e2 and looks really stupid uh and uh you know obviously black has very quick attacking ideas if white is not careful queen a5 bishop takes h6 on the board queen takes c5 rook f6 hold up he sacrificed the bishop right the best move here for param was not to go here it was to back up protect his pawn on c5 and then just try to like slowly safeguard his king and advance his queen side instead parhan plays bishop takes h6 with a very simple idea gh6 rook f6 and the other idea is if you ignore my bishop then i'm going to go here now you can take both of these right the other idea white has is to maybe get the queen over there but vidit finds a really really tough move here and this is kind of like a cold shower he plays queen e7 and the rook is hanging and there's nothing you can do because if you go here i get a full rook right the the logic of not taking here is that white would have gone queen c3 queen g3 as well as bishop f8 like there was right but now both both pieces hang and i'm i'm safeguarding everything and uh param just kind of like dives in head first he tries to give up the rook here to try to checkmate black but viage just doesn't take now he does baram's attack is too slow king e1 and uh it's kind of a lesson like you can't really attack with a centralized king param really wanted a very chaotic exciting game today but sometimes in chess you got to be careful what you wish for cuz vidit at the time that he needed to find a couple of cludge defensive moves was up 40 minutes on the clock right when you're have 40 minutes you you have that luxury and uh he defends perfectly and gets a big win and he's gunning for india's number one spot he is very close he might even he might even have it he might be a few rating points away he cleans up house and even though his time got low at the end he was up a rook and parham's getting mated param has sort of been the exciting fighter of the event putting on a lot of epic games but uh i mean his record he has lost a lot of games uh he has lost four games so he's on minus three meaning he's lost four and 1 one vid is on plus two so i mean vid's taking what comes to him you know people want to attack him he's going to defend himself he's going to stick up for himself tomorrow vid plays nck who we just saw is is crushing mar andrea maritti in the meanwhile versus liam v uh mar andrea can't be stopped this man is a point ahead of everybody else he had seven and a half points out of 10 grandmas from the netherlands is his opponent i don't know why the grandmaster from the netherlands didn't just try to make a draw with a ly trying to make a draw relax slow maritti down uh they play a mainline spanish a4 is an anti- marshal it's designed against black playing this very aggressive d5 knight c3 knight d4 take take and he offers up vilic a pawn takes back this one and again mar andre has been a killer in dynamic positions but he's been a killer in any position where he has the tiniest edge d4 rook a3 bro he's got bad intentions he's trying to put that rook there all right that's the idea and here we go and there it is and now the just the threat of being attacked by the guy that's got seven and a half out of 10 you're going to react the knight goes back to f8 you know he's defending himself and now the positional pressure the dark square bishop b3 bishop a3 is just going to carve things up f6 takes rook takes e3 mark andrea zuk f7 check he did not want the pawn to be taken instead he baits the king out which we you saw noryb do the same thing rook bishop takes e3 so now it's five pawns each but black's weak black's got weak dark squares he's got a weak king he's got really weak dark squares and apparently putting the king back to safety was the wrong decision he had to play b4 you know like sometimes stockfish just doesn't even begin to make sense like i mean at least 96 right nope no 96 maybe maybe but bishop c5 and now you see the dark squares are getting carved up queen e2 rook f7 and he just what a move it's a it's it's a touch of magnus put the queen all the way down i was so excited i spit a little bit on the screen wow that is uh today today's recap was a little bit crazy a little stuff all over the place just so exciting i just can't keeps alive in my mouth queen g5 queen c6 now the pawns are going to get picked up look at those weaknesses he just goes right back queen b5 anchoring in the pawn and now he's just a clean pawn up and there it goes queen f5 queen d3 rook d1 he's going to win this pawn that knight never moved how long did that knight sleep on f8 seriously knight e6 and it went back to f8 on the 20th move of the game and when he resigned on move 31 it never emerged the knight just became a bear welcome to gotham chess recaps the horse became a bear it fell asleep on f8 and it slept through hibernation and it never woke up and mar andre mari has eight and a half out of 11 i mean i don't even know what you're going to do with this man he's about to win the section and qualify to play the masters next year which is what which is what happens no abdor leads the master section with 7 and a2 um and gesha seven i think it's either 7 and a half seven or s and six and a half i can't actually show you because my laptop is unable to crop the entire standing screen that's travel setup but you know link link will be in the description to track the standings that's all i have for you today i'll see you all for round number 12 tomorrow and um i will see people in toronto if you watch this video and then you go to the event in toronto and check out the ches kid national festival get out of here
