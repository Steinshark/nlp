did you know an increase for blockchain developers 
in demand is going up between 300 and 500   yearly that seems like a lot of demand for 
blockchain developers and the best part is   well the best part for developers anyways is 
it's very very understaffed there are a lot of   companies who need blockchain developers who need 
this talent and there's just not enough of them   in today's video i'm going to be sharing 
with you how to become a blockchain developer   in 2022 we are going to be talking about 
what programming languages you should know   what steps to take what really is a blockchain 
developer and so much more before we get into   it though make sure to hit that subscribe 
button for more tech encoding related videos   give this video a thumbs up and 
let's just jump right into it i also want to give a huge shout out 
to our sponsor of this video appify   appify is essentially like your one stop shop 
for everything for automating everything from   web scraping data extraction and web rpa appify 
is one of those tools that i actually used when   i was well abused throughout my career but 
one of the first times i used it was when   i was in a coding bootcamp and i needed to make 
an api and one of the great things about appify is   you essentially can turn any website into an api 
they also offer web scraping web automation and   web integration so it's your one stop shop 
they offer hundreds of ready-to-use tools   for marketing machine learning lead generation 
etc and the best part is all ready-made scrapers   have a free trial one example of appify is with 
machine learning so you can actually generate   large-scale data sets from the web for 
training of your artificial intelligent models   and as a developer you can build your own 
scrapers and automation tools using the appify sdk   an open source full-featured node.js library 
for web scraping and automation and you can   also earn extra income by renting out 
the tools you develop for others to use   in the appify store so it's kind of a win-win 
you're developing things but you also get paid   by others for them to use it i have linked appify 
down below so make sure to go sign up for free   you will also get five dollar usd in usage credits 
every month without any credit card needed and if   you need an upgrade i got you you can use the 
code tiffintech20 for a discount code of 20 off   before we can really get into how to become a 
blockchain developer we need to know exactly what   is a blockchain developer now this might sound 
obvious to some of you and others of you might   be really curious as to what this role entails 
so i really want to go through it to make sure   we all have a good understanding of what exactly 
it is the role of a blockchain developer is very   highly paid and involves designing developing 
apps and solutions based on blockchain technology   now there are so many different routes you can 
go with blockchain development and areas you can   specialize in we're not going to necessarily go 
through that today but rather the steps to take in   order to get your feet into becoming a blockchain 
developer also it's important to note people often   associate blockchain development or blockchain in 
general right with cryptocurrency and yes that's   a huge use for blockchain but it's not its only 
purpose blockchain can record digital transaction   of yes cryptocurrency but also data and other 
information another example of where blockchain   technology could really be used is healthcare 
if you want to keep track of healthcare records   and ensure they are unique i have in front of me 
here the blockchain academy report for 2021 and   some of these statistics about blockchain 
development really blew my mind i knew it   was really in demand and roles were growing 
that way but i didn't realize just how much   so i'm going to read some off for you and i'll 
link the whole report down below so if you're   interested you can continue reading it some 
of the things that they are stating for facts   include blockchain developer with an increase 
of 33 times is the most emerging job since 2020.   it's amazing also blockchain is at the top of the 
list when it comes to the top 10 hard skills in   2020 based on a linkedin report big companies are 
using or will be using blockchain-based systems in   optimizing processes and then it talks a little 
bit about salary but that always varies based on   company and where you are located in this 
report it says the average annual income   in the us for a blockchain developer is 136 000 
followed by 87 000 in asia and 73 per year in   europe that could vary greatly based on what 
company you work for how senior you are etc   but that's some insight as to what blockchain 
developers really make and also to just how in   demand they are okay so we have an understanding 
now of what a blockchain developer is and just   how in demand it is but the next thing that i 
really want to bring your attention to is why is   blockchain even important we keep on hearing about 
blockchain keep on hearing these buzzwords but   what does it really do how do we benefit from this 
technology blockchain helps the verification and   traceability of multi-step transactions that 
need verification and traceability so anything   any transaction that is taking place that really 
needs to be a verified but also something that   is traceable something that is unique and 
can be have a whole kind of what is the word   just follow each footprint it leaves behind also 
another great thing about blockchain technology   is that it can help contract management and 
audit the origin of a product so it really   is almost like a i like to think of it as a 
fingerprint it is unique and it is traceable okay   that brings me to what programming languages do 
you need to know to become a blockchain developer   now of course this will vary if you already are 
in a position where you are blocked or you are   a developer it's not blockchain developer 
versus you have no coding experience and   you want to become one obviously if you have 
no coding experience and you're working your   way towards a blockchain developer it will 
take more time but it definitely is possible   some of the programming languages that you will 
need to know the first one includes solidity   and there's probably no surprise here solidity is 
the original smart contract development language   and it was developed by ethereum that's used for 
creating smart contracts and also different apps   that are on a blockchain based platform such as 
ethereum so this is a must-know language if you   want to become a blockchain developer i have some 
games that i really like to learn solidity one was   space doggos it's a bit outdated but i still 
think it's really worth looking into i'll link   it down below and then also too i use build space 
as i've mentioned in a few of my other videos they   give some great solidity courses and really made 
me really understand it and once you go through   building a few smart contracts with it it's pretty 
simple another programming language that's very   popular when you are a blockchain developer 
is c plus and it's used for many blockchain   projects including of course the infamous bitcoin 
with c plus though it's not only helpful if you   are looking to become a blockchain developer but 
just any developer in general it's one of those   languages that has been around for so long and 
has stood the test of time another programming   language that's very popular for blockchain 
developers is python and actually i have in   my notes here python currently is the second 
most programmed common programming language in   the world which i feel like i need to google this 
is this actually true python is the second most   i don't know if this was me writing my 
notes at 2 a.m or this is actually true okay so right now in 2021 anyway so last year it 
was rated number one and then jab and number two   i guess it really depends on what site you 
look in but essentially it's extremely popular   and it's not going anywhere and python just like 
c plus plus is one of those languages that you can   transfer to so many different roles that it's just 
good to have those skills in general okay and then   we get into some other things such as cryptography 
so cryptography is fundamental to the blockchain   almost every process uses some form of public 
private key now you don't need to necessarily   be an expert in cryptography however you should 
understand the basics of cryptography and basic   algorithms there are some other coding resources 
that i will link down below if you are looking   to really elevate or start your career as 
a blockchain developer these are just some   languages i'm not saying go out and learn them 
all because that's definitely not the case but   have an understanding of what is in demand 
what is popular and then you can kind of choose   from there where to start for me how i chose 
where to start was simply by taking a tutorial   on build space building some different solidity 
smart contracts and kind of getting my the basics   of them figured out that way and then from 
there once i knew what the basics were and   having that foundation you can make more educated 
decisions on what language you want to learn next   blockchain right now there is a lot of hype around 
it and it can be easy to be is this going to be   something that's here to stay or go away and 
i think that's one of my favorite things about   it though is being on the development side and 
learning about blockchain development is you know   that portion of it is here to stay whatever when 
you go into investing or cryptocurrency it can   go up and down and really all around and that's up 
to you what you choose to do with that but when it   comes to building the blockchain that's not going 
anywhere and having these skills that are so in   demand is i think really exciting and it really 
excites me that's why i'm spending so much of   my time learning about blockchain development at 
the end of the day if you are looking to become a   blockchain developer start with a tutorial start 
with solidity start with one of these tutorials   that teach you how to build a smart contract 
and work your way up from there it's really no   different than if you want to become any developer 
you just need to know what tools are used and then   learn those tools i hope this video was helpful in 
understanding what a blockchain developer really   is why blockchain is important and also to 
some of the most popular languages around it   and also to some courses to take about it thank 
you all for watching this make sure to leave in   the comments other videos you want me to see 
and i will see you all soon thanks everyone you
