ladies and gentlemen in this video i'm going to be showing you games that were played today in round number 12 out of 13 in the t steel chess tournament of 2024 it's rare in a chess video when i show you multiple games and every single game has an impact on the standings every single game is important every single game has multiple brilliant moves we also have memes we have historic moments in today's video we are covering all of those things and the first thing that we are going to cover is this this was a live player shot this was from the twitter feed of anayia kazarian this is yanish she showing up to his game today and looking at the board like wtf and that is for good reason because ali riza fua his opponent today started the game with knight to c3 y'all may not understand this but knight to c3 is one of the most bogus first moves you could possibly play in standard classical chess because according to the computer you give away all hopes of an advantage that was a hilarious reaction this is the first recap i will ever make that has 10 games that is because this was the most exciting round of chess in any chess tournament maybe in history historical implications insane mistakes and brilliancies combined crazy defensive resources historical implications and after this round we have a five person tie for first place five i've never seen that before here we go nepo played knight to f6 and very quickly white only was left with the option to play bishop to f4 which is the jobava london not a bad opening for many levels of chess but not a serious opening at top level to get an advantage c5 e3 takes takes black plays a6 preventing anything from going to b5 we have knight f3 bishop g4 nepo playing this line where you're going to give up the bishop for the knight but then you're going to play like this and like this and black is basically rock solid the only chance that white has here of creating any attack on his opponent is with his g&h pawns which is exactly what fua does now i've actually had this position myself in blitz it it's really not that easy to play like your opponent needs to be up for a fight and the good news is that yan is pretty much always up for a fight you know yan could have castled and tried to been solid whatever but no he's just queen a5 let's go let's get in a fight king to be one a very useful move and now ali resa brings both pieces back to the first rank to protect his king protect everything important and regroup and reposition before launching his next defensive he kicks the knight out and now he lurches forward with this move g5 yan plays knight d7 which is actually an inaccuracy and it's better to go knight g8 and reroute this way to maybe go there or there knight to d7 allows ali resa a very quick pass with h4 bishop h3 and now very potent threats this is a free pawn which jan accepts and now the game absolutely explodes queen e3 pins the knight to the queen this defends it this attacks and i mean yeah as you can see spending 26 uh minutes for yan did not pay off what he should have done is play knight to b5 setting up a queen trade and a knight trade white would now play knight takes he can't take because of the pin black might play queen c6 and uh attack this attack this and after this castles yeah white maintains a very small advantage but yan decides to play bishop e5 and sacrifices his rook but ali resa just defends himself and within seven moves rips open the position bishop takes h takes and uh rookie one and i mean even here yan could have played something like bishop g7 maybe but ali res is just ready to sacrifice yan goes here and that move just straight up loses to queen d3 the move just straight up loses he just blundered the bishop is hanging if you move the bishop d7 is hanging and you play rook e4 you can't take because of this queen d7 so yan could have actually defended himself and a one move blunder cost him the game knight c3 op i mean you talk about an absolutely ridiculous surprise that is brilliancy number one so ali reza destroys yan pomi in a ridiculous game of chess all right there's there's one brilliancy down now this this game is sensational this is a long game i'm not going to get into the details and the intricacies as much as i would like because we have so many other games to cover that's just the nature of recap chess i'm not going to spend 30 minutes on this game vid gui is a man on a mission vid gutra is a point out of first place no abov is in first place 7 and a half six and a half if vidd beats him he ties him for first doesn't care about what else happens on other boards if vidit beats nck he's also now officially the number one rated player in india the highest rated indian chess player on the planet taking it back from prananda gkes who had it previously not anymore and of course vish vishwanathan anand who is a legend i mean legend does not even begin to describe it we get an imbalanced position and in the opening vidit out prepares his opponent and then a skirmish happens and ner beck misses this and suddenly black's position is under a lot of stress and what he has to do is trade knights go back and be down upon nerb tried to force the issue early he tried to like put his bishop out and get the bishop in and make a whole mess and the mess that he made was actually on his own table because vid just has seven pawns and black has six and my friends this is move' this game ended on move 77 now it's a matter of can black defend himself or can white win e6 look at that move threatening a mate f6 now we're going to pressure we're going to try to go to an end game we trade we trade the pawns off look at that sacking the queen to get the queen back off and now we have a rook and bishop end game where white has a past e pawn if you simplify everything down everything it's e pawn and king versus king it's probably a draw depending on where the kings are now if it's bishop in one pawn versus bishop it's probably a draw rook in one pawn versus rook probably a draw so with white you got to be really delicate you got to use your one pawn advantage and slowly methodically improve your position not simplify too quickly but definitely simplify but not too quickly f5 look at this vd doing a great job nock not going away vidit makes it down to three on two king f7 g4 slow process we've now crossed 40 moves the advantage is the same nck is fighting vid's king is out in the open he's trying to get active look there we go the pawns vidit taking away squares from nock's king hg fg now he's got f and g he has excuse me he has g& h g&h versus the g pawn can vid it get it done we're now 50 moves into the game bishop g3 he's got a completely winning position but how is he going to break through black is on the back rank but he's very very solid where's vid's breakthrough can he find it we're now 60 moves into the game slowly surely building up the advantage at some point there we go there's the simplification not everything all at once king g4 king f5 and there goes the king there goes the king there goes the rook vidit plays king to f5 and in this position nck resigns he resigns the game why does he resign the game rook d8 is a massive threat that is why you can check until the end of time you know this king can go to d7 and c6 but the point is the major reason why he resigned is because let's say rook e2 rook d8 rook e8 and like i said if you don't rush and you simplify correctly you play something like king e6 and a4 you simply win the game black's pawns are all stranded on the same color square as this bishop he could have played another 30 moves he probably wanted to get dinner my friend viu for the first time in his life first time in his life this man is 29 years old he has had such an up and down few years he's been so close so many times he's now 2751 and a half for the first time in his life at the age of 29 he's top 10 in the world he's in the candidates 2024 as well in a couple of months and he's the number one rated player in india and he's tied for first first place in the tournament first place in india top 10 in the world for the first time in his life incredible stuff and norbeck goes down now there were crazy games all over hans nean in the challenger section then i got a couple more absolut gukesh and prague i don't even know what was going on in that game i'm going to fast forward through this game because it doesn't have an implication on the standings but all i'm going to show you is this hans demon plays a line of the of the english where you gambit this pawn you gambit this pawn then you try to win that pawn back and then you try to have control of this position i'm not going to speak i'm just going to click and i want want you to pay attention to this c pawn because my friends there are a lot of little details and intricacies of this game for example this move c3 trying to give the pawn up to make it a weakness that pawn simply never got taken hans neiman tried to use a developmental advantage to get in but to get somewhere but look at this e6 giving up a rook corov sacked a rook to just preserve his pawn because he knew that in the end game that pawn standing two squares away from being a queen is going to come in handy this game exploded neiman was attacking it was topsy turvy but an inaccurate decision allowed black to consolidate and when the dust settled and everything flew off the board black was up a piece my friends that pawn that pawn is the reason black won this game he took that pawn on the fourth move white's entire opening exists predicated upon the fact that you are going to win this pawn back and on the 30th move of the game it went to c2 and a few moves later it fell but it was going to become a queen and that's it anton kbov the ukrainian grandmaster just effortless conversion and hans deman resigned because uh yeah by the way the knight got just just a small detail here this knight is trapped just in case you're confused good memes knight f7 is a very nice idea if if queen or rook were made that would have been a fork just again it's the small details point is kov wins a beautiful game uh white resigns as always they could play on but you know black would slowly get over here and take these pawns and it would take another 30 moves so 56 move hans deman goes down to anton kbov in a wild game i thought it was a very interesting and funny game i like to show hans you all have mixed emotions about hans but he's a very popular player now i got to show you this game this bananas this is the battle for the future i mean you talk about gukesh prague have kukes and prague ever played a classical game of chess against each other maybe like one maybe maybe maybe two max because they don't play at the olympiad right they will these guys are going to play in the candidates they're literally going to play against each other to qualify to play for the world championship this is the the battle for the future of chess right here i mean this is incredible this is like some dragon ball z type of stuff now ges prague they go for a nso indian defense one of the most critical lines cd both guys demonstrating prep early queen d3 uh clearly from the time usage gukesh is still very much in his comfort zone and this one gets wild quickly prague tries to instigate on the queen side with gukesh all right with his a pawn his b pawn and his c pawn gukesh plays knight g3 and starts an attack and the battle for the future of india might be tipping in a direction as the position is sensational for gukesh i mean dear lord you give gukesh a position with 90 minutes on the clock this man is a surgeon he is a precision machine bishop to g3 targeting the pawn on d6 the knight comes in the rook is here every single piece white has is working every piece is putting in work look at look at prong trying to defend himself the position is extremely complicated knight f3 gf3 obviously cuz queen f3 would have hung the queen but now you have the g file as well it's just longterm building pressure now both guys under 10 minutes to make 13 moves king g2 uh excuse me rookie four first king g2 both guys have 10 moves to go prague decides to go for counter play they both have three minutes three minutes in one of the biggest games of both of their careers for now because in a couple of months they got to play the candidates tournament bc rook c3 and gukesh coldblooded sacks his rook he gets a pawn for it but now two pieces stare at the king and the bishop is escorting the pawn ges is winning proc plays f6 ges timely d6 on the board you can't take because this is a fork pragas to lose the bishop now both guys 3 minutes two minutes white just made his 35th move so gukesh needs to make five more moves then he gets an hour and he gets an hour to fix up the position or maybe gets 30 minutes to just clean this up prag goes here rook g4 from gkes he's threatening rook g7 now rook g8 gash now has to make four moves he has to make four moves and his time is thinking he thinks he plays bishop f4 bishop h6 knight h6 massive threats of checkmate queen f8 defending bishop d6 attacks the queen always good to repeat the position because if you repeat the position one time you you just made two extra moves when i told you rook g4 he's got four more moves to make by repeating the position he's got two moves to make so ges thinks his time is ticking he's not going to go for a breakthrough with limited time he knows it's just he's just going to get that extra time and then he's going to go for it so he repeats one more time just to be sure and in this position prague claims thre position repetition they did not repeat this three times but they repeated the position position three times the position with the bishop and the queen on these squares happened once twice and it was about to happen for a third time on gh's 40th move the move to gain him is extra time he blunders a thre move repetition and he draws the game that is unbelievable he could have played you know he could have went here but then he was worried about losing the pawn i guess but you can't take the pawn because of bishop d6 so if he had just gone to g3 he would have gotten an extra 40 minutes and he would have been able maybe to go on and win this game instead he forgets that it's not the shuffling of the queen it's the fact that the rook moved and this move creates three position repetition proc claims a draw and gukesh snatches a draw jaw uh oh my god snatches a draw from the jaws of victory that is crazy he was winning what a game what an unfortunate turn of events hey credit to prague okay for like having the the sense of mind there to claim it amazing uh but wow i mean i can't wait to see them fight again now this one was nuts too i told you five way tie for first after this round jordan van forest anish giri plays a french jordan says we're not doing that we're just we don't have fun around here in the netherlands nobody has fun in vion frankly i don't even know why they play the tournament there why aren't chess tournaments always held god knows where why aren't they held in amsterdam them why aren't they held in uh what's another big city roddam you know like why are they not held in these in these big cities like uh why why why are they always god knows where where nobody's heard of you know i anyway sorry like i'm not trying to i'm just saying okay knight f3 knight f6 he says you know what let's trade the queens he's just like i'm trying to i'm trying to kill your fun all right bishop b7 and um there's literally nothing to analyze in this game i will give you just a little bit of instruction this is an isolated pawn it has no c and e neighbor white wants to block the square in front of it black wants to have pieces around it creating counterplay yeah look i'm just going to click for a little while this is the kind of tournament that jordan van forest is having in this position anish plays a5 and the idea is very simple he just wants to attack the the knight so it stops guarding this that's it the best move here for white is to trade rooks the point is that if black trades everything black has no advantage uh the point is if black takes like this white just slides over targets this and is fine right puts the knight on c5 um the other point is if knight takes there's no threat so i just kick the knight out but in the game jordan plays queen c3 right away i just showed you you can play rook e4 rook e4 excuse me d4 queen c3 because after rook c8 you win the pawn but jordan plays queen c3 right away and loses the game to this you can't take with the queen and you can't put a knight on c5 you can't take with the queen because the knight is guarding two pieces take take rook d4 j v forest straight up just hangs a piece rook c8 a4 black wins that's how anish just won this game from completely equal completely equal position queen c3 rook c8 a4 that's i mean that that is that is shocking that i really there's there's no way to sugarcoat it that is absolutely beyond my understanding i i jordan i i really feel for him because he's not himself i mean jordan's like a 2720 player 2710 player and he's having one of his worst tournaments i don't know like like that i that i can and you kind of feel for the guy and in each gear he just just cruise control i mean he just picks up queen f6 and this is a threat that's a threat then i can't move and it's all over just like that boom i got some more games for you we're going to we're going to take a dip into the challenger section we had a massive shake up at the top we have two more games with implications for the standings and uh yeah here we go mar andrea maritti is a bulldozer eight and a half points out of 11 you literally cannot stop this man his opponent this round is daniel darta the best chess player in belgium we have a knorf we have the knight undevelop itself to f3 because top level chess is a black hole that nobody can really understand anyway in this position black plays a double fen ketto sicilian bishop h6 trying to trade black's king side bishop makes a lot of sense and marre in this game played like a man that's got eight and a half out of 11 black is trying to create counterplay marre is like bro take my pawn i don't care i'm going to go attack and win your queen side look at this undevelop and kind of baiting his opponent forward and i mean this man is playing very confidently rook b8 knight d2 defending his center knight f d7 and here daniel d said you know what i don't care that you have eight and a half f5 brother i am up 30 minutes on the clock all right your past results are not indicative of future performance ef5 i'm going to chop this night so we get a clarification and i'm just going to attack your kingside now according to the computer the game is still very balanced but as you can sense yeah the uh initiative and the momentum is kind of swinging to d's favor not to mention mar andrea's got nine minutes but mar andrea has been clutch the whole tournament until now knight takes h3 uh-oh i think that might have been part of the plan though because after rook h3 queen e4 there is a big attack as a counterplay but black's king is safe safe is relative queen d4 apparently the best move there by the way was not even to take it was to play bishop to d3 i don't know why and go for some sort of end game instead of that we have this and mar andre is still firing away he's got a few a few more moves he's hunting the king and we go to an end game but black is winning he's just winning rook e7 d6 but the pawn is stopped white's position is completely hopeless by the way you just can't move any anything and it goes from bad to worse as d just picks up all the material and the outside pass pawn is fatal you cannot stop the pawn we go into the 50th moves and in this position marand resigns marand resigns because by the time the king stops the pawn this king will eat both of these king c3 king f7 king b4 king e6 king b5 king f5 and there is no way for the because the king's got to get there and he is not flying private king c4 king f4 king d3 king g5 you are still two squares away three even so mar andrea loses that's nuts he hasn't lost ever meanwhile luke uh leon luke menona who i i think that's how i'm supposed to pronounce his name you guys have been telling me uh indian grandmaster but with a portuguese name plays a french defense uh an indian and a you know that's a fascinating is it an would it be an emirate like how do you you know if you say someone's from somewhere somewhere you say i'm from the netherlands i'm dutch someone's from the uae what are they i don't know that's actually fascinating you guys are going to teach me stuff you i always like to learn from the youtube comments because you just google it and then you write it you you look really smart cuz i don't know and i'm not going to google it anyway my point is he's up against salam salah who hasn't spent a minute in the opening cd knight d4 king b1 and this is literally just about the best thing you want with black and because i have two more games in the master section no disrespect whatsoever to the challengers um this was an absolutely insane complex game both guys were threatening different types of fatal attacks onto each other and at some point something's got to give rooks come off salem sacrifices his knight and plays queen f5 there's a draw here by the way there's a draw bishop h6 is a draw so draw is on the board if you play queen h7 king g5 queen f5 and the king can't come here obviously because of this so it would have been a draw so salem actually is kind of like thanos he holds the fate of the universe in his his hand right now and as you can see he does not sack his bishop he does not force the draw so instead he goes here and goes for this monstrous attack but leon escapes his king goes to the center of the board and in the skirmish completely survives and not only does he survive he's thriving he still got a mating attack we fast forward white's entire position follows apart d3 and it takes 55 moves and instead of forcing a draw salm salet played for a win cu he's the arabic falcon because that's his actual name not like legally uh and he goes down to leon and leon's tied for first so the loss of maritti and the victory of leon these guys both are now uh up at the top incredible so they are both died for first with one round to go and now we go back to the master section this game was crazy max varmer down versus dingly ren the recap of this one will be uh obviously max is having a tough event uh so is ding i mean by his standards of course he is the world champion max plays g4 sacrificing a pawn trying to create an attack but then ding gives it back and basically we have this position rook two knights and six pawns each but here's the thing look at how fast dingly ren plays this ph of the game at some point dingly ren had a 50-minute lead of one time and max the experience simply caught up with him he goes down to five minutes you go down 10 moves it's 115 to 41 it's looking like they're going to trade down and make a draw but ding is so experienced and this just shows you the levels even if you're 2780 in the world champion but you're suffering and you've had a bad event you haven't played in eight months you're not 2630 and 2630 is a ridiculous level of chess but this move b4 an impulsive decision just trying to make something happen gives black the pressure that he needs to simplify the game down into an end game and dingly ren is winning he simply up pawns in a rook end game and he is going to clean up max vadam is wait a minute max vadam max vadom sacrifices his pawn to damage black structure and he set a trap and ding falls in ding falls into the trap max vadam is a genius rook to a5 check and look at this you cannot take because it's a stalemate oh my goodness max vadam is a hero rook takes e5 and that's it now you got to be careful you can't take like this because of this but if you play rook e4 you also lose because my king comes to help my pawn you got to be really careful here so ding is like oh my god what have i done plays g3 now king f4 is still a draw because you need to force your opponent's pawn to g2 and now you have to stop the pawn but first you have to give a check if the king goes to the g file you give a check you give a check if the king goes to the h file you put the rook on the g file black can't move if check you just slide to you know rook h4 you just slide to e3 and this a fortress it's a fortress you just attack both pawns max feram is drawing but he the wrong check he gives the side check which is fine but now he has to keep giving side checks king e6 and now he has to put his rook oh my goodness he's drawing the game king to e3 this is unbelievable rook h3 and now in this position instead of king e2 it's better to go king f2 he's got to try to win the pawn but he goes here rook a3 and now he has to go he has to go he has to go to the pawn and he and he doesn't and he doesn't it's it's tough he misses it and he's losing again i mean he found a way to draw an end game down three pawns i've never seen anything like this he straight up found this and rook end games are so tricky this has been the story of the event for max vadam he just he loses because ding makes a queen and now if you take with the king i force a rook trade and i win the king in pawn end game and if i go here rook a2 king f1 and this is i mean i don't even i could play e3 but um yeah wow i can't even so dingly ren wins what an absolutely game and i got one more game for you this uh this game has another bearing on the final standings uh of the day d4 e6 and wei plays a dutch wei showed up today to get in a fight with the black pieces jan jun has been great she's been performing really really well she's very solid but wei shows up and he plays a stonewall dutch defense you do not see this at top level very often and he plays a stonewall dutch where he doesn't even build the stonewall that's crazy this is some sort of edgy dutch i have never seen anything like this knight c6 bishop b2 and now wei opens up the position and we get a queenless middle game rook c1 played by j and june we plays here and now rook c8 he voluntarily damaged his pawns so he would have open lines to target jan jun structure bishop to f1 is a little passive rook c7 and he brings both rooks so both rooks are fighting on the cna a file j jun plays f3 a little a little too slow a little bit too slow she she needed to get the knight into the game a little faster because knight c6 now she gets into the game with c5 take take h6 he's trying to play g5 and now you would think trading a knight for a bishop is a good decision more often than not and she does it but that bishop was a little bit passive and that knight was really good she goes here now wei activates everything j and jude in this position had to play bishop b5 this is the key idea she needed to apply pressure right now and then even trade everything and then get the knight back cuz then you even have a pass a pawn but instead of that instead of playing bishop to b5 she plays knight f2 and wee quickly activates and just snags this pawn it's it's not even clear to me what exactly was missed there if i'm honest like maybe there was something she didn't like with bishop b5 she didn't like there was a way wayi could activate maybe she still was a little bit afraid of this move but um yeah the way j and jun played it with knight f2 uh wei just got all his pieces active and uh again maybe j and jun she had something in this position maybe she thought she was going to go take take and then bishop b5 or something but um black is uh simply getting too much activity here with uh the pawn hanging and rook d2 and everything so rook b1 and we just plays a wonderful game i mean his bro dude just went knight d1 when was the last time you saw a black knight move to d1 like this you can't even take because your rook on the other side will attack this rook with knight f3 check and then rook takes i mean it's crazy uh this is the wei that we're used to and um if you haven't been watching a lot of wei because you know he he doesn't play a lot as much as he used to rook b before is just game over by the way because um if rook takes there is rook a2 and it's actually mate you cannot move the king anywhere this is the only square king e1 rook e2 is made wei wins wei wins and he doesn't play a whole lot but he he he plays in this event and um he's tied for first out of nowhere your standings after 13 rounds of action 12 rounds of action in tas steel 2024 leon and mark andrea with 8 and a half daniel d having a monster event tied for uh that third and fourth place spot with awin lei and we have vidit anish gkes nbec and wei with seven and a half a five-way tie for first that is bananas wow i'll see you all tomorrow for the last round of t steel 2020 for now get out of here
