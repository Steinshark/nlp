this video was brought to you by ind dentle io learning python made simple how's it going everyone in today's video we're going to be covering five python easter eggs that you must know as a python developer maybe you're new to python or maybe you've been programming in python for a long time but these are the five most famous easter eggs that you can find in python starting with a major timesaver usually when you start a new program you'll test it out by creating hello world and printing it but this can lead to a lot of mistakes because typing it out each time means that sometimes you're going to miss a comma sometimes you're going to put a full stop there and sometimes you're going to just capitalize it incorrectly so instead what we can do is import a built-in module called hello then we can refer to it and use the main method that comes with this module and with this simple import we can now print hello world consistently although i guess everything i just said about that comma goes down the drain because there's no comma here but at least we have points for consistency moving on to easter egg number two a lot of you have probably heard of the zen of python and one way to find out what that is is just to google it and you'll get a very beautiful poem or you can also import this and the next time you run your script you're going to have the entire zen of python printed to the console and it's a very beautiful poem by tim peters and i can actually zoom out if you want to see the whole thing as you can see we have the full zen of python in the console but that's not all we can do with this module it also comes with a little challenge and what i'm talking about is try printing this dos and what you will notice in the console is a lot of random letters in a random order and coincidentally it's as long as the zen of python so as you probably might have guessed it might have something to do with that but it also comes with something else which is this do d and with that you get some sort of dictionary or some sort of map that might or might not help you with this puzzle so if you ever get bored try to decipher what all of this is moving on to easter egg number three and to use this one we're going to have to use the future module so from future we're going to import barry as fluffle and fluffle stands for friendly language uncle for life and barry was one of the core python developers i don't know if he still is today but legend has it that he was one of the core python developers and he had this crazy idea that we should use the diamond operator instead of the not equals to operator for comparisons so by importing this we can now open up the python cont console not the terminal but the python console and import berry as fluffle so that every time we want to do some sort of comparison to check that something is not equal to something else we will be forced to use the diamond operator so for example if we try to do 10 is not equal to 10 we're going to get a syntax error that bar as fluffle requires us to use the diamond operator instead of the not equals to operator so now we can compare something else such as if bob is not equal to bob and that's going to return false it's going to work exactly the same as the not equals to operator and py charm is going to give you a lot of syntax highlighting for it because it's not official syntax otherwise if you want to use it in your script you can't just use it directly because that's not going to work python does not recognize that as valid syntax if you want to use it in your script like this you're going to have to wrap it into a string so you can say code code of type string equals this code here and then you're going to have to execute it so we can do something such as print what evaluate will return to us which is the code we are running and then it will give us the result that we got in the console up next we have easter egg that was such a weird accent up next we have easter egg number four and once again we're going to import from future braces and we're going to get some immediate syntax highlighting but bear with me on this because now when we actually try to run our script we're going to get a very cool syntax error that there's not a chance that python will use braces and actually that's all you get here it's just a very cute message and finally moving on to easter egg number five probably the most popular easter egg and this is the anti-gravity easter egg as soon as you try to import anti-gravity it's going to open up a browser giving you this great comic which practically just sums up the power of python in a nutshell but just like with everything i like to really explore these modules so one thing i noticed is that anti-gravity also had a geohash method and what it requires is a latitude a longitude and a date dow so what i did is go to google maps get this latitude and longitude from the faulkland islands and then i just typed in anti-gravity geohash passed in the latitude the longitude and then i inserted a date dow buffer object and what it gives us back first is the comic but then it also prints out these coordinates and all it does is comput the geohash using the monroe algorithm and i personally don't really know anything about geohashes so if you have anything interesting to share regarding this please leave it in the comment section down below i just thought it was quite cute that they included this in a module such as anti gravity it's not something you really look into when you import it all the articles on the internet just point to the comic so it's actually quite funny that they even have a method inside here but yeah that just about sums up all of the most popular easter eggs that you can find in python i'm sure i'm missing a few so in case you know of any which i did not mention please leave them in the comment section down below i would love to learn about them or i'm sure other people would love to learn about them as well but otherwise as always thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next video
