ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the chess world cup 2023 it's time for the quarterfinals in the open section and it's time for these semi finals on the women's side incredible stuff the quarterfinals has four of eight indian players remaining as vidit gujarati yesterday in the tie breaks knocked out yanyupomnishi the the two-time world chess championship challenger did it prague our generic icy and gukesh are four of the last eight men standing this is unheard of completely unheard of 50 percent of the field remaining is from india three of them can move on two of them have to play each other and that's prag and arjun unfortunately i have some incredible games for you today starting with magnus carlson versus domaraju gukesh that is the matchup for the future uh oh my goodness this is this is really it this is not an exaggeration either um you think this is an exaggeration magnus carlson is the present and the past of chess he has been around and the world champion for over a decade uh and kukesh is the future uh gukesh is 17 years old he is ranked number seven in the world uh and uh he's the number one ranked indian player now this is it this is his moment are you for real or are you still a young guy who has to earn his stripes get thrown around the gym and learn from the best dukesh begins the battle for the future of chess with the move d4 knight to f6 played by magnus and gukesh plays bishop to f4 uh which uh i saw on twitter there was a fun thread by um uh uh this this gentleman uh olympia i think his last name is urkhan but i think he it's the loopy now he's a historian he's a chess historian uh and he wrote magnus in an interview yesterday said chess is boring so you know gukesh plays the london because he wants to bore him to death um b6 all right b6 uh knight c3 all right so it should be seven f3 already we got some weird stuff going on here all right so magnus plays b6 he doesn't play a central pawn move he is looking to fight against the london in a in an exotic way and gukesh responds to the fighting against the london in an exotic way with the move knight c3 which is already very exotic as well and you'll notice that magnus spent four minutes on the move b6 so he he was thinking like you know do i do i play a main line what do i do so it goes b6 knight c3 and now there's a fight for the center here and we have ponta f3 trying to play the move e4 now black could just play d5 here but for some reason magnus doesn't and instead plays e6 after spending another five minutes what he allows gukesh to take the full setter but why would he why would he do that this is what i don't understand like why not d5 maybe he didn't like something you know maybe there's lines here where black it's an unpleasant position there's some lines white can even play g4 for some reason uh anyway e6 e4 now another weird move a6 what what even is this i don't think this has ever been played before i mean these two are playing some really goofy stuff and gukesh plays queen d2 um not spending any time i mean you'll notice that gukesh is literally not thinking he's not he's like look i'm not gonna you know i'm not gonna maybe i should play a3 or maybe i should lay or he thought like he's just playing queen t2 magnus plays d5 after three more minutes of thought and now gukash has a moment where he should obviously spend some time uh because you can play e5 here you can you know you can play bishop d3 maybe he plays long castles and he doesn't spend more than a minute and that's losing a center pawn uh magnus has three attackers on that pawn and gukesh just gives it up he gives it up in a slightly different way magnus goes here could uh was just intending to give up the pawn and i think essentially the idea is if magnus grabs the pawn then black will just get a very passive position and white can already begin smashing through because if you think of the bishop c4 wins the bishop so magnus plays here first he pins the knight gukash still gives up the pawn gives it away and then plays d5 pushing upon onto a square where four black pieces control it i mean that move is not supposed to be possible but it's not easy for black if you take with the bishop the bishop is pinned i'll take i'll win this back i'll rotate backwards so taking with the bishop is probably bad taking with the pawn is even worse because you get the same situation uh maybe thinking of the bishop is worse than taking with a pawn they're around the same now uh taking the queen you lose the queen knight takes there is queen takes g7 oh my goodness what is happening i mean you talk about a scrappy start to this game these two dudes they're fighting they're fighting and it's the first period of hockey queen to f6 in like a regular season game it's not even the playoffs although they fight less in the playoffs take take now this move looks like it wins because it looks like anywhere the knight moves you have rook d8 but black will just play defense so instead gukesh pins him this way forces a defensive move out of him king e7 and takes his pawn now i've i woke up this morning and i saw this position all right i saw magnus playing ibd7 and i thought okay what's going on one two three four five six first thing i do always count pawns one two three four five six actually the first thing i always do is i look if somebody's up a queen because that's what i have to look at in your games in these games you know neither side has a queen uh which is good because nobody can blunder one and and pawns are equal black has two knights and a bishop gukash has two bishops but it's that's not really the full story the full story is that black has this kind of powerful pawn and i immediately thought well king is here this king is in the center imbalance well definitely benefits magnus right right away no queens long-term game slight imbalance that's going to benefit magnus but gukesh said in an interview recently he has to and wants to improve his endgame and he is going to take a page out of magnus's playbook because that is what you have to learn to beat the best and as max holloway says in order to be the best you got to beat the best and the best is blessed not anymore it's vulcanovsky but you get the point so bishop g3 dukesh brings his bishop out of the territory magnus plays rook g8 develops his bishop because ian hasn't had a chance to do it yet and if he just developed his knight he would have lost the pawn and you will be wondering why he's not taking uh because in chess every trade is a winner and a loser and this one benefits blackmore you can give a check but these players don't celebrate checks like you do that's not really there's nothing there and then black is just doing quite well so bishop to e2 and now we have take take and you say levy you just told me he's not gonna do that well he's gonna pin the knight to the bishop and he's gonna force a big trade knight takes pawn takes take take and if magnus chooses to take this pawn gokesh is going to win that pawn and that is exactly what happens and magnus moves the king off the back rank all right the position is completely equal slightly slightly slightly slightly better for black slightly minus 0.1 and i tweeted this morning and i said um i said uh the position when i watch a magnus game when the evaluation goes to minus 0.1 i just think he's gonna win like i again i even here i check back in i i walk my dog you know my wife went to work because she has a real job and you know i sit here and look at chess games all day um and i thought okay well well magnus has this position so of course magnus is playing for win but what's funny is if magnus was playing white i would say oh magnus is playing for a win with white which is a really stupid bias that i have to get rid of essentially you look at the you look at the imbalance of the pawns first of all black has a pass pawn like that pawn has no pawn stopping his path it's called a pass pawn three on two has a possibility to become a pass pawn but it's not there's no past pawns yet and these two cancel out each other so magnus is gonna try to do this also magnus has the better king and in the end game you actually want your king more involved in the center and out in the open as long as there's no queens on the board so how is he going to do this well gukash plays knight d4 looking for knight c6 also e5 is not possible and maybe he wants rook f1 as well magnus puts the knight in the center preventing knight c6 uh glucash targets the knight obviously and now a fascinating decision magnus doesn't guard the knight magnus of course being a gotham subscriber what's equal or more value than a knight a knight so he's like all right let's just get rid of the knights now here go cash can play what's called a desperado he can give up his knight because he's gonna win it back but magnus would go here so that wouldn't work and now his king is going to guard the knight so instead we get just a pure rook end game and the rook goes back to e2 the players can shake hands and make a draw but they can't they can't magnus is still gonna try and listen this is literally the worst situation that gukesh could have found himself in this is why i love comparing chess to fighting because in fighting in mixed martial arts not fake sports like boxing where you can only use your hands boxing's a real sport but mixed martial arts is really the epitome of you know glady modern gladiators um you want to avoid us a a person's preferences striker al jermaine sterling on on on august the 19th is fighting sean o'malley all right ufc 292. striker vs grappler that's what that is so we have the same situation here if you get caught in magnus's web of end games the chance of you doing something stupid even microscopically stupid increases he's going to beat you the longer the game goes on okay i'm hyping this up big time right he better deliver first of all look at this he's threatening made already that's not impressive c3 crazy that gukesh saw that by the way very sneaky rook f4 the king slides up to the second rank and magnus targets the weakness rook g4 rook g2 is the idea gukesh not fearing that plays b4 now if magnus were to play rook g4 right now and gukesh were to play rook h2 gukesh would likely lose this game in the long run why because he can't move either rook and black would just very slowly encroach on the space the only chance gukesh has is breaking something over here by creating an outside pass pawn it serves as a decoy and it frees up one of the rooks also in rook end game sometimes you can lose a pawn but it has to be the right pawn you can't lose this pawn and give black a two on zero you could lose one of these pawns maybe and then maybe it would be a draw so b4 magnus shuts that down and then targets this and gukesh doesn't play passively he counter-attacks forcing magnets to do this and now we have a one rook end game now it's very difficult to make a draw here with white because magnus's plan is very simple walk down the center of the board he's gonna get the pawns here he's gonna trade and he's gonna promote he's just gonna win so what do you do if you're playing with white so a4 magnus ignores you completely and plays the move f5 that was always his plan gukash plays the pawn takes b5 pawn takes b5 and rook a2 very natural he's utilizing the open file guest has done absolutely nothing wrong nothing except he's losing what but it says minus 0.5 it doesn't know deep depth sockfish already senses danger for white he's losing he has to go cash is now walking on a type rope against magnus carlsen magnus is the director of the circus lukesh is walking on the tie rope he makes it to the end he gets the prize which is a draw this is ridiculous you don't even realize how hard this is the computer doesn't even realize how hard this is there is a drawing mechanism here for white c4 rook g3 check and you you actually volunteer this pawn for capture and you just invest in your b-pawn i mean it's ridiculous stuff who plays just like this but what i'm about to show you is even more ridiculous rook a2 magnus plays rook g5 ready to play f4 and defend the pawn like this and now rook to a5 pawn to f4 is the winning is is the drawing idea and now the otherworldly king c2 you induced the pawn forward you walk into a check but you get your king closer to the pawns so now black has to go back and guard you go here here and now you don't go here you give a check what does it look like you've accomplished and now you go here because now if e5 rook a6 and then rook e6 and black cannot move a single piece that was the only way that go cash could make a draw in this game instead gukesh went here and now here comes magnus here comes magnus here comes magnus here comes magnus and magnus i told you that was the plan all along who cash missed a psychotic if gukesh found that there has to be a scan of his backside on the way out of the room i mean i'm sorry you gotta scan everything he doesn't find it look at how frozen white's position is white's position being a draw was an illusion the whole time all the way back here it was an illusion magnus knew the way to play it forward gukesh stumbled into magnus's strength you can't do that look i mean the position is literally zeros but it's not it's only zeros if you find it on an otherworldly level of depth and find the defensive mechanism i'm not even sure gukesh made a mistake he had to find this absurd defense and it takes 48 moves of just hydraulic press and magnus carlson wins gukesh resigns because rookie 8 king d3 this is coming the shield you can't stop it i'm gonna walk in here and i've got two pawns that are gonna promote magnus beats go catch with black the future of chess will have to wait because magnus was in vintage form you cannot beat this magnus carlsen can't beat him okay there's nothing you can do did he play a perfect game by the way i haven't actually checked game review yet i'm gonna check game review live right now what was his accuracy 98 estimated hilo 3600. what do you even want from this man i mean like seriously were his mistakes were probably in the opening bishop to b4 is considered an inaccuracy root g5 a little bit later magnus have to find i think you have to play king f6 i mean like he had to play i was just it's it's it's it's it's actually sick you know who else is contending for the for the future of chess our generician prague these guys are friends my friends this is um this is this is really an unfortunate one uh these guys are literally like roommates at the tournament imagine going to the world cup in baku hanging out with a friend for the entire tournament both making it to the quarterfinals to represent the hottest country in the world of chess right now not climate although that's a separate issue that we'll discuss that some people don't even believe exists um chess in india is red hot and these two are playing in the quarterfinals while also taking walks at night together which is um sad i would like to see them playing other people knight f3 all right the battle of the friends it's an anime plot line one of the two indians will knock the other out of the world cup but that means one of them will qualify to the semi-finals and probably make it to the candidates one of the two people that wins this matchup is literally going to the candidates that's crazy maybe like 90 chance they play a symmetrical this is called like a neo groomfield you don't have to know the name you're not gonna remember it anyway knight d7 none of this matters they play a very sophisticated opening and this is the position after the first 13 moves everything is good they've traded c pawns black has advanced over here could it be an asset could it be a liability questions that we have to ask ourselves um rook a5 oh my neck is stiff i i got back into mixed martial arts training i took some time off i got coveted back in december so i took like six months off the gym but recently i've gotten back to personal training and uh i've gone back to boxing and judo uh and uh it's good i'm just very i haven't showered yet either i came home from training and i'm recording the recap um but uh my neck is stiff take take anyway it doesn't matter no a pawn no c pawn symmetrical position uh arjun seizes the a file he just says you know prague you're my roommate but i'm getting that side e3 rook say it i have no evidence by the way that their roommates are not but they're very good friends and they're obviously hanging out in the tournament a lot uh now uh an interesting moment eric i see gives up the bishop for the night under traditional circumstances this is stupid he is not stupid uh i mean in chess maybe he doesn't know how to tie his shoes i don't know arjun if you're watching this i think you're great e6 um six pawns on light squares he just traded his light squared bishop he put six pawns on light squares that makes a lot of sense because the light squared bishop covers the light squares he now has a brick wall of a position rook d1 bishop both guys are bringing their bishops back into the game and arjun is very clearly dominating and trying to force something to happen on the queen side take take rook c8 things are falling off the board bishop e5 and take take and in all likelihood we are headed for some sort of draw but we do have a slight imbalance of bishop versus knight and potential pawn structure b5 and suddenly eric geise in low time sensing weakness plays d4 and now a very very very difficult moment um if you take with the pawn eric ice he's gonna put his knight here and this is very scary knights are very scary so he goes here thinking the knight has to leave it doesn't the knight just goes straight in just absolutely flies off the cliff he gives up a night for literally a pawn upon that's it one pawn but in chess there's two important things material and king safety and now the king is weak queen b6 is coming queen d2 is coming queen g5 is coming the pawn is coming arjun is coming this is a very very difficult position for white bishop to g2 and prog blunders with 40 seconds on the clock he actually played this move with 10 seconds on the clock because he gets 30 seconds back i think um he had to play king h1 sidestepping this check because rook c8 is a checkmate threat so he plays this and he makes it to the 40th move but look at the position white is stuck in the corner of the board and my friends unfortunately it never really gets any better eric icy just very patiently waits for the right moment he brings his king forward literally walks into the position like uh who was that belgian king king albert who walked who was like uh he would walk with the soldiers he walks with the soldiers sacrificing the rook to promote the pawn and uh this reminded me this scene where he manages to promote like this and then this this reminded me of uh of the scene in harry potter like if something like this there's a scene in harry potter in the deathly hallows where they fall on the ground after nagini gets cut with the sword and then it's like they just stare at each other it's just kings and pawns but black is completely winning because black is in white's position so black has much quicker access to the pawns and black is going to win the pawns and uh white is simply going to run out of moves i mean you can you just you you cannot defend the pawns anymore um so uh eric i see wins every guy he beats prague which is crazy that is a crazy result eric i see the winner um and prague now has to win with black just like just like just like gukesh would you rather play in a must-win situation against eric icy or carlson i mean no disrespect to arjun but i think people would choose him the alternative is the best player of all time uh but listen arjun in great shape right now to make the semis and probably make the candidates uh one more game uh no no no well just we're gonna keep rolling friends this was a crazy game this was a heartbreaking game uh le dope the man with the greatest nickname in chess also lanier dominguez perez is one of the most underappreciated super jams of all time he hasn't really won any flashy event he's won a few things he's been 27.50 for like 15 years before he transferred to the united states i'm not even sure you knew of him which was like five or seven years ago he was cuba he played for cuba he's cuban this is 27.50 he's just in the quarterfinals i mean it's ridiculous he plays for the olympic team and and i got news for you in this game he he took on the preparation of fabiano caruana he was down 28 minutes on the clock in an e45 game fabi traded light scored bishops fabi thought for the first time 15 moves into the game this is just vintage fabi stuff there's just like nothing you can do about it you know queen d7 take take and fabi played d5 and he sees the center of the board this is like exactly what fabiano caruana does to people it doesn't matter what their level is he's got prep all up and down he will drag you up and down the chessboard he closed the center he undeveloped his knight clearly looking for hostilities on this side of the board but lanier was patient all right he was patient he took the a file right he traded rooks and and and and and basically offered fabi this point fabi doesn't have to take the pawn taking the pawn could potentially cause infiltration here could weaken this over here fabi thinks for a while takes the pawn decides lanier is full of full crap he's got nothing he's got absolutely nothing i'll just bring bring my queen i'm up a pawn but suddenly the pawns for black start looking delicate like i'm talking real delicate only black is playing for a win this this and this are all only white is playing for win black spawns are weak now fabi had to be active he had to give up the pawn target this and be active on the a file and try to use the beep on 5v played passively and all of a sudden fabi is dead lost he's down two pawns this is resignable territory this is like i mean this really i'm not exaggerating look at this position two pass pawns now he's only he's only down one pawn but two pass pawns and like you know black if black plays rook c3 i should go d6 you take that i got d7 i just win you can't do anything fabiano is dead lost against lemire the most underappreciated 2700 ever this is this is ridiculous fabiano is one of the favorites remaining besides magnus to win the whole thing out of nowhere leniere is putting the hurt on him he's just gonna queen nobody could have seen this coming rook b7 advancing the pawn rook c3 counter-attacking scrap he's just up two pawns just pure two pawns it's not even close rook to d3 linear seals the deal here comes fabi trying to defend himself and here lanier had to bring his king he moved with his knight and that gave fabi a little bit of life the the white king did not want to stand over here the white king needed to be a bit more active suddenly fabi got active but also but also defensive and preventing white from making any progress how does white make progress here can white bait progress here this is insane lanier now gives up a pawn knight e2 he's trying to seal out the rook but here comes fabi with side checks with front checks linear runs the king but knight d7 oh my god is fabi gonna save this game knight e5 king b5 g5 h5 that's it fabi stop the pawn two pawns down in a rook and night end game this is other worldly defense lanier sacrifices his pawn and gets this one but now rook e4 and an absolutely herculean effort this is not that this cannot be understated my friends it was over he was down two pawns it was like plus four in deep analysis and lanier chooses the wrong plan right at the very end and fabi pulls off a miracle and draws the game he was on the verge he was gonna lose saving the game this is going to give him so much momentum fabiano fans y'all can rejoice because this was unbelievable uh another game that was very fun this is then the women's side they're in the semifinals the other matchup ended in a draw this was a queen's gambit declined from tanjong yi of china they have a ridiculously stacked team by the way they have leighton yeah they have jew and june tanjong yi uh this was uh awesome stuff vintage uh queens gambit decline stuff here white is trying to get a big center black fighting back on the queen side we have trades of bishops and white has uh this type of position now you'll notice here this move h5 from karachina trying to prevent white from expanding white chooses the wrong plan clearly white was building up something over here which is what you're supposed to build up in the queen's gambit decline but then should have continued to build here or play knight c5 white chooses this plan and all of a sudden queen b8 the lighthouse from far away right hitting things computer preferred here for black to play some obscure knight g7 i mean i don't even know queen v8 and garage gonna took over the game on the queen side white tried to stabilize black just made some casual improving moves we went to a queenless end game c5 lashing out creating a weakness but a potential long-term infiltration spot take take take d4 tough decision b gluttonous and allow infiltration if you do this rook c2 this is very very delicate stuff now over here there's crazy tactics bishop g5 bishop e3 infiltrating on the dark squares white goes here but now this is a passer and good atkin is just she found a way in and away in she is going to get bishop g5 from all angles h4 prying away the defense rook d4 rook c1 check and the pawn has fallen and this is all you're gonna need if you're black all right white tries to create some counter play but unfortunately it's just not good enough you can take a pawn with check but you can't stop a pawn promotion f4 pawn takes and it takes 45 moves look at the seal by the way bishop to b4 you can take the bishop but then i promote and it's uh it's game over you get ladder mated basically knight takes king g8 and that's it the pawn is gonna queen goody actually kind of winning a very nice game punctuated with this move h4 it seemed like white had stabilized but it was all an illusion just like the magnus game and thatchkin it takes a one to nothing lead in her match and this is the last game of the day we go back to the open side this was also another game that was crazy like an absolutely absurd back and forth fight this is vivid gujarati the fourth indian remaining in the field of eight versus niger base who's playing from uh from azerbaijan the hometown hero vidit i mean this was a spicy game that was knights dancing all over the board in the opening putting it nice and in the center take take black has a miserable and ugly structure but he's gonna use dynamics he's gonna try to get rid of the pawn he's gonna try to be active with his pawns like this vidit can take on c6 but then queen e7 and bishop b7 and black is firing back so if it doesn't take the pawn for now maybe he's not gonna take it at all knight c4 take take vidit has a slightly better position here from the opening you'll notice black i spent no time 128 on the clock when h6 threatens the pawn between g6 i mean ninja is not even thinking now he plays h5 that's his first time thinking in the entire game and the position finally clarifies after 25 moves we have the following position this is one of the ugliest positions i have ever seen in my life i don't know why anybody anywhere anytime any elo would volunteer themselves for this this is the this is the like the equivalent of getting a root canal at the chessboard okay this is the equivalent of getting a colonoscopy at the chessboard all right this is like a very unpleasant medical exam black has when i say zero that is not an exaggeration black has negative chance of winning this game negative every pawn is frozen white has four pawns on light squares that create an impregnable setup over here black has to say guarding both of these stupid pawns with best play black will make a draw but vidit is going to try and make so many headaches bishop h6 bishop back at some point he's gonna play g4 some point is now five pawns for white on light squares look how amazing his position is black can't infiltrate but i can't move anything all black can do here is sit and wait and vidit is gonna just pose questions at some point he might trade the rooks he might trade the bishops is he winning in one of these end games i don't know here he goes all right it looks like black has you know oh oh oh oh oh oh is it gonna fight have they repeated moves yet no is he gonna play a4 at some point with a trying he's trying is he making any progress all right maybe oh oh oh is the root getting caught maybe not all right oh oh black spawns are on the move black spawns are on the move now it's in a rook end game king e4 oh that it's one upon but here comes counter play material and king safety right now black's king is very active you don't want to trade the rooks here you don't want to trade the rooks king and pawn end game is a loss but somehow white can't make progress because white's extra pawn is over here so it's just stuck despite how absolutely stupid black sponsor and now all the pawns are falling white is going to win a few pawns and try to advance the g pawn but it is close he's close he's so close but black comes back and plays defense and creates counter play of his own and oh now vidit is down upon but he does get in and the players agree to a draw after 109 moves there was like some very limited moments in this game i think early where vidit could have pressed and the computer actually showed a very big advantage but i don't know if it was misunderstanding the fortress like i said black had no chance to win this game vidit pushed forever so vidit and fabi make draws against their respective opponents kukesh and prague now have to win with black or their world cup is over the future of chess will resume tomorrow get out of here
