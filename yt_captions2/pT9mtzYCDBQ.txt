so in today's episode we're going to be talking about the rule of three if you've never heard about this rule before it's really fantastic for interviews it's something that i bring into every single one of my interviews and i have ever since my very first interview and it actually got me my very first internship so i want to talk today about what it is and how you can apply it in your life if you've never been on the show this is tech and turn and our goal is to help you get your next internship if you get any value out of this video please subscribe to hear more content like it and i can't wait to see you again i want to start off with a little story so my very first interview of all time for my very first internship and when i walked in the door you know i shook hands with the guy and sat down and he immediately said to me hey i like to do something a little bit different here what i want to do is reverse the rules here i want you to interview me if that happened to you what would you do you might panic a little bit especially if it's your first interview so you can imagine just how many nerves i had going into that interview and speaking to other people that also did that interview the common thing i heard is people froze and they said uh i don't know um can we can you just interview me like people actually would say that to him and so i was given the job because i immediately asked him questions and i already had three questions ready to go those questions were the rule of three so the rule of three is that you always have three questions going into an interview always three questions now you'll always ask these at the end of the interview you always want to make sure you ask questions at the end of the interview never leave an interview without asking at least one question the rule of three takes a lot of pressure off you because when you go into an interview you have to ask questions at the end of it now usually it's best to ask questions that are specific to the company or specific to that job but sometimes when you're when you're in an interview you get nervous maybe you kind of blank out a little bit in the middle maybe you didn't have time to research the company before you went into the interview so it's really nice to have at least three questions to fall back on as your go-to and these questions are not just random they're not these really generic ones they're actually well crafted questions these questions are going to help you tell the employer something about you so in that interview i asked him the three questions then we flipped the interview back to the other way he started asking me questions again and then while he was speaking i came up with questions about the job as we went and at the end of the interview i asked some more questions now what is a good example of a generic question that might tell the company something about you here's one that i use in all of my interviews and you are welcome to use it so what i say is do you have any opportunities for extended learning such as lunch and learns or hackathons company hackathons this is a fantastic question for two reasons the first being it tells the employer that you want to learn that you're there to learn that you are excited about it and that you want to learn more the second reason is because it gives the interviewer a chance to brag about the company so almost every job in tech is going to have something like this it's really uncommon for some company to not at least have lunch and learns so by asking this question you're giving them the opportunity to tell you more about the company more about what excites them for those two reasons that's a fantastic question now another example of a question might a good generic question you want to bring into every interview to fall back on might be something like why do you still work at the company now every time you go into an interview they'll ask you why did you apply to this job why do you want to work here well if i found if you flip that question around on them they're often very disarmed uh they don't expect that question i actually had a guy before i was interviewing at my fitness pal i almost said my fitness buddy so i was interviewing at myfitnesspal i asked this guy the question and he said uh it's a job it pays the bills so that's a really good example of a question that you know keeps it gets the interviewer off guard a little bit and sometimes they'll expose something about the company that maybe is not so great now i've never worked at myfitnesspal i'm sure it's a fantastic company to work at um but it might say something about how this guy runs his team very specifically now i implore you to come up with one other question kind of like that on your own and then before you go into an interview you should also always come with interview specific questions for that company so that if you're working at microsoft ask something about ask something about you know azure or a microsoft product or how they they do i don't know some process code reviews i don't know something that you think is very specific to a company but these are questions that you can fall back on in the worst case you didn't have time to prepare questions for the interview you forgot what the interview said during the middle because you were so nervous you forgot what the questions were you had for the company specifically you always have those always prepare well but these three questions maybe four questions you can have this rule of three will always be with you and they'll always take the pressure off you because you know that no matter what happens you always have something to fall back on so i really hope you guys enjoy this episode if you got
