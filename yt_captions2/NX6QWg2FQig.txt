ladies and gentlemen it's currently 2024 at the time of me hitting record on this video and for about 20 to 25 years now chess engines have been better than human beings and in particular over the last 10 to 15 years it's it's gotten worse and worse however this industry is ai proof nobody in the chess world is striking outside because ai is posing any sort of existential threat people still want to watch human beings play chess because we suck and it's hilarious but sometimes our top end engines play against each other and every single year there is a thing called t-c or tcec or top chess engine championship where the best engines in the world go to battle and in particular in the final we frequently see stockfish and leela and that is the purpose of today's video i'm going to be showing you and breaking down hopefully in a human and understandable way what happens when two 3600 elo engines play against each other now a quick caveat the computers don't play from the standard position move one and do whatever they want because if they did that they would actually draw probably close to 100% of their games so instead some of you may have heard me say this already some of you may have not they pair openings so they say hey me and you we're going to play the same opening and we're both going to get a game with white and black we're going to see what happens so without further ado i'm going to show you three games which are absolutely fascinating uh and maybe i will make another update it's currently in the middle of the t-c superfinal uh and i'll probably give you an update stockfish generally tends to win the final game of this match was a caroan and an absolutely brutal and an absolutely fascinating one but first e4 now in this very first game uh the bots played an alin's defense alak's defense this one is fascinating because they followed mainline theory they actually followed the most popular way to play the alakin defense and stockfish might have literally refuted the entire opening so allow us to proceed night to f6 pawn to e5 attacking the knight now d4 and now an opening called the four pawns attack one of the most aggressive ways to meet the alakin defense the four pawns attack is also available in the king's indian defense after d4 knight f6 c4 g6 knight c3 bishop g7 i'm not trying to show off my knowledge to you i'm giving you different openings but as you can see here it's like a 3 point4 advantage whereas here in the alak's defense it's nearly double that because black wasted a bunch of time in the opening moving the pie around but what black does in this opening is take target the the center with the knights right white plays bishop 2 e3 white does not play knight f3 because black will pin and immediately develop so bishop b3 black goes here and now and only now that you saw this move you commit your night okay and so this position is where they left the opening book everything up to this point was pre-programmed and then here black played this move bishop g4 because it's actually such a good idea idea to pin this knight that you can spend the second move doing it now i think actually technically here is where they left uh known theory humans have left have entered this position thousands of times i myself have had this position thousands of time no that is no probably about two or three dozen times because i've been i've been playing this with white as well and generally black will take this knight you actually have to take with the pawn because if you take with the bishop you lose the pawn on c4 more on that later uh and speaking of yeah we're all morons compared to this and here leela plays queen d7 so leela is trying to put some pressure on this pawn completely reasonable castles and now humans castle sometimes here rook to d8 now there is a major problem in this position the major problem is i can't move this bishop i can't take back the knight because you're targeting this so what i do here with white is i frequently play a move like b3 black plays bishop b4 bishop b7 right and now i'm like i'm going to go here and then here and then here and then start some sort of attack stockfish plays knight g5 which on this stockfish on the one on my desktop like right now on ch.com it doesn't even understand this move it doesn't get it i mean if you look at it you'll get it obviously the threat is that's the threat however it loses a pawn it loses a pawn you can't do this because of knight takes c4 you can't take the knight because and you can't take the bishop because you get giga mega super omega super forked so stockfish just hung a pawn no i told you more on this later it just goes back it allows the opponent to take a pawn and it backs up and not only does it back up it blocks its own rook and yet this is what former coach of mine polish grandmaster vo miranda he used to call this a time stop i mean he probably still calls it a time stop but back in the day he would call this a time stop might do another lesson for him as part of my recent uh road to gm series this is a position where time freezes and you have this interaction between all the pieces and black can't exploit anything like now i'm threatening to take so you have to take me i take with the queen and you're kicked out now you're kicked out back to your position but if you go back to your position right i'm going to i'm going to attack you down the center line like this so stockfish finds this ridiculously deep idea and instead leela targets the knight knight b6 and now now knowing our opponent is one move away from exhaling we say no thank you we don't worry about the the pawn hanging on d4 losing g7 is much more valuable and this right right here right here against stockfish that one move that's the admission of death that's it you lost you lost i mean this one only thinks it's plus one and it's plus one with black being up a pawn so it's a massive massive positional advantage this is the end of the game now some of you are are like probably mind blown by that because as humans we we have so much work to do here and and just in general in society and the planet um as a human here you might play rook d1 and very quickly your advantage is gone like you get with this move you come back black finds a way to consolidate you don't get any advantage so the engine here now plays queen h5 eyeing this and disallowing h5 i just told you disallowing h5 so these pieces can't get active now we have knight d5 and bit come on look at that i mean that is can't take that's that's a that's a mate right there on f7 so black plays queen e8 and now stockfish just takes and just backs up you can't take on d4 because knight c3 attacks the rook and opens up an attack over here so queen g4 and you just you just basically are making fun of the fact that black will never get the rook in the game and stockfish is so good with this element of time it's just slowly methodically improving its position all for the cost of one pawn it's still a pawn down but black can't back up anymore and here leela decides it doesn't want to repeat the moves it actually just gives up the knight uh the rook for the knight it decides it's better off playing like this now had it gone back to d7 stockfish would have either play d5 and maybe this is a winning breakthrough uh i guess evidently it's not because the evaluation is not spiking uh i i think they would have probably repeated once and then stockfish would have moved forward so it would have played like rook d2 and maybe something over here maybe it would have doubled and instead of that yeah leela decides it's already time to hit the panic button and now watch as seemingly nothing happens but stockfish finds the winning configuration basically leela says this is a draw you cannot break through i'm completely defended nothing in my position is un unprotected except the rook but you can't win it but watch as stockfish just methodically slowly patiently just completely shuts down all the play and then finds a slow series of infiltrations though it infiltrates to b7 okay now it plays queen a6 queen d3 queen c2 it's going to it's going to reinfiltration how is white going to win this position absolutely fascinating stockfish finds the deep dark forest it needs to get its king to e8 how the heck are we going to do that how how's that what how's what we can't teleport we don't have a first cl ticket here's the thing that's the weak base of the pawn chain and the knight can't protect it see if the black knight could somehow hang out somewhere like on the g5 score you can't win because you can't get to the pawn and now stockfish trades and just this is so look at this look at this king walk just just absolutely gangster check boom and what's funny is that this doesn't help ah i got to sneeze allergies are killing me um you can't move black is in what we call aang ridiculous and king h7 uh you actually just take and what funny is you actually it's going to be a promotion too d5 g4 d6 g3 d7 d8 look at that you both made a queen congrats i made you heartbreaking so knight g3 the king makes it all the way to e8 you take and now you pick up the the last pawn and this is a completely winning end game the pawn promotes and uh black resigns um what a game i i was absolutely fascinated by this like just all i mean it just literally chucked upon pawn for nothing all stockfish needed was to make sure the opponent could not castle the second king f8 was played the game was lost because black falls behind so drastically in development that the cost of the pawn is not felt at all now next game by the way leela did not beat stockfish in the alakin they drew so stockfish won that pair now in this game they made the play appears defense which if you ran a simulation of like a million top engine games and let them choose the best moves the move d6 would literally never happen out of a million games now maybe some of you watching this are like inclined to engines and inclin to statistics and you guys know this stuff and you say no the chance is not zero it's higher than zero well it's probably higher than zero if you do all the numbers but if you asked them to play the best moves they would play e5 and c5 and beyond e5 and c5 e6 is a better first move and even c6 like i think the french and the d and d6 are like not comparable so they let them do this now white plays the austrian attack and we get this line bishop d3 very solid very reliable line e5 take take and now the top line according to the engine and the most common move in the database is knight to h5 here putting the knight on the outskirts of the board and then as you can see it's it's a game it's a game now they ask these engines to play knight d 5 which is the second best move and i just found this game very instructive knight d5 is is definitely not what humans would play like most humans i think would put the knight on h5 here because they know the theory so i'm i'm not like i don't love this game because they're kind of deliberately forcing the engine to play bad move whereas in the previous game this is all theory like all of this has been played here they go here and it's a slight you know weakness and white gets this very strong center but it's important to understand humans lose this game half the time like white score in the database here in the human database is like 53% so humans are losing 47% of the time you put engines here engines probably win nine out of 10 games with white and the one game they didn't win i don't know there was an electrical surge so the point is this is very very powerful the engine knows that c5 and f6 are basically black's only attempts at stiring up any trouble so knowing that and knowing that black has to take a step backwards knowing that black has to deal with the center you play h4 cuz this is what engines love to do castling goes out the window out the window all right c5 now c4 the most important thing for a successful attack is a clamped center a center where the opponent cannot break through this is very instructive because the less mobility the opponent has in the center of the board in a chess game the less they can create counterplay when you're isolating your opponent like this pushing them back they can't do too much now bishop f3 is a idea but then i just take with the pawn which is why in this position the stockfish doesn't even stop it just goes for you can't take that b of course i'm going to take it with the rook are you crazy obviously my bishop is a beast and here the top line of the engine by the way is just bishop f4 just sitting and relaxing queen e4 is now going to be made pretty soon so black goes here queen here f5 bring the queen back and look you induced this move so now black cannot fight back black plays e6 first of all you can play d6 but that allows the knight to get back into is just castle rook h1 rook h4 these are the ideas these are this what's flowing right so h5 black plays e6 and i mean bishop g5 first i don't even understand bishop g5 like i don't what i'm playing as a human here i'm going to take i got to open my rook now bishop g5 pawn takes d5 h takes g6 now long castle just every piece every piece is playing open rook bishop f6 is a massive problem bishop h6 is a massive problem now i love again you give stockfish a position like this the accuracy with which it will play this attack is brutal plays bishop to h6 bishop it's down two pawns it's down two pawns where is the attack there is no attack you can't even play queen h2 you know what the best move in this position is you're up you're down two pawns and it's plus. 7 the best move is just play king b1 just get off the checking lines what do you do with black where do you go where do you move now you move knight c6 okay now i regain control of h2 so wherever you move i go here you obviously cannot take on c4 that will only help me so you play bishop to f6 and now i will continue to do things over here bishop to g5 i'm just going to continue to create threats but the question is where's the mate right as a human you go here bishop h6 queen h6 the king runs you give a check trying to get it to escape you know you go here king c7 you take another pawn knight goes back you can even win another pawn attacking the queen but after queen e7 queen e7 rook e7 somehow this is the best you're going to get you want a bunch of pawns back as a human this is a very playable position but stockfish ain't doing none of that but stock stockfish is going to play rook h3 it's just going to improve his position it's just going to improve that's it it's just going to improve so what does it do it plays rook h3 and now with the doubling incoming now leela takes bishop c4 and leela goes for counterplay counterplay trying to create some problems now you play bishop h6 what's the difference the difference is this this area of the board opened up compared to what i showed you right in that position where this is kind of closed in the game all of this now happens queen h6 queen g5 queen d5 difference difference now there is this sequence takes takes and this is a very different simplification of an endgame you take on b5 you brought the king in front of the knight now you take the rook now you have to win this position by the way we are far away from a win in fact a human could lose this end game with white how let's just say something like b4 okay now now suddenly you're under pressure right you play a3 you get h it with a5 you might lose the pawn completely and then if you're not careful and you lose this pawn i mean in a worst case scenario absolut worst case i'm not saying this is going to happen but in an absolute worst case scenario you get something like this you got two pawns rolling down the board i mean it's absolutely possible to lose as a human so rook c1 and now it it i just love watching stockfish end games i mean i love watching stockfish win in attacking games but it paralyzes the opponent's king on the edge of the board right freezes the king completely king a2 slow improvements now it's got to make a breakthrough targets both pawns rook c4 it's targeting everything rook c3 what's the idea what's the where where's the winning idea it's to slowly improve by the way it's giving up the pawn on f4 completely because it wants to infiltrate on d6 that's the winning idea rook d3 rook d4 you just take cd4 king b3 you know why this is winning because the king is gone stockfish wins this endgame by paralyzing the black king along the edge of the board and if the king cannot participate in an end game you lose cuz the rook hunts down the knight in the two pawns on his own like a bond movie and this is exactly what happens in this game leela slowly realizes it's going to have to probably allow the rook infiltration rook d5 rook gets in and leela's like i don't want to trade well if you don't trade you're going to get mated now we take and this is just an easy win i take on f7 i'm going to win the other pawn as well there it is i'm going to win the the pawn and now i don't even i don't even have to wait i'm going to win on the a5 pawn now i'm going to come back for the g pawn my pawn's a passer and uh just incredible just i just like i love it completely froze the king and it makes yeah i'm just wild like absolutely wild i these games are so fascinating like the way it just locks everything down closes the center goes for this attack and then like navigates the complexity of the position waits for the opponent to overextend with b5 leela thought it was just going to lose if the attack came in and by the way like it it was right you know for instance let's say b5 and and rook h1 you know what the what the idea of all this is like you know what the winning idea here is the winning idea is just queen h8 you need backup you needed the second rook so that this was made like that was stock fish's idea so seeing that that was on the way that's why leela changed the position these engines don't really blunder it's all just a mix of evaluating a circumstance in the future and now we got to look at a ridiculous game like they they made them play the carl con and i was fascinated advanced variation right the best it's it's the best according to top engine play because space is very important for computers as we see right dominant space advantage in this game look in the center right dominant space advantage in this game dominant space advantage look at this dominant space advantage all right all of this has been played before all of this castles now here black should already begin to fight back with c5 or h6 to get out of the way of this move so i used to play knight e7 in this position and my idea with knight e7 in this position is like let's say white plays like rookie one i'd like to go here and then i would quickly go for f6 and trade the bishop for the knight which is why the best line here for white is this move knight h4 just saying i want the bishop and humans here for the longest time just retreat cuz they're like you know what i'm solid and as a human this position is completely playable completely and this is where the engines left opening theory now the best move according to deeper analysis is this immediately creating counterplay because otherwise otherwise watch what happens so takes takes computers are out of their prep this is a rock solid position for white and black knight d2 black plays knight f5 look at how high the evaluation already is for for a computer all based on space and two bishops now black tries to trade some pieces makes sense g3 take me i don't want to take you black needs to trade pieces black doesn't have a lot of space right so black is trying to get rid of some pieces so the spatial disadvantage is not failed now bishop b7 why plays a king move just like improving the positioning of the pieces and defending the light squares and leela continues to try to trade pieces the less pieces on the board the less the pressure will be felt when you have a spatial disadvantage c3 bishop c1 rook c1 okay the position surely is better for white because a bit more space but if i turn this off do you know how many of you would lose with white i would lose with white if i played a strong enough player with black you got so long to go black plays queen e7 white plays rook e1 now appar castling short is already losing completely because of h4 and the same kind of h4 in the previous game that we saw this is just game over like you have to you have to generate this and i will just very slowly and methodically prepare h5 not right away i'm not going to do it right away because i i don't want to take with my bishop my bishop's not the one leading the attack so losing you can't do that you're just going to lose apparently which is why leela castle's long which is is why stockfish just says well i'm a principled engine you know i know about attacking on opposite sides king b8 and finally this move c5 comes right finally a dream scenario for black would be to lock the position completely i mean the engine also just wants to win a pawn but let's just say you can't do that and you get this like in a perfect situation everything closes down black can't lose c5 now watch as watch just just how effortlessly stockfish carves up this position it takes on c5 it's splits these pawns now again to me this is obviously better for white but it's pretty farfetched like as a human i want to go c4 okay great that happens yes dc4 rook c4 rook d7 where is the breakthrough well let's go here but what about knight d3 that's what happens rook d1 rook d8 where's the breakthrough how do you do anything in this position first of all black is threatening knight f4 check let's say you go bishop e4 knight f4 check wins the rook now you could have went bishop e2 as well i'm still going to go knight f4 and then i'm going to trade every every piece well you built all this pressure up and black's only method of counterplay was this move c5 you can't play f6 because i'm going to win the pawn on e6 so you knew that that's why black had to go c5 you you created all these problems and now the winning idea is hidden in the position it's hidden the winning idea is bishop takes b7 what well one thing is very simple if you take with the rook what happens is you end up in an end game down a pawn and with king problems for the computer it's plus three but what if king takes if king takes check if you block i take and you're pinned which is why you have to move your king and now i enable rook b4 by sacrificing my rook now you have to sacrifice your queen or you get mated and now again stockfish uses all of its advantages transforms the game into a winning endgame queen versus two rooks is an eternal debate what's better what's better depends on the position and right now because white has so many pawns the more pawns the more powerful the queen the more targets for the queen the less targets for the rooks whereas if you removed all the pawns the rooks would be able to defend everything very well watch as a 3600 elo bot shows you how to play the end game all right it gets in on g7 now it starts creating a pawn imbalance it's got the outside pass pawn ready to go outside pass pawn invaluable asset in the end game rook d2 g4 slow and steady defending its king at all times it's ready to go rook d2 check rook d3 counterplay constantly being created on the pawn king g4 rook d1 back rank problems now the queen sneaks out you don't want to get hit from the other side put the king on f4 rook d4 king e3 patient game rooks are disconnected they got to go back and defend but now queen c5 check now the king is a target now the king is a target and so are both rooks so we get give a couple more checks now we bring out the king again now black has to make a move queen a4 targeting some stuff over there queen e4 targeting stuff on the diagonal now we push now we're two squares away from queening rook a every move the only winning move in this position the only winning move king to e3 why because you cannot take the pawn if you take the pawn queen b4 you're king cannot get off the back rank queen f8 and queen h6 that is what you know how many humans would play king g5 here then rook c1 and i told you the rooks are resilient they're stopping the pawn you can stop rook to g1 but you cannot stop rook to h1 and you lose the pawn this is the only winning move how of course black does not fall for that but now check now queen back to f4 and now the problem is pawn to h7 s and by forcing the king to the corner you still defend the that's so deep and ridiculous queen queen h6 you lose the how can you lose a pawn with a check in an end game the point is this looks like it defends but now the king is activated now the king is in and you get here and it looks like black is going to survive black is not going to survive again because of this tactic now the king runs that way so we give check we keep the king out in the open and now we begin operation number two if rook h7 you give a check on d on b3 and anywhere the king moves you lose a rook if king a7 queen e3 anywhere you move you lose a rook you go king b8 check let's say king here queen c5 from this position stockfish calculates every combination of moves and in every single one of them black loses a rook king to g7 the king has made it now it's just a matter of time the pawns are falling you give up the h pawn for the two passers and we start a new and the problem with bots is they have unlimited energy they're like toddlers queen c7 and that's it you start a brand new phase of the game the engine is not like oh no i lost my h pun nop look at i mean this is look at queen d8 is ridiculous and it wins and this is the and the craziest part is this is all from this opening where it just evaluates that black is much worse it needed you know black needed to play c5 i guess that's the only way to make the advanced carocon tenable at the engine level the advanced carocon is almost an auto win for white which is sickening sickening stuff that's all i have for you today i hope you enjoyed do let me know in the comments uh i will add this to our uh engine playlist here uh ai chess engine uh playlist on u the channel and uh that's all get out of here
