if you're going to get into the adventure world you better feel dialed in what you're doing you know and the last thing you want is for a production company to hire someone who's going to be a liability there's a lot of competition in the sense that a lot of people like the idea of the work and not that many people who are actually willing to put in the work and those are always the people who rise to the top that's that's actually very very fair i think people romanticize the idea of being like an adventure filmmaker but like how willing are you to get out of your tent when it's howling and negative 40 yeah it could be brutal if someone wanted to try and follow in your footsteps right what would you sort of suggest these days oh boy that's a good [music] question documentary film making and adventure tend to go hand inand and getting out into some of the world's most extreme and remote places is honestly one of the biggest perks of the job at at least for me anyways but of all the dps i've met in my career one guy in particular stands out way above the rest it's no exaggeration say that pablo dan is one of the world's very best adventure cinematographers and the fact that he's also a close personal friend and the person who helped me break into the industry myself many years ago is just kind of icing on the cake and don't just take my word for it because some of the biggest names in the business are also saying exactly the same thing and luckily for us all i was able to get pablo to sit down with us between shoots to talk about everything from how he broke into the competitive industry how he found his film making niche and how you can too the importance of networking and how you can stand out in a very crowded market i've honestly never met anyone who's even close to pablo's level when it comes to getting cameras into really extreme places and the fact that he also shoots so much more than just adventure stuff makes him even more impressive so enjoy this rare chance to pick the brain of one of the best in the business cuz pablo doesn't do a ton of interviews and the advice he shares here is pure [music] gold okay so welcome to another industry pro conversation we're super lucky today because we actually have the guy who brought me into the world of production um quite a few years ago now pablo dan if you're into outdoor adventure kind of stuff you might have already heard of him but legitimately one of the hardest if not the hardest working dp i've ever met like i've stop it i i'd like to think that i have done a bunch of rugged stuff but i've watched pablo do things like hang off rock walls and climb down the deepest caves and lead antarctic just next level stuff i'm not joking when i say he's like literally one of the best adventure camera operators sl cinematographers in the world um i'm not going to embarrass him andy's married so i'm not going to embarrass him with too many accomplishments but he's done pretty much all of it and worked with lots of big people like nacho and netflix and jimmy chin and all these names so pablo thank you for coming and it's great to see you it's good to be here lito so before we start talking about uh dp stuff you got into this world in sort of an unusual way like you came in well i don't know if it's unusual i i don't think there's a standard way of getting in or maybe there is i just don't know of it but i always loved photography like it was always fun like i was editor for the school yearbook and you know it was like a hobby you know i learn how to develop my own black and white and uh but i it never occurred to me that you know i could get into this as a profession and then when i was in school in in college in north carolina i got a a scholarship and i took a semester off and biked across china with my sister at that time you know you had to give a presentation and i hated public speaking so i was like can i just do a little video of you know the trip or whatever and so i took this little camera i had no idea what i was doing but i just fell in love with the idea of storytelling and travel i was you know was determined to try to see if i could make that into a career um i was lucky enough to get an internship with national geographic which is kind of what got my foot in the door met a lot of really amazing people from there i yeah moved to dc i i got offered a job as an associate producer and i worked in the office for about 6 months but i knew i wanted to be um you know a filmmaker a camera person and so i quit and spent my money life savings on a camera and kind of went on from there just taking jobs as as pa ac i was fortunate enough you know during my internship i met this husband and wife couple uh sean fine and andre andx fine and to this day i think are still some of the best documentary storytellers out there and i was determined to to work with them sean who at the time was working on a few documentaries he he would always just go as you know dp and sound person so really the only way i could work with him was to be a sound person so i actually taught myself audio and convinced him to to let me work with him and it not only gave me you know the confidence to work by myself cuz when i'm on expeditions i don't necessarily have the the luxury of a sound operator but it was also kind of just like my master class as an audio operator i got to work with all these great dps and it was a really good learning experience you know i wasn't impatient of like oh i just want to be a dp you know i knew that was kind of what i wanted as an end result but enjoying the process i think is really important i mean it is i think that's a great thing to hear cuz it is such a long process anyone who thinks they're going to shortcut it and do it really quickly is sort of setting them up for setting themselves up for disappointment so after that you finished school you finished the internship and you you you busted your ass in that program and then what was the transition like from there into starting to become like an air quotes pro like how did you start getting paid how did your career build off that i mean a lot of it was through you know the the connections that i had built in national geographic and i i soon realized that it's it's important to n cultivate relationships and you know leave jobs in good standing um you know you do one job and someone will recommend you to something else and i think it was important to also find ways to make yourself you know stand out from other people you know like i i speak three languages so that was a huge benefit you know i got jobs in you know in africa and south america um so i spoke spanish and french um you know i was a climber you know and that got me into this you know this project that then led to you know all this adventure you could be super capable as an athlete but are you a good storyteller and i think focusing on other stories where you know you don't rely on action and excitement to keep an audience entertained where you're relying on storytelling to keep them entertained i think that's that's critical to then you know take that and and push it into the adventure world and you know and ask yourself well how can i tell a good story beyond just shooting pretty images i think that's super important cuz the pretty images are getting so easy you know with the gear is getting so good that slow beautiful slow-mo doesn't mean much anymore right there's got to be that story with it at its core there's no luck in getting to where you are now like there were some lucky encounters but like i mean i've seen lots of people and i've talked to lot like i know lots of people in this community and everyone has something similar where luck comes to the people who are in a position to take advantage of it right like you worked so hard and i think that's maybe one of the big takeaways from your career and and and mine for people trying to emulate it is that there is no you don't there's no like rule book you can't say do this and then this and then this and it will work but if you make your own stuff open yourself up to meeting as many people as you can and work really hard for a long period of time you've got a pretty good you've got as good of a shot as you can as you can make for yourself and i mean if you're going to get into the adventure world like you better feel dialed in what you're doing you know and the last thing you want is for a production company to hire someone who's going to be a liability or you know for the talent to be waiting on you um i mean if you really want to get into the adventure world like you you know you also have to train you have to get your body in a in a physical condition where where you can keep up or be faster than the people that you're working with and it's just attitude i mean i don't think anyone wants to hire an [ __ ] um so just be be nice yeah don't uh if yeah there's no room for like toxic energy anywhere there and is one of the most important things i think that people you know you can be a workaholic but if people don't want to be around you you're not going to you're not going to get called back how do you see the general shape of the market then these days in general like do you do you think there's more opportunities for young people to get into this stuff is it getting more competitive what have you sort of well it's definitely competitive i mean it's it's way easier to to be a filmmaker i mean you can make a film with your iphone um but i also think there's a lot more opportunity like there's a lot more like there's a lot more content being produced um there's a lot more opportunity for viewing like all these streaming services all these different platforms um i mean it's sometimes overwhelming how many different platforms there are but there's a lot of content being being shot there's a lot of uh companies now that are leaning on you know branded content you know doing you know documentaries um so i think there's definitely way more opportunity but there's als i i also feel like there's probably a lot more competition too yeah i think that's accurate i think a lot of people i think that i think the one thing i've noticed though is that there's a lot of competition in the sense that a lot of people like the idea of the work and not that many people who are actually willing to put in the work and those are always the people who rise to the top that's that's actually very very fair i think people romanticize the idea of being like an adventure filmmaker but like how willing are you to you know get out of your tent when it's howling and -40 and you know get out to maybe just get one shot but that's you know an important shot to get and um yeah it could be brutal if you if everything went away overnight for some reason and suddenly your pablo fresh out of film school knowing what you know now but none of the contacts and none of the resume what would be your sort of of playbook what would you do to start working your way back up to where you are i mean find find a way to make yourself stand out you know experiment i' maybe go to my local you know whichever local business you know do maybe do a little little promo piece for them you know and actually start filming start getting something some content out there um i'd probably reach out to people and not just reach out to people but actually you know if there's a particular person that i gravitate towards in terms of the type of work they do or the style of filming that they do and i want to learn more from them like take the time to actually watch their films take the time to analyze and like when you write someone not just write to them saying oh hey i want to be a filmmaker you know can i be your assistant you know show them that you've put in the time and that you actually have a genuine interest you know why is it that you want to work with this person you know watch their films and and you know figure out how to stand out i guess that's one of the first things i mean it's inv i mean it's so true though like the the i get a lot of emails and i'm guessing you do too that people say i want to do this and i want you to help me but i haven't done anything you know i haven't actually started the process myself compare that to someone who comes in and says here are four projects that i shot on my own in my community that are in the style that i want to be working in and i've watched your last three projects and based on that i i rage about networking all the time but what you're saying is so true like there's a difference between just dming someone and saying help me out and actually taking the time to show them that you want to learn from them i mean like your origin story right sean you were like i want to work with you i don't need anybody unless you'll do sound like okay well i will learn sound then let's let's let's switch topics here for a sec cuz neither of us are overly technical dps um but what are you shooting with these days we both like toys but we're not super technical but we both like little they're not toys luke they're instruments surgical surgical instruments they're surgical expensive instruments so what do you what do you what's your sort of main your standard setup look like these days what are you using uh i just upgraded to the barano and and i have the fx6 so i usually like to have two bodies um you know most of the time you have some you know two camera interviews or you know i'll have the fx6 set up either on a gimbal or you know really really small handheld that i can just pick up and run um and then the barano would be more for kind of like verit shoulder work um i've got my drones even smaller i've got the the r5 canon um which is great in situations where maybe you need to do stills and video at the same time um but i mean that's kind of my video setup you know i have a gopro but i try not to to use it um but there's a time and a place for it so your your setups can vary a lot depending on the environment and how much weight you're allowed to bring and stuff but like what about lenses and lights and stuff like that how much stuff comes out with you on a normal load out let's say not an extreme expedition but what are you what are you generally trying to get out with you've got two cameras and what about all the other stuff what do you how are you setting them up um i mean i guess it just depends on the project depends on the style i mean i could go on a project and just shoot on prime lenses um or what do you have for what do you use for that you've got you've got those leas right yeah i've got these old rehoused uh leica rs they're old from the'80s um you know they're really nice with sunflare they're definitely a look uh but i really like them and i just like that they're small like i could fit all six in my backpack and you know which is important for me um you know so you know if i bring i probably always have like one or two primes no matter what um either for interviews or you know for low light scenarios um so like a 35 and an 80 is always a nice prime to have if you're just going to have one or two um and then it just depends on the production you know you have just the regular canon 24 to 105 i mean if i were just to have one lens i mean that's a just a great workhorse uh but if you're at a higher end type of documentary i've got the fujin on cabrio the 19 to 90 which i think is a great verite uh lens um it's a little heavier but um but it's you know you could you could shoot on that lens all day do you find yourself mostly going to zooms then and then primes are for more spefic specific cases like are zooms mostly on your camera i know i mean if you're shooting if you're by yourself yes you know if it's a two camera shoot you can get away with you know shooting on primes um if that's the look that you want um it just depends on yeah it just depends on who your sub what the subject is you know with the directorial style um and i i totally agree but what why why why do you say zooms when you're by yourself we do the same thing i'm just why why i guess it just depends like if if if you're in a space and you have a limited amount of time and you're trying to cover something like so what i enjoy shooting most is is ver but i feel like that word gets thrown out a lot but in the true sense of veritate it's it's basically filming something that's happening that will not repeat itself um and your job is to capture it but you know capture it beautifully yeah amazing uh what's up next for pablo what what do you have going on what's coming up what's in your future what your hes and dreams secret it's a secret luke you got uh you've got your movie in film festivals right yeah i've got my film um we're kind of nearing the the year year long film festival uh circuit and hopefully get that get it distributed and out to the world um working on a few other you know documentaries with with a few different uh directors um but yeah also quality of life you know doing some home projects still finding that balance um but yeah cool man where where where do you where can people find you or you're mostly on instagram right if if there's any social media presence yeah i'd say instagram is probably the you famously had like the most basic website ever for the longest time still have the same the same website i think i still have the same we i i actually just added a few things last night cuz you reminded me and i was like huh i haven't updated it in like a year i feel like recommendations hold a lot of weight you know in the community i mean for me like if i get offered a job that i can't do i will always recommend a colleague of mine you know and it'll go both ways you know if they can't do something you know they'll they'll recommend me you know i think rec yeah but getting to that point where you could recommend people that's that's the tough part yeah that's the tough part yeah it's true working hard for someone else and having them suggest you is how most jobs go and you know people are not so much stumbling upon uh you know they're not googling for their next dp they're like does this person i trust can they do it if no who do they who do they think's up to it so it's sort of your reputation is everything cool pablo well it's lovely to connect with you it's always good to talk uh we probably don't do it enough because we're both super busy but um yeah i appreciate you taking the time to to share all that with everybody i think it's going to be super helpful thanks luke and it's it's it's been exciting and fun seeing your growth and everything that you're doing and yeah i'm pych that you're doing this channel i think it's really helpful um i mean it's definitely a tool that i i wish i had uh when i was getting started so so good for you yeah me too that's why that's where the idea came from it's like what do i wish i had i wanted to hear people tell me what to do anyways uh great to talk and thanks for everything pablo we'll see you soon bye luke bye bye so i hope you found that as interesting as i did because there really aren't that many dps out there who even come close to what pablo does and that was just a short excerpt from a much larger conversation
