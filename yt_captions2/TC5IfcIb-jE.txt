imagine if the world's biggest manufacturer of chips just shut down and i'm not talking fredo i mean tsmc the massive company based out of taiwan that produces around 90% of the world's leading edge computer chips recently earthquakes that shook taiwan as well as tensions with neighboring china have led people around the world to be concerned about what would happen if tsmc suddenly couldn't make chips anymore so exactly how would the planet fair with the sudden loss of one of its most important companies before we answer we'd like to thank our friend dr ian cutus for helping us out with this video when you're done watching go check out his website more than more and his youtube channel tech tech potato first let's talk about natural disasters taiwan is located squarely within the infamous pacific ring of fire meaning earthquakes are a concern tsmc along with other fabs is generally quite well protected against vibrations that can disturb the delicate machinery needed to produce chips between anchors that dampen the effects of earth earthquakes and floating piles that allow buildings to be supported by more stable soil deep underground tsmc can and does get back up and running even after significant earthquakes within a matter of hours good thing too considering 1 hour of downtime could cost the company millions of dollars but earthquakes are one thing human caused problems like war are another so let's say tsmc was wiped out due to some kind of military confrontation what then well do you remember the graphics card shortage from a few years back it would be like that except much worse a big part of the reason for this is not just because tsmc makes so many chips but because they produce tons of leading edge chips basically these are chips that have smaller transistors than other chips allowing them to be higher performance and much more power efficient think current gen cpus and computers or the s so's that power flagship smartphones but it isn't just higher end chips that would suffer a big time supply shortage of the roughly 12 million 12in wafers that tsmc produces yearly about 95 million of those are on older nodes for cheaper chips for applications that don't need the highest performance in a smartphone for example about 70% of the silicon inside is on these older nodes this means there would be shortages of everything resulting not only in higher prices say on cars for example but also a ras to the bottom what we mean is you'd start seeing pcs and phones being made with the fewest number of chips possible meaning more basic functionality lower resolutions and refresh rates older versions of wi-fi and less responsive performance in general from most devices on the market would likely be the order of the day if you don't want to deal with this extreme version of paying more for less you'd have to hope your current devices are high-end enough to last until tsmc could get back up and running but how would the world try to recover in the meantime we'll tell you right after we thank odu for sponsoring today's video to car for your your own space in the digital world without a website is madness with odu you can design and get your very

website with odo of course if tsmc went away there are are other chip fabs that would try to fill the void but they don't have the capacity that tsmc does especially for leading edge products much more strain would be put on firms like intel global foundaries and lesser known companies like tower semiconductor along with other companies like tokyo electron and asm which make equipment important for chipm that they then sell to fabs all this pressure means that there wouldn't be a whole lot of innovation for a while you know how intel does that thing where every year they talk about how their upcoming chip lineup is faster consumes less power well instead of that all their efforts would be going into just cranking out as many chips as possible on existing process nodes so it would be very difficult to upgrade even if you had the cash the problem would be exacerbated even further as some companies amd being one of them are very reliant on tsmc to produce their chips to the point where their designs assume they'll have access to tsmc manufacturing this means upcoming designs would instead get abandoned for the time being and amd would have to try and adapt anything still in development for foundries like samsung or even intel ironic if you know computing history this kind of situation would probably last for 6 years or so until tsmc could be rebuilt and in the meantime there would be obvious geopolitical consequences as tsmc is a crucial source of chips for nato member states and nato alligned countries maintaining a sufficient chip supply would suddenly become a major national security issue for those nations meaning you might see nationalization or at least closer government direction over chip fabs within some country's borders of course the assumption is that the most likely way this would happen is due to a chinese attack on taiwan but there's a high possibility that such an attack would result in the most costly war in human history and that china would be cut off from nearly all global financial markets as a result so do we really have to worry about tsmc going up in flames tomorrow most likely not but no one would blame you if you squirreled away a latest gen high performance ultra book fresh in the box to go in your doomsday stockpile of canned lima beans thanks for watching guys if you like this video you might like the one where we covered this dude who built his own graphics card at home very cool
