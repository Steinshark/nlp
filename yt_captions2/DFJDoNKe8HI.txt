ladies and gentlemen there is a new strongest chess bot in the world and in this video i am going to test drive it for all of you and that bot is stockfish stockfish has historically dominated all other chess computers in head-to-head matches and tournaments and whatever it might be and the most recently released version is 15. but in this video 16 is released and i paired it against stockfish 15. you see normally uh bots they play against other bots they don't really play previous versions of themselves but the previous version of stockfish is the best computer in the world so i paired 16 with 15 and i'm going to show you some games that they played oh and at the end there is a plot twist like you would never believe so i was quite disturbed by what i saw in the end of this video uh and uh stockfish 16 is actually currently estimated to have a 50 point elo advantage over stockfish 50. so nobody really knows the exact estimate it's like 3 600 3700 stockfish 16 is 47 points higher rated uh in early testing versus its uh its former counterpart um now the way i made these uh to play each other uh shout out to matia who's a fantastic developer who works on um my courses website chesley uh pair these together and we gave them a limited amount of time to make a move so without further ado the first game is a karo khan defense um you try to get these bots to play different openings against each other because if they could they would just play you know e4 e5 and try to draw every single game um so the first game is an advanced carl khan with pawn to e5 stockfish 15 opts for bishop f5 which is one of the main lines of course obviously there's also c5 uh everything else is not great so bishop f5 trying to develop the bishop now white has many setups white can play the tall the short the whatever that is um bishop b2 is played first i don't really think there's much difference and now black has many options black can play the maneuvering variation or h6 or whatever black plays c5 c5 is a very very direct solution to the problems uh and and and these bots like to play very like crazy otherworldly level chess uh and here normally black is taking or black is playing some knight e7 or something along these lines but uh yeah stockfish 15 plays queen b6 which is a very very aggressive move and the idea of queen to b6 is very straightforward basically you just want to take the pawn here and it's actually not great for white to defend because white is going to lose sight of the center it's also not good for a white to go here because white is going to weaken the dark squares so instead of that what white historically has done is just go here and just let the pawn be captured queen takes b2 now queen b2 can lead to some problems for black and sometimes black would rather play a6 and just wait a little bit so nothing can get to b5 but slakovich 15 is like i don't care you're an idiot you have no idea what you're doing you lost the pawn on b2 so stockfish 16 now can play knight to b5 but it would need a little bit of time to work this out this is the entire idea of queen b2 it's to play knight b5 and after something like this white goes queen c1 and the bishop is hanging in knight c7 as possible but if you rush with knight to c7 check then after this this in a ridiculous turn of events black is a full rook down but this knight is completely trapped and after something like knight c6 actually black is fine so this is a really absurd line where black completely survives the opening despite being a rook down but the engine doesn't know any of this and there's other ways for white to play and instead it plays queen b1 queen to be it loses a knight and it also is losing this because queen b7 is possible and then if you obviously sacrifice the queen it's not very good then you play c4 white is just the queen up so queen to b1 played by stockfish 16 take take and now white is going to infiltrate there and there and that is exactly what happens as stockfish 16 completely reverses the course of events knight b5 is a fork threat the king has to slide over to cover and the knight wanders into the d6 square volunteering itself for a capture and this is the position so stockfish 16 stockfish 15 stockfish15 on chess.com giving the blessing to stock for 16's play uh rook wants to go here you want to go here you want to take the pawn you want to play knight e5 knight g5 it's a very nice position but black is still defending white now plays rook to b7 and black here plays a6 which is a move like doesn't look like it makes much sense but it's stopping bishop to b5 i smudged my glasses in the beginning of this video like i don't know if you noticed i took my glasses off and i smudged them so badly so just bear with me because my head is hurting like i thought i was just gonna power through if i can i'm just gonna keep going because i don't believe in video editing um but uh yeah that's actually quite annoying but oh seems to have fixed it a little bit knight to g5 threatening this uh and the stockfish 16 is infiltrating from multiple sites bishop to d3 trying to remove the bishop so knight f7 is possible black plays knight h6 and it's a desperate defending for stockfish 15. but these pawns could still go forward you could still trade the rook off this one pawn i mean stockfish 16 has planted it firmly in front of stockfish 15's territory and it's very difficult now look at this oh this is g4 is is a is a is a brutal move g4 i mean g4 is crazy the idea of g4 is to restrict this knight from moving and it can't take on g4 because it would stop defending this so i would take and play knight f7 it's it's quite ridiculous actually pawn to g4 is such a disrespectful move like you can't take the pawn rook b8 rook a7 rook b6 obviously white did not want a trade of rooks now black is going for the pawn on d6 and stockfish 16 castles because it understands it needs to get the rook into the game if rook d6 there's for k8 and obviously rook b1 in the future so bishop d3 now the king is ready to walk over um they repeat moves one time um and then uh the repeat moves a second time like this uh and then and then white brings the uh the rook to c1 so we almost had a thread of a draw there but no draw stockfish 16 not in the mood for a draw loses its pawn and actually if we just go back a moment we go back to this position black has been upon up this whole game has it felt like it yeah i will remind you in the opening black took a pawn did you remember that and then the rest of this game was just sort of spent moving around stockfish 16 is just happily vibing and uh and upon down in fact why there's two pawns down stock switch 16 is down two pawns in this position but it's not even worse why activity just activity and restriction of enemy movement this pawn on g4 is so crude it is standing there completely hanging and you can't even take it and if you play rook f8 to try to go here i'm gonna go here and guess what we have the exact same position but i am up upon now also there is rook a8 but we're just gonna you know power through that um so rookie eight giving up the pawn on h7 and now stockfish is like nope open file i don't need the pawn d4 well d4 does attack my bishop but you know what it gives up knight to e4 rook b6 we trade but i've got this i've got this i've got this so many weaknesses bishop g5 check very important move inducing and seducing the pawn forward to f6 now we take and now my friends it's time for the cleanup stockfish 16 has four targets it was down two pawns and it's gonna get four back it's pretty nice roi one one two two pawns have been returned three were just eating we're feasting and now we are in a better rook and night end game g5 played to weaken the structure knight takes f6 knight back to b3 and it's four pawns versus three but this is a winning end game for white because you have a pass pawn that's it and these pawns are weak you have a pass pawn and it's just a matter of time can stockfish 16 convert the game kicks the night out pressuring rerouting to the center looking like black is defending but it's very difficult because of that h pawn that is the major difference in this game a5 restricting this pawn from moving we win it back four pawns have been won back four black might be able to win a pawn back but it's too little too late too many pawns down and black loses every pawn white goes from two pawns down to three pawns up there is a five point turnaround and yes you lose the pawn on a5 but it's just too much the king the pawns advance whites king joins the battle the black king restricted on the back rank and it's just a matter of time until we're going to promote and there it is and obviously the game ends successfully stockfish 16 manages to win up a queen delivering checkmate in 93 moves what a game an iconic moment in this game was like right here where black is just up two clean pawns but completely restricted on the back rank with multiple weaknesses and the second they try to fight back stockfish 16 is like get out of here that was a good slap god damn that was a good one wow that was a loud slap let me try wow that was i'm not gonna go for three three two two was good enough i almost went deaf wow uh and they win stockfish wins game number two i have for you this one's a sicilian defense uh and stockfish 16 goes for an open sicilian we have what's called a dragon with g6 uh white plays f3 queen d2 and we have opposite side castling kind of a vintage dragon where white is going to play for g4 h4 unless black plays d5 d5 is a very sharp line uh it's just trying to trade everything and go to a slightly worse end game there are many lines here including lines like queen to e1 which have been played at the top level uh but stockfish 16 takes knight takes knight takes pawn takes and the essentially the idea is like if you do this black goes queen c7 and you can't actually take this because that's mate that's a queen the position is equal um so white plays bishop d4 this has actually all been played at the top level and black plays e5 kicking out the bishop the bishop goes and attacks the rook and black sacrifices the rook on f8 and this is essentially black's idea bishop f8 queen f8 bring the queen bring the rook bring the bishops bring the bishops slaughter whites queen side now stockfish 16 is not uh masochist it does it's actually not into that stuff so it plays knight e4 which is the best move and other ideas include the move c uh c4 and so on so black plays rookie 8 and now stockfish plays h4 there we go stockfish plays h4 trying to play h5 slackfish's side fish plays h5 preventing stockfish from playing h4 tremendous bishop c4 visually a very very neat position for white everything is nice and tense black plays knight f4 looking to trade queens and potentially bishops white trades bishops but doesn't trade queens and volunteers the bishop for capture because if you take this the queen is hanging and a move later after queen b8 i will still happily allow you to take my bishop because queen c5 is a better position for white why weak weak weak and uh white has kind of neutralized black's typical dragon play queen to b5 black's still looking for that dragon play but it's actually stockfish 16 who is pushing pawns in front of its king you're not supposed to push pawns in front of your king that's what we're taught but it plays rook d7 this active queen active active of active g4 on the way at any given moment black drives the knight into d4 but a very nice move now from stockfish 16 as its sacrifices one takes d4 and that's it pawn takes bishop takes rook takes d7 bishop takes g7 stockfish sacrifices two rooks it's not quite two rooks because knight f6 is coming so stockfish gives up both of its rooks for a bishop and a knight knowing that the weaknesses of black's king are too immense and frankly probably refuting the dragon completely at top level like the dragon sicilian at bot level is just not feasible so the machine slowly neutralizes everything the dragon has to offer then completely embarrasses it by giving up all of its pieces for two rooks bishop back to h6 and it takes the pawn ultimately stock pushes up two pawns and two pieces for two rooks right king h7 knight g5 check it sacrifices the bishop queen d4 because you can't actually take the knight because queen d5 and this is just a you're just losing it's just a losing queen end game so the bot goes here knight back to e5 f4 and stockfish 16 just has a horse and three pawns for the rook an absolutely clinical execution as it just completely and totally neutralize the dragon the dragon's entire purpose is to have a little bit of anti-positional play but drill down on the queen side over here it got nowhere it got absolutely nowhere black had zero chances in this game and my friends it's just a matter of technique stockfish 16 advances all of its pieces nearly all of its pieces are on dark squares the knight look at that gonna go back to the center every piece in white's position is on a dark square excluding this pawn and it's a slow methodical process targeting the weaknesses you play f5 to split these pawns you sacrifice the pawn because you have queen g5 first of all hitting the rook but second of all you're splitting both the pawns so both those pawns are going to be much more liable so queen to d6 queen e8 knight e4 is a fork allowing this but it doesn't matter king back to c1 the rook is hanging f6 is on the way black has to lose the rook and black is down simply too much material the checks continue it's just a matter of time until you escape stockfish has a sense of humor and it just takes everything away from its counterpart and that's it we can auto play the rest of the game advancing pushing the pawn to h7 a square away from queening winning the final pawn securing the promotion square now it's just about getting out of checks there are no more checks after knight g5 queen c7 and you queen you lose your queen and you don't even win the queen back you go straight for mate and stockfish defeat stockfish in a dragon sicilian now the next game that they played was a scandinavian i wanted to see how bad the scandinavian defense was at engine level it wasn't that it's bad but it's just fascinating to see how giving a bot the tiniest amount of play results in it winning the game also for some reason my i plugged in my phone to charge like 30 minutes ago and then i just disconnected it and i forgot all right pawn takes queen takes thank you queen a5 this has all been seen before the critical way to attack the scandinavian is to play 95 bishop c4 and g4 so when knight e5 is played you have knight c4 ideas so the queen actually needs to make a getaway like i've had people blunder this against me and then knight c4 is extremely unpleasant you might lose your queen so you have to be super super careful um however this move allows the queen to get back but now there is g4 and there's a very historic and famous game visions that went like this uh essentially white tries to track down the bishop and trap it black goes here white takes the knight plaque takes and then dances the bishop to d5 and in the past there has been rook h3 played in this position f3 played in this position um this is a very interesting move but castles is played by stockfish and we have the following position this is a very obscure line where for some reason white has an advantage at engine level but i never really understood how it's possible because white has pushed all these pawns but basically because white has the two bishops and black's knight is kind of restricted with moves like g5 why is it just better so queen v6 c3 uh this pawn you can't take because rook b1 rook b7 queen f3 checkmate sometimes in the future black plays g6 to try to attack over here and stockfish is just like oh that's cute a4 and if you take shiva it's not gh this allows counter play on the king this is very bad rook g8 king h1 is too dangerous queen d8 queen h4 is nearly made so you've got to find a way to block it like this and you're gonna lose so you're actually very close to losing here but the idea is that if this g5 keeps it all closed if h6 i go here so stockfish plays bishop c7 to try to go here and then mate and white goes king g2 so that if this i can play f4 or rook h1 a6 a5 rook h1 and stockfish has now restricted the queen side as well with its pawn plate black plays e5 trying to open up the center white now takes on g6 understanding black can't take back and now white plays one of the most ridiculous otherworldly engine moves i have ever seen in this position stockfish 16 played the move bishop h6 now if i asked you what is the idea of that move you would say easy bishop g7 and rook takes pawn and i would say that makes sense for a human but it's not the right idea because then e4 and i open up the bishop and i hit your bishop and i've got attacking possibilities so what on earth is the idea of bishop 2h6 the idea of bishop to h6 is to prevent black from ever playing h5 and prevent black from ever getting a rook to f8 here bishop h6 for instance like let's say white went here and black castled there's h5 the point is you can actually open up an attack on the king if you open up the side of the board bishop h6 blocks the pawn physically and covers the f8 square it is a ridiculous move and now white goes here and now white is able to launch an attack without worrying about h5 or a rook coming to f8 this move neuters the black attack completely and it looks like white can't actually build up anything because black has good defense no c4 white can build something up because after this you open up the queen to yourself but just here and if e3 bishop f3 so c4 opening up the position queen c2 and sensing the danger black decides it's time to sacrifice the rook for defensive purposes because if black had just tried to sit back and play something like king b8 white would play take and you would lose this in the end game or white could play rook c1 and just build up a bigger attack and blacks just never fast enough black just never fast enough rook f8 take take this is now possible and the attack is here but queen c4 and there's nothing do you know what queen c3 stopped various queen g3s for instance you could play rook b1 here but then e3 and queen g3 is literally mate you lose so you've got to be very careful here queen c3 there's h5 but now i'm too fast and the second black gets any momentum i trade your queen the queen is the most powerful attacking piece in chess so this is the way you stop an attack in chess that's how you do it king b8 queen d6 and pawn to b5 the attack continues but we're transitioning into an end game we use the threat of an attack in chess to now simplify the game down to an end game where you are winning knight to g4 rook h5 and it looks very dangerous for stockfish 16. look at these pieces walking in e3 bishop e3 rook f2 knight either how many of you would hang a mate here bishop c6 there is nothing there is absolutely nothing knight f2 check stockfish 16 walks into a discovered attack because there's nothing bishop d4 rook b7 and now witness as stockfish 16. marches its king to the other side of the board to safety never losing its advantage discover check the king goes up side check the king goes up front check the king goes up rook g3 the king goes up rook g3 the king runs to f7 and the king has made it there are no more checks knight to d3 and the craziest part is the the king actually rejoins the party on e6 and it's just a matter of technique as white's a pawn is going to march down and it's not guardable rook a3 bishop b4 you lose the knight you're gonna lose the game in a moment white's king continues to dance bishop e4 pe6 the pawns have fallen the pieces have fallen checkmate in a few moves on a7 what a game and perhaps the most absurd moment in this game came from a bishop move that just doesn't look like even human well that's because it's not but now i told you that there was a plot twist at the end of this video here it is i wanted to show a game that stockfish 16 could win with black because engines very rarely win with black with white and chess you can stall you can make draws engines very rarely give up advantages uh with the with the white pieces so i force stockfish the best chess engine in the world to play stockfish the best chest engine in the world and play a king's gambit which is a flawed opening for white it's not losing but it's a flawed opening and stockfish played bishop c4 allowing queen h4 and the loss of castling rights this is the size of the advantage that stockfish 16 was working with it played d5 giving back a pawn but forcing a move out of white and now catching up in development knight f3 bishop d5 and now knight to e7 and d4 stockfish 15 gives up a pawn as well take take stockfish 16 says no thank you i want a castle fascinating stuff here as neither engine wants to win any material and white's king can't castle but the pieces are getting pushed back but instead of taking this and giving the initiative back to black stockfish 15 defends the center it def it develops its pieces and it holds a big center stockfish 16 tries to fight back with the move b6 stockfish 15 plays c6 taking space restricting the pieces and once knight b5 knight c7 for the end game but now bishop d6 king f2 and now the knight tries to get up from the edge of the board but a3 stockfish 15 has built a cage the knight can't actually get out this is insane stockfish 16 is basically playing without a knight bishop f5 b4 it's a full lockdown cage that's it stockfish 16 could play rookie 8 and attack over here but it's playing the entire game without a knight g5 that's what it's trying to do desperate times call for desperate measures it already understands that the situation could be very dire h3 f6 it builds up a brick wall on that side of the board but rook a2 is going to rotate over look at this the other stockfish is correctly trading the pieces because it understands this knight is dead it sees the future it's like wait a minute that's my older brother and it's been beating me up but it made a mistake queen f7 now queen a4 oh my goodness knight v8 back the pawns are under fire in the center of the board you can win the a7 pawn but it's more important to keep the cage closed bishop to d3 now the knight drops back looking for the light squares the queen goes back to d1 because there's no way out for the night black's just playing down a piece a6 white trades another pair of rooks because black is losing in every end game king g7 knight e4 bishop f8 back pawn to g3 takes takes take take what is going on five queen e5 in g6 oh my goodness king f2 bishop g7 what's happening white has infiltrated but black is going back h6 h4 but the brick wall is still here the brick wallace the great wall of stockfish it's disallowing stockfish 16 from ever moving its knight finally black plays b5 but b5 that's it you are never going to move anything on that side of the board king f1 king g7 i queen h3 and now it's just a matter of time a4 this is a massive decision opening up the cage releasing the cage this should be four take take knight takes b5 and now stockfish has come to collect knight c6 sacrificing material because if you take the knight i have this this this i've broken out of the cage at the right moment and now i'm threatening a draw but stockfish 15 planned all this out it doesn't take the night knight knight c7 the bishop hangs the knight hangs 98 is a fork winning a queen unbelievable bishop d2 98 check king to f7 take take take and if you take my knight my pawn sneaks through insanity utter insanity bishop to f4 knight to d5 the pawn has made it through and stockfish 15 is up a piece and has a passing pawn and that's it my friends f4 king d3 there was a brief moment there that one of the stockfishes claimed it was a draw it was never a draw night back to b5 knight gives a check and the pawns made it this far but that was it as the white d-pawn advances the knight stops everything d6 e6 king e6 and the craziest thing is if you do something like this i can go d7 and i can just wait i can wait you will bring me all of your pawns and now you have to get out and i win f1 queen that's exactly what happens and in a ridiculous turn of events stockfish 15 has actually stood up to its older sibling stockfish 16 in an unprecedented victory with the white uh with the white pieces again giving a big handicap in the form of a king's gambit but it gets the job done that's crazy that is actually wild but it wins the game and um that's where we will end this video now it would be more impressive if maybe stock for 16 if stalkers 15 won with black but what an idea in this game to build this brick wall and completely disallow this knife from coming out i mean sensational stuff wow um that's all i have for you stockfish 16 47 points higher rated than stock fish 15 but not a fully perfect machine obviously the bots were given a very limited amount of time to make their moves i think in a classical format some of these mistakes wouldn't happen but i'm not going to sit around waiting for eight hours for a game to finish so hope this video was enjoyable and uh if you're watching this on your stockfish dev and you're like very technically trained please understand i'm trying to break this down to a more general audience they might be cringing at some of this stuff going this is not exactly fully how you would do this but anyway i will see you in the next video get out of here
