amd played you all for suckers played us all for suckers really i mean look at this they are releasing basically the same ryzen 7000 cpus but for way cheaper not only that but they run way cooler and they draw way less power i wouldn't blame you for feeling pretty bad right now but don't feel bad this is exactly the kind of sucker punch that we've gotta love because it means the whole market is moving in a less costly direction and it means that amd is putting heavy pressure on intel in a way that we wish they would do to nvidia i mean it's a good thing same-ish cpus lower price which i mean there's got to be more to this right what are we giving up in exchange and is it worth the buyer's remorse that i know some of you are feeling right now let's find out right after i give you buyer's remorse for not checking out our sponsor build redux build redux makes it easy to configure your new build with support guides to help along the way they also offer competitive pricing as compared to building a pc yourself head to build redocx.com linus and start your new build today oh [music] where the x labeled ryzen 7000 chips enjoyed tdp ratings of 170 and 105 watts taking the x away leaves us with essentially the same cpus with the same core specs but at lower base clock speeds slightly lower boost clock speeds and a friendly 65 watt tdp with a stock socket power of just 88 watts the cache thread counts and most importantly overclocking support are all identical and the accompanying 600 series platform keeps all of its capabilities no matter which cpu you plug into it you're still getting tdr5 pci express gen 5 and the same rdna2 integrated graphics cores although as with the x-series chips those two gpu compute units aren't going to do much more than light up your display and handle hardware video encoding and decoding all of which sounds pretty good though what's the competition up to then good question we couldn't help noticing that intel has already launched their non-k competitors to these chips we noticed when we read about it in the news and it looks like we weren't the only ones who got completely blindsided by this launch as far as we can tell there aren't any proper reviews for these chips anywhere as of the time of recording this could it be that intel maiden oopsie whoopsie underestimated amd and doesn't really want anyone to talk about these honestly it kind of looks that way not only did intel cut out overclocking support and cut down bass and boost clocks but these chips dramatically exceed their 65 watt tdp in a way that we didn't observe with amd and they won't opportunistically boost forever like the k series will and like amd's entire 7000 series will what's worse the core i5 13600 inexplicably loses a big chunk of level 2 cash that might not sound like a huge deal but cash can make a huge difference in performance across a wide variety of workloads inc including you guessed it gaming so did they kneecap this chip on purpose unfortunately we don't have any of them on hand so we're gonna have to look into them at a later date and we will look into them intel even if i have to personally camp out in front of the store to buy one i'm kidding nobody's camping out for these coming back to seem exciting though amd they claim that by simply dropping the tdp they're able to achieve industry-leading performance per watt which obviously we're going to be put into the test today we're going to be using a noctua nhd15 for cooling in order to let all of our chips stretch their legs but it should be noted that the entire non-x lineup ships with a box cooler and you should expect to get maximum performance out of these ones without spending any extra money on an exotic cooling solution as with our previous ryzen 7000 review our intel bench is using ddr5 6800 and our amd bench will be using ddr5 6000 this is not to give intel an advantage but rather to keep our comparison fair am d benefits more from running tighter timings and keeping the infinity fabric clock synced to the ram even if that is a little lower if you want to learn more about the infinity fabrics relationship with ram we did a whole video on ram speed on ryzen a little while ago that is still relevant to the current gen in cpu-bound 1080p gaming shadow of the tomb raider starts the non-x chips off pretty decently with the ryzen 9 7900 and ryzen 7 700 falling behind their ex-cousins by about eight percent while the 7600 managed exactly the same performance we tested cs go next but modern chips have actually gotten so fast that it's quickly becoming irrelevant the lowest result is 450 fps meaning that the differences basically don't matter and sometimes the results are even contradictory moving on then cyberpunk is a slightly worse story for our x-free chips than tomb raider was with the dip in performance sitting at anywhere between 8 and 15 percent for the higher core count parts and between two to three percent for the ryzen 5 7600 it's clear then that demanding multi-core optimized games are going to take better advantage of the x-series much higher all core turbo characteristics f122 brings better news to the non-x chips though where the 7900 comes within 5 to six percent of its x counterpart while the ryzen 5 meanwhile manages once again to match its x counterpart which at this point is becoming a bit of a pattern far cry 6 shows a bit more of a gap between the non-x and x chips though with the 77 in particular falling behind an average fps while the 7900 falls behind in minimums and forza horizon 5 sees the 7900 falling further behind thanks to its higher core count and thus lower relative clock speeds compared to the 7700 and the 7600 which are mostly in line with their x counterparts modern warfare 2 evens the playing field a lot though hinting that perhaps the game is a little more gpu bound at 1080p than we initially realized still the ryzen 5 7600 seems to fall behind a little here compared to the others hinting that perhaps thread count to a point is more important for this title the same can't be said for total war warhammer 3 though where we actually got some weird data that looks like a bug with high thread count chips the 7950x ends up slower than the 7900 for example and look at the 3900k but it seems like it's okay on the lower core count chips where we see about a two to nine percent performance gap between x and non-x's perhaps the most interesting game we tested though is factorio which is lightly threaded but still highly demanding in this the non-x chips performed admirably within five percent of their ex-counterparts and nearly on par with team blue keep in mind as you're looking through these charts guys that we don't have the price competitive intel chips on our charts because they paper launched them you can't actually get them overall then none of our tested cpus performed poorly i counted only 17 occasions where any frame rate dipped below 120 fps these are all capable gaming cpus but more importantly for these new ryzen processors the 7900 came within five percent of its x counterpart with the 7700 coming within four percent and the ryzen 5 7600 being on average bang on with the 7600x that is incredibly impressive now the 5800x 3d still stands out for the impressive performance that it delivers on a last gen ddr4 platform but with the way that ddr5 has come down in price and not to mention the upcoming x3v 7000 series chips am5 is starting to look like the place to be if you want an upgrade path kind of like our plaid flannel shirts are the place to be they're super comfy and warm and they come in more fun colors than ever if you're less concerned with gaming and more concerned with work though you might be a little disappointed cinebench puts the ryzen 9 7900 at just 88 of its x variant and the 7700 manages just 80 compared to the x thankfully with fewer cores to feed the 7600 manages to stick closer to its unthrottled counterpart which is a pattern that you'll see repeated through a lot of these tests well a lot of them not all blender is another bloodbath for the new chips clearly they are power constrained except for the 7600 and handbrake's av1 encoder has all the non-x chips trailing there almost equivalents our chromium compile is an example of one of those um for the most part where the 7600s shorter power leash does hold it back and it took a good seven minutes longer to finish meanwhile the rest of the non-exes stayed within spitting distance of the x-series none of them it should be noted are going to threaten intel since as we'll see their chips are very liberal with power consumption even compared to the ryzen x series and in spite of their power chugging ways they don't manage to win everywhere anyway even the x-less variants manage to outperform intel in very light tasks like flack encoding other more lightly threaded workloads such as those improcion are a little easier on the x-less cpus with the 7900 dropping just over 10 in photo editing and coming within three percent in video which isn't bad at all the 77 does even better and the 7600 manages to evenly match its x-series equivalent in video editing performance pretty cool now let's take a detour into synthetics to look at 7-zip where that same pattern we saw with heavily threaded loads makes a return it's worth noting though that in the real world this would be a lot more limited by storage speed than it would by your cpu so it's mostly academic like wide cruncher hey segway why cruncher is interesting though because it lets ryzen flex its avx 512 muscles while intel's chips only have avx2 they still manage to beat the lower power ryzen chips and this is in part thanks to the absurd amount of energy that avx 512 requires causing them to throttle hard to their comparatively low base clocks now let's head back to the real world with spec workstation i'm not gonna lie none of these tests are exactly a win for the new lower end chips and a lot of the performance differences are similar across the field but there are some cases where they at least come close to their high performance intel counterparts like calculus overall then the productivity performance for the 7900 and 7700 are only slightly better than their price difference would suggest but the 7600 manages to stand out at an impressive 96 of the 7600x's performance effectively making the 7600x obsolete it seems like six zen 4 cores are perfectly happy then running at under 100 watts speaking of which are you ready for a magic trick what do you get when you have two processor dies and a power target that's under 100 watts 40 degrees in prime 95 that's what that is ridiculous yes before you ask cpu utilization was at a hundred percent and as you'll see the power draw was as expected that's just how it is the ryzen 9 7 900 then would make an awesome small form factor cpu not that the others are slouches either the 7700 does get a bit toastier thanks to its higher quark clocks and single ccd but it's absolutely in another class than its x label twin and the core i7 13700k the ryzen 57600 is very much the same story as the 7700 embarrassing both of its competitors in our lineup here even though it has slightly higher thermals again thanks to its high core clocks and single ccd here's all of them on the same graph that is hilarious i mean why does the scale even need to go up to 120 degrees right because of the core i9 core clocks are interesting because while thermals were very low clocks remained at or above base clock on all of our chips the ryzen 9 7 900 while much lower than its x-twin managed to hover around 3.9 gigahertz before dropping to base clocks after the first half of the run that is frankly really impressive the ryzen 7700 meanwhile is significantly closer to its twin and hangs around the 4.5 gigahertz range or about 700 megahertz over base that is phenomenal remember guys that prime 95 is an unreasonably heavy load it's a stress test that is designed to make chips choke the ryzen 5 7 600 meanwhile has the same base clock as the 7700 but manages to boost 200 megahertz above and beyond even that chip which you can see when we stack them all together on the same graph like this it's hard to believe that these are all staying within 90 watts but they are here's the ryzen 9 7900 just embed addressing the 3900k when you consider the relatively small difference in performance i mean is that a spike to 350 watts this same story keeps playing out because each of these chips maxed out their 90 watt power target while intel shot to the moon the core i5 is a little less of a power gremlin and managed to keep things under 200 watts but i mean just look at this combined graph here it's just a single line all things considered especially with the energy crisis going on right now this is an absolute win for amd how could we forget performance per watt well we did but at f122 the ryzen 9 7 900 remained at its maximum power throughout the run which just happens to be much lower than either of the other 9 series cpus and when we capped it to 100 fps its power consumption drops even further while remaining roughly the same distance away from its x counterpart the 7700 isn't that much less power hungry in gaming than its ex-sibling and we can see that in action when we cap the frame rate the lines match up pretty well the ryzen 5 7600 was already very close in terms of power and performance to its ex-sibling and capping the frame rate gives us basically the same line which just so happens to be e roughly half the power draw of the core i5 this all works out to a watts per fps nearly three quarters that of the x series for both the ryzen 9 and 7 while the ryzen 5 7 600 somewhat predictably is roughly the same as the 7600x for enthusiasts though stock performance is only part of the story we couldn't run our entire test suite on all of the new chips but we did run the 7900 in a handful of applications to see if you can simply save a few bucks by altering the power targets in the bios yourself and then scribbling your own little ax onto the heat spreader and it looks like kind of can is that a one percent difference in cinebench considering the fact that we are not even manually overclocking the chip all we're doing is letting it draw more power this is phenomenal i mean i can't speak to what overclocking potential above and beyond stock boost operation whatever you want to call that would be there you know maybe the x's are better binned chips but if all you want is for it to run out of the box these things look great especially for the money although it should be noted that cost comparisons are complicated somewhat by the underlying platforms today while the non-x7000 series chips are significantly less expensive than even intel's kf skus not to mention they come with coolers intel does still hold the crown here in raw performance and maybe more importantly the lga 1700 platform supports both ddr5 and ddr4 making it somewhat more versatile and cheaper to build on especially if you go with an older 600 series intel chipset motherboard instead of a 700 series one ddr5 may no longer be a scalper item and its price premium has been coming down but a kit of ddr56000 is still going to set you back about double what a low latency ddr4 3600 kit would if your angle is the f word future proofing amd's socket am5 platform is newer and amd has committed to supporting it through 2025 and beyond which normally is the kind of claim that i wouldn't take at face value but with amd's history with socket am4 and am3 before that i at least want to trust them intel's pattern meanwhile though is to just release two cpu generations per platform and that is it so that money that you're saving today by going ddr4 on intel could end up costing you down the road if you're a frequent upgrader so then is this the shot in the arm that amd needed post-raptor lake i think so well it's a step in the opposite direction to competing in terms of performance it is a leap in the right direction in terms of value not only that but the thermal output of these cpus is low enough that you could put any one of them into a small form factor rig with a low profile cooler and get stock performance out of them i mean you'd need to drop to a non-case queue to do that on intel right now and even then things could get pretty toasty we don't know for sure because intel evidently doesn't want anyone to look too closely hopefully that changes for now though i guess it doesn't really matter what intel's doing because with these new chips amd has something in their lineup for just about everyone just like i have this
