ladies and gentlemen welcome back to tata steel chess 2023 the first elite chess tournament of the calendar year uh look uh we've been following a lot of amazing chess players throughout the past couple of weeks uh today's video uh it it doesn't feature the type of games necessarily that uh we show up to chess recaps for so today i am going to have to supplement that uh adding a little bit more spice if you will to the frying pan of the games uh but some of these games are useful if you would like to take a nap actually i will be taking a nap after i record this video i'm very tired i just had way too big of a lunch you know what you know when you have a huge lunch i want to record this video like an hour and a half ago i was just laying on the couch uh you know who else probably wished he was laying on the couch during uh instead of playing this game a uh a a1 magnus carlsen and the reason why i say that well you know some sometimes you show up to the board and certain things happen right so magnus begins this game against wesley so in the uh 11th round of action out of 13. he plays the move d4 and look wesley plays the best lines wesley does not just show up and play you know some nonsense wesley plays the nimso indian which is why you would utilize that move order magnus plays e3 looking either for the bishop d3 setup or the the knight e2 setup and wesley can castle he can play d5 he can play c5 he chooses to play c5 which is the most principled line magnus does in fact play this blocking his light squared bishop but now we have this and oftentimes in these nimso positions black takes black takes and black takes so black chopped a couple of times in the center then developed his knight and castled a very very solid line and what black is going to do in this position is play b6 let's just say give white a move bishop b7 let's give white a move and then in many positions black will blockade this pawn like this because it's an isolated pawn um i'm not saying that move order would occur but i'm saying that's the general idea or just to have a very powerful bishop or to rotate the knight over this way now magnus in this position already played a move that was uh when i saw it it was surprising to me um and the reason is all the pieces fly off the board so he could play queen f3 pinning the knight to the rook and then after this he can try to put like you know bring something back like the computer actually evaluates this position very very confidently for white maybe at a low depth like maybe if i let it run a little bit it's just gonna there's nothing right but at first it's saying there's like a lot but magnus plays the move d5 now the reason that move is surprising is because uh everything is going to get traded everything is going to get traded so uh we're gonna have like a a massive central explosion we have pawn takes we have knight takes we have bishop we have knight takes we have queen takes we have bishop takes we have queen takes when i saw this i was like okay this game is going to be a draw uh because you know they got the same exact pawns yeah there's a bishop for a knight but i just you know this is my elementary eye i'm just like i don't you know who's asking the questions in the position it's magnus no questions absolutely and actually in the interview after the game um he said this is this is what he wanted i mean he he wanted a position where only he was asking the questions which is very fair and you know he brings his rook and queen out and the thing is folks to the untrained eye like yours and actually also like mine like this position is uh is at a level you know they can calculate the intricacies of this position much better than i can i can do it better than you but that doesn't mean a whole lot all right i've played chess 20 years you might have played it for you know two days um and so we get queen and knight in five versus queen bishop and five and and really it's just gonna be a question of like what can magnus accomplish you know can he poke at the queen side can he get his pawns forward in such a way that uh it's gonna you know it's gonna be beneficial official like right now wesley could have played very passively here but instead wesley trades the queens and magnus gets a queen trade but now the black pawns are a bit split right so it's three like this and that one's an island and if white let's just you know just one move in the wrong direction and white getting a centralized king could be enough to pose long-term problems and if black's pawns are frozen on the same color square as the bishop it's simply going to be a loss for black so uh there really are a lot of intricacies here but wesley does a nice job uh despite allowing magnus basically everything like everything you would want a more active king uh pawns that are just totally frozen from moving forward pawns on the same color square he gets everything i mean magnus literally got everything he might want but it's still not enough because wesley immediately puts his pawns on light squares and uh they start trading and magnus still has a one on you know one-on-one over there and continues to ask questions but wesley's so clutch dancing around the board with his knight even though he's got very poor pawns they're untouchable because they're on light squares and by the time magnus is able to win one pawn you got knight a5 on the way so wesley doing a very nice job great defensive effort from him and expertly done you might ask yourself what is going on here why would you sacrifice the night for the pawn because when you have an outside pawn and a bishop if the promoting square is a different color than the bishop it's a draw so wesley can just lose everything and go there and it's a draw and that's exactly what happens uh magnus decides to do it this way but it would have made no difference if if the pawn had been trying to queen it's just the theoretical draw so like to me and you this game is tremendously a bunch of nothing and it really it is but at a metal level magnus was the only one asking questions in that position he he talked about it afterwards like it's it's hard to beat wesley i mean we saw hikaru struggled with it mightily in the cgc like wesley's just a really solid dude sometimes not much you can do um however the rest of the games are not solid and as always i've saved the best for last the last game of the video is completely insane um but first i want to give a shout out to two very special uh individuals who are sons of two special individuals uh and uh those individuals who i want to shout out are warner and stone and i hope you both did your homework before you watch this video um special shout out this is not like something you can buy don't think like oh i'm gonna buy a shout out to my kid in a gotham video no this was a very special case and uh and i don't want to don't want to say too much but i hope those dudes finish their homework before they moved on with uh with watching this video now dingley ren the second best chess player in the world uh in in classical chess versus jordan van forest so this one was a slob defense a very sharp line and where this got really goofy is right here all right dingley ren played the move queen b3 which attacks the pawn on c7 the only move that i have ever in my life been aware of in this position is queen c7 i don't know any other move the point is to defend this and target that with the rook like this like this queen c7 this man jordan van forrest played a move here he took on c4 which on its own is not ridiculous right you would probably think oh i just take back no no no no no eyes on the prize jordan gives up b7 completely so this is under fire that's under fire and that's gonna be under fire too so what is the point you could go rook b8 but then i take take take i got i have an extra pawn so jordan plays c5 oh my god what is dingley ryan gotten himself into and also c5 looks like it just loses the idea is that if d takes c5 black is actually going to go here and be better but c5 allows knight b5 with the threat of queen a8 and knight c7 ha is jordan just losing in 10 moves or is he an evil genius like jordan plays alien style chess like the way i think of jordan's chest is if aliens decided uh to you know come down to earth and try to emulate 2700 level grand masters and they somehow stumbled on jordan's games they'd be like boom c5 like but that jordan doesn't play like a human he plays like an intelligently programmed robot knight b5 is lunacy jordan allows knight c7 and just moves his king as if this is just normal you know as if jordan isn't from a large family and has siblings watching i'm sure there are young dutch kids who look up to jordan and they look at this jordan jordan you should be disappointed 1400 7 like jordan i don't know what the dutch equivalent would be it would probably have a lot of double letters in it uh like forest anyway queen a7 queen c8 and uh yeah ding is going to lose his knight so somehow he's gonna lose his knight he's gonna go here lining up an attack on the king jordan's gonna take its discovered check but now instead of taking the rook if you take the rook remember you're gonna lose your queen all right so remember that every time a piece moves other pieces might have their eyes opened yeah in this position the king is in front of the bishop yeah not anymore so you gotta take with check so your queen can't get taken and now we have queen c3 and the game very quickly does what's called petering out okay uh as ding is like geez i'm done with this game i'm just gonna consolidate uh king e7 and um jordan actually could have even considered playing on i think the computer was giving him a very decent edge here after knight b6 um but uh we have g5 and a couple moves later um just rook h4 creates this barrier and the players actually just repeat moves so jordan decides not to try to you know continue posting problems and we have solidity and a draw but i mean not all draws are the same all right some draws look like the last game some draws look like this but sometimes you know after really really ridiculous engine prep games just become draws anyway because if both guys play at the top move of the engine position is just equal especially if it's very forcing then a lot of pieces get traded and you know things simplify um okay now two games that did not have a draw both of these games were decided by a winner and a loser uh the first game is pragnananda ramesh babu whose name they just removed and parham maxulu this one began as a night orph h3 is known as the adams attack named after wednesday adams uh e5 so there's two ways for black to play a night or for one is e6 and one is e5 e5 is the more active night orf the knight comes back to f3 and in this position pragnananda looks like he makes an over the board mouse slip and plays knight h2 let me tell y'all something right now if ice ever saw any of you play knight f3 and knight h2 i would contact your parents and ask them to disable your connection to the internet you know like parents need to disable like they need to do parental controls to see like what bad websites their kids are going to you're going on a good website chess you still can't go on it anymore you can't even access the internet all right this is this is heinous knight f3 knight d4 knight f3 knight h2 i don't know what deviant stuff you're getting yourself into you are too young for that and if you're watching this and you're 30 years old all right and you're still playing like this i don't know who i'm gonna contact i'm going to contact next of kin you know i like i really i don't know i'm gonna contact a friend of yours i mean knight h2 now the idea of knight h2 just so you understand is i don't know the damn idea of knight h2 how about that the idea i think is to go knight g4 trade off the knight and seize control of deep also knight h2 carries shock value and i'm pretty sure shock value was achieved because within the first 15 moves proc had a fantastic position like he got everything he wanted and i'm pretty sure his opponent was sitting there going yo this mfr which kids don't ask what your parents stands what that stands for um it stands for uh master fudger uh this dude really played knight h2 this dude played knight f3 knight d24 knight f3 knight h2 knight g4 knight e3 what huh that's what he played y'all i'm not even joking now in the night off it's all about the d5 square all right and uh pro you know prog uh pro got a great position and then brock played this that same night which went boop boop boop boop boop boop now goes to f5 and dies and his idea was to open up black's king but parham just says uh no we're not opening my king right now no that's not what we're doing now knight takes d5 looks like a free pawn it's not because after knight d5 and queen d5 rook d8 will win the bishop so bishop h6 rook d8 and all of a sudden parham takes over the game and goes knight a4 and basically just says you can't be trusted with horses just look at how you treated the other one and the other one uh now now now prague is left with no knights he got no horses uh and the queen is trying to get to g7 but it's not happening prague's still trying to go full steam ahead and uh yeah parham's like uh what if i just play f5 and just take your pawn and then come back and where is your attack like where is white's attack right okay bishop c4 i just take the bishop okay like my king is out in the open but it cannot actually be checked i'm threatening to take the bishop the bishop comes back and uh blacks upon up and not only is black upon up black's got these dudes let me tell you something right now black is going to push those dudes let me tell you something right now black doesn't even have to push those dudes past where they are right now black can use those dudes to go here and those dudes are going to open the gate for the other dudes which are going to open the gate for the other dudes this way and it's complete collapse the e-pawn has a red carpet to the conclusion of the board bishop h4 will cover the promotion square and it's just a matter of time you can do it with the d-pawn you can do it with the e-pawn the pawn makes it through and uh a lot of tactics but he makes a new queen and he's just going to win all of the remaining pawns with bishop h4 and uh rook c2 bishop back to f6 and rook f2 and i mean black spawns are just gonna collapse white pawns excuse me are just going to collapse e3 pin goes back e2 and the game ends with a very very beautiful tactic which i will not scream but i will simply say in this position to promote his pawn successfully parham muksudu sacrificed the rook on h2 it's a forcing sequence that makes king takes h2 happen on the next move bishop g1 comes with a check and e1 sneaks in before it can be taken rook h2 a beautiful final move and progresigned what a weird game night h2 now he actually had a good position he didn't lose because he played knight h2 but what on earth was knight h2 that was wild chess is so weird alright all these kids spending time on the internet their parents don't know what they're looking up well they're looking up night age too you guys know that meme man and woman laying in bed man on his side and the woman's like oh but he's thinking about other women right now and the guy's going why did prague play night age too or uh what's what absurd looking move can i play on move like six seven in the night orf uh now if you had the patience to make it this far in the video the game that you were about to witness is nothing short of spectacular and i said that this video is a good for a nap um and i'm not necessarily lying i will absolutely go lay in bed after this and try to sleep i'll probably just go on my phone for an hour and a half and not actually take a nap because you know 2023 uh but let's see this game now uh beardson is quickly becoming my favorite uh chess player all his games are super exciting uh this game is a rosalimo sicilian we have g6 and now a weird line where he doesn't take on c6 right away even though that's literally the entire point of putting the like chess has developed into such deviant like lines you go here to to take and double black's pawns and then you just don't like yeah and they're gonna do it man and then and and then when you're attacked that's when you do it so basically you're saying this was a stupid move by black because i was gonna take on c6 anyway but black invites this and we have a you know complex position we get a very sharp line here c5 trying to give up this pawn in order to play take take and knight e4 uh he doesn't play that and now we have b5 so both sides are just seizing as much space as possible bishop b7 and uh visually speaking white's position is completely dominant but it's not the point is that black actually has meaningful pressure on the center black is going to have crisscross applesauce going here with the bishops at any moment and black is going to play b4 and the knight is going to move in the center is going to be very very unstable so we have this this black seizes control of the other diagonal and brings the knight back and now plays c4 and the knight will dance into the white position so the position is anything but clear here comes the knight here comes whitesnite preventing knight d3 and here's rook c8 92 and the bishop drops back and now it's very clear that these knights are about to pull up into the black position what's up so complete opposite side of the board beardson going for this this guy evage going for stuff on the other side h5 g5 shuts the door knight drops back e5 looking to lock the center but now the d-pawn can walk not yet though first we shove the bishop backwards now we play knight c3 the idea of knight c3 is that if you play b4 i'm gonna pop out this way i'm gonna try to get my queen into the action all right so that doesn't happen rookie 3 rook f3 targeting the pawn black jumps into the white position that that knight might die that night is definitely a nuisance uh white plays a4 looking to poke a hole in the defense of the black queen side black takes white takes attacking the queen queen a6 slides out of danger b3 once again trying to poke a hole in the stronghold so the knight moves to f4 effectively completely blocking white's attack beerton drops back with his knight to target this and try to get to f5 black takes the pawn white response now the bishop comes in blocking the queen's vision this way all right beardson now says it right my knight's got no forward momentum this way i'm gonna bring this knight back too just like i brought back that night now apparently rook c3 is winning for black all right beardson messed up and in this position the queen needed to be chased again back this way 92 check and apparently black is like getting the upper hand instead of that evich saw this and got scared and played king 2 f8 but that gave white an opportunity to take on f4 and then come here with the knight instead of that he does it this way and now apparently black is better again but we have d6 this pawn is such a problem for black that must be terrifying just a random pawn in the middle of a fight to the death among pieces paul's just walking through so what do you do right you go rookie eight and now the best move is to hit the pause button and not even push it apparently it's to play knight d5 what a cluster you know what of pieces a cluster farc f-a-r-k i just invented that word uh see it's a family friendly channel um instead of that beardson plays this obviously rook here now he takes now he jumps into the black position that's a sacrifice of a piece if you take for free i cannot take because of this but i will sneak in and you're gonna die i'm gonna go here etc etc if you try to trade queens i'm gonna go here and you actually can't stop queen g7 checkmate unless you lose all your pieces so rook takes d7 though now knight ef5 and now the only thing that black can do here is to block the queen by playing xc4 and you cannot take because of this but evich plays c4 sacrificing his queen in order to grab a rook and threaten mate this is mate and you know what white does here to stop mate i told you this was going to be a fun way to end the recap the only way to stop mate is to run he runs out of the side of the castle the king's gone running in the words of conor mcgregor jose is going running the king's going running up to h3 he goes black takes the pawn on e4 now the knight is threatened that's made in a couple of moves so you know who plays defense on the knight and the rook the king king's like i got y'all if that bishop takes either one of you i'm snapping back and i'm surviving the king is actually completely safe from checks king e2 knight blocks whereas a king goes back to g4 probably i actually don't think king e2 survives i think there's probably some tactic there um king has to go back in any case the bishop slides back to d5 and the hunt for the king continues queen d7 it's gonna be a buzzer beater finish all right we have rook takes g2 check this rook blocks rook takes g3 knight takes g3 bishop takes 94 check on e2 and in this position this king had an opportunity in the game he just got blocked first but he had an opportunity to play king f5 and then finish the walk how gangster would that have been if the king went here here here here and here can you imagine and the king becomes a checkmating asset bishop g4 knight f5 safe take take he will come right back and it's game over insane in sane in the membrane instead of that all right king walked up a little bit later but we got bishop d6 check and uh in this position if you play the move king f6 you lose in a tragic fashion so uh that didn't happen and instead we got this and black resigned uh because all of his pieces will perish including look how big the board is his rook what a walk up the edge of the board huh king h3 king g4 incredible what a game to end on 11 rounds of tata steel action are in the books we will see if magnus carlson is can win his last two games to storm into first place out of nowhere uh and yeah if you'd like to follow the standings of the event link uh is in the description and that's it i'll see you in the next video get out of here
