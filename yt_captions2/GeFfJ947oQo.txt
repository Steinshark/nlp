ladies and gentlemen another day another drama in the world of chess this one has been developing for several weeks here at the end of 2023 and i've waited a little while to present it to all of you because new developments are coming out every single day but i think i'm ready here we go this drama surrounds the final two spots to play in the fed candidates chess tournament the candidates tournament is an eight-player tournament a double round robin with 14 games and the winner of that tournament qualifies to challenge for the world chess championship winning the candidates basically secures you close to a million extra dollars and obviously a lot of prestige and sponsorship that's just how the chess world has always been set up the two most elite and prestigious events are the candidates and ultimately the world chess championship match now this year it is a nightmare it it is a disaster and i'm going to show you why here we go so let's first talk about who has already made it and what the format is very simply the person that ran that was the runner up in the world chess championship match prior yanish now has a spot now magnus carlson has a spot because he won the world cup he might decline that spot and it would go to fourth place finisher in the world cup niat abbasa from aeran two other gentlemen by the names of prag nanda and fabiano carana also qualified from the world cup vidit and hikaru qualified from the grand swiss this year there was a big tournament called the grand swiss if you got first or second you qualified and then we have two spots one is the highest rated player as of january 1st 2024 and the other one is the circuit winner the fed circuit is an interesting concept and let me just summarize it for you on full screen because the truth is i don't think anybody really understands what the circuit is essentially the fay circuit is a weighted calculating system where you take the five strongest tournaments that you played in a year with your best performances and that adds up to something and you lead the the the circuit board so right now what that looks like the fed circuit board which i believe i have for you here is a list and a leaderboard and right now it's carana but if you remember carana already made it so we don't count carana we have gesh anish giri wesley so arin eri and you'll look at their scores here and these are their performances and you can and and all of this is calculated in a super weird table the amazing team at chess.com summarized it for me each tournament awards points based on strength which is called tar simply put of the tar is 2650 first place is 15 points you can screenshot this and read it if you'd like i'm not going to read it to you cuz i don't want to insult your intelligence but essentially the way it works is there are series of tournaments that determine who wins a certain event at a certain average rating and that person can overtake on the circuit leaderboard now what i just showed you there gukesh overtaking a niche happened today that happened today because of a chess tournament that was held in india and chenai anish giri was the leader of the circuit until today december the 21st of 2023 there is one tournament remaining that is eligible for the fay circuit and it is the rapid and blitz world championship that begins in about 5 or six days so crazy stuff but that's that's the beginning that is the beginning of all of this drama allow me to tell you the story of the final two candidate spots this year here's a look uh on the 2700 chess website of the top players in the world magnus carlson fabiano carana hikaru they all qualified magnus doesn't want to play the candidates he doesn't want to play the candidates not a fan of the format he's withdrawing from the cycle dingly ren is the world champion jan has made it we are looking at spot six 7 8 n and 10 those are the highest rated players in the world eligible to qualify as of january 1st wesley so 2757 ali resa fuja 2756 lenard dominguez perez from united states 2751 and a half karakin i he's not playing a lot as of late but he's 2750 and an ge is's 274 9 now those are the protagonists of our story and this story begins in the singfield cup this was a tournament held in st louis not too long ago and these were the final standings fabiano won the event which is why fabiano if you remember in the circuit is destroying the c fabiano carana is the biggest chad on the planet because this man has qualified to the candidates like six different ways okay this man is a monster and look you you look he's the only other player in the world rated 2,800 right now so he he's really a beast but second place was lenier dominguez perez and then it was wesley so and this is where the drama begins because all of a sudden lenier dominguez was one of the highest rated players in the world despite not playing a lot of chess and wesley was very close and fua was at the bottom fuja got second to last at the singfield cup there was only nine players because dudo withdrew he had he had a health concern so wishing d to all the best feru tanked and if you look at fu's recent tournaments which we will get into in a moment i think they they will show up here um he had a rough event he lost a lot of points did fuja i think there's a way to look at this but uh i i might have to i i don't know where you're supposed to click but fua struggled and he lost a lot of rating at the singfield cup so all of a sudden it became a wide openen race now while that was happening in london december 1st 2023 ges got third place you will remember that gukesh was trying to overtake anish giri so while london is being played and while the grand chest tour is happening we have a bunch of jostling we have a bunch of people going for different spots and this is where it all started okay this is where it all began first chris bird who's an international arbiter tweeted sop chess at the last minute have added that to be eligible for the rating spot you have to meet circuit regulation 3.2 apparently the international governing body of the game fay made a small change that basically said for dominguez to be eligible for the candidates for dominguez to be eligible to play the candidates he has to play and i will take you here he has to play not more than two tournaments in the same country if this rule is not respected the player is not eligible so literally a month before the deadline this is what this is what i don't know exactly if that was when that happened but this is what i was seeing on socials the international governing body of the game said you actually can't just spam tournaments in your own country to farm your rating so you know what he did he went to barcelona i think this tournament is in barcelona i might be wrong he went to spain no it's in formenta oh oh no it's in no it's in barcelona in december right here so this man lanier after basically just vibing the entire year gets second place and says you know what if i can't play in my home country i'm going to barcelona i'm going to barcelona that's what i'm going to do um incredible so he goes to barcelona and lanier goes to to play a tournament in barcelona because he wants to gain rating in order to make the candidates and that's completely i it's completely legit completely legit thing to do that that that is the rule they say that the person that is the highest rated as of january 1st is eligible you will remember lenier was just a couple of points away right so of course he's justified he goes there now what happens when lenier goes to barcelona well what happens when laner goes to barcelona i have a couple of other games here for you is in the very second round of the event he is playing a fed master with a rating of 2337 from america lanier plays a very combative sicilian defense his opponent plays rook g1 which is called the freak attack okay of the nidorf variation and we get into a very big battle because that's what you're supposed to do lanier is literally 408 points higher rated than his opponent but he needs every when you beat a person with a 400 point gap you get 08 that is the rule you get eight well what happens is lenier gets into an extremely complicated game against the young man and and and and gets a very bad position like he he gets a position here where the computer was saying that he was he he might even be losing on a high depth like he he played in in some very very very provocative way and the computer was giving a this this computer on a low depth for some reason is not giving such a big evaluation but i'm pretty sure uh the position was uh was was quite bad and i think here was the biggest valuation it was like fg it was very complicated but it was normal stuff okay and so what ended up happening was they traded a bunch of pieces and uh this is a drawn end game like rook bishop 4 rook bishop 4 opposite color and uh it went on for a little while and laner tried to win but you you you can't win this position i don't care if your opponent gets hit in the head with a baseball bat this is a impossible position to win and they agreed to a draw and then lenier drew somebody else and then lenier withdrew from the tournament so in an unbelievable turn of events lenier traveled to barcelona in order to play in this event to gain rating but he ended up losing rating he ended up losing a couple he drew a couple of games and that lost him points and the crazy thing about chess is you need to stay top 10 the thing is historically if you're not top 10 in chess you will not get in invited to major tournaments so lenier has more of an interest in not falling to like 14th he'd rather and so what he did is he withdrew he withdrew after playing this game over here which is crazy like that is it's crazy that the top players in the world can they don't even have to finish a tournament because there's so much pressure on them to stay in the top 10 maybe that shouldn't even be allowed right so that is that is a whole crazy thing lanier goes to try to chase the the rating spot he ends up drawing a couple of games losing points he he now doesn't want to play in the ra in the tournament anymore which is crazy and then there was this this was bananas this was announced on december the 11th which if you remember the london chess classic end the december 10th this tournament was in the works for a long time this is called the chenai grand masters and the tournament is a monstrous event the ratin aka rating average is 2711 okay massive sponsors gukesh and arjun have a chance to make the feed a circuit spot candidates param makulu can have a good event and catch up now apparently anish giri over here and wesley so were invited to play the event wesley so was in toronto playing the uh the champions chess tour and anish giri has a family and he has to prepare for the world rapping and blitz and you will remember anish giri also is 2749 like he might not want to risk it so let me remind you why this is important they organized the tournament that according to the fay circuit is very very very strong you will remember that to organize a tournament you have to take a very high standard rating and that is how it is calculated so the pressure pressure was on gesh to win this tournament if gesh wins this tournament of monster opponents if he clutches it out he is going to the candidates probably he is going to take the third spot and as of today the final day of the event he won the tournament so did arjin eric see tying for first so if you look at the fiday circuit leader board eric gy is really close to if he has a really good rapid and blitz he might actually get up here but for now it's ges and this is the first start of the problems and i will pause here and just discuss okay let me discuss i think the entire cycle of qualifying to the candidates and ultimately playing for the world championship might be overdue for an overhaul it is good in theory but we are still the only sport where our massive biggest events are determined in a one-on-one battle not just a one-on-one battle at grand pre an eight person double round robin hunger game style event we make eight players play 14 games against each other and then the winner emerges to play the world champion no other sport does anything similar tennis every individual sport there's a circuit there is a leaderboard but there's small tournaments and big tournaments and what i don't like is that you can announce a tournament anytime that should be strange even though the chenai grand masters is 100% legitimate listen to me it is 100% legitimate what i am about to show you is not what i'm about to show you is something that is only app applicable in the rules that they currently exist and it's kind of a hate the game don't hate the player but can we just agree that you cannot it if we're going to be a credible sport i don't think you can announce tournaments in the middle of the year i think they have to be determined beforehand now according to that tournament and according to saga and is giri etc they have been planning this tournament for a very long time and they are 100% reputable individuals and i have no problems with gcash going to the candidates that is not what i'm saying at all but we if we're going to be a credible sport like can you imagine somebody in tennis wants to overtake like number one that's that's where it gets a little bit weird for me and where it really gets weird is what i'm about to show you because then they announced ali resa fua ali resa fu's race to the candidates tournament this is the ultimate this is the ultimate bending but completely legal applicable situation in the rules they organized a round robin tournament where ali resa fua is going to play three people in a double round robin they are all older grand masters feduk uh shakov and jiad 2439 256 2546 ala fuja has to play all of these guys and i think as of today he is now five out of five and he is now higher rated than wesley so fuja is now higher rated than wesley so because of this tournament that they announced literally two weeks before january 1st the chenai grand masters compared to that is a it it it it's not even it's not even comparable the chenai grand masters has a tournament average of 27-11 it is 100% a legitimate tournament it's just unfortunate they announced this tournament on december 11th that's my old like i this tournament should have been on the calendar from the beginning can i hope we can all agree on that but this but this is wild and this is why this whole system is is problematic because technically what ali resa fuja is doing is 100% within the rules it's just probably going to be frowned upon and cause a bit of a ruckus and then the international governing body of chess said today on december'th the mini matches featuring ali resa fuja began in france the six-game tournament fitz peruja uh pitz f fitz peruja p oh my god pitz fuja against three veteran players with an average of 2497 concerns have arisen regarding the tournament's potential purpose whether it was orchestrated to aid mr fuja in boosting his rating for qualification which is really crazy they would think that considering it's called ali resa fu's race to the like at least chenai named the tournament chenai grand masters and not will kasher iy qualifi to the listen there's a big indian chess audience all right [music] i look at these sherlock holmes out here the international chess federation would like to point out according to the point4 clause of its rating regulations fiday reserves the right not to rate a specific tournament what fay has already sent an official request to the organizers of the event we're going to carefully follow and investigate all aspects of the organization oh my god oh my goodness and then the question comes out of there is no consistency you did nothing when it was dingly ren not only that uh yan she tweeted they did not bother to at least issue an official statement about the chinese tournaments last year now enjoy the consequences it serves it right okay let's talk about it i want you all to listen to me because youtube is weird i talk you hear something different than what i'm saying i have zero problems with the chennai grand masters and i have slightly more problems than that with what fuja is doing but almost none because it's in the rules they did not not do anything about this so technically i could go farma 27 not really because that would be suspicious but you get my point this was all created because the regulations allow it and it's also a problem because there is way too much emphasis on the candidates qualifying to the candidates in the world chess championship has way too much of an impact on a player's career maybe it should maybe it shouldn't i don't know but the point is this is the system this is the system what fuji is doing is completely legal it's just you know questionable what dingly ren did last year remember the dingly ren events serge karakin last year was removed from the candidates due to social media activity during the russia ukraine war that's what happened you may remember this maybe not ding l ren could take his spot but he did not have enough eligible games because dingly ren did not travel during the pandemic so dingly ren played locally in china 27 games or something but dingly ren already had the spot he just wasn't eligible because of the games played it's a bit of a different situation than fuja who actively needs rating to overtake wesley so wesley so could go play some games in st louis right now and over take fuja the point is this is a circus the point is how can we just have eligible tournaments submitted for candidate spots at the end of the year it doesn't make any sense what should be possible is if i'm close i can go play a little tournament like somewhere and maybe i win it maybe it'll but that tournament was announced six months ago this whole thing is craziness it is craziness last year dingly ran had to do this had to do this because it was a crazy situation where karakin was removed from the candidates and even then people had a problem with what dingl ren was doing because he just he needed to play games locally against chinese grand masters because he hadn't played enough games because he couldn't travel during the pandemic what's going on now is fua lost rating and the only real way for him to gain it back just a little bit right before the end is to do this and of all of those situations this is the one i might have an issue with but it's within the rules you technically can do this because there's nothing in regulation against it so the international governing body of the game is literally adapting to the situation on the fly i don't think a single person on earth even understands the fiday circuit clearly some people do because they are able to organize tournaments gkes has now overtaken anish giri because of the circuit but there is one tournament remaining which is the world rappid and blitz which is going to happen at the end of the year and anich has an opportunity to to overtake but even today the best player in the world magnus carlson put out a tweet which said i have no horse in this race but in my opinion the world blitz is much harder to win and should therefore give more circuit points than world rapid magnus is arguing that because the world bliss has more rounds it's more grueling and it's actually harder to win now the argument is well the world rapid is technically closer to classical than you know blitz so it should count more so nobody even we're making this up on the fly like we're literally everybody has an opinion nobody really understands what's going on and uh and and and meanwhile c squ podcast put out this meme anish guas ala and wesley all battling each other and fabby qualifying for the candidates in five different ways is the best meme ever this is incredible this is awesome um this is great so everybody had an opinion maxim vra chimed in um oh the united states chess federation appealed for the event not to count just i'm not sure the united states chess federation after various things in 2023 can ask for anything but um yeah so the federation here says it shouldn't count because they want wesley so to make the candidates by rating right now if all things ended without that event wesley so would have made the candidates by rating uh but now it's fuja so fuja has officially overtaken wesley so um that that's where we are now and today i tweeted should i play anish giri in a few games over christmas to make him eligible for the candid by rating so anish giri would need to beat me 10 times to get to 2760 and he would overtake fua okay look all of this is a is a complete circus that that's my point like i don't even i mean i've said so much in this video and yet i i still feel like i i i don't even know what to expect or what point that i'm making um i don't think that you should be able to organize tournaments 3 weeks before the deadline but it's within the rules and if you're going to organize something what chess base india did and what sagar sha did was fantastic because they organized any the strongest chess tournament india ever had so congratulations to them shout out to sagar sha shout out to arjin arayi gesh harri krishna all the players that participated in that event that was a great event and massive congratulations to gukesh who won it in fact anish giri congratulated him too you know as bittersweet as it must have been for anish who he was invited to play that that's what they said uh i'm going to find it for you i'm going to find it for you there we go so it's right here it says congrats to gcash on his much needed victory in chenai rising up to the occasion as a great great quality as a quality of a great champion so look that's fine like what that's fine what the fuia thing is less fine but it's still within the rules and uh wesley might go organize some games in st louis and i don't even i don't even know what's happening anymore um please let me know your thoughts in the comments i mean we we need some help this whole thing doesn't make sense it doesn't make sense it doesn't make sense none of this makes sense i think right now fuja is taking the spot from wesley and gukesh is taking the spot from anish because fabiano already made it nuts and magnus doesn't want to play so it's going to go to the guy that got fourth place in the world c this is all insane this completely nuts um that's all i have for you today very big drama uh not not by the way they might not rate the event they might not rate the event oh my can i just say that fay literally reserved the right not to rate the event we don't even know if it's going to count this is nuts whole thing's nuts um that's all i have for you today so get out of here
