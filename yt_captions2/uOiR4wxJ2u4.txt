ladies and gentlemen hans neeman has struck again those of you that have followed the chess world since let's say september 4th 2022 are likely well aware of certain players like hans demon magnus carlson let's add hiar nakamura as well we had a little bit of drama it seems to have died down since then but yesterday january the 30th 2024 was a big day for many reasons first first of all it was the 30th of the month so some people received paychecks second it was tuesday on tuesday we do things like taco tuesday and third of all tuesday is the day on chess.com where we play a chess tournament called title tuesday not taco tuesday but title tuesday and hans nean was on a rampage yesterday we saw the first game of chess between hans neeman and magnus carlson since the $100 million lawsuit was settled and died down we also also saw the first game of hans versus hikaru in several months hans nean is now up to number three on the entire chess.com website and yesterday he won his first ever title tuesday tournament then after that he trash talk magnus and he also challenged tikaro to a $10,000 blitz match i mean you you can't i i the the content makes itself at this point so in the first title tuesday i'm going to show you by the way hans magnus hans hikaro and just a couple of bonus games of the hans neiman rampage that was detonated upon the chess world yesterday so yesterday hans neiman was undefeated in the first title tuesday i think he was like seven out of seven he lost a game he might have won another game and then he got paired against magnus carlson magnus hans i mean like this this is the stuff of of of legends of movies all right these guys had a hundred million lawsuit going on all right magnus withdrew from a tournament due to the history of hans now magnus opened with e4 hans booted up a stream for this game he had he wasn't even streaming he live streamed the game e4 e5 knight f3 kn c6 it was a spanish and then hans played knight f6 hans played the berlin right now you know he didn't have to hans could have played the sicilian would magnus have played a sharp line would he have played a solid line i don't know but hans plays knight f6 knight f6 is an invitation it's the first invitation to go for an equal game and potentially a draw i mean the thing is black could play a6 and knight f6 in the main line spanish hans's repertoire with the black pieces does seem to be the mighty and legendary berlin and now it's sort of up to magnus magnus could play the anti- berlin if he's trying to get a fight but here instead of going for the end game which is pawn to d4 a long line line after that uh he plays rook e1 keeps the structure symmetrical you can't take the bishop because of discover check but this is a very well-known and relatively painless position um this position is completely equal like white can play this for an advantage in some way um like there are lines instead of pawn to c3 where you know you can play bishop f4 knight c3 you can give away this pawn it's like very sharp very complicated but unfortunately this game is not anything special uh neither guy spends any time they then trade literally every piece you sack your queen you take and then you know you got to trade everything and it's just a dead draw and now hans offers a draw which magnus doesn't see or declines to you know and then now these guys instead of agreeing to a draw shuffle their kings around for 40 moves this is how magnus carls and hans nean ended yesterday the lawsuit got us nowhere but uh this game got us nowhere either we got absolutely no information about these two they played 87 moves they made basically the equivalent of a pre-arranged draw they did not pre-arrange it but they never got a game interesting so you know magnus declines us a little bit of content but i got to tell you uh hans could have played a sicilian you know he could have went for a win on move one right uh and then maybe maybe magnus would have played c3 like you know the thing about playing with white in 2024 in chess at the top level is you could force the draw in any line like would magnus have forced the dragons i don't know i don't know we'll never know so that was step one and then hans started yelling you know that magnus is afraid of him i'm paraphrasing he didn't sit there and go you know magnus is afraid of me but he did say that um you know he wanted magnus to play for a win he was yelling that he wants magnus to beat him mag denies us content this is not really content but then hans had the second title tuesday to work with and uh yeah you you might want to you might want to put on your seat belts for this one because uh he crushed everybody 10 out of 11 points including hikaru so one of his first opponents was benjamin bach in this game hans had the black pieces he played a nso indian bishop to b4 none of this is important c5 knight c6 this is a very solid line and this bishop has gone there to perish you've sort of walled the bishop out so takes takes and now hans takes the center with e5 this is uh one of many ways to play uh when the knight is on f3 i think the cyp of setup is is named after the german grandmaster uh robert huer i think his name is robert i know his last name is hubner d5 he gives a big center to his opponent we see bach trying to attack hans like this hans gets it done in multiple ways in this video uh but this game was quite impressive so in this position rather than sort of sitting around and waiting uh he doesn't sit around and wait uh and his you know he begins firing off his kingside pawn at his opponent to try to mess around with his coordination they trade and now he plays f5 the idea of f5 is that yes you are pushing the pawns in front of your king but you are trying to lock the position not allow your opponent to kind of snipe at you uh from a oh my god from a distance with his bishops which is exactly what bach is doing um i can't i by the way i honestly i love bach's last name because it's the noise that chicken makes like i i i love it bach and you know what if you're dutch that's probably not even how it's pronounced it's probably pronounced like book or something but i i love his last it's great last name anyway benjamin bach uh puts rooks and bishops on these diagonals and it's a pretty menacing position so hans goes here and says you know what i'm not going to sit around playing defense b5 all right i'm well well uh well equipped to to strike back over here you will also notice black is not rushing with the move e4 yes this kind of seals the position but this bishop just becomes a god i mean you essentially allow that bishop to just sit on b2 and have permanent pressure uh so b5 taking on c4 potentially opening up the b file as well as creating a weakness in the longterm in the end game queen f7 and now a well time strike in the center of the board yes you open up this bishop however it's difficult for white to defend all the pawns in his position and so hans trades off the rooks and basically his approach is well you're not going to mate me if we trade a bunch of pieces all right bishop f5 is possible but it's m in one these guys are rated 2900 3,000 in h's case 3200 uh that's not going to happen and now hans plays queen f7 and now bach goes on a massive attack of his own and actually over the next few moves builds up a massive massive attack and herei can actually deliver a knockout punch and this is what i mean like hans was getting it done in a variety of different ways all right he was getting it done uh in uh you know in in in ways that were flashy and exciting and dynamic and he was attacking people but he was also getting it done in in in ugly ways like sometimes you get a really bad position here bach has a knockout punch if bishop takes pawn and uh the reason why this is a knockout punch is whatever takes and black's position you lose if you take with a king there's a discovered attack so bishop f5 check i pick up a piece i'm up multiple pieces in the end game and if bishop g7 queen g7 the queen goes here and it's actually very tough to protect yourself so i would play queen f8 queen d7 and you're just winning because you're going to feast on these pawns and you might even win this end game although there's no reason to you know there's no reason to trade the queens so bach misses it now hans goes here allowing actually that to happen again because he has 5 seconds and he keeps trying to defend himself and box's like what i'm supposed to be winning so b goes here tries to trade to queens thinks he's still better hans puts the knight in the center now i'm not so sure anymore i think i think white panicked a little bit in the time trouble and now h is a pawn up in an end game now h is a pawn up so we go from under severe pressure to a pawn up and the best part is he's not playing for a draw anymore he just has to not lose his pawns he wraps around into the into the white positions really difficult to defend the pawns and uhoh uhoh uhoh the bishop is locked out you blocked out your own bishop the king cannot get out of the way because you lose the pawn so bach ties his shoes together and tries to play soccer football soccer football satisfying the entire global audience hans push the pawn down he wins game over bishop takes c4 out of nowhere this man hans was worse for 50 moves 50 moves a little bit of an exagger he was worse for like 40 moves he was under pressure for 40 moves he defended defended defended and he wins the time scramble versus bach getting it done and in listen you don't always win a flashy game but he held on and he wins and there you go hans then played speed of light who's actually uh a rival speed of light is uh i think andrew hong uh grandmaster from from the us and um you know so is hans these guys have played in the us junior championship i think they're roughly the same age i've lost to both of them uh i've lost to andrew hong in tournament chess i lost to hans in tournament chess when he was like 11 then i got revenge when he was like a little bit older but uh they're both very good and um this one also i mean this was a long battle it started with an offbeat opening clearly hong looking for uh hong looking for hans to play d4 h says you know what let's just play an italian cu i'm 2700 f i only know how to play e4 e5 as we can see from the from the magnus game knight to f6 and uh and and and now no fried liver we just play just a clean italian until this when andrew hong plays d5 d5 is very forcing line it's not you know not one of these maneuvering games i cover many top level games on this channel d6 h6 etc e knight d5 bishop g4 a4 a5 right very very tense position white trying to get this pawn but he's under some pressure black has very active pieces but potentially a destabilized center h3 knight here knight b6 and now we are targeting the bishop on c4 which hans puts on the b3 square now um that's apparently theory like cuz the bishop looks to me better on b5 and then you can play bishop takes and maybe take here yeah hans goes here and um that just hangs a pawn like queen d3 is a free pawn 100% which he takes but clearly from these guys spending their time this has all been played before cuz now you can move the knight your queen is hanging but this queen is hanging now black plays queen f5 apparently black is better like on low depth but both these guys are busting out these moves really quickly rook d8 all right knight e f3 and now instead of putting a rook on d8 the computer likes putting the rook on e8 apparently and then you trade and then you know and then and then bishop c2 and then queen d5 and then i don't know is is it a draw like do you repeat moves i don't know i don't know but h uh andro hong goes rook d8 queen e2 knight d5 and uh hun tries to trade the queens tries to trade the queens get his knight in the center target black's bishop queen d7 rotates the queen over trying to attack andrew now because he's backing up look at this all of a sudden the queen went up and over it went to e2 e4 h4 here comes the knight here comes the bishop white's position is all of a sudden coming look at this look at how look at how scrunched up the white position was a few moves ago bang bang rotate knight and and bishop everybody gets out very quickly everybody gets out everybody's coming to the party have a real good time bl system of a down if you haven't listened to system of a down you have not lived queen f5 queen g3 my favorite song is probably radio video by them lowkey song but that's my favorite song anyway it's one of my favorite things to do is to like drop nuggets of things that i like in these videos and then you guys are in the comments like cu i read the comments unfortunately i unfortunately read all the comments about never failing and getting oiled up and stuff um but i i do enjoy when you guys are like what he he knows that bander he knows that thing i thought he was just the idiot on the screen we just talked about chess for 30 minutes every day that part is also true anyway queen f4 uh andrew looking for an end game and we do get one but here hans finds a very nice idea bishop takes knight removing the defender of the queen and now you can take the queen but you're going to lose the bishop but since you're going to lose the bishop anyway you play what's called a zuk in between move disper desperado bishop takes f7 it's called a desperado it's when you sacrifice a piece you know you're going to lose on your own terms and then you proceed with the game as plan so you give a check this wouldn't work by the way if the queen was there cuz it wouldn't be hanging but also could just take uh and now he's up a pawn and and andrew's got to defend himself and hans goes directly for the end game cuz he studied enough magnus games and probably court documents so rook e1 b7 is hanging look at this i mean this is this is methodical this is magnesian all right uh call him hnus nanson rook a1 knight d4 just pristine trading the pieces let's get that knight versus the bishop let's get the rooks now let's advance what's actually funny is that the computer did not like that like it wanted to keep pieces on the board it wanted white to just expand like this it seems like this is a natural continuation but because white's extra pawn is a g pawn which is doubled white according to the computer doesn't have a big advantage um so i mean you still got to play chess right so hans is expanding the other reason white doesn't have a big advantage this pawn is so weak so hans really would like to give it up and he does right he he suppresses the black position but look at that look at andrew hong defending his king the king is suffocated but the bishop is on a4 rook b6 a4 and now we just get into a scramble both guys 10 seconds 15 seconds on the clock anything goes andrew hong you know oh my goodness g5 is terrifying hans gives up a pawn to win it back he gives us a bond to win it back he's threatening maid he's threatening knight g5 and rook b8 rook e5 defending but knight f2 rerouting both guys at like 5 seconds now and in another scramble uh-oh uh-oh it takes moves of the game for hans to finally break through repl that move with two seconds on the clock bishop b3 tries to disconnect but check and knight f6 and it's the arabian mate knight and rook in the corner of the board and that's it he gets the win oh my goodness that was out of nowhere the only defensive scheme here was to target the knight i i guess you could run your king out of the pin but bishop f5 h6 the thing is if you take the knight there there's no there's no losing i mean you know you can get to oh oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa you would take the pawn i thought the pawn was protected um so you just take the knight and there's no more attack but he wins the scramble and you know this set up a uh a a a crazy matchup and uh this game was was unbelievable i was watching this game live while suffering through my own title tuesday and um this game was nuts because it was 96 moves hikaru versus hans 96 moves keep in mind hans earlier talked try was like i can't believe magnus is is not playing for a win against me beat me play against me and then oh my goodness e4 in this game my man caro kh this is the biggest match up on chess.com yesterday 3293 3227 if we lived multiple lifetimes and combin our chess abilities we wouldn't even be this high rated uh hikaru plays a2 knights a very solid positional approach we will look at it from h's perspective bishop g4 it's a very common move order there are many you give up the light squared bishop and then you just basically regroup on the light squares now now what frequently happens in these positions is white plays a very solid setup and the position gets very closed but we just saw this so i mean we we just saw a position what happens when when both guys just play each other to a draw well you know uh we have knight d7 right and and queen e2 is played in order to just like use the f pawn to attack black the way i like to play this position i like to put my knights like this all right g6 bishop g7 i play very solidly hans plays d4 that's a very committal decision when you play against bishops you generally want to repace the pawn structure you don't have a bishop on you don't have a light squared bishop so it would be good to keep it exactly like this you don't want to open things up the advantage immediately goes 45 right 0.5 to white if you try to open up the position so d4 now hans's already violating some principles he puts a pawn on a dark square and he potentially could open up the center now if you play c5 f4 you know b6 bishop g2 like as you can see white has a major advantage now right if you're playing on the wrong color complex you're allowing the other side to open the board up you're doing it wrong hans now plays h5 what yeah i guess the idea is to play bishop g2 and even h4 i mean just like make you know make white have these holes then play e5 and and and see you're locking away the white pieces so hikaru plays h4 himself now hans locks the position but but h3 so hikaru is going to have a long-term advantage bishop d6 knight e7 c3 c5 and look as we can tell i mean white's got some good pieces but he's very restricted but this is going to be a long game hikaru locks the position up doesn't allow hans to touch the center anymore and in a close position it's about who controls the pawn breaks a6 b5 g6 f5 you're really never going to play f5 you play f5 you're a psycho that's that's never going to happen queen e7 and hikaru begins preparing a3 it's going to be a long game a5 so this is what i find fascinating about this position is that he traded his light squared bishop yet he has five out of eight pawns on dark squares yet his bishop is garbage and yet the position is equal because it's so closed and he's fighting against hikaru's pawn breaks if hikaru can't make a pawn break in this position we're just going to make a draw so b3 g6 f6 look at hans just creating this barrel right if this knight could kangaroo to d5 like for example king d8 if you couldn't take the knight and this got look look at look look white immediately is completely winning completely winning right because the knight gets in but you can't do that there's no way for the knight to get here f4 king c7 hans walks his king out of the center of the board escorts the king and now rook f8 big question what's going to happen over here right rook a1 right both guys making preparations now karu jumps into the position the idea is very simple if you take this gets weak i take e4 is a clearance open diagonal and i destroy you in the long run hans says no thanks g5 and now is a very big moment because if hikaru does this it's over the game's over no one's ever going to win the position's too close so hikaru is trying to win he's trying to keep a flexible opportunity he takes and he keeps trying to open the position hun shuts it down but the way this works now white has a pass pawn pawn's a passer someone's going to have to watch the pawn this might be weak in the long run right so so many things at play right now hikaro is now going to have to wrap around he does he begins building up on the b it's a fascinating game building up on the b file rook a1 he gets the king to the corner hans plays rook g8 defending himself enabling the movement of his queen and the knight to f6 hikaru plants the knight on h3 for long-term pressure knight h7 queen d1 and hikaru's plan here is stall hans out overload hans's nervous system break through the position and get a win b6 rook a2 queen f6 guys are shuffling it's exactly the hans game in m in the magnus game but that one was a dead draw now look at hans hans doesn't have to do anything but hans plays a4 this dude does not have to move he can wait and wait and wait and finally he's like you know what i'm going to call the shots tough moment for hikaro who takes on a4 he spends 17 seconds he takes on a4 and now hans controls the final remaining pawn break in the position if there's a chance that hans breaks through in the future with b5 we we might we might have something happen all right bishop d1 rook a7 this is nuts 40 moves a4 now there's no pawn breaks now you can't play b5 it's just never going to work but pawn moves you jump in rook a3 all right both guys at around a minute knight f6 wait a minute g5 is hanging g5 is hanging but if you take g5 then you have to calculate knight g4 but then there might be knight e6 but then you can can sack the queen maybe oh my god i i don't even know like you don't even have to do that you might just be able to immediately rotate so maybe hearu is like do i really want this pawn he spends a long time he doesn't take it he spends 25 seconds he doesn't take the pawn that that might have been a moment there i mean the computer liked it but it was very dangerous rook a5 knight f2 it's a huge game of shuffling now karo's king is blocking look at hans hans in this position this i'm going walk my king to the other side of the board it's a deceptively dead position it's anything but dead there is enough room for both guys to maneuver their pieces to certain situations like knight h3 knight g1 knight f3 both guys can sacrifice at some moment they're both going to get down very low on time and then one of them is going to strike they both got 20 seconds they're shuffling pressure is building white could put his queen there and pressure g5 bishop c1 queen d8 oh my goodness this is so stressful bishop d2 queen d6 shuffling 65 moves 20 seconds versus n9 for huns bishop e7 bishop f6 hikaru reposition positioning oh my goodness he's taking over maybe 70 moves knight f8 knight h7 knight b4 bishop b1 something's got to give somebody is going to have to do something at some point knight e1 queen c6 knight c2 hans waited for white to kind of tie his shoes together a little bit oops and with 4 seconds on the clock he takes on d3 take take he is now losing however he's got a piece for two pawns and if he gets out of the way e4 is coming anything can happen now the winning move here is knight a3 bringing the queen to defend the rook and then you go rook b3 and then you can stabilize but hikaru plays this and now h is winning if he puts the queen on h1 and the idea is this is mate that's mate and it's really hard to stop because if you play rook f3 i play e4 somehow you can't defend yourself and you can't move the bishop because i was pinning you queen h1 is winning but hans goes back cuz he's trying to play e4 he's trying you know queen h1 is a really tough move to spot right he could have played knight a3 and the defense knight a3 queen h1 is that now you can move the bishop so you move the bishop you get a queen trade and white is completely winning because there's no queen anymore so hans misses queen h1 so does hikaru but now here comes hans pieces and this is a really tough position because hans got his pawns rolling hikaru doesn't play bishop g2 he sacks the knight back so he sacks the knight back gets the second pawn back and now he's going to win his rook hans takes on c4 karu takes on a8 rook takes a8 this is unbelievable so karu is up a point of material he's got 20 seconds h has 5 seconds on the clock okay queen queen d3 obviously if you trade queens i already been over this you're going to lose the end game it's going to be a long boring end game so queen d5 but queen f3 uhoh uhoh now what you have to trade the queens oh hikaro is cleaning up but hans activates his knight bishop to g1 from hikaru rook to d8 ready to push the pawn and now hikaru needed to actually go back because the pawn is about to get rolling but he plays a5 and hans plays d3 just runs the pawn away the better move apparently would have been to take first and what happens there is if you take rook a5 d3 you lose the knight i go d2 and then you know you can do this and it's going to be a draw but instead of that hun blunders blunders in parenthesis and now rook f1 actually saves the day rook f1 saves the day because you you actually can't take you actually now you lose the race now i get to play rook d1 so you lost the race that was the key difference is that the other way the rook never got to the f1 square fast enough so now rook f1 is winning now hikaru here mentally prepares bishop takes c5 and then he can win this pawn he also mentally prepares bishop c5 d2 and rook d3 but there's a difference which rook you put on d3 if hikaru plays rook fd3 like this hansen queen and it's defended but also there is bc5 and the pawn promotes c4 rook d8 bishop d8 a7 d1 queen a8 queen and uh it's a draw it's going to end with perpetual check probably but hikaru plays this rook to d3 and that is l losing because after this like i just showed you there's a difference right a6 c4 rook d8 bishop d8 and if white plays a7 d1 queen i mate you instant replay if you move your f rook to d3 then what happens is after this long sequence you have an a rook not an fr rook so i cover the diagonal but what happens in this game not this rook moving and opening the diagonal what happens in this game hear moves the a rook so when this sequence of moves goes down bc rook d8 excuse me bc a6 and this sequence you block your own queen and so hans wins hikaru plays rook d3 in the game d2 rook d3 and the game is over because of the promotion crazy bc rook d8 bishop d8 a6 d1 queen and it even goes down like this and that's just over even if even the pawn made it even if the pawn made it right because instead of taking hikaru should have just pushed so hans beats hikaru that's crazy he beats hikaru he gets to his lifetime peak elo of 3,230 and then he tweets i guess i'll show it to you if you got the patience don't go anywhere i got you right now he tweets out hey hikaru how about a blitz match good game today uh i'll show it to you right now crazy just i can't i can't i can't believe this is the timeline we live in good game today hikaro why don't we play a blitz match for charity loser donates $110,000 to the winner's charity of choice kindly waiting for your reply and uh hans won his first ever title tuesday with 10 out of 11 points wow we got to get a cage match is what we got to do we gota oh my goodness oh my goodness hans demon is 3230 on chess.com blitz he's the third highest rated blitz player on ch.com right now uh he he he's yelling at magnus to play him for a win and then magnus doesn't want to lose and he's beating hikaru and challenging him to $10,000 blitz matches what a time to be alive what a time to be alive i just when i thought that content was drying out i mean good lord we are back in better than ever i'll see you for the next one get out of here for now
