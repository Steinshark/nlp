when a gaming pc shows up in a giant pelican case we always know there's going to be some kind of cool gimmick but the problem is a lot of the time they end up being all flash no dash this one is the exact freaking opposite this was hand tuned by the one and only alan slave gliebersuch one of the world's top overclockers and the gimmick here is anyway the gimmick here if you could even call it that is that every possible dial every knob every bell every whistle has already been perfectly tuned to make this the absolute fastest gaming computer that money can buy how much money you ask it's so much that he doesn't even know well i for one cannot wait to take it for a spin now let's spin over to our sponsor glass wire instantly see who or what your pc is talking to on glasswire's network monitoring graph plus see what your computer may have connected to in the past use code linus to get 25 off at the link below right out of the gate there are some unexpected design choices here starting of course with cooling the key night among you might have noticed that there is no water cooling anywhere instead what we've got is a bank of three 140 millimeters two'0 millimeter fans a 140 millimeter exhaust and then a gigantic mesh back on this case from fractal that slave says allows him to overclock this thing to the max without resorting to having any liquid near your computer but you need more than just airflow to deal with intel's 12th gen core i9s and that is where this comes in this thermosyphon cooler from ice giant is actually competitive with the best dual aio coolers on the market and they have a copper version coming did you bring it i did bring it you brought it okay i want to see it that's that doesn't seem copper to me the bottom oh that's all they had to turn wait the they turned the base copper and that was good for nine degrees yep shut up did they change anything else nothing i can comment on right now wow the point is this is the best of the best when it comes to air-cooled components and it gets even bester this cpu is not a regular core i9 12900 ks this is a slave edition so the oem that he's working with to actually put these things together ironside computers will buy a hundred 12 900 ks's which if you're not familiar are the top bin of intel's 16 core chip right now they'll buy a hundred of them only the top 10 make it into the slave pc and it gets even better than that for ram not only did g-skill create a special splave edition 6400 cl32 kit they silkscreened his logo on it and naturally it's overclocked even past that of course the question is how much does 6600 megatransfer per second versus 6 400 mega transfer per second really matter how much can you even overclock this thing once intel already essentially overclocked the bloody things out of the factory oh to find out we went ahead and using off-the-shelf components we built our own slave pc that's right we've got the same 3090ti ftw3 we've got okay it's not the same as rock uh tai chi is it a tai chi board we've got a maximus whatever extreme we're up to now we've got a knock to a cooler imagine apologizing for the knock to a cooler in your knockoff the point is we're gonna bench this against that and see just how much professional overclocking tuning actually helps quick andy matt you missed the whole boot sequence the fast computer i guess the first question then is am i gonna notice am i gonna notice a difference like should i fire up a game that i play all the time and see if i can even tell yeah absolutely wait a second have have you done any like windows process tuning or anything like that because this is extremely low cpu usage on about point six percent of the desktop maybe okay but for real have you no no really windows 11. i think the task scheduler is is pretty good okay i haven't touched one of them that much you know what no we're going straight to the bios what have you actually changed then here's what ended up getting changed for voltage mode we go from stable to oc not stable who needs stability why why would you change microcode update the 16 microcode performs better than the current one for all core loads got it i actually didn't know that you could roll back previous microcode another reason to have an asrock motherboard you've actually now this is interesting you've actually undervolted right the cpu well that's not really what most people do when they overclock can you explain why you've done that so i uh undervolted the cpus because they are so highly binned we're able to do so and with doing that and through controlling the power limits uh we're able to hold the boost clocks longer for multi-core 5.5 is never a problem with the ks turbo standard never a problem right we'll see the idea was to have the best silicon uh in order to maintain those high frequencies for longer from for multi-threaded like your r20 or your blender or other programs that are for productivity will it be faster for gaming in this configuration or not really um it should hold boost tire so it should give you higher clocks and everything okay a lot a lot a lot of tuning to the memory here holy crap balls we've changed the dram gear mode uh yes i overclocked now you've got intel stream tuning utility on here surely we're not using that are we no that's just for monitoring yeah or uh some score testing stuff we did got it okay what should i have open what's your preferred tool are you hardware info kind of character sure do you have like firmware on here though can i just can i just see what it'll actually hold just don't kill the card please or did you want to buy a piece i mean it's not my problem because you want to buy a pc that doesn't have a cost yeah just give us your credit card information all we know so far is that it's a lot of dollars or really a lot of rubles for comparison the one that we built is 5100 and it costs more than anything cool from lttstore.com like our new colors of water bottles available in 40 ounce and 22 ounce holy sh nikes we're at 470 watts we went beyond the scale of the gpu power breakout graph what are you doing man i don't know i've never run this program before what clocks are we at show graph 1400 yeah cool i don't know is that good i have no idea we'll see over here we're going to blow a breaker in my kitchen if we try and run this and that and i make some toast how's this one doing it's marginally slower we're getting a little bit under 1300 megahertz really because i am managing in the mid 1300s even actually high 1300s just shy of 1400 what's the power 450 watts okay so we squeezed a little more power out of this one even though it's the exact same model of gpu huh man this this card throws heat man it's going right into the cpu cooler though is that not a concern no okay you'll see you'll see you'll see he says okay fine you know what fine i feel challenged now because this guy's all cocky up in here hey where's my cinebench at are you running both of these at the same time yeah linus's electrical test yeah let's see if they wired up my house properly three two one and let's go boys oh man you know what i think that's why my gpu is getting more clocks than yours the second we fired up a cpu test my gpu power draw and my gpu clocks dropped so i think it's a question of how well the cpu can actually keep up with driving the gpu that hard also have you thermal throttled oh yeah instantly what with an nhd14 oh that's a 15. yeah i can't handle it wait oh i did too yeah that makes sense uh oh clock watchdog timeout i think we blue screened this one's at 280 watts actually no more like 240 on the cpu and then what's the gpu at now i bet it's way down there we go oh wow 450 watts 450 watts that's a lot of watts but your thermal throttle i'm very much there as well okay let's back off the fur mark let's cina cinebench drag race them yeah the cpu package is at 115 right now so is it possible that this cooler moved again on you it's possible okay well that could be a problem might have been a little damaged in shipping here unfortunately okay we might have to go a little easier on you instead of going full fur mark and uh cinebench r23 at the same time in fairness though it's actually managing to hold both of them now yeah that's good in spite of the reported thermal throttling though almost all of our p cores are running at five gigahertz what are yours running at uh oh this test didn't keep on running let's just see here 4.4 4.5 damn that's a big difference oh i just blue screened again though we might have found our culprit the fan profiles didn't apply we're fixing them splay's fixing them i'm watching okay core temperature core temperatures are now at 94 degrees all you did was reseed it yeah it must have shifted ah i mean not to say that water cooling is better but that is an advantage is the heavy components of your cooler are mounted to things that don't matter and then you've got nice lightweight blocks mounted to the cpu socket they are less likely to shift during shipping however if you guys are gonna have this packed in nice and tight i would imagine that will resolve that for the end user but if you have mondo rubles and you buy your self-display of pc what's it called slave pc okay i got it right and your temps are not great call your courier one thing i'm curious about whoa i'm hitting five to five point one now oh i don't have any under five sorry sorry i didn't mean to cut you off just this is cool it's way cooler than what you're doing well i wonder if just because of like power and stuff if i hit this one that one will become unhappy are we even on different circuits or are we on the same one i have no clue okay that's holding it's holding well that's way better and i have not thermal throttle i did exceed the core power limit but that's exactly what slaves said was going to happen so it is power limited to prevent the thermals from getting out of control it is tuned oh it crashed alex i was doing fine until you started running your crap machine interesting i wonder if that's actually it wait it's not it didn't crash oh it didn't no it's actually still running when that got shut off was that it yeah we turned this off and came back your house is cursed oh no it's totally still running all the benchmarks too fur mark is still running cinebench is still running in the background i've never seen anything like it one other thing that i learned before is that having our wireless microphones on causes a lot of interference so maybe it's the combination of these which is brutal for overclocks and this and linus's bad power was enough to just tip her over the edge because now it's fine i did manage to thermal throttle so my belief is that the heat being kicked off the gpu because we're running two power viruses essentially at once here going right into the cooler is affecting us but because we're sitting at anywhere from 105 to 110 on our peak course i think if we could squeeze a few more degrees out of a better cooler that would actually resolve it anyway let's play some games no do maternal that's fine i have two and a half gig internet it's the internet cpu test right it doesn't take long that's right this is actually an excellent cpu benchmark how fast is it check this out we are sucking back i saw it peak at over 40 percent of this 12 900 ks that has the snot overclocked out of it and that was only at 100 megabytes a second okay we're at 123 megabytes a second 141 144 we're at 60 cpu you hear those fans go fur mark barely managed to get the fans going but downloading games on steam that's the real benchmark whoa we peaked at 77. we're at 64 right now look at this she's going boys oh i bumped the power cable and i think it shut down i mean i don't know that this is the world's most amazing it doesn't look like it i wonder why we're having power troubles well i look i don't know alex this is gonna be the big test at the same settings running the same game does the tuned pc outperform our stock one and is it really stock like did you enable xmp and all the good stuff xmp is enabled multi-core enhancements on it's not even really stock it's like good stock okay you're marginally faster than me should i be expecting a big difference it's the same hardware all right but there was so much stuff changed in the bios 220 220 a little higher but we're talking like 5 fps okay spoil it for me then you already did the proper benchmarking how much faster is it in games five percent across the board pretty much no matter gpu cpu bound five percent faster okay i mean that's actually not insignificant what about like minimum frame times though five percent faster okay so just min max average just it's a little faster yeah well you want to run ida let's run ida let's do a let's do a read test so we're running at i think it's 50 oh 5200 cl 38 wow that is a lot faster you're like 20 faster well depending on the workload then if we're doing something really memory intensive this thing could absolutely crap all over our stock machine but then we could also put better memory in our stock machine sure and most of the performance gain is in the tertiary timings not in the main ones you see so the 32 42 42 58 yeah i mean some would see 42 versus 38 and think that one's better but in fact those don't matter as much as the timings you don't even see in windows those all those timings we changed in the bios right in a nutshell display of pc must be hard to have it judged right in front of you is what you'd expect it to be it's a balls to the wall tuned overclocked machine which is going to come with all the things that come with that yes it's going to be faster but it's going to come at an additional cost i don't know exactly how much at this point in time and well when you're flying that close to the sun your wings night might not get burned but it is possible they could get a little singed meaning that if there are any environmental variables around you say for example you live in a very hot climate or your power is a little unstable in your house well it's not undergoing the same kind of validation that it would in somewhere in like intel or nvidia's lab where they're ensuring that out in the real world no matter what you throw at it it's going to run as expected you know for this pc you can afford a ups then she'll run great that's a fair point anyone with a pc worth more than i'd say a thousand bucks for the tower should have a ups on it so your mileage may vary but it'll certainly be fast mileage just like this fast segue to our sponsor drop looking for a new keyboard check out drop's expression series keystream keyboard it features
