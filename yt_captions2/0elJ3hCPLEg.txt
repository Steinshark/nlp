ladies and gentlemen why do we play the game of chess do we play it because it's mentally and emotionally stimulating and challenging do we play it to feel intellectually dominant versus our opponents to defeat our children or maybe our elders or our bosses at work or do we play chess for pleasure there's several things in life that could bring you pleasure and chess is one of them now i got famous in 2023 for screaming the rook very loudly and that is what i'm going to show you in today's game this is a chess game that i played yesterday you will definitely learn at least five things from this chess game while simultaneously seeing two brilliant moves and everybody knows that brilliant moves are the cornerstone of chess and i sacrificed the rook the most iconic sacrifice that there is in chess sit back relax enjoy this game i'd love to share it with you uh this was part of one of my worst chess tournaments ever like literally ever i lost five games to players 200 points lower than me i don't know what was wrong with me yesterday but there is nothing wrong with me in this game and i hope you enjoy it all right here we go i was playing a fed master from spain a lot of very good chess players in spain uh and uh i opened up the game with pawn to e4 my opponent played the move e6 french defense now there's a lot of ways to play against the french defense the classical way to play against the french defense is to play pawn d4 but i was feeling feisty and i was tilted which is very important because when you're tilted you take a lot more risk and you do things more stupidly so i play the move b3 and this is actually uh one of the lines that i recommended in in in the oldest course that i've made and to this day it is the most popular one it's it's the e4 course new york style and the idea is very simple you are playing a gambit you are just giving up that pawn that you put in the center of the board but if black takes it then you will try to win it back and then you will try to castle queens side now black could defend this pawn with absurd moves like queen d4 but in general you will castle win the pawn back have an active bishop and even try to attack like this when your opponent castles this way that's a very interesting gambit it's very interesting which is why people decline it you see you see i was very upset when my opponent did not accept my gambit but the good news is i don't have to lose a pawn if this is played and i get to play pawn to e5 so now at least i advancing i have blocked my bishop but that's fine and the knight now has to go backwards knight to d7 now two things have already happened okay three things number one the center is now locked so there's going to be a lot of locked center space here number two i advanced here which means i'm going to focus here they are going to focus here all right which means i probably won't castle this way and they probably won't castle this way so we're about to see some very interesting stuff i played this natural move f4 uh sometimes in the french you do take more space with your king pawns again because you are anticipating that they will castle this way and these pawns will be very useful in the future attack so i played f4 and black played the best move which is c5 taking pawn space on that side of the board and then they're going to put the knights behind the pawn so they're going to put the knight here they're going to try to play b5 and then put the knight there okay now i played queen g4 the computer calls this move it inaccuracy but it it this is why trusting game review is a little bit dicey the op the computer doesn't really know openings that well cuz like now now it's sequel right the idea of queen g4 is to prevent the bishop from developing and if the bishop wants to develop by moving that pawn that pawn will now be a target in the future for your h pawn so you have made black make a commitment queen g4 is a nice idea and then you develop your knight and your queen just menacing l stares at this little rectangle here it's a it's it's one of the ways to play it's not an inaccuracy stockfish can can shut its stupid mouth knight to c6 knight to f3 and now the plan for black is to do this the plan for me is to attack over here however my opponent played h5 uh this is a move intended to dislodge the comfort of my queen also i do not want to trade queens because then i'm not going to be able to have any sort of attack so i went queen h3 which pins the pawn to the rook and maybe i can play g4 in the future black played a6 bishop to e2 and b5 okay we have both made uh nine moves black has done everything that i said that they would do and i have done everything that i said i would do it's a very closed position in closed positions you are looking for your advancement of pawns you are looking where you can play with your pawns and you are looking where your pieces are going to go so if i'm playing with white here i'm looking at knight to g5 right i'm not going to castle this way cuz i'm going to die in an avalanche uh but i will castle that way and hide my king in the corner and then maybe maybe i will move any of these pawns any number of these pawns but again i have an advantage here that's where you have to find your advantage so i'm always wondering when that move f5 is going to be possible it's not possible right now cuz my king is in the center and if i try to bulldoze in with my queen i'm just going to get slapped that's just not going to work so uh so in this position i played a move the computer doesn't like i played a4 i thought it was a good move the computer is not so convinced um but the advantage is still relatively in the balance i just really wanted my opponent to play b4 that's just was the idea and i thought if knight b4 i'll just play bishop d1 or knight a3 defending right so my opponent did play b4 so i played a4 they played b4 and now they took away that square from their knight i thought all right well this is an accomplishment for me now i'm going to castle apparently castling is an inaccuracy even though the evaluation stays the exact same this is why stockfish just needs to just just choke on some food like not die i don't need it to die all right stiff neck but i do need it to just just shut up just leave me alone again it's like if a phd student walked to a local elementary school and sat in a classroom of third graders and yelled things at them that they didn't know things and that they were stupid no you know what i'm not going to hide it cuz everybody likes the evel bar castle there's nothing wrong with castling all right pawn 2 a5 apparently a mistake this one a bit more of a mistake a5 is a feel-good move you play this move cuz you're like yay all my pawns are together but a5 every time you make a pawn move you're going to learn something right now every time you make a pawn move it strengthens something it weakens something so that pawn now really thoroughly bolsters this but it gave up the b5 square and now what do i do i'm going to exploit the b5 square now again computer saying in accuracy but the evaluation literally did not change right game review operates on a different depth of engine sometimes so maybe i didn't have to play bishop b5 right away but in the future the point is you are giving me that square so i played bishop b5 and black went queen b6 defending which again somehow is deemed a mistake this one is a bit more of a mistake because the queen needed to keep eyes over here the computer now already thinks i can begin active operations but i'm a human i saw this i saw the king so what did i do i played king to h1 which i thought you know that's a sensible decision because now there's no discovered check turns out i should have never been afraid of that i should have just won f5 if black played c4 check then i would have won king h1 and nothing would have been different but you know aaron nimo once famously said uh that uh the threat is more valuable than the execution right that's that that scared me so i decided to just acknowledge it right now i thought it was a decent move now bishop to a6 a very very very logical move in my opinion deemed in inaccuracy by stockfish which has this point is a recurring theme in this game um but again makes no difference it's a good move because if i take the bishop uh now black just has a very very powerful diagonal attacker so i thought i need to plug that i need to make sure nothing gets out of that position so the move that i thought here which was very clever is c4 also deemed inaccurate this is just funny at this point um but the point is if takes then i would just take and then you're not getting me out right like i'm going to keep all of this blocked now i c4 anticipating on pant but then i would have taken with the knight which would have defended the bishop if black went d4 i would have went knight e4 take take take best part all of that happened so when i played c4 i was ready to plug b5 my opponent realized they can take on pant and then remove the defender my knight is guarding my bishop i don't want to take because that would open up diagonals d4 is a removing the defender tactic but i didn't miss it my logic here was that after i move my knight and my opponent plays take take take thinking this idiot lost a pawn and not only did they lose a pawn there's also this hanging after which this is hanging they must have thought they were in good shape they're not in quite great shape yet why next thing you're going to learn in you learned already about close positions about moving upon pawn in chess the two most important things are material and king safety in this position black is a pawn up but black's king is still in the center black is not going to castle this way because that's like building a house with no windows black might castle this way but then you're walking directly into my queen and my knights and then my pawn here it's a very tough position so i thought i got f5 on the way and i went f5 i sacrificed a second pawn i decided i'm going to go knock on this door because when i take on e6 my rook is opening and then i have six 11 20 points of material going straight down so material king safety counterbalancing my opponent decided i'm going to grab the second pawn i don't believe you i'm now down two pawns that is a big advantage maybe not at your level or you know the tra the checks and balances of chess at 600 happen at like queen level you know i'm down a rook and a knight or whatever two pawns is a lot okay and i thought all right what's next i'm going to take now this is considered a slight inaccuracy it's actually called a miss apparently i should have went knight g5 first applying more pressure but i had an idea i took with the pawn if my opponent takes like this i'm going to move and get my rook in if they take with the queen a very big moment you do not want to trade the queens if you are losing you also don't want to trade the queens don't want to trade the queens the what was that if you don't want to trade the queens if you are attacking right now i'm down two pawns and i am attacking i don't want a queen trade queen g3 however now here comes this pawn knocking on the door h4 and some of you might be looking like wait a minute can't black take on e5 yes black could be up three pawns in this position but it's not very safe i have ideas like queen f3 which simultaneously attacked this and the rook it's a very dangerous position material and king safety very very important in chess so instead of that my opponent deflected my queen out of the center when i went queen g3 by playing h4 i slid forward and they went h3 which which is a very natural looking move because i'm probably going to have to address that i'm going to have to take and if i don't take then take take but i realize something another thing that you're going to learn don't use general descriptions in chess do not describe things in chess with words look at this position this pawn is about to take and attack the king many of us would say white's king is in so much much danger white's king is so weak i have to make sure this stays closed no look at the evaluation the best move in this position and the the the way you are supposed to think not in words you're supposed to think concretely does black have a check sure you can say white's king is out in the open can black attack it or not and that is why in this position i went knight to g5 which attacks the queen and now teams up my rook with my queen to hit f7 this is a way better move why because after pawn takes king takes you can stop here and go the king is out in the open it's so scary there are no checks the king is out in the open but it's actually black's king who is a moment away from getting vanquished banish to the shadow realm like yu-gi-oh okay black in this position plays queen d5 a natural move pinning my knight not letting me move and they're going to take like this here white can already play knight takes f7 but instead i opened up the door for my queen pawn to e6 i thought this was a great move getting out of the way of the position if pawn takes now queen f7 and i had calculated one of the most ridiculous sequences of my life in this position i calculated here i saw e6 f takes queen f7 king d8 knight e6 do that one more time f takes queen f7 king d8 knight e6 king c8 queen e8 you can't block cuz i take can't go here cuz of my knight so king b7 the rook attacks my queen but rook queen takes rook king takes knight c7 check here queen f7 king d8 knight e6 here here here it looks like the attack is over but queen a8 and you attract the king into a fork and you escape and you win a rook when i saw that i got so excited i was like i have to play e6 oh my goodness and now my friends it's coming black plays knight f6 it looks like the attack is stopped it looks like the attack is stopped because if i play pawn takes f7 check which a lot of us would do a lot of us would play pawn takes f7 and they would say the king is so open but it's not about words it's not about these general the king is so weak is there something concrete does white have a followup is there any check no because queen f5 is just a trade you don't have another check so in this position i found my first brilliant move of two queen to c7 infiltrating i had just opened the door for the queen to drive into the gates of the castle and now the queen has arrived the threat is pawn takes f7 and now the king cannot escape the king is sealed in knight takes c4 is too slow pawn takes f7 you're a move away from discovered checking me but you're not queen c7 is a brutal move but then i already thought i was winning i thought thought it was over it's also the only move to get a winning advantage my opponent played bishop e7 and suddenly it was a cold shower for me i realized now the king was going to escape and black's position is completely defended this is next and i lose and if i play d3 trying to defend myself black will take i'll go here queen h5 bringing the rook i'm in huge trouble here and i thought oh that's it i lost but i didn't lose i had the chess gods on my side in this position because my everything that i had done up to this point coordinating my knights opening up my rook making sure my king was well protected opening the door for my queen all was leading me to this moment because my friends over the past year in 2023 the biggest chess meme known to the entire planet is sacrificing something and i was looking in this position for a check and i used in this position the checklist it looks like white has absolutely nothing it looks like white is completely stuck if pawn takes check king to f8 this is not a check this is not a check and i realized attacks what is the most valuable piece in the black position the queen so in this position i played the one and only winning move and i sacrificed the rook rook to f5 the only move not only the only move to win it is the only move that doesn't lose that move changes the entire game because now black's queen is under attack the order of priorities has shifted black has to deal with an attack on their queen while not having any way to attack mine my my queen or my king this deflects the queen away from this but most importantly it deflects the queen away from the knight on c6 and you'll notice this took me 30 seconds to find rook to f5 the absolutely only move in the position that is called a deflection it's a deflection and kind of an attraction you attract the queen this way but you also deflect it off of that square and that is the only move in the position if the queen moves anywhere for black i'm going to take i also have pawn takes f7 and knight e6 just in the future my opponent goes here now i pick up a knight my opponent has to go here i pick up a rook my opponent blocks and now we have escaped and we are completely winning however in this position i did something stupid um i should have just taken this pawn and i would have won the game in two moves uh i i think i was again i you you know you know why i played rook f1 and almost lost my entire advantage according to the computer uh i was worried that my king was weak so i decided i'm going to defend my king i didn't follow my own rule my own rule is don't think in general terms there is no check and if queen here i just go here pawn takes f7 wins the game and it's not even close because after this king h1 and there is nothing and this is checkmate and that's checkmate so i did not follow my own advice this is why you have to follow follow your own advice knight to e8 i went rook f1 thinking well i'm just safe but after f6 apparently it's not over you know black is winning my pawn and black has a lot of pawns but i went here i took on a5 and um i'm still winning and black only has three seconds so king g8 and then i infiltrated and uh it's a very difficult position to defend which my opponent promptly blundered with two seconds on their clock rook takes rook g7 and they resigned because king here this is main one this game was made possible by the fact that we got into this ridiculously tangled attacking position which was deadlocked extremely locked position but the way you find your way out of lock positions is with pawn breaks and where you are stronger you got to identify you have a lot of pieces you have more space more pawns in the center black was stronger here so what i tried to do is i try to plug that side of the board but black did a very nice job here removing my defender but by removing my defender and accepting this offering they allowed me to have a lot of material here and where my queen is and their queen isn't i'm able to create an attack and that is exactly what i did i did not trade the queens and i did not think in general terms here that is why i managed to keep a cool head my king was safe and e6 opened up the door for my queen to infiltrate to c7 teaming up with my pieces together and in this position rook f5 oh my oh my and i just realized my camera is frozen i don't know how long that has been like that but uh let's reset it all right i have i guess i'm going to check the footage and i'm going to see and if it's not too bad i'll just leave it exactly as it was for 2 minutes i had no clue i i did not realiz i really hope it hasn't been like that for like 10 minutes because uh yeah that would be kind of embarrassing uh amazing uh well that is how we will wrap up today's video credit to my opponent for a great fighting game this was like one game that i won in this event um that's all i have for you uh yeah feel free to uh feel free to get out of here
