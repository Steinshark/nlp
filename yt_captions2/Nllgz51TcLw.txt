all right here we go mandela effect all right are you ready for this favorite code editors is everybody ready for just the most glorious moment of their life all right so let's start it right now okay my favorite code editor number five is uh now in my first what what i mean i thought this was gonna be something at least you know like i use vim and i make fun of people using vs code and we're gonna laugh over them and say oh you know intellij is really awesome but he just came out the gates with adam with adam adam has been deprecated and stopped it hasn't been worked on by the company that started it in how many years now what what kind of weird ass start to this whole thing is this i am i'm just confused i'm absolutely confused by this take all right let's go to let's go to the next one full opinion adam just looks really really nice i might be biased here but i love that number four is any jet brings product now okay i think jetbrains should have made the list i agree i mean i think jet brains that they they think about you know think about development before lsps and all that jetbrains was really awesome and when they did their community edition back in like what is it 2011 where ever everything but javascript i don't i still don't get that one was uh paid for or for free like that was really good honestly it was really really amazing i thought jetbrains they did a great job when i was using python it was fantastic right pie charm you got it pretty much for free uh it was nice this was good but number four i mean it does beat adam it should beat adam i'm just really scared with the next three are because there's only emacs vim and vs code pretty much left or helix these nuts that's i mean that's it that's all we got i don't often really use japanese products because they're really really bloated but they're super simple to use and variants jet brains is nothing but simple okay there's nothing simple about jet brains jetbrains is the single-handedly the most complex piece of software ever created i mean i get that you can press the green button and press play but it's it has one billion features that integrate with every aspect of your development life like it is it is by far not simple okay i would even call it greatly intuitive either number three is a product that i use off and this is vs code yes okay good vs code is not number one everybody that's that's that's a victory right there i'm not gonna lie to you after adam being number one i'm super scared of what number two three and two or uh two and one are gonna be i'm happy vs code is not number one everybody we should all be happy can we get some claps in here but i'm not gonna lie to you i have a strong feeling that that the rest of this is just giving notepad plus plus i swear it's gonna make it nano or notepad plus plus i swear i swear foreign because it has a bunch of extensions it's lightweight and honestly it runs like fun it it doesn't run like butter it is definitionally not lightweight it's a big ass v8 engine running that runs like eight processes all running javascript they each take up like a gig of ram there's nothing there's nothing lightweight about this whole concept of vs code like nothing this lightweight is not the proper description here okay runs like margarine runs like melted legos okay these are just hot ass legos getting poured all over the place run like churned butter baby [music] number two and i use the most often okay so what the hell is number one this is giving this give me an anxiety just thinking about it the open being number two i can respect that okay because some people are emacs chads you know they just they think it's number one i can let that go but i think okay chat real talk what do you think it's gonna be it's gonna be helix i think they're gonna he's gonna just drop helix is number one helix or notepad plus plus or sublime incoming you think nano oh man we're getting a load of nano all right before we do it let's just let's just do a quick poll because i do i i want to see this what is what is the the thoughts of the new one here i'm just gonna go like this what is it oh actually now let's not do a poll let's do a prediction you got to put some dollars on the line here okay what's number one emacs helix nano note pad plus plus google docs or something else all right what is it gonna be what is it gonna be a google docs microsoft word microsoft word google docs will be the same so if you get microsoft word add the standard editor it could be uh sorry no no gambling from sweden uh pull people uh can cheat i know this will i think this is good this is a bet nightshade dude no this is a bet this is good there's no cheating oh yeah there is cheating don't be a d don't be a doo-doo head and go look up the name i even think about that [laughter] there's people that already saw this that are like easy money so my guess is it's something else all right here we go it's gonna be sublime or some something some nonsense is coming in isn't it all right here we go vim is great because it has a bunch of extensions even more than bs code and its key bindings are amazing in my opinion it's almost perfect but the most why am i being trolled like this this why are we living this life right now is pretty good okay it was pretty good because he was pretty i i think adam had to be the start on on purpose just to make people so upset and then finish it off with notepad plus plus i feel like this was all on purpose this we are being had right now we're being had what i just watched is bs we're being had
