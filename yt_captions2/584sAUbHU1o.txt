so uh yeah my unpopular opinion is that git is awful and it needs to die die die die wow why why why why why yeah well because it doesn't scale uh among other things also it's completely unintuitive and it's honestly it's it's oh god you're gonna get me ranting uh look first of all i've seen i don't get the unintuitive part i guess because i used svn and perforce those don't feel very intuitive either as fian emotionally hurt me i did love tortoise though tortoise svn and a company that bisco and i both worked at computers unlimited which sounds like a 1970s computer repair shop so they renamed it tim's which is now sounds like a fishing shop um they had a even rapper around everything called trebuchet which everyone just called tree bucket and i hated it i hated my life i hated it i hate it i don't want to go back to svn the thing is is that i don't mind specifically on something like this i don't mind if you on it but i want to hear a good alternative all right let's let's see some alternatives here visions of control systems come and go right i started with rcs and then cvs and then svn and then pert force and it went on and on piper at google and and then get in mercurio and i mean get was just another one and it had great marketing it had great it had some sort of great virality it's really kind of garbage the whole thing is just it's very powerful and flexible but uh and it doesn't scale like fundamentally all the companies that we work with that use git have you know maybe a hundred thousand git repos what what are you gonna do with a hundred thousand git repos you know android struggled with this mightily when i was uh on the android team at google right i mean just we had all these huge rappers around git to deal with multiple repos because of the open source problem and you know the internal stuff and i just learned to hate git but is that a git problem was that a git problem or was that not a git problem you have part of first off you have part of your thing that's open source part of it that's not open source by the way the not open source part that's the spying part that's the nsa backdoor issue you know what i'm talking about that's the back door part um anyway so when you're hiding your back door now you're trying to have like two repos that are going together i mean that's always difficult like is that ever easy i don't think it is sub modules did you just say the word sub module sub module is the world's greatest idea that is emotionally painful every time it happens nobody likes sub modules everybody thinks sub modules are going to be good nobody loves sub modules we still use sub modules i hate it here i hate git and i think that there's an unhealthy dependence on both git and github i think that's fair i think the github reliance thing is actually a real that that's a fair critique which is now we we really just wrapped up a single point of failure um and it's also owned by microsoft so i don't trust it at all now i'm just wondering when the next monetization is going to come out from it other than using all my sweet sweet programs whether or not my license says not to for co-pilot but besides for that i'm just saying github is a monopoly they're closed fundamentally i think that that micro microsoft under satya has been a very open ecosystem right look at vs code yeah right look at i mean they've been some really cool stuff but github i don't i don't trust this guy's opinion anymore this is getting hard for me to really love this opinion because i'm just saying that's that's a hard opinion to believe that it's just really open when a copilot x works only for vs code uh they're building these sp these like spaces online and everything they're just trying to take your computer take everything and just charge you monthly for it i don't trust microsoft one bit it's an acquisition and they're still very oh we're just doing free and we love [music] we look really when has a company ever been really great for no reason come on very very closed off and you know uh and i i don't i i think developers like github too much i mean maybe the alternatives aren't that great but like i i see this uh you like it just too much too much liking going on it will stop from here on out um i do get what he's saying though i do get what he's saying it's a great pro i mean the thing is it's a good product have you used stash stash is not that much fun okay i haven't used gitlab i don't have enough use with gitlab to really understand it it's attachment to it and i'm like stuff changes and you're not holding a high enough bar it's not good enough you should never be satisfied with the state of the art if it's killing you and right now the state of the art is killing us how's it killing us yeah 100 000 repos every company okay that's the killing us but why is that bad i gotta understand why is having multiple repos bad why is having netflix's python slash whatever the hell the language is repo that is designed to help produce algorithmic recommendations separated from the ui library why why is that good or bad right to me i don't i don't i don't think i don't see why they have to be the same code base right i don't even see why they're related but who's feeling that pain i'm not feeling that pain well you don't have that many repos is anybody working on this who's working on this well facebook just launched what is it sapling right which looks kind of promising although it didn't start taking the getting the acceleration that i was looking at but changing code hosts is a big deal for people you guys want an unpopular opinion on giving you like potentially the most no no we're we're with you this is part of the game here we're playing the game i'm enjoying this i'm considering it i do like github i'm wondering you said maybe they like it too much and i'm thinking the product is good though so that's why i like it like it's good it's decent you haven't used google's tools true check mate i i i'm curious about google's internal tool i've never worked at google it'd be fun to actually use like what does a company that builds everything themselves what does it look like right i know you've never used google tools i.e you never passed google's interview i.e wrecked um draw the little square proved uh but real talk i would like to try out google's tools right i've never worked at google i think it'd be a lot of fun so oh no could be cool i think i'd get bored pretty quick at google though real talk i think i think i'd get pretty i think i get pretty pretty bored so if google's tools are that much better then why doesn't google make a better revisioning system and then why doesn't google create the hosting for it and why doesn't google just simply make all the monies from it right there has to be a lot of monies on it and you got google barred the subpar ai why not just have a hosting service for free and then slurp up all the data from it some people need a source graph another source graph uh swords graph source graph i would argue is you know because the the folks at source graph actually love github and haven't used google's tools source staff is you know i mean source graph is better than github in a lot of ways but you know source graph doesn't try to be github with all the workflows and all that stuff right tj wrecked tj tj is in shambles tj are you in shambles right now shambled tj shout out can we get a shout out for tj he works at sourcecraft why would i be in shambles uh because you're just like a not as good github as what i take from this and github's killing people so that means you're killing people faster what i mean by that is they beyond work there and quinn worked there the history of knowing google tools using google google tools and then being an expat of google and then doing something without it is what i mean by that they were the inspiration right we need yeah we need somebody to say okay i've been in google and i've used google tooling and we need a non-github that is google toying that's better a startup that knows google's tools but i can then recreate them yeah who's who's gonna do that who i think that doing that sounds unfun i'm just gonna throw it out there i don't think i would like doing that personally who would you bet on to do that you mean to to come up with a google style tool so well that's that's i really wish you would qualify what a google tool is because i think that would help a lot of us try to understand exactly what does he mean by why google is better like i love like an example or a a diagram or something something that i understand why it's better because i i guess i'm a little confused as to why it's better think angular i don't want to think about that come on man that's my dreams oh i see so this is not the beating this might be the beginning of a new story sorry the vault by the way his volume is very low it's been it's been hard i'm trying to get it as good as i can it could be i like that so git isn't good enough and i think you said github is bad i'm just trying to think of how i would love a compare feature that doesn't require me to have a pull request and then manipulate the url just saying that'd be kind of nice just give me just a button that says compare give me a button that says diff like if i was going to put this into it we're not going to try to uh if you've been trying to read the two leaves if i'm not trying to tackle github or anything like that right now karen unfortunately it's you know it's the least bad right it's the least of all the bad options least bad of all right there but i truly believe it could be a lot better and that and that ai is going to make it a lot better and um so you know i love being at source graph because we can actually bring that experience across there are still bit bucket users in the world i'm one i mean to be fair i use stash which is like that's this bit bucket so i get it i'm i'm i i netflix is all on bitbucket so you know i deal with them honestly bit bucket not all that bad we have a good setup you know if i wanna if i want some automation i click a bunch of buttons on uh jenkins for about 20 minutes until i find the job that i actually want because their search is really confusing and we have multiple sub domains to different builds once i find the build i want i copy the build and the configuration then when i get the configuration i updated the point at the new stash url and then boom i got ci ci you know what i mean it's pretty neat one oh yeah not not to get not the bit look it's great either but have you used fossil fossil scm from richard hipp from a sqlite it's a completely different way of thinking about it maybe give that a look fossil you never commit right like it's always you commit but everything's always synchronized around every piece it's still distributed but it's always synchronized it's never on your machine only you never have to get push master it's just there i don't know if it scales or not but they use it for sqlite yeah i think fundamentally we need somebody who who comes at this from the perspective of we need to make this scale up to world scale code bases okay and i think that will ultimately come out of industry i think facebook sapling might be the closest but we'll see or ask google or somebody who leaves google and says i need a company you know what's good was google's tools you know what's bad is git and i'm gonna try to tackle this that could happen still want to know what makes it better just give me a three second explanation what's the thing you know gosh i'm so curious i'm so is this actually how there is this google hiring a guy to secretly get people to want to work at google by not telling them but telling them how great their tools are is this like a psyop of the greatest amount because i'm feeling very psyopped right now i'm feeling super psy often all of a sudden i have this great desire to go work at google to go touch their tools i'm getting foreplayed this is foreplay i'm i'm what is google's tools in this case like what do they have that would be better the scale version of it why can you describe it or is it under like nda and you can't tell anything about it forever i got four played for five minutes straight and now we're hearing about it all right pre-watched no yeah it's just that like the the the the code graph you know gets exposed across the entire workflow so you know on github if you see a symbol in a pull in a pull request you know you can't click on it or hover it or get you know graph information about it you know like in your ide uh you know they don't they don't have ide quality indexing when you're you know looking at like when you're looking at trace logs or debug views or whatever all of that stuff is completely and fully instrumented at google where you know so in other words their ability to discover and diagnose problems uh is just unprecedented there's a gestalt to it that's really hard to get across that sounds like what sourcecraft's doing he works at sourcegraph right i mean that's i i love that idea i mean i would like that but that's not i mean to me what he just described isn't a git problem specifically isn't it a tool on top of git because like is the version is the revision the real thing that's needed is that what causes it or is this actually just a tool on top of code to be smarter about everything it feels like it's it's the things uh we've abstracted overkid you can use other version control systems as well yeah that's what i mean is that is the version control really the place that this should live to begin with it kind of seems like this is something bigger right this is lsp for the future how has there been three golden kappas in this chat why are people getting golden caplets i never get a golden kappa why is my kappa never golden okay yes that's also my team works on it uh we've talked about this for a while i know i know we've talked about this and we've talked about but that's what i'm saying is why i don't i don't get the the dislike forget i guess that's where i'm struggling is i don't see the connection between git and what he just described maybe one could argue that you could i mean could you store language level features in a revision system yeah because that's kind of what i see is that there's a revision system in which would have to store like stuff about what's happening because how is it supposed to understand javascript or the linking between two libraries that are internal like why would you want to do that that's just it just it fully that's why i love sourcegraph right i want more source graph in my life not less but more i want more tj but it's a very comfy environment by the way tj if i ever decide to try to get a different job i would apply for source graph just let them know that they've won me over okay and it was you if i were to apply somewhere else i'd apply source graph it's like a world scale ide almost except it's distributed internally can i use some of your words from what you wrote you this is in regards to code search at google so i would imagine there's some similarity in uh satisfaction score potentially for this um this intelligence i suppose you said by the way this guy's voice is the only normalized voice in this whole thing google codes searches like the matrix except for developers it is it has near perfect satisfaction score on google's internal surveys and pretty much every dev who leaves google misses it this is regards to code search this is the reason why source graph exists because this was only a google and everybody else needs it too you want to say google engineers today can navigate and understand their own multi-billion line code base better than perhaps any other group of devs in such a large environment so are you saying that they have a tool like gator github that's that gives net intelligence this better and no one else has access to this thing this is their proverbial secret sauce behind the scenes to be more efficient as an engineering team despite everyone now having to work on ai and kind of being behind the ball that's right okay that's right their tooling environment in fact google's entire infrastructure stack not just the tools but everything you use as a developer there even the docs and stuff are just uh just unbelievably good unstopidly good like you just come in and you're like what like it just it makes no sense like the rest of the world just feels like people just bang on rocks compared to google stuff so i have long kind of on i think how google google does stuff they're technical artifacts how they do promotions i think it creates a lot of perverse incentives but based on what he's saying maybe there are some things that are good from it this is huli propaganda i i will i do i think everyone is correct which is if they're so good at all this why do they kill everything they create netflix tooling we do not have anything like this nothing at all nothing i could never convince them to give it to the rest of the developers if killed by google google domains google optimize google cloud iot core google album archive youtube stories grasshopper conversational conversational actions google currents google street view standalone app a jacquard google code completions google stadia rip stadia uh google on hub um okay youtube originals a threaded youtube originals rap that was not uh wow oh my goodness thank you oh gosh i can't read all this oh my goodness okay some of these are fair though some of these have to be fair like google killed a google uh desktop bar desktop bar was a small inset window on the windows toolbar to allow users to perform search without leaving the desktop i could see why this would be killed right i think some of this is a little unfair on some of theirs right that was 17 years ago i know but i'm just saying a few loads i mean obviously it's fun to uh make fun of google killing tons of projects but let's be serious google's market cap is 1.7 trillion dollars like they are shipping stuff that power such an incredible amount to the world yes and so you have to explore a bunch and you have to create stuff that people like but if it doesn't make a material difference you have to kill it because you don't want to have to have staff and people hired around stuff that isn't producing anything like i get it i'm not against what they're doing but the point still stands they kill stuff i mean netflix kills a bunch of features too you just don't hear about it because our features are all within a player only steve baumer had been there screaming about developers right okay falcor falco hey hey tj you know what problem i had just yesterday my falcor client couldn't con couldn't connect to the database server on the current latest build of tvi so guess what falcore still alive felker still alive it has been developed on in literally a half decade but it's still alive that would do it that would do it well this has been a very good unpopular opinion maybe i like it yeah i appreciate it i'm still thinking about it yeah i would love to see it i'd love to see like a demo you know for the rest of the world because sometimes you don't know you're banging on rocks until you see somebody who has like a more sophisticated tool and you're like kind of like when you're in vs code and you don't realize how sophisticated it can be so then you see someone in neovim and you're just like wow up and banging on rocks this whole time like oh i could do that yeah i mean you can see you can see google code search if you just type chromium code search they've indexed it was i actually did i actually liked i do like the chromium code search stuff i used it quite a bit to explore the v8 engine it's very very good their chromium code search stuff is incredible this is on my way out it was my swanson at google uh at least in the code search team it was was was indexing the android and chromium code basis so you can play with it it doesn't have all of the functionality but it has a lot and you can see it's very slick uh you know navigation it's just it's really really good but that's only the search stuff and that's that's actually not even used that much compared to some of the other things like their their quick editor uh and uh so cider they have and then sit-see they're clients in the cloud they have basically cloud-based clients and oh my god the stuff they have is like science fiction still the stuff they had 15 years ago is still science fiction for the rest of the world like they have high speed networks and they can make they can they can do uh incred edible it's really nice it's really nice so yeah the rest of the world is kind of hurting and that's that's why i'm still in this space because i think the rest of the world needs to get to where google's at wow thank you changelog that was awesome hey that's me in my own video being promoted to me um thank you that was actually really good um i really like that i okay so i'm still confused by the get things still i i don't understand why it gets the problem on this stuff but i i understand what he's trying to say which is that the tools we use are absolutely awful comparatively to what say google has either way this is it's very interesting i would love i mean i really want to just get like an exp i want to go experience the google tools just to feel them and then take that experience and go that's what they mean this is why it's bad i would love it i would love that experience either way the name is i don't understand why it gets like so battle it's killing i don't it seems kind of intense but i guess i haven't seen the other side maybe i'm just the one with rocks here okay a gin
