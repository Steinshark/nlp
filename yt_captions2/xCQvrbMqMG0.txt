welcome to my new series called talk tech with 
tiff where i am sitting down with industry   professionals to hear about their career journeys 
and current roles i created this series to hear   from people who are established in the tech 
industry so that we can all learn what these   individuals do in their day-to-day jobs and 
the type of opportunities that are out there   okay let's get started today i'm sitting down 
with martin zhang who is currently a product   designer at nurse simple hi martin hey how's 
it going good how are you doing i'm doing great   thank you for being here yeah thank you so 
much for having me oh i was very when i was   reading about you from your bio and speaking 
to some mutual friends i was so excited to sit   down and just pick your brain because you have 
such a great and really interesting journey so   on that note i'd love to hear more about let's 
start with your current position at nurse simple   yeah okay so i'm a product designer for nurse 
simple it's a startup that was founded in toronto   i think around like two years ago and what we do 
is essentially nurse triage so as we all know i   guess being in the canadian healthcare system 
like there's a lot of like wait times and lead   times when it comes to hospitals and stuff like 
that so what we're trying to do is bring part   of that online and it's what is what we like to 
call nurse triage right being able to help nurses   and customers are i guess patients be able 
to like flow within the system a little bit   better as opposed to just waiting around right so 
having a lot of medical hair uh information being   down and documented so that it would just easily 
get i guess transferred over as opposed to just   doing it over and over again and well that's like 
our core business and i guess the core product   stuff that i haven't really been touching because 
right now what we've been working on is with um in   partnership with dynacare we're doing a lot of the 
outbound or in outbound and inbound um testing for   um people for travelers excuse me for 
entering and exiting the country for kova 19.   so for example if you're like travel outside 
to the states or like travel back into canada   into states you'd be able to book a test and 
make sure that you have you know pcr tests to   get in and out of the country fine i 
guess in terms of my current role right   there right now it's about just designing 
that and making sure that people who are   using the system can actually use it right because 
this is not like a target audience of people who   are necessarily very uh knowledgeable about how 
tech works right like these are everyone we're   talking about old people like young very young 
people everyone needs a pcr test there's no like   oh we have a very targeted market we know we can 
figure out what they want who they are and no it's   or how they use sites so that design is been a lot 
about like what i've been focusing on right just   being how do i make a design that can translate 
and is understood by literally anybody that can   go and take a look at it so yeah but that's a 
little bit about you know what i'm doing there's   a lot of other side projects as well that we're 
doing um you know some are in partnership with   new companies such as um citizen care health like 
they're more outbound focused like because you   know if you've been reading the news i guess 
there's been like a huge backlog of you know   kova tests and stuff like that so we've been able 
to like or we're trying to bring that part online   a little while to solve that so yeah pretty busy 
at work so i'm trying to say yeah exactly and as   a product designer uh so many product designers 
have a very specific problem they're trying to   solve or audience they are targeting so the fact 
that you are designing essentially for the general   public like everyone yeah like you said no matter 
what age they are or how tech savvy they are that   has to be very challenging oh no it definitely is 
challenging because like your first instinct is to   go online and maybe just take a look and see like 
what other people are doing you know like maybe   like facebook or like oh how does facebook have 
their design for like the dashboard or something   like spotify or shopify right like these like 
these general things but you still know that   there is like a targeted customer there so for 
me it's about limiting actually the artistic   side of the design right removing as much of 
that flare as possible that like maybe other   companies would integrate to maybe i mean like 
you know part of branding right but this that   really isn't part of the goal of like the designs 
that we're taking yeah the goal is to just what   is what is like linearity down to like what is 
the most important aspects of this flow this and   just cut out all the [ __ ] that could be there 
yeah i like that wow that's really interesting   but you so when we were talking prior to starting 
this yeah you mentioned that you weren't always   your path wasn't always towards product design 
so could you tell me a little bit about your path   yeah yeah so um i started off within um i guess 
in business school right now my queen's university   or the smith school of business and um it was 
kind of weird i guess because when i was in the   school i was looking around and like i was trying 
to think like what are the possible paths i could   be taking right now right like most of them are 
i guess slightly obvious they're like you know   finance marketing and accounting et cetera right 
yeah but it was it was quite odd because like   i i didn't really like think i enjoyed any of them 
even though i didn't really have experience in it   right but it was just something that like never 
really drove me and it was um it was slightly odd   because i had to like i guess well let me say 
this actually i had a really good opportunity   to try something that was outside of the scope of 
what business school tries to teach it to you and   that's sort of starting my own new projects and 
working on startups while i was in school to like   gain a bit more i guess insight into like what 
tech really uh really was because i was always   interested in tech yeah and this ties into sort of 
the hackathon stuff that maybe we can touch upon   in a later bit yeah i'd love to and like well 
like i i guess i as i was in school like i   had still a lot of free time to like sort of 
mess around stuff like that and yeah i think   wait sorry what was the question again i might 
have no it's totally fine no you're on the right   track i was just wondering how you your path like 
how oh yeah yeah your journey into where you are   now yeah yeah of course sorry about that basically 
yeah as i said i was saying so like it was it was   a lot about project-based work right so it was 
back then me and my uh my then co-founder we   started taking a look at this company that we that 
he started back in around 2015 2016 called back at   the time ivy apps and this was a company that 
was funded by the um ontario government at the   time they had the program called summer company 
which was to encourage like entrepreneurship   and within younger students right so what he had 
done back then was like use that money to fund   a website for getting peop i guess um asking 
like literally just going approaching alumni   and asking hey you know um can can i get your 
school applications okay or universities and   just putting online so that students would see it 
so i guess i didn't really explain the idea but   yeah that's really what it is at the core 
it's just a website or blog that has a list of   successful applications to top universities within 
canada the states and like all across the world   really and just being able to like make it online 
and make it accessible right wow but that was   something that it that was the original idea right 
okay and we had taken a look at that and we saw   like it was an opportunity because we had gained 
a lot of passive seo just because people were like   you know around application season especially 
you know i i remember this pretty formally that   i would be googling like oh like successful 
applications to you know queen's university   yeah to um like harvard and just all these random 
universities right so there's a lot of passive   interest into yeah into what the or into like what 
our blog offered right just students offhandingly   googling it and that was an opportunity that we 
saw and being able to transition and move towards   like oh wait this may be a like yeah this may be 
a good idea that what what if he expanded it and   what if we like took a look at it right and the 
logical next step that we had taken with that was   definitely we should try and offer some sort 
of mentorship thing right because that's the   next step we have you have read you as a student 
have read how these students or these people are   like or their applications like who these 
people are but now the next step is like   why don't i meet them and maybe they can help 
me right like it's about finding the person who   has a very similar background similar interests as 
you and like being able to like fine-tune that for   a university audience but it's also like you know 
other stuff too like i want to get to know like   what is your path how did you get here right so 
it's like it's all about like you know it's more   about the mentorship network so that's when we 
went and co-founded squired wow yeah and that's   the company that we're working on and we worked 
on at the time i guess and it was it reached about   100 000 students at one point it was very cool to 
see that yeah like being able to work on a project   that actually gained like a lot of traction like 
a lot of interest and also like seeing people like   meet new people and like these mentors meeting 
other mentors mentors meeting students students   also meeting other students it was like it was 
like really it was like a network yeah that was   really yeah it was really interesting it wasn't 
like a social media network it was just a game   network of people who are like we're interested 
yeah that's right like a community exactly yeah   and being able to found that community was one 
of the most like almost like inspiring things   like knowing that like what i've like the hard 
work that i guess i've been putting into it's like   yes like you can see it exactly it translates yeah 
wow that's incredible yeah i know a lot of people   who are watching this uh want to either start 
their own business or are working towards becoming   an entrepreneur or startup and as someone who's 
done it so well like yourself reaching over a   hundred thousand students yeah what is some advice 
or insight looking back that you may wish you had   or that you gained through that process well 
um i would say this okay i guess i really have   three big points on this the first big point is 
like oh it is very very much more stressful than   people like to believe it is like i know there is 
a culture for entrepreneurship and startup online   where it's like you know the grind you know never 
stop hustling et cetera et cetera but the reality   is is that like yeah i love grinding i love 
doing work as well as most people love doing   like something that they love right but waking 
up every single day stressing out and being like   i i needed work now right almost constantly under 
stress especially because during that semester   i took a year off school wow as well like i took 
a gap year to focus on this startup and actually   yeah like try to advance it forward like you know 
try to do many things at times many things all the   things at the same time right like stuff that i 
had no experience on like how do we like go about   like shoot is right now the time to be raising 
money or right now is it the time to be moving   over technologies right because our our site was 
based on wordpress which is sort of notoriously   slow as you know i guess many people would know 
and like especially with all the plugins that we   used right so that was another battle that we 
had and it was also like oh like how do we get   marketing how do we manage all these mentors 
right and it was just uh it was just us two   we had a third guy um i guess i i should probably 
say their names actually my co-founder's name is   alex norman windsor okay great guy and there 
is a and the other guy is yawn like these two   yeah we're coverers so yeah but back to i guess 
the story it was it was it's no it's not like   it's not as glamorous as it is portrayed 
i believe in media yeah i think that   yeah like it's easy for people to go out and 
say you know just do your startup just do it   you know just do it like there's a catchy 
slogan yeah but then there's actually doing   it and actually experiencing yourself it's 
like you gotta understand the realities of it   like this is this is gonna take a lot of 
sacrifice i had i sacrificed a lot of friendships   you know just being able to like not keep up 
like or maintain my social hygiene because   it was just i was just so busy with like this 
and it was constantly yeah i would be hanging   out with people i'd be like [ __ ] i need to like 
go back now i have to do this right it's like no   well then you know and then there's also the 
other thing where it's like yeah well i can be   like here but i don't know i can be working on 
this but i don't know if it's actually going   to be like long-term successful right because what 
like what is the goal it's like we've reached like   we we've reached this point where we're helping 
people but like if we want to scale like that   involves like so much so much more manpower 
stuff that we just weren't experienced with right   exactly exactly and when you're in that budding 
stage uh you know you necessarily can't bring on   more people because you're just kind of you're 
still in that budding stage you have to do   everything master of all exactly whatever it 
is and in turn you're working 24 7 but then   the other side is what is the sacrifice for is it 
going to be worth it in the end or where is this   going to go that is a lot and that's tied into my 
like second big point on this right is that like   it's just not to like be realistic about like what 
is in front of you like don't be obsessed with   like the i guess the like the flares of being an 
entrepreneurship like don't be obsessed like don't   be distracted by stuff like oh i want to build 
like the best team the biggest team ever right   oh i don't want to be or don't get distracted 
by um like i need to be wearing like or i need   to be posting online on my story it's like telling 
people that i'm like i'm grinding right it's like   there is you have to be realistic and know that 
this isn't like this isn't going to be easy   and this you shouldn't be focused on all the 
other like bullshitty stuff that you know   is mostly for appearances and you should 
be optimized optimal i guess this is the   biggest point actually is that you should find the 
optimal solution for literally everything you do   even if it's not fancy if it's not nice right i 
didn't like to use wordpress but like that was   the solution that we had to use because we needed 
to get an mvp out right validate that there was   demand for this we could have waited for you 
know like we could have done a dev cycle don't   done months of this but then for what right 
i know it's yeah if we if there's no one that   enjoy it or no one's going to use it it's just 
a waste of time right so it's like you have to   always be optimized and yeah like know when to 
like when i guess you had to know when or what   how much time you had to be doing for everything 
right so that's another thing exactly exactly   you can't wait until the perfect moment or 
perfect tool comes along you just need to   keep on iterating yeah exactly it is like a very 
iterative process right and it was especially like   it sucked for me because like you know like i i 
feel like i'm kind of a perfectionist type of guy   really especially you know i mean that's kind 
of why i'm a designer as well but you know like   being a perfectionist it's like really like kind 
of shitty because you have to you know hold back   the horses you're like oh i need to like we need 
to like do this now launch now even if it's in a   perfect state exactly yeah exactly switching back 
a little bit into product design yeah and speaking   of being a perfectionist or or not holding back 
a lot of people who are not product designers   but maybe want to become one i get asked this 
quite often so i'm just curious to hear your   take on it as a product designer yeah they ask if 
i want to become a product designer do i need to   know how to code do i need to be very technical 
what is your experience and take or advice   so this is what i'll say i think that 
it is a yes and no thing for like being   technical and knowing how to code and i'll 
start off with a yes because you need to   like i guess at the end of the day what you're 
doing as a designer is that you're designing   for a developer right you're designing for code 
and you have to kind of understand what you're   like what you're building right like it's 
easy to go or not i wouldn't say easy but   it's when i was when i definitely was starting out 
what i would do is i would just go and you know   find some inspiration online and then like you 
know recreate the rectangles and stuff like that   at that time i didn't understand that you know 
component structures like oh i didn't understand   like reusability like extensibility right like 
within like your design being able to like   minimize the amount of work for the developer as 
a designer right and that like interaction between   develop designer and developer only came to me 
when i worked like when i'm working full-time   for my own work experience right because yeah 
like you know like deploying your own designs   and like just knowing what to do is just different 
from being able to communicate that within like   your design documents to like somehow so that's 
something that it's okay i would consider it like   a very technical thing and obviously i would say 
that you know having some general understanding of   how basic front-end development would work such as 
html css just understanding like the nature like   oh how do i recreate it you know the div stuff div 
you know h1 tag stuff like that that stuff is all   i think is definitely important to understand 
but also like not like you don't need to be   like a full-time developer right it's just being 
able to understand like the connection between   the two exactly yeah so i but i guess while i'm 
saying that i would also say that it is not like a   very like it is very technical but there are 
aspects that are much more nuanced and you know   this is more of like the artistic side of like 
being designer because i've been talking a lot   about the practicality of stuff like at the end 
of the day like there you have to understand that   design is something that is not like set in stone 
like there's not one right way to approach it   because design will obviously change based on 
context and stuff like that right so i mean   this is something that my mentor and teacher back 
in the day mr batitus uh we used to call him mr   big tito or d i guess so like what do you told 
me is true like you need to be making sure that   whatever you whatever you are doing like actually 
makes sense within your context and that comes   from like a lot more experience it does yeah it's 
yeah it's it is like unfortunately not as simple   elegant or seamless as like what it sort of seems 
like online but it's yeah but that's that's that's   essentially what i might take it's there's a very 
technical aspect to it but then there's also that   nuance which is based so much more on context 
for sure yeah and like yourself someone who is   going to university and completing it but not for 
necessarily a coding specific uh role how did you   based on your answer of there is some technical 
for someone who's looking to get into product   design but like yourself didn't come from a coding 
background is that something you just picked up as   you went wrong and taught yourself okay so this is 
actually something i yeah like this is only very   important i guess within my uh career development 
is that it coding seems like such a inaccessible   like very far out concept right like oh like what 
am i looking at you're looking excuse me you're   literally looking at lines of just like like 
words on a page right it's the same language   exactly it's his own language right so like 
my approach and what i believe is like one of   the um better approaches is instead of like just 
approaching it from a traditional school like you   know module breakdown thing i think that people 
should learn how to code by just doing their own   projects and like by actually actively going 
out and solving your own problem right i have   i guess like something that like what i can point 
towards an experience i had recently is something   i've been working with a company called 
thinking cap right run by my friend saeed   shout out to that guy by the way he is like 
what my experience with that is being able to   like um hold on no take your time have a design 
that we had together and figuring out like   okay so like there is this like i have this design 
this template and my developer friend syed has   been able to build this out but then there are 
some certain aspects of it that are like kind   of wrong and kind of off like oh there's a bit 
too much spacing here or there's a bit too much   like this text is too high then it would be like 
google yeah how do i change that or and then   that's how you learn it right so this is more like 
the front and front and markup stuff but then it   also ties back into like another experience 
i had when it comes to more like logic stuff   right so this is for another project with uh 
another friend of mine i guess this is for um   a project called um habitat okay and yeah it's um 
yeah run by my friend todd like what we're trying   to do is or i guess what the what the project was 
was trying to optimize or not optimize create a   co-living workspace platform that allows like 
people to like book co work co-living spaces   online and being able to move that between places 
right so that's the overall problem right and then   there's certain aspects that are very like how 
do i make sure that this particular um page or   not page this um excuse me this house is going to 
be able to like show up in like this place when i   need it to right like that then you're delving a 
lobe into javascript then you start looking into   that right i know i sort of rambled on there for 
like quite a bit when it comes to this but like no   it's so important yeah back to the original 
point though like it's about being able to   or know what or know what the problem is and 
honestly knowing what to google it's true oh   googling is a skill in itself yeah 
and it's something that you learned   yeah exactly no like i've definitely tried to take 
one of those boot camps and coding stuff like that   like i would say they're definitely useful for 
like you know maybe on recognizing like oh like   that's the syntax there or something right but 
it's not quite like it doesn't translate that   into like real learning in my opinion because i 
i honestly just spaced out a lot of the time but   when i was actively learning is always when 
i'm like trying to identify a problem that's   in front of me and being like okay this is 
something that is not a unique problem number   one that's something important to remember yeah 
this is definitely something that someone else   has like asked a question online so i just got to 
find that right exactly yes i totally agree yeah   we're not the fir you're t usually nine times 
out of ten you're not the first to come across   this problem yeah yeah exactly or maybe even 
almost 10 out of 10. i won't say that but almost   yeah i mean that's coding is pretty much like 
one of the most documented things ever right   like you're always going to be able to find like 
someone else who has a similar problem to you and   they're going to help you out right so that's 
what matters like just remember that there are   resources online and just don't yeah just focus on 
that but yeah i agree martin i have one question   last question for you well i have tons more but i 
won't keep you forever thank you my last question   if you could sum up for in a few sentences 
what advice would you give to your younger self all right i'm putting you on the 
spot here that's a very good question   because okay i guess i'll i'll say this 
like one of the very original sort of   i guess mantras that mean my friends usually 
had before was that we used to like roast coders   you know it's pretty funny because i'm 
telling you this as you know your developer   but what we used to say is coders are easy to come 
by yeah visionaries are one in a million right   it's like oh yeah you know i can see the cringe in 
your face right now but what i'm trying to say is   that that mentality and approach to just like i 
mean anything really it's true it is true it's i   actually don't agree i think it's false really yes 
because i think that you can't just dis you can't   just say oh coders are like you know they're like 
they're bad you know visionaries no i agree right   i agree with that yeah yeah and it was something 
that like it discouraged me from like learning   aspects of coding because it was like oh like this 
like more about like the flex of like just being   like a yeah like a designer or something like that 
right and that's something yeah it's i understand   it's like a kind of a niche thing it's not like 
everyone has this idea right but it's it's about   like being both like practical and also like being 
able to like being able to apply the ideas and   this is something that i would have been able to i 
should have told myself a lot earlier instead it's   yeah it's just like you know i want to be a guy 
who like works on my own projects yeah but that   but that also involves me being able to like learn 
be open to learning yes i guess i totally agree i   completely agree and and i think it comes back 
to what you used to say about coders and versus   visionaries yeah i think it although like you 
said it's not necessarily the truth one thing i do   agree about that is with any role not just coding 
any role you can either just do your job and   do what you're told and that's fine if that's what 
you want but with any role you can also become a   visionary and take it and continue to learn and 
continue to grow and really hone in on it and be   open and that's like a really good point towards 
entrepreneurship as well right if you're an   entrepreneur you don't need to be just always like 
starting your own project on your own thing right   there's an entrepreneurial like mindset like being 
able to think a bit more entrepreneurial i think   that's what really being a problem-solving origin 
or just curious person really looks like right   that's so true yeah you never thought of 
it like that that's how yeah so really cool   martin it was so amazing talking to you thank 
you for taking time to to share all your insight   and your honestly wisdom like i feel like 
i've learned a lot from this oh thank you   so much for having me thanks this has been a 
pleasure thank you thank you all right amazing
