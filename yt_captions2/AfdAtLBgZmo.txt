i have something to confess i've been lying to you well actually not just me the entire internet has been lying to us you know what i'm talking about or i hope you do anyways by now i am referring to google's gemini we've all seen this video when it first came out i remember being wow this is incredible this has the potential to maybe put some challenge on chat gpt i shared about it on my instagram actually and was having great conversations with people who were using it on bard only to start seeing a couple of days later news outlets trickling well what ended up being true we were being lied to so what exactly happened what exactly was google lying to us about well it wasn't intentional outright lying or maybe that's me just the canadian and me being too hopeful in humanity but what rather they did was in their video demo when they were showing what gemini is possible gemini i being their newest ai model that they are releasing or three different models we'll get into that they faked the video and what i mean by that is instead of actually prompting gemini to identify uh the objects in the video or go through different exercises such as play rock paper scissors what they did is they crafted the video using still image frames from the footage and prompting via a text now google's response to this coming out in the news they are saying that for the purposes of this demo latency has been reduced and gemini outputs have been shortened for the purposes of this demo latency has been reduced and gemini outputs have been shortened for brevity they go on to say that this is what gemini the multimodel has the potential to look like these use cases all right so we know we've kind of been lied to it's a gray area and i say kind of because yes right now we have been but i truly believe what they were showcasing in this video will be possible very soon that's why they put out this video they feel confident that this technology these ai models that they are creating are going to get to a point where this can easily be done and i mean we've already seen a lot of these things it's not new especially with chat tpt so today i thought you know what would be fun you know what we should do because i use chat gpt all the time all the time whether i am coding creating content researching it's almost like my new it's the new google that's where i go to search nowadays so i'm going to be comparing models we are going to go on bard compare which is using gemini and then we are going to go on chat gpt use gpt 4 and see what actually will provide us with better results the purpose of this video is a to educate us i'm learning with you i'm doing these things with you but also two i'm really curious i want to know what is going to give me better results when i am uh coding creating content researching i want to use the best ai model out there so today that is what we going to do battle of the ai models all right we're taking a pause and going through the battle of the ai models because i wanted to address this question on youtube here i asked uh i think it was on friday a while back anyways i asked what do you want me to cover in this video going through gemini other than the obvious seeing how it compares to other ai models what's going on in the news around it and the question that got up voted the most times was around what does this mean for the future of coders and i know we've covered this question a little bit in past videos to varying degrees but what does this truly mean i mean it feels like every day we are seeing a big tech company coming out with a new ai model that is superpowered i mean even with gemini and its three ai models one is powering now alpha code and they are saying what is it i'll put it up on screen here but it's something like now with alpha code using gemini it can outperform i believe it was almost 90 80 to 90% of programmers it's outperforming which is pretty wild let me let me add a little bit more context to that here programmers meaning pass all the exams and code in a way that is is beating all these tests but it does get you wondering all right well now with alpha code coming out and chat gpt being able to code what what is the purpose like why would you learn to code in 2024 like where what does it mean for us here are my thoughts around it it is going to take away a lot of jobs and some of those jobs will include coding jobs we' be i'd be lying to you if i truly didn't think that what i do think it will mean though for coders technical or non-technical people is as these ai models advance and we start integrating them more at big tech small startups just in our daily workflows what will happen is we will have the responsibility if we want to grow our careers in a very sustainable and also to in demand way that we need to learn a broad set of skills gone or the days where you can learn one programming language and that is it you don't have to ever think about learning anything ever again you are specialty you're focused on i'm not saying specialty roles are going away please do not take that as what i'm saying what i'm saying though is if you you really want to stand out in your career and grow uh into a senior level or management level role being open to different opportunities different roles different skill sets is going to become more in demand all right i just want to give that little synopsis because i think we are rightfully so freaking out about coding when it comes to ai and i'm here to tell you it's okay it is still one of the best skills you can learn and keep with your toolkit of other skills curious to hear do you agree with me do you disagree let me know in the comments all right we are back i came to sit with jack behind me in my dining room cuz i felt like i needed to i don't know does anyone else need to move places when they are working like every hour cuz that's pretty much me in a nutshell all right you can see on screen here i have chat gpt for up and running and we are going to ask it to provide us three different coding questions that are typically asked during interviews and i'm going to prompt bard and chat pt in the exact same way so let's start this all right in chat pt let's say i am a a midlevel software engineer uh looking to prepare for a technical interview provide me three different algorithm rhythm questions that are typically asked during coding interviews i don't love that prompt but let's go with it we're keeping it real here i'm going to copy it so i can use it in b as well all right so i can see as it's responding one thing it does right now already is gives you know what the algorithm is and then also too it will give um an example which i think is really interesting you know write an algorithm to find the first non-re repeating element in a given array for example strain processing manipulation okay i mean i did say i'm midlevel and the first at least the first one array manipulation searching seems very junior string processing even that another very junior one tree graph traversal implement algorithm perform ad depth for search all right okay the third one's really good i think okay so now let's leave it there we won't do anything let's go into bard and in bard let's enter our prompt i'm not i'm not i haven't used bard a ton i'm i'm a chat gpt person let's go here all right so implement a fun function that finds the longest common substrate into strings all right so another string question function that checks if a binary tree is balanced okay that's a good one the larg okay so it does you know what it's interesting they did both do um questions around the same topics one was around uh a string one was around a binary search was that what this one was oh tree and graft okay yeah but still in the same realm and then we also had number three which is is going through an array basically so that's really interesting to me one thing i do like though about bard that i instantly noticed is how they have diagrams here like that's something that chat gpt did not provide us i mean maybe they didn't need to and that's why but they could have done something here with the binary tree like bar did here interesting all right let's give it one more prompt here let's another technical right for me let's make it build something with code now what could we build with code create for me here how we going to do this let's make it make us a form in react create me a form with uh name entry um location and password with a spot maybe that's how i should put with a place for an input that sounds better with an input for a name location password make this for me in react copy these are very i'm almost intentionally making them very basic prompts just to see what it can do before i get into the specifics here like getting really detailed with my prompts cuz then that's i don't know i feel like it's going to give us better answers so let's see what it does just the initial level without because a lot of times when i'm using something like chat gbt i'm not taking time to craft this per perfect prompt i'm just typing things in all right see here so far it's pretty good i think got inputs all right and then there's an explanation down here we use use state and submit i also oh this is a big win i love how they included their sources down here that's really cool i don't know i wish i didn't like barred as much as i do but it's it's pretty good so far let's ask this in chat gpt and see what happens now okay see me the exact same i wonder what was this called i do like how this one was called my form they got more specific with the function name versus just app that's a huge thing too comments of what it's doing okay i do like how they used uh state to store input values i don't think they did that oh no they did yeah of course they did here okay i'm just wa to see [music] here i do like how they say to use this component that's something we didn't get with bard so they're saying you know if you actually want to implement this into a project here's what you would do which feels more real world i don't know it's a tough one i initial input i think they are both really interesting and really good and honestly i think it's comparing there are differences but do i think that the differences are so unique that i think it comes down to your personal preference i think it depends on what one you're most familiar with already and uh what platform you typically use i' i've heard a lot of people though use bard especially through social media when i was posting i was doing this video because its responses are more um in-depth and accurate so that's a very interesting observation that i'm already starting to see as well all right this is just too close i can't tell just by typing in prompt so i went right to the data let's check out what they are saying what the data is saying so and we're comparing so for context gemini has different ai models there is gemini pro gemini ultra um so i'm not comparing i cannot compare say gemini ultra to chat gpt for example because they're are using different ones so what is really important is that i compare gpt before which we were just using to gemini's ai model that they're comparing against it which is gemini ultra all right so let's go here google claims that the yet to be released gemini ultra outperformed the state-of-the-art models like gpt 4 all right let's see what did you what did you do so good at so they are saying gemini ultra received a remarkable 90% in massive multitask language understanding showcasing its ability to comprehend 57 subjects including stem humanities and more whereas gpt 4 is at 86.4% so basically gemini ultra outperformed gpt 4 by around 4% now there goes into some other data around it but honestly the differences at this point are not that grand in my opinion i do think bard in this case does take home the win overall and i do think gemini especially with it coming out with gemini ultra model is going to have huge impact on what is possible and it's just the beginning i really think though that even if i truly believe bard is a better ai model i'm so used to using chat gpt i don't think i'm going to switch to bard which is so funny to say curious to hear what one are you using do you use bard do you use chat gpt leave in the comments all right only time we'll tell which ai model ends up taking the cake or first place if you will and honestly i don't even know if it will end up being just one or the other i think there will be many different just like there's many different ooh i was going to say just like there's many different search engines but mainly google so we'll see we'll see it's very interesting time though i think the most important thing though is and i hope what this video did is encourage you to play around with these different ai models not be scared of them or think oh this is going to take over my job we are far away from that the main thing is being open-minded playing around with them getting comfortable with integrating and using ai in our daily lives because it's not going anywhere all right i hope you all enjoyed this video thanks for following along leave in the comments other videos you want me to see or you want me to make that you want to see whether it be more hands-on uh going through different ai models whether it be more coding future tech tech news all of the above let me know i don't know unless you let me know all right bye everyone thank you oh and subscribe that's important [music] too
