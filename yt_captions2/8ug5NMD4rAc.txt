malicious translations target ubuntu 2310 launch by mark tyson oh hey mark tyson ukrainian translation appears to have been targeted by hate speech okay okay mere hours after the release in 2310 download images have been removed from distributions if you try and grab the latest desktops iso at the time of writing you'll be greeted with a message saying you buntu 2310 cannot be downloaded right now okay ubuntu's official accounts on twitter x reveals uh oh they already have the right here we have ident here we have identified speech from a malicious contributor in some of our translations submitted as part of a third party tools outside of the ubuntu archive the ubuntu 2310 image has been taken down and new versions will be available once the correct translations have been restored further updates here whoa i just learned that ubuntu has a discord oh no that's discourse gosh the just i can't read i i can't read mom i can't read i'm uh anyways so the ubuntu 2310 release was supposed to be available and stay available from yesterday we've discussed the release of manic minor in our news sections yesterday notable new features include increase os security a new and improved app center and the introduction of support for risk 5 based uh sbc's and the new raspberry pi 5 little did we know the ukrainian language resource files we spilling over with hate speech okay okay okay what's happening here the malicious contributor appears to have kept some translations as intended but interspersed them with text rings that highlighted extremist belief with regard to certain religious groups sexual orientations and political persuasions tom's hardware genius by the way has been let's see has seen the original uk ukrainian text and used machine translations to initially confirm the contents the text was then reviewed by the editor who can read ukrainian and they have confirmed that the machine translation is is accurate the only example of these malicious translations that we are willing to print can be seen in the context below battery warning warning computer is not connected to power source string gi offline warning your pants are not off yet how did this happen how how did we how did we arrive here right ubuntu has also set up forum uh post about what it calls malicious translation incident it notes that these translations are not a part of the ubuntu archive and we believe the incident is contained only to translations provided via third party translation tool we ed for a subset of the applications keep an eye for this post for further details okay so so hold on so what they're saying is that ubuntu uses a translation service the translation service was the one that got attacked i mean i really wish there i could see more of the translations right because obviously the one that they showed seems mostly just like ridiculous right i'd put this under the ridiculous category a rogue employee oh a rogue employee yeah i'd put this under the i mean i wouldn't call this hate speech i'd call this is like i i mean this is like twitch level speech right this is what i like if i were to make some warning messages and someone from twitch said they would help me translate it this is what i would expect like this is what i would expect out of it tate speech this is heavy tate speech okay this is twitch chat speech right now so be is and butthead level yeah are your pants off yet i can't stand up i'll tell you that much stand up on stream i might get myself a little bit trouble um it's kind it feels like just a post i'd love to i mean i' i'd like to know if there's more of them does anyone have a link uh this is the github commit oh really hey are your pants off you removed the valid translations and did not remove the the part of the malicious one oh no oh no see but i can't read any of this stuff so i i mean i would i would honestly just have no idea right i can see why they didn't want to show that nearly as much the other one was like twitch chat level this one ain't twitch chat level so since i can't read this and this is just ridiculous we'll we'll we'll just assume that the rest are pretty awful that's like twitter level that's twitter level you can you can yeah yeah so kick level that's kick.com level i'm just going to keep that one uh i'm just forchan there's some forchan in there too twitter forchan same thing okay well geez holy cow um wow i i can't believe that yuntu got destroyed by uh a translation service i mean that just goes to show how hard translations are you are at the complete mercy of those doing the translation right like you have to know that whoever's doing those like they have to be you hope that they're correct like i i wouldn't know if you're like hey here's the correct ukrainian translation and i took it i wouldn't even have any idea right i i just hope it's right wow good a good lesson here good lesson to always double check maybe a little bit of your translations deep language solves that for you yeah i think it sort of does it doesn't quite solve all the things there's let's see just learn ukrainian bro yeah i know just learn all the languages bro it's it's a real problem yeah you'd have to hire a couple independent people but that's like again hiring independent people for an open source project it's hard you know there's a lot you have to do to double check these you know what i mean just the poly glot that's all all right hey careful translations are extremely difficult okay a
