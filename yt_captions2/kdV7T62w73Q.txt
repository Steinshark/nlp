i was flipping through a bunch of old photos on my phone this morning and i found this old beauty of me covered in mud in northern alberta it was taken more than 10 years ago when i was still a professional tree planter and way before i ever started shooting docks it got me thinking about the weird and strange path i've taken to get to where i am now i never planned on becoming a photographer or a dp and i definitely didn't plan on starting a youtube channel it all just sort of happened but i wonder if i'd taken a more direct and traditional path would i still be the same filmmaker that i am today [music] sometimes i wish i had one of those backstories that we've all heard like i was a young kid and i found my dad's old camera and picked it up and from day one i just fell in love with it and never looked back but i don't have a story like that i usually start thinking like that every time i'm unhappy with my filmmaking career i think that maybe if i just started earlier or i'd done things a little bit differently maybe i'd be further ahead than i am now what if i'd gone to film school or moved to new york city would i be a more successful filmmaker than i am today but i didn't do that i studied literature at school not filmmaking and as soon as i graduated i left the country i took a whole bunch of random jobs for the next four or five years mostly i did labor and picked fruit i worked construction i was a cable layer over the mountains in new zealand i worked in a toy store i stacked pallets in a refrigerated warehouse i planted hundreds of thousands of trees in northern canada i did a ton of different jobs none of them related to filmmaking i also backpacked full-time for almost four years and taught english in south korea for two years all of this happened before i ever even thought about picking up a camera seriously it was definitely the long way around and sometimes especially earlier on in my career when i was really struggling to get my foot in the door i was really mad at myself for not starting earlier it seemed like everywhere i looked there were younger people who were more successful than me people who had started earlier and were doing way better i remember once i was accepted to a photojournalism master class in france held by the photo agency newer if you don't know who they are check them out they're amazing and when i got there i was the oldest person except for one of the instructors instead of being grateful for the opportunity i had i got fixated on that and started thinking of it as an excuse as to why i wasn't where i wanted to be in my career i thought if only i'd started a little bit younger i'd be better than everybody else but all that was was fear and me making excuses i started when i started and there was nothing i could do to change that so instead of just getting upset and looking for reasons to blame everything about myself i should have just been getting to work but eventually things started to click i broke into the photojournalism world and even though i didn't you know win any huge awards or get super famous i think i did pretty well for myself i got to work on some really cool projects for some of the biggest news outlets in the world and more or less i accomplished what i'd set out to do then i hit the reset button on myself and decided to change into documentary video there's a whole bunch of reasons why i did this and i can explain them all in another video but for now it's enough to know that after four or five years of my photo career i stopped what i was doing changed the tagline on my website to say that i was a dp now and started only looking for video jobs i struggled again from day one like we all do it was super hard to break in i had no contacts and no experience but eventually i made that work too and the weird thing is the further i got in each of those careers the happier i was that i hadn't taken a direct route and the more grateful i was that i'd done all those strange jobs in my opinion the hardest part about making documentaries or photojournalism isn't making beautiful pictures if you practice enough and you get in the right place at the right time the pictures kind of make themselves what's really hard is getting permission and trust of people so that you can take those pictures in the first place the kind of photography and documentaries that i'm interested in are about people so it doesn't do you any good to be a photoshop master and know everything there is to know about f-stops in the latest gear if you can't interact with people and start relationships with them what really makes a difference in a great documentary or photography project is access and all the technical skills in the world won't help you with that let's look at an example from a photo project that i was hired to do while i was still living in cambodia it was created by a big aid organization and the idea was to visualize poverty by comparing household objects around the world so the idea was that if you could see what a toilet was like in a middle class lower class and wealthy family in say zimbabwe and then compare that to the same objects in another part of the world say eastern china you might get a better understanding of what it meant to live below the poverty line in different parts of the world it was a really cool project and it's a little hard to describe in words so i'll put a link below in the description you should check it out i think in the end i went to nine countries and shot with more than 65 families i had a shot list of over 350 things that i needed to find in their house and photograph and i didn't have any of these locations arranged for me in advance there was no production company and no one was waiting for me on the ground i basically hired a fixer and then we drove into areas where we thought we might fit families that fit the demographic we were looking for and then we just started talking to strangers the pictures weren't really that hard to take i had to know how to get the most out of my camera in low light but basically i just needed to put the object in the center of the frame and take the photo it wasn't about making artistic photos of toilets it was about documentation the photography was actually the easy part what was really challenging was showing up in a new city or country that you'd never been to before and talking your way into a stranger's house and then photographing every object that they owned it was really intimate and pretty invasive i spent about five hours in each home and we would comb through everything they owned these people had no reason to let me in there was nothing in it for them but still somehow despite not speaking the language i was able to convey a feeling of trust and in the end they let me inside they really didn't have to do that and i don't think that those skills are something that you could learn in photo school all of that came from spending years living in other countries and getting used to being a stranger being comfortable with approaching people who you don't know and who don't speak the same language and aren't from the same culture as you all of that came from my time as a backpacker and even though i might have thought that that was wasted time it really wasn't let's look at another example from a few years ago i went to papua new guinea with a super talented crew to film a very high budget dock in a remote part of the world we had to climb through the jungle sleep in hammocks we got poured on with rain we were walking all day with heavy loads on our backs it was really grueling if i'd just gone to film school and hadn't spent five summers sleeping in a tent in northern canada and planting trees i don't know that i would have been able to handle that kind of exposure to nature that job taught me how to be comfortable in very uncomfortable situations and not to complain but just to put your head down and get it done if i hadn't been a tree planter i wouldn't have been a good fit for that crew no matter how much i knew about shaping life so even though at the time i often thought i was falling behind by spending so long as a planter in the end that experience was invaluable for me this isn't one of those videos where i bash film school in fact i think there's some real benefits to film school that you can't get anywhere else you make amazing contacts that you probably will work with for the rest of your career also if you want to do feature films and not documentaries there's a lot of technical skills and access to equipment that can be pretty tough if you don't go to film school film school definitely has a place and there's a lot of reasons why it could be a great fit for you instead what i'm trying to say is don't be so fixated on getting to a certain goal in your career that you ignore life experiences along the way take random jobs and do strange things that have no direct link to filmmaking you'll be really surprised about how they come to influence you later and give you perspective on the world i worked for a while as a cable layer in new zealand and that gave me a totally different perspective on manual labor and how a lot of people in the world make their income i even worked for a while in a call center in australia and even though i didn't last very long i hated the job and i hate getting those calls just like everybody else i still learn something from it i at least understand what it's like to be that person on the other end of the phone and even though i haven't made a documentary about it yet i'm sure that that's going to pay me back sometime in some random way while i can't exactly say how each of these experiences has impacted me as an artist i can say that without them i don't think i'd be as curious or compassionate a person as i am today at its core most filmmaking especially documentaries is about telling human stories in order to do that job well you need to understand other people so test yourself in weird places don't be embarrassed to look stupid in front of strangers and push yourself outside your comfort zone [music] so don't get so obsessed with photography and filmmaking that you forget to experience the world you're portraying the more you understand people the better your stories will be so live a full life now while you can i promise it'll make you a better artist [music] later [music] you
