we are going to code today with gpt we are going to build our own gpt and then get it to build a website for us just by giving it an image of a diagram that we want created this is next level if i would have told you a year ago we'd be building websites or having ai build us websites just for an image we're sending it you'd be like tiff you're off your rocker you are you're crazy but now here we are this example is pretty simple submitting an image of a diagram that we created and then getting it to build us a static website but when you really stop and think about these gpts that you can customize think about if you want to implement it with react build a react app or if you want it to be um mobile responsive anything you want feel like a it's like a what are those commercials anything you want you can get only for $5.99 i i don't know that was weird that was really weird wasn't it get what i'm saying it's going to be really fun let's get coding or telling gpt to code for us i think there are so many possibilities with these custom gpts i was really excited to dive in with them and start tinkering let's go do just that oh and before i go make sure to hit that subscribe button for more tech coding and career related videos all right thanks [music] everyone okay one more thing before we start into this project i wanted to share with you about a project that i've been working on for probably the last year now i'm super excited to share with you about takeoff this is an online platform membership base that you can sign up for and it will give you access to the most incredible speakers that will talk to you about uh career mentorship networking how to learn faster and so much more these speakers are all very knowledgeable they are executives seite individuals have been in the industry the tech industry for a long time i knew i had to create a place like this for you all because i get so many questions around growing your career or specializing in tech and i want wanted you to hear from the best of the best experts in this area take off i link down below uh i hope to see you there i'm i've never been so excited about something to share with you and i hope you find it super valuable there will be new speakers and also workshops such as resume building coding public speaking all these different skill sets will be in workshops and then also in talks we just launched so be one of the first early adopters go sign up to it today and i will see you there oh also we have a bunch of new features we're releasing soon i'm sure i'm going to get people going be like t you're not supposed to tell about these features we haven't released them yet but you know things like really really big unique discount codes wonderful slack community online events there's it's just it's just the beginning so go be an early adopter be head of the crowd all right thanks everyone now let's get into it okay you can see on screen here i am in chat gpt specifically in create a new gpt and as we covered already we are going to be creating a custom gpt that will build websites from images we provide so diagrams or sketches i've been tinkering around with this i've already built a gpt that does this so this is my second time doing it for this video and honestly i mean on one hand i'm so impressed because you know you're literally providing a pdf and it's building you that static website but on the other hand it's like well it's just a static website is it really a big deal but when you think about this technology is the worst it will ever be it continues to get smarter and smarter or improved i should say it's it's not getting smarter it's pretty wild when you really stop and think about it so let's get into it today we got to pause got the dogs the dogs barking moment let's just get into it that's my sign idea to just dive into things all right so for this let's start off with explaining what we want to make make a software why are we in capitals we are not yelling make a software engineer who helps format my code and build me a website from diagrams i provide to it this gpt can make assumptions for the most part but if there are big questions please get it to ask me about it i want the gpt to be um mobile responsive put as much detail as you possibly can like think about it you are telling i mean you're telling technology what to do we need to be so specific so i want the gpt to be mobile responsive and create really good designs boom all right so now we wait okay so now we have here let's give your gpt a name how about we called it call it code craft yes i like that name takes a long time to upload or think i feel like in between prompts which it doesn't for a chat gpt but when we're building a gpt i find it takes a long time to do so come on generate profile picture okay i like that profile picture let's go with [music] that okay let's define or refine the context a bit more are there any spe specific technologies languages and frameworks so let's include html css and javascript if needed we'll start out with the basics but you can always change this to include really specific frameworks what's going on here send message here we go all right next considering code craft will also be assisting with website design are there any specific design principles i already said this i don't know why it's asking me again color scheme okay yeah um let's you can choose but make sure it is um mobile responsive cuz that's something when i when i used to work at what company was it um oh really all companies that was probably i remember i got assigned so many tickets for one company i worked at as a developer and they kept on asking me to make everything uh mobile responsive which is like of course it is but the website massive website was designed not mobile responsive i don't know how or why so going and refactoring that was so painful so now using something like this in this situation would be incredible make sure your company allows you to use products like this obviously that goes without saying all right now about the interaction when codec craft needs clarification how detailed do you want it to get okay okay how would you like it to communicate should be strictly professional friendly it's very specific but i noticed it's kind of buggy like i'm pressing enter and it won't like send it all right let's see here i think what i could see happening too in the future with these gpt is companies starting to create their own and allowing employees to work consistently with different gpts and what that would do is it would create a lot of consistency with code best practices at that company and also to ensure that everything really flows it's the same wording same structure same kind of coding style i mean to me it will really help with that which has always been a big issue at companies all right great code craft will now have a friendly and supportive style would you like to give codecraft a try in the playground yes i do i want to test it out all right so here where is it let me show you i actually already drew can you guess what kind of website i already drew i mean obviously obviously it's dog related you know i love my dogs where are you where is the website i already uploaded it so if you can't find here we go okay so you can see here maybe you can't see i don't know but you can see on screen here i have my website that we are going to take a photo of and upload to our gpt let's give it a try so on this side here let's go and upload and i sent this yesterday one second here where is this i got to turn off all the brightness maybe it's in screenshots from yesterday here we go okay and then i'm going to say code me a static website that is mobile responsive i don't think i need to say this because it's the gpt already knows to do this but i'm just you know uh mobile responsive and make it very colorful let's add some color let's add some spice i guess that's my new thing add some spice into this all right let's see let's see what you can do code craft that's the name of the gpt i'm not just coming up with this okay okay okay so to create a website based on the following we'll need to create uh use html css and possibly a bit of javascript all right so let's see here i think it's one of those things where you can train it to be very technical like for this demo i'm doing it's mainly html and css we're going to really dive into but imagine when you start bringing react into the mix or you start bringing uh other frameworks angular into the mix how powerful this could be even if you're not using it to build full websites full-fledged websites the structure gives you to start if you are a coder or someone who just has an idea and wants to put it uh to real life i mean or bring it to real life i mean this is huge when you really stop and think about it as a side note very important before you take any code i feel like your mother before you take any code from chat gpt or online make sure you know what it is doing because there have been cases where there are packages people are installing that they aren't as familiar with and in turn causes security issues so just just an fyi but for this css we're going to be good [music] here it's really slow i mean it's funny how we think though it's so slow but it's like it's building a website from a photo i took and i'm complaining that it's slow i don't know okay we're getting into the html portion of it for me i would find this mostly helpful i mean it's just html like it's kind of b that's kind of boring but the css is someone who is not inherently good at because i don't enjoy doing css i find this to be so useful the amount of hours this would have saved me i mean it's it's wild it's really amazing okay so now it's placing where the dog photos will go h the one thing i noticed i'm not sure how it's going to play out but the one thing i noticed is they didn't actually put source for the dog photo so what's this gallery item let's see maybe that's what it is it's going to attach to gallery item gallery [music] item yeah there's nowhere for the dog images gallery maybe okay add in for me the source for each dog photo can input real ones oh no regenerate no are you doing it all over again oh my gosh stop okay now what we can do is let's put this code into vs code and actually run it let's see what actually happens here so i'm in vs code i have a new project and i created an index html file now i'm going to go back copy the code we had some technical difficulties over here and there we go we can see we have our index html and we also have some places for the css and then also to the dog photos i mean it's it's pretty basic but i mean for someone who's starting out their coding journey or maybe you're building something bigger just think so big think about the possibilities with this all right next up let's create a new fold older uh call this images and put in our dog images uh this could be anything though of course let's choose three dirty hairy mr mugs and my sister's corgi um whose name is dudley all right so now let's update the sources for each of these here once again this is super simple but even too it includes things like you know alt uh it includes making mobile responsive like it does a good job of including the basics that sometimes programmers can forget like the most the simplest things i mean how long have you spent looking at you know different articles for silly things like how do i center a div how do i make it responsive things that you're like i am way too far in my coding career in my developer career to be doing this right now no we don't have to all right let's see the final result oh they look so cute i'm biased but they look cute but it's isn't that wild like look how it was able to create this website for me i mean yes it's very simple it's static but once again just look how responsive it is it's so good and we could get so specific here with things like bootstrap or um different kind of frameworks like we could really make this very specific to different technologies all right i hope you enjoyed building that with me today it was a fun simple project but just really wanted to share with you how to build a gpt that is really customizable and really enhances what you want or hits on what you want to build with and it's still it's still wild taking an image and then building a website if you haven't already make sure to go sign up for takeoff hit
