ladies and gentlemen today i am super excited to announce a new format of a chess event that is being championed and pioneered and driven by magnus carlson this event is called freestyle chess the word freestyle has absolutely zero relevance but that's its name and essentially this is an eight player event which is a mix of rapid chess and classical chess with a couple of twists number one it is an invitation only event so basically magnus partnered with uh this uh this resort uh in germany to put on this event and they invited a bunch of players there's no hikaru who might have declined i'm not sure there's no wesley so but there's fabiano carana there's leevon aronian nobe abdu satur uh and i'm going to forget some names right now so i'm not going to name the rest but even dingly ren is playing the current ro champion and uh it begins today it's a mix of different formats rapid in uh and also classical chess and it's fisher random so it's chess 960 meaning the games have no openings there are no opening repertoir involved which means the games are absolute madness as you can see this is this is the setup the only rules and the reason it's called 960 is because the king has to be between the two rooks so you can castle a certain direction or you can castle that way and the bishops have to be an opposite color otherwise you can shift everything around so magnus got his wish magnus got a chest tournament with a unique format a mix of time controls and a knockout so they basically tailor made this tournament around magnus okay great so here are the stages in the first stage it's a round robin everybody plays everybody and then everybody gets seated into a knockout so this is day one and the very first move of this game is castles why cuz this rook is used for castling short and this rook is used for castling long very funny so that rook would need to be over here to free up the space anyway both sides castle so magnus and fuja both castle their kings on the first move and the incredible thing about fisher random as they begin this game is like there's just no openings right so you have to open up your diagonals of queen and bishop we have take take they get their knights out and then they play these like weird pawn moves that sort of block the diagonals away from each other and and magnus plays this very slow maneuvering game magnus in general stays away from making too many pawn moves because he doesn't like to make too many weaknesses alza brings his bishops to the to the side of the board to a5 and a6 and then they trade and magna starts doing his usual thing this kind of looks like a regular game of chess now except for some reason the queen is here the knights are sort of squiggly and if white plays d5 white's going to have dominant control over the lights square so alza plays bishop a6 magnus advances his pawns and alyza tries to fight back take take knight f5 and slowly magnus builds up a very very powerful initiative with this move d5 he's got the same amount of pawns but he's got a pawn that's three squares away from queening he's promoted uh he's made a pass pawn rather but ali resa sharp with it knight to d6 queen hanging queen hanging knight hanging take rook f1 we trade and we go to this end game with knight e7 passive defense by ali resa magnus turning the pressure applying the but he he doesn't have a way forward and now we're here all of a sudden ali reza is uh is is is in in cruise control with the pass pawn the pawn's marching down the board both guys have 30 seconds on the clock in this rampid game and ali resa glues magnus's king to the last rank look at this position magnus can't move because if he plays knight e3 king c1 he's completely stuck the knight has to stay there and and then ali resa is going to try to get his knight to c3 and maybe win the game but in that time these pawns are going to go so it's sort of an unstoppable force meets an a movable object situation where magnus is not going to leave ali resa's pawn but alyza can't stray too far either so alyza keeps trying magnus has pawns on both sides of the board so he's very close to winning but aliv res is still with chances knight to d4 check is winning maybe so he plays knight f2 knight and now and now the pawns go both sides with one pawn each and now basically says you know what i'm going to go march my king we're going to trade everything down and we're going to make a draw it's so funny in these games you can castle each you can both castle so this is a a brand new type of format uh every one of these positions is unique we've got some great magnus games players are on fire all over the place let's keep moving right along the incredible thing about fisher random is that again the king is between the rugs but last game there was a queen there right this is just one of these positions so early on in this game something completely happened uh something completely insane happened between leavon and nck uh check this out y'all e4 knight d2 and in this position n abd satov sacked his bishop what yeah because there's no way to guard the king so levon goes here what he's just these king is on the edge of the board but there's no way to mate him you can play queen h6 and then you can play queen g5 and now the king walks all the way to e2 he goes boop boop boop boop boop and now he's safe but because the king is so weak nobe just keeps attacking brings his bishop in plays rook f7 and black is better you notice rook g1 was played if you take my queen this is mate if you take my queen this is literally mate i mean chess 960 fisher random is so goofy it leads to some completely wild positions and all opening preparation is at home openings don't matter anymore in many ways you can even crown the best player in the world like this look at this bros king went on a spiritual walk knight e7 the bishops come out it's a completely insane game norbeck is still a piece down by the way and and and levon is just trying to trade off some pieces and kind of extinguish the initiative look at d5 d5 on the board just trying to open the board as much as you can cuz white is sort of stuck rook d8 king c2 the king is running around now finally finally white has consolidated and he's doing very well but he's only got a minute queen b7 bishop back to f6 levon is a piece up but nck is not he's not he won't stop he won't stop attacking he only has one pawn nck has six pawns versus five he's down a full piece and yet his attack is roaring forward and it actually manages to break through queen e7 e3 but wait a minute but wait a minute levon levon doing his job levon look at this queen d3 nice and solid and then he here narbeck uncorks a rook sacrifice the attack is never over king to f8 nck is down a full rook but knight b4 is on the way with queen e4 coming but bishop a3 now you can't move the knight there rook b8 and now if levon just goes for it he wins but he doesn't he hesitates he plays defensively and all of a sudden nck is back at the what is going on nck has just three pawns that are going to storm down the board king e king d5 what a leevon can't move any pieces oh my god rook oh my god levon's giving up a piece he's giving up everything is levon losing i think he might be but when the d settles it's king rook and knight versus king and rook and this is just a draw so they play 40 more moves and then they make a draw i mean a 100 moves they played a 100 moves what even was this game he sacrifice this is this is what we're talking about i mean this is the real stuff right here this really shows who's got the best nerves and who's the best chess player look at this complete madness of a game this is really what we want you know chess on television of course the purist the traditionalist they're not going to be happy they're not going to be happy this is this is goofy chess this is circus chess uh but uh i mean the games were just absolutely all over the place i'm going to i'm going to keep the starting position here just so you can see this is a brand new starting position this is gukesh versus magnus carlson this one starts with a bird f4 for for white to castle white needs the rook there so you would need to move the queen and the bishop and to castle that way you're going to need to move all four pieces so that's the way you would castle c6 and both guys begin developing their pieces okay now white can't castle that way knight d6 and there's just no openings right there's no openings magnus has the sniper bishop he has a strong structure and then he starts look at that g5 move you can't take with a knight cuz i would take your rook if you take with a pawn that's fine but i'm going to activate my pieces right magnus plays bishop f7 and then here you talk about a psychological blow boink this dude is teleporting off the map and now the king's on the opposite side of the board now you're like oh my god and let's not forget white can't castle white can't castle short the only way white can't castle is longs side which would be queen here and now white could potentially do this which is nuts cuz why would you castle into an attack so i don't i don't know what gach is going to do clearly magnus has planned this out very well where gkes is either going to have to sit here and get mated or castle and get mated what is he going to do he starts fighting back e5 and then he takes on e6 removing this plays queen b3 but magnus is taking over the game magnus has clearly understood the position a bit better than gukesh and he's got a very powerful position knight to c5 gukesh takes here comes magnus knight to d3 takes on b2 oh my goodness gesha king being hit around like a pinata take take e6 but now gash somehow back in the game somehow magnus has been pushed back into passivity knight e5 and oh my god look at this the hero gesh clearly a gotham subscriber because i always say when in doubt run the king to the opposite side of the board rook d8 check he blocks the check with the knight oh my god magnus is losing control of the game in fact magnus is just worse gcash is threatening knight f6 check which would pick up the rook magnus goes here knight e5 take take check the king just goes right back to the middle the knight is stuck the pawns are potentially weak rook h6 magnus still has 2minute advantage on the clock gukesh is like can be a little bit nervous with low time he's not a he's not a huge blitz player but look at this he consolidates and there's a pawn in g's territory that is going to make the difference and there it goes and now both guys are at 30 seconds gesha has evened out the time situation c7 the pawns to score away from queening rook a2 knight d1 what a move what a move stopping the knight and if you take i queen if you take i queen and gukesh consolidates and swarms the black king and is up a piece the most important thing is he's got a pawn remaining because that pawn can become a queen magnus fighting back we're now deep into the 58 we're now deep into the 50 moves rook a7 is mate but if you play bishop b7 i play here bishop c8 knight c5 and then i'm going going to win this bishop and you will resign and gukesh beats magnus carlson in freestyle chess oh my goodness oh my goodness we have seen so many positions we've seen kings over here and queens in the corner we've seen this position and sometimes in these in these games like look over here you know the king is pretty safe here the king is kind of like is it stuck is it going to go that way what's going to happen now one of the craziest storylines of the day by the way is dingly ren so dingly ren uh by the way this is uh i think back to the the n game you'll remember it's the exact same position right so in that game you'll remember uh maybe you don't because this is all really confusing nock sacrificed the bishop here and brought the king out this could have happened in this game as well ding versus fabiano like right here uh fabby could have played bishop takes pawn and then it would have been king takes and queen g6 and king f3 and queen g4 and king e3 and queen e4 and king d2 and then you would have taken the knight back uh but that didn't happen instead we got e6 and this game was very balanced uh it was a complex game and and ding was down in exchange but it was it was very complicated and then it went into an end game and ding had 22 minutes on the clock when he played bishop e5 and hung a bishop like i'm not exaggerating ding had a 10-minute time advantage and played this and hung a piece he was down upon pawn but i mean fabiano did not really have anything impressive going on and you know bishop c3 bishop b4 like yeah probably black is playing this for some advantage but there and dingu straight up just blunder like i i don't i don't i don't know what to say um and um that was one of the biggest storylines of the day that ding played that then i have a few more games for you uh nerb versus dingl run you might recognize this position from this game from the ges magnus game where magnus kind of teleported the king the other way norre in this game went for a massive center and ding played in a very kg approach he played very passively queen c2 we had opposite side castling so you know now we're going to get into a big fight also bishop e6 ding sacrificed the pawn to create immediate counterplay nock took backed up and said i mean i'm up a pawn right and then i'm just going to like i'm going to trade the pieces down because i'm a pawn up knight f4 we have captures on f4 and then we we get to this end game big simplification ific ation and this is the end game and nck is still up a pawn so dingo here n defends starts bringing his king and now it's basically a question of can nock win a pawn up endgame knight versus bishop king d3 he's not rushing takes strong knight rook f1 defending and now he's going to advance and basically what nock is trying to do is isolate the advantage the advantage is there he doesn't have a pawn advantage on the other side of the board so he's going to try to isolate that advantage kind of bite his time clearly it's equal uh and ding is doing a great job defending himself knight f3 solid rook h4 oh but wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute that's maybe something he wanted to avoid in end games you got to be really careful how you're simplifying and now ner backck might have a pass pawn advantage and that might win him the game and there goes his king and he's dancing and he's looking for a way and does he have a way or is this just a defensive set ah that doesn't look very good here comes ding though here comes nra c6 n be is very close and he finds a he finds an idea here but there there's an even more gangster idea and the gangster idea is knight takes pawn and the point is that after this the bishop cannot stop both pawns the king is behind the pawn so you you can't take me it's crazy he misses that he goes for this take take here the knight is coming back knight d5 and it stops the oh my goodness and no is winning he's winning king b4 and the pawn is going to go and it goes and it goes all the way and how are you going to win this position pretty easy you just go forward you allow the queen it's check it's check it's check it's check and it's mate it is mate check check check check and in this position dingler ran resigns oh my goodness what an endgame win by nerb now we move right along vincent kimer who was the grand master this is the very first position that they played the very first type of setup um this one vincent played a very solid setup queen takes d5 bishop to d3 ding went for a pin he had pressure uh but he gave up a pawn early ding was playing kind of in a very aggressive way uh but uh you'll notice vincent just has a dead rook so fisher random is super super clunky and weird and apparently in this position this despite being upper rook white's rooks suck like it's kind of weird how relative peace values exist in fisher random and i'm going to fast forward through this game vincent goes on a monster attack the relative value of black's pieces is way stronger than white's rooks white's rooks are staring at nothing and very quickly vincent develops a mammoth initiative mammoth all the m's are capitalized knight h3 look at this you can't take me if you you take me rook g4 nobody can stop mate not a single one of these bozos nobody can stop mate so ding has to play g3 rook f5 but he is mercilessly attacked by the queen and rook of of of kimer and in this position he just resigns he resigns because he's down a couple of pawns in an end game he will lose this and queen h1 is on the way as well dingley ran is 0 and three and vincent kimer is two and a half out of three vincent drew magnus beat nerb and he beat dingl ren so vincent kimer who's like very very good but he's not you know he's not top 10 yet he's like top 15 top 20 maybe top 25 i'm not exactly sure his level absolutely crushing it and i have one more for you by the way i mean i really hate um i really hate to do this and i i i listen i i love dingle ren but i also love gukesh a lot and i got you know i got to honor when players have monster performances uh in this game ges brought his queen out on the edge of the board because there's no kn see in chess you don't really bring your queen out early except like in the scandinavian defense cuz there's knights and knights are very scary but uh and and just so you know like i i know we love magnus you'll have a magnus game i promise uh but you can bring your queen out because the queen is actually very difficult to target bishop takes f6 knight d5 andes just says i don't even want my rook you see i could have played rook b1 but then you would have went here and then i couldn't go there because you would have taken he just just take it rooks aren't worth anything anymore that's why everybody's sacrificing them rooks aren't worth much in fisher random because they're so passive and because the dynamics of the position in a regular chest setup rooks get to the action relatively quickly like in 15 moves but here it takes a while and and ding obviously like half on tilt and half kind of like i'm going to have to risk it for the biscuit gives up a pawn opens up his king and just starts fighting back but gukesh has long-term pressure and he's just attacking ding's weaknesses and it's almost like a field day i mean black just has no play look at black's rooks ding is going to have to start getting rid of his rooks because just like in the kimer game his rooks are not getting in involved and oh my goodness he starts fighting but bishop d5 look at this beautiful synergy by kesh's army kn2 d4 perfect coordination slowly building up the pressure and this is hanging that's hanging and that's hanging and i mean look and the rook is by the way hitting both things it's just a perfect symphony of peace coordination and when it all it's all said and done it is him just picking up all the pieces queen b4 queen a5 ding resigns he resigns because the rook is trapped the rook is literally like you could play rook c8 then i take and i i i bring a knight in or i bring in a queen dingly ren lost every game he played today he went 0 and four that is shocking now he's not knocked out as i said this is the round robin stage so basically he would be the eighth seed which i imagine comes with some sort of disadvantage right like otherwise i don't even know why we're playing rapid if there's like if everything's the same you're just the eth seed and you i don't know i really i'm i'm not sure but yeah ding did not play his best today um frequently getting stuck with very passive rooks but you know who did play really well today vincent kimer vincent kimer played very well today as you can see this is this is a setup we haven't seen yet so we're probably going to be opening up this bishop we're going to be trying to blunt that one and then white is going to decide which way to put the king so you can't stop a man from playing a london if he wants to play one uh both guys bringing pieces kind of quickly to the game castling and now it's just kind of a london except you're kind of in a dream you know like when you're dreaming and you can't really move your limbs but you can but you can't and it's like that's kind of what we have here we have a fever like for some reason we have a bishop here i i don't know why you know the the the king in the rook castled and the bishop had fallen asleep in his bed they're like you idiot wake up up bishop f5 rook d1 and of course you know we're going to build up the position very normally and there's g3 so here comes the bishop very locked position very locked fabby takes on h1 and then plays h6 and kimer says wait a minute what about g4 g4 and f3 look at that control it's all about control and the person in a close position that controls pawn breaks has the advantage if you control the pawn breaks you have the advantage black does not control the pawn breaks therefore he does not have the advantage look at that knight c5 he's taking a step forward h4 a lot of space getting taken now fabiano tries to fight back take take look at this move queen h2 dear lord to bring the rook to pressure the pawn if the knight moves you got the sniper bishop black is very restricted he plays take take knight d7 because when you're down space you want to trade pieces fabiano a very principled man but vincent kimer controls the pawn braks therefore he has the advantage e4 he's got a lot of space but it's a it's a game where like it it feels like if white makes the wrong pawn move everything will fall apart the whole sand castle knight e5 fabiano seals the door but now look at this we have a new front of attack bishop e3 i'm going to trade your best piece and now look at rook b2 i'm just going to double up i'm either doubling on the b file or the d file you don't know rook d8 oh no i'm going to b7 rook d7 you can't take me because in fisher random rooks are terrible look at that and believe it or not according to the computer the best move is to take and then to play queen a3 to create counterplay i don't know how he was supposed to find that instead he went here and then the space advantage became completely untenable and now mate is threatened and unfortunately fabiano carana resigns as his king is about to get brutalized vincent ker is winning the tournament he is winning the tournament after the round robin again that doesn't mean anything because they have to play a whole another section but he is destroying people and magnus only won one game today he only won one game so again same setup all right that one became a london right so from this setup you know vincent kind of played a london and magnus played uh whatever this is knight c5 knight c5 now i just i want i'm going to tell you something right now which is so wild so in this position levon lost the game levon borderline lost the game after the move b5 advanced computers already state this one move so drastically weaken c5 that white is winning and the point is if you play d6 to control c5 i can very quickly play g3 and a4 and actually it's impossible for black to defend the light squares if b takes even rook a4 something like check here take take this position is already so weak that black is borderline losing so magnus puts his knight on c5 and because now black has to defend the light squares for the rest of the game he is basically losing from like the second move take take and black is structurally busted he can't play d6 he's trying to but this and the point is crazy you just can't take the knight you you can't do anything if he had played queen b6 magnus would have went a4 and a5 which would have forced leavon to play a5 and then there would have been takes and takes and i don't know b4 like you you you cannot move your entire queen side because of the way that you played the opening it's shocking b5 is already borderline a strategic losing mistake in chess you can't lose in two moves unless you really freaking want to but in this game magnus just builds up this positional advantage and levon tries to get you know tactical levon deflects the bishop and takes the knight but his king is too weak look he tries to run with the king magnus plays d5 and a4 and and and levon's just he's too stuck he's too stuck like his king is stuck all the pieces are on the back rank bishop b7 castles and here comes the rook and i mean it like again computer doesn't think this is completely completely hopeless but magnus just won't stop i mean for a human being this is basically hopeless you can't have four pieces on the back rank while your king is just about to get you know massively assaulted c takes b4 and yeah magnus doesn't take with a e just takes with the rook and you can't take because queen d7 s king b6 bishop e3 the king is hunted out into the edge of the board rook rook is going to come in did how how how did he lose in two moves like how is that even possible the theory of chess 9960 is still being developed and it's just fascinating how you could play any setup like literally five or six setups are probably possible from any given position because there's 960 possible starting positions which means within those there's probably like 15 different openings so good luck is my point your standings after the first day of the round robin vincent kimer with three and a half out of four against dingley ren fabio carana nck abdul satov and magnus carlson i think that was his four it might not be nck it might be somebody else magnus only two one win one loss two draws complicated games ding zero leavon 0.5 now this doesn't exactly matter because it's everybody makes the playoffs but maybe it matters because an eighth seed is a disadvantage and you don't get to choose your colors later i i don't know otherwise i'm i'm not really sure maybe these guys could lose on purpose and try to get a better matchup like would you rather play magnus i don't even know is magnus the best at this format i have no idea clearly it seems to be vincent so this is freestyle chess this is day one of the round robin tomorrow we will finish the round robin then we will know our final pairings uh for the quarterfinals and that's all i have for you today get out of here
