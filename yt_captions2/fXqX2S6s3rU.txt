hey hey hey don't contribute to open source okay i haven't watched this one people saying this one is a heater people saying your boy theo went down on it what let's find out open source is great and you probably shouldn't contribute to it i know spicy take damn that is spicy that's that's right off the rip man that's i mean we didn't even you didn't even you didn't even like forplay me into this situation okay you just just dropped a heater on us like this all right type one in the chat if you agree type one in the chat if you agree with this initial statement cold take you think that that's a cold take wow we got a lot of agers we got i mean there's there's ones there's a lot of ones tj did you type a one yes this video is great okay okay y'all are going to have some feelings about this one but this isn't a clickbait video i do actually believe that most developers probably shouldn't be contributing to open source or at the very least setting open source contributions as a goal we're going to take a bit of a weird journey i don't know how i feel about that we're going to let him cook i forgot to turn off alerts his audience say un-based jtsd so yes one get wrecked get wrecked soy devs hey by the way soy i mean first off the js devs they they they are the fastest at creating open source because they make a new framework every day okay so i mean they have the the the open- source output of the javascript community is unlike any other community ever seen ever okay but i think it will highlight why i feel so strongly about this and also help new and seasoned in bettering themselves well why am i talking about this as per usual i saw a tweet this tweet frustrated me not because of the tweet itself the tweet was fine but the responses that i was seeing to it flavia found a post on the react subreddit from a beginner asking for help finding repos with good issues for a first-time contributor they specifically said they didn't want repos that use typescript because they didn't want to learn typescript all of the replies were learn typescript people were upset that this is the typescript cabal pushing so hard to convince everyone to use their language and looking down on those who don't and it accidentally fed into this a bit by the way this is a stupid take jack's 024 if someone's like yo dog any good react repos without typescript i want to contribute to like why why you got why you got to be up in his butt like that you know just hey hey hey if somebody wants to use ruby on rails you let him use ruby on rails okay it's noty it's not my fault i know 68 up votes by the way for first off weak you couldn't get to 69 okay you and your cronies pathetic second off what is that what is that just let the let the let the guy do just javascript there's plenty of javascript repos out there i hate i hate people calling typescript a language damn you hate them you hate them that kind of seems a little intense don't you think don't you think that's like a little intense all right telling beginners to strive for open source contributions was a huge mistake this is uh uh it's clear this dev is very early if they still don't see typescript as a hurdle they will let's see if they still see typescript as a hurdle they will be a massive burden on whatever project they try to contribute to i i don't like this take it all in the sense that some people just want to use javascript i'm literally writing a program right now in javascript using whenever i need to a bit of js doc to make it easy and to make it nice and to make it good you know why because i just don't i'm sick and tired of building just giant ass right i i i i don't want to do it right look at this there we go i look at that look at look how nice that is look how nice that is it it shows it right there i get types i still get all the typy scripts i just don't want to do typescript and i'm giving it a shot right i'm just giving it a shot okay anyways whatever didn't realize that's what people were misreading i called out the issue i saw here which was about beginners desperately trying to sneak in open source contributions but since i use the word typescript here specifically i said if they still see typescript as a hurdle they'll be a massive burden to whatever project they contribute to that's a fact i'm not going to debate that let me i mean if the project's javascript then the project's javascript i mean spelt spelt doesn't use typescript you don't have to you don't have to use typescript the it is okay if you don't want to use typescript i don't want to use typescript i'm not loving js do i'm still i'm still getting used to it i'm still trying it out see if i like it or don't like it it's been fun it's been fine i i don't agree with this take just in general right like i don't think you can tell if somebody's seasoned or new okay and because my only problem is the word beginner is kind of interesting right if you've been programming for five years and you've never contributed to open source are you a beginner or are you seasoned are you seasoned medium rare i don't know like that the problem is is that i i i wonder what they mean by this statement right you're employed i'm just i'm just saying i don't know if you're what does this even word mean i don't know i don't have the context i would probably ask more questions and by the way it is true if you're brand new is it bad or good i don't know let's let's hear him cook let's let let's let let's let tim cook okay i want to hear his argument comments that i'm wrong because that's not what this is actually about and i think if i show you the real reddit post you'll understand just what i mean here the original post everyone replying to trying to find some good project without typescript to contribute can someone help me in finding a good open source project in react without typescript which contains good first issues for a beginner to start as i need to start doing open source but can't find the suitable project dlc interesting interesting i need yeah interesting i as a need i think that's kind of it's it's interesting language right here the problem here is i need to start doing open source no body needs to start doing open source this is why i am so very specifically frustrated and you can even see their replies down here here it is when you do open source your debugging skills improve in everything like networking which can be good for referrals attract interviewee when they see you big contribution in open source and scope of learning is high this sounds like either he chat gped why should i do open source or just read a list of the things you should do to get your first tech job this sucks like genuinely because open source was never about helping somebody get started with dev open source is about sharing contributions to things you use so others can use them and benefit from them as well and if there's a bit of a problem here though there's a bit of a problem the problem is is that so many people are also celebrated because they make contributions to open source and they do get a job you know what i mean like the problem is is that there's like a whole there's a whole problem right i i understand what it means like open source as a requirement to get a job is crazy right and and the fact that this person feels the need that that's the way you get a job is definitely not correct right that is an incorrect way to approach trying to get a job that there is only one way to do it and you must do open source like i think we all agree like i think theo's spot on on that take absolutely right 100% i think this is perfectly done and even showing that this o the op just thinks that this is the way to do it but i do think this right here though is really correct like when you uh when you open source your debugging skills improve and everything like okay so debugging skills true debugging someone else's code is really really good you know what i mean debugging someone else's code that's a that's a great that that is like that is a great skill to have and so i do agree with that statement if you want to go and improve your debugging skills try to solve bugs in a project you didn't write it's extremely hard to try to look at someone else's code because some people's codes they just write it so differently than you it's very very easy to goof this up it's very very easy to goof this up um there's definitely like a dichotomy here though that people certainly celebrate people who do open source stuff and people certainly get all rah rah about it but it's definitely not a necessity i never did open source until gosh so long into it right i i definitely never did any open source until quite some time and then second off you know i'm sure tj will say something like this that i bet you his first job has nothing to do with open source but the job that he really wanted ended up being somewhat based probably in from open source is that is that fair tj is that your first job was not open source and your second job the one at source graph was probably able to make that jump due to open source it seems like in my opinion uh internship plus first job plus second job had nothing to do with oss source graph had some relation to it i would say yeah to me what how i view open source in getting a job is that open source is the goal to get the job you want meaning you've done the work you've worked at a couple jobs you feel pretty you feel pretty good and then you know what you want to focus on and then you're able to go and become an expert in that category and open source is a great place where there's a lot of free stuff that you can like projects already running things you can contribute to uh you can attempt to and then it is fantastic and that's kind of like how you expertise yourself is really getting into the more niche side of things uh is i also don't think it's bad if you're new to try to go do open source like if you want to do open source i think it's a great way to learn but if you think you're going to get a job just because you you fixed an issue and react like let me let me tell you something let me just tell you something it's not it's it's you're not going to get a job by doing that you're not going to get a job kek started doing oss now no job exactly you don't know which projects you should be contributing to it's because the carts being put before the horse here obviously contributing to open source does help with getting jobs as a hiring manager if i could by the way did you you know you how i said when you want to expertise in something then you go and do open source by the time you want to expertise in something you already know what you want to contribute to like if you have to ask what do i contribute to you're probably not ready for oss yet people you're like you're probably you probably just have no idea at that point people should work on os uh oss projects because they enjoy using them and want to make them better bingo uh what should i contribute to uh is like asking what should i build agreed absolutely agreed um i i i think that if you set a goal in your mind that you want to contribute to open source project you should already have like it should already be natural that you have some projects you would like to look into right it there should be some sort of natural by the way that was greg a leptos greg again greg just such a gem gem just an absolute gem every time greg every time anyways let's keep going look at your github and see a lot of contributions read through the code and see that you know what you're doing that builds a level of trust that i couldn't have otherwise gotten without having worked with you in the past but i feel like the carts getting put before the horse here because the open source contributions aren't valuable because they exist they're valuable because they show that you've run into real problems with software not only did you have those problems you fixed them and have been part of the community in that way contributing code also isn't the only way to make a splash via github if you're showing up cutting issues that describe problems in detail especially if you bring reproduction steps with it that's huge being able to articulate problems well and show that you are in the trenches you are out here writing code is way more valuable than convincing some repo to accidentally merge one of your weird poll requests and this is why i'm so frustrated because we're holding the idea of open source contributions as this holy grail that gets you a job but that's not how it works if you're struggling to figure out which projects can by the way he's he's he's spoton this is this is absolutely spoton well said well done issues are great um i i i appreciate issues not that i address the issues but i appreciate the fact that you make issues okay i love collecting issues um real take real talk uh but this is good this is this is a this is a i i would say this is a perfect take this is a per this is absolutely spot-on contribute to you shouldn't be contributing yet the best project to contribute to is the one that you use you have a problem with and you've looked through the source code and think you might be able to solve it and even then you should be starting with an issue not with a bunch of code that you're hoping somebody will take the time to mentor you through fixing open sour that's a good take often whenever i make an issue i follow it up with like i first figure i figure out the problem and then i follow i mean the last few times i've made issues i followed up with should i take an attempt at fixing this because it's just very very nice i i think that's pretty nice i have one on htm x that i want to fix and i don't think it would be very hard i just haven't got around to doing it but i think it's i think it's the right way to always start with here's the issue here's what here's what i found here's what i think the problematic code is like that's always really really nice if you can point out the problematic code like that's that's really really good sce is not a place to go for free mentorship open source is not a place to go to get a free job open source is an ecosystem of people working really hard to keep the web and all of software development alive it is not her job to mentor you at the same time i'm not saying you can't get good mentorship in open source and that there aren't people in open source sce who will do mentorship when people start contributing i've even done this with the contributors both to creat t3 app and upload thing cre3 app has over i think 300 contributors now half of which are firsttime open source contributors that's huge but i like how i like how many people you can recognize due to uh twitter in the photos contributors now half of which are firsttime open source contributors that's huge but that's because they used the project they had problems with it or they saw issues they knew how to solve but it started with using the project not with wanting open source contributions and if your goal is just contributing to open source you've entirely lost the plot and that's what i saw when i saw this reddit post it was somebody who didn't want to learn they didn't want to improve their skills they didn't want to do the hard thing they wanted to use open source as a hack to get a job and that is incredibly toxic and will actually destroy open source if we're not i don't think it will destroy open source i mean that's probably a little too intense i think this is just like hacktober right if all you do is you're just trying to get a couple quick commits so that way you can move on is just hect over all over again uh but at the end of the day you know people are just going to reject reject things right it's definitely going to it's definitely i mean it's just going to cause people to to move away right toberfest it's toberfest let's go let's go let's go right uh update read me i i i i have almost exclusively don't well i don't know what just happened i think i had a stroke i i almost exclusively don't accept read me changes just because almost always is is a read me change so like even though yeah it's like nice it's almost always so worthless biden deb you i don't know what happen i don't know what happened i'm g to go roomba myself off stage now careful about how we recommend these things i called this out on twitter because i think it's incredibly toxic to push new developers to open source as though they'll get free mentorship in jobs that's not how open source works most by the way like mentorship is expensive it's really expensive and the person that's doing mentorship it costs them a lot and so if you go for free mentorship that's i mean the hard part is mentorship is extremely hard to get as a developer it's very very hard as an individual who's struggling to try to figure out how to get into this world and they really really want to be able to make it into this world and to be able to get to that mentorship they need and the thing is is that you have to be able to distill kind of like free mentorship as a scam it's always a scam if someone's offering free mentorship i'd be extremely skeptical for whatever reason they're doing it okay there has to there has there's always a quid pro quo when it comes to me mentorship there's always something on the other side so if the mentorship comes with you fixing a bunch of stuff in their open source project maybe but they have to first kind of validate that you are even worth it to invest in because there's probably plenty of people that are asking to be a part of it like think about how many people have probably tried and said i want to commit to react and then guess what they don't ever get there because have you ever looked through the react source code it's extremely extremely ver house and there's no just simple ramp up it's going to take weeks and weeks and weeks of full-time effort to even get near being like somewhat useful probably in javascript though it is in javascript open source developers and maintainers are already struggling to keep their projects afloat under the weight of all the issues and prs and random nonsense that they're getting especially now that we're seeing a surge of ai generated poll requests and nonsense ai generated poll requests is that real i didn't even know that was a thing i would i would hands down if i ever feel like i'm getting an ai poll request i am shutting you down you're a new developer showing up on an empty github account making a bunch of prs with code that we'll be honest isn't great yet because you're still new it's going to do nothing but frustrate the maintainers and frustrate yourself as well now that you're wasting all of this time what if you just cut issues on the things you use this is what i'm trying to push this whole time so how do we get here by the way a good another thing another thing that i've kind of you know you learn over sometime is when you start using something and you think you find it issue maybe take a step back this is a good tj will love this take read a little bit of the documentation don't just jump right in debug through the code a little bit come up with a make sure that you're actually spotting an issue not just using it completely incorrectly take a little bit of time here why are there so many devs that think open source contributions are this magic trick in order to get a job well i think there's one event that led to a lot of these problems an event hosted by digital ocean every year named hober fest hober fest started all the way back pre-at pre scammed of course toober fest dude it's always dude toober fest is just the worst dude the amount of like dude the amount the amount of just like 2023 like updating updating licenses dude it's just the worst back in 2013 is a collaboration between digital ocean and github this is actually before github was owned by microsoft so the azure digital ocean competition wasn't really something they worried about the inaugural october f was a modest affair participants were challenged to make at least four poll requests to open source repos on github dur the month of october in return they would receive a limited edition hober fest t-shirt as a token of appreciation for their contributions by the way this is like you know the thing is is that when during the time period when this first started was 2013 you know i have a strong feeling that the first year was actually pretty okay do you know what i mean the first year was probably filled with a bunch of people who were likely to be good contributors that's my guess yes but then as word got out and it became a thing is when it became shitty i think this is something you could have done one year i don't think you could do this today right like if i were to do a hober fest make a g commit to a github issue i think it would go really shitty i think it would go really really bad because i don't think you can do it today how many users did github have in 2013 not very like significantly less than today right the event attracted a few hundred participants in audence with this wasn't that they encouraged open source or that they gave out free t-shirts actually pretty cool it was a small thing for open source maintainers to encourage them to contribute to more different projects and get out decent few prs in a given month cool idea i appreciate the sentiment i see what they were trying to do here but it very quickly exploded and caused many more problems than it solved in 2020 open source maintainers were getting tired of the lowquality contributions that tended to come through the october fest goals when you set a goal as arbitrary is get four poll requests merged there the result isn't people being very careful meticulous with the four prs they cut the result is people spamming repost with dozens of prs making single line fixes or changes or just having their own opinions about grammar and hope somebody will merge it so they can hit that threshold and be a member of by the way gr grammar prs you're literally the worst person okay i just want you to know don't do grammar pr okay don't don't do grammar pr don't do it just don't just don't do it just don't do it you know what's really nice if you do be right back like if you document a a uh an api that's public that hasn't been documented yet and you have some nice use cases and all that and you make a you know you go through the nice process maybe join their discord say hey i'm using this i'd like to do this blah blah like that's great but if you're just like you used they are when you should have used their th h ei you're like got him it's just like dude i i hear you but come on october fest i really like how it's put in this article by dominic in reality october fest is a corporate sponsored distributed denial of service attack against the open source maintainer community so far today on a single repository myself and fellow maintainers have closed 11 spam poll requests each of these generates notifications often email to the 485 watchers of the repository and each of them requires maintainer time to visit the poll request evaluate it spaming close it tag it a spam lock the thread to prevent further comments and then report the spammer to github in the hopes of stopping their time wasting rampage the greatest v requests is four per hour and it's not even october yet yeah another article let's see it somebody even made a twitter this is so bad you should be ashamed of this whoever did amazing program at the end whoever did this should be very very should be ashamed okay account called  toober fest where they document the crap prs people are filing during hober fest it's hilarious just how bad things were in the title please accept my po request i will get a free t-shirt please request this amazing this was so bad it was so bad i don't think we appreciate just how bad this got and to me it highlights the size of this problem when you have a bunch of people who don't understand open source and you tell them that it's this magic thing that gets them something be it oh we got we got one more hold on another example let's go let's get a good one this better be a great one oh this is like a whole this is a whole thing damn it damn it one out of seven i i thought it was going to be like a sweet october fest oopsy daisy what are you doing a t-shirt or a job you end up with nonsense to be very very clear i'm not saying you should to open source if you have a problem with something that happens to be open source or you see an opportunity a project you're familiar with to make a meaningful contribution i think you should start with issues but in order to start with an issue you have i feel partially guilty about some of this in the sense that i've said hey contribute to open source but when i say contribute to open source i don't mean just like that i mean you find the thing you like you create your own project you solve your own problem and make it public source so people can look at it like you you do things in public you actually contribute you find the thing that makes sense but i guess so so i mean to be completely real i'm sure this is part part partly my fault because i've said contribute right the the hard part is when when you say things and you there's like an assumed context right there's like an assumed context that you think okay when when i say hey go contribute and people go okay i'm going to go like you know can i has react to js library please right that's a problem this video is great because it addresses a very specific problem which is that contributions are not a means even that's hard to say contributions can be a means to an end honestly they can be a means to an end that's the hard part is that there is truth that being great being great and doing great work in open source can be a great means to an end but the count of issues or the count of poll requests or the count of lines changed is not a meaningful metric does that make sense yes 100 prs is not as good as one good pr 100 prs is not as good as one issue open sources for commies no open source is for charity charity's different if you don't get it you don't get it have to use the thing enough to have an issue not only that 100 bad prs is less than zero good prs facts facts of life do you think that many of these are just children trying to help well i think there's a lot of naivity right uh there's obviously naivity on my behalf saying go contribute to open source and assuming people are going to be like oh i'm going to contribute to the one that i love right right uh but instead it's going to be like i will find project must make go now right uh i think it's just people that are simply new it's just it's just the problem is is that it's simple ignorance i i don't think it's toxic or or um malicious or any of those things i think it's just young people doing what young people do best which is make mistakes i make mistakes constantly a wholesome prime i i'm being serious though it's a lot of these mistakes are just and i wouldn't even say young kids that's probably the the the wrong term inexperienced developers cuz you can be 33 and still make this exa exact same mistake it's easy to make this mistake and so i don't want to on them because they're just trying like at the end of the day uh 32 and i've made the exact same mistake like real talk at the end of the day these people are doing what everybody else is trying to do and they're trying to do it the best they can they just want a job and a good life and and and to be able to provide for a family and have something meaningful to have value to be able to have some level of purpose and they're just trying to figure out how to do that and this is a great lesson in in what you incentivize is what people will do so when everyone is glorifying os and there's these people you see on the internet getting the dream job from os or sorry os oss foss then that's what's going to be incentiv in the minds of these younger people these inexperienced people hold on please stop repeating the same thing just i i think i took an extremely different approach can you please explain yourself i don't want you to explain yourself i don't want you to explain yourself get the hell out of here i thought i was making a completely different point there but maybe i was making the exact same point there but i don't think i was issue with it in order to use the thing to have issues you should be building stuff this is where my constant rant comes back best way to get better at coding is to code more build stuff solve problems that you understand let's say you're really into my theo and i really strongly agree with this one this might be this might be the the number one take i make which is people just constantly come in should i do this should i do that should i use go should i use russ should i do whatever like just build something first how does that sound go build one thing go build two things and then decide do you want to do it in something else maybe build two different languages try two different things try a bunch of different stuff just build a bunch of different things and find which one you like find which one just cuts like cuz there's going to come this one there's going to come a point in time when you're just building little things that one of them is just going to capture your attention and when it captures your attention take note of it dive into it make it yours go as deep as you can but don't wait for somebody to tell you what to build don't wait for somebody to give you the perfect project there ain't no perfect project minecraft maybe make a web app to keep track of the different things you're mining or how close you are to specific goals or you're really into sports make a website for tracking your favorite sports team scores at different events there by the way he's totally right on that because here's the problem is you know what someone will say well there's already that already exists yeah who cares invent the wheel it's literally your job reinvent the wheel there's a lot of things you can do that might not be perfect but solve a problem you understand well enough to know if your solutions working or not and once you start doing that by the way you don't even have to like uh jimmy you said build a better m strap jimmy i don't even think you have to build a better mous trap when you've never built a mous trap build a mous trrap learn how to build a mous trap because you could probably learn how to build a better one after you've built it once you'll almost certainly use open source projects and once you start doing that you'll certainly start to run into problems good open source contributions don't come from the goal of contributing to open source they come from an understanding of what the project does that you're contributing to and this is what i mean when i say the cart before the horse the horse is having a problem with some open source software the card is the fix that you created to that problem or even just the issue you cut about it but if you put the cart in front which is the goal of open source contributions you're not going to get anywhere you're just going to sit there refusing to learn typescript for some reason and not progressing i don't like that last point that last point typescript does not mean you you can you don't have to learn typescript you can try js talk you can also just try rust you can try go you can program in lua you can do whatever you want to do okay i i the typescript i do not think makes you better or worse it just makes a thing now me personally if i had to do pure javascript no js doc or typescript i would choose typescript every single day of the week okay i have like layers i have layers of what i want i want as much type safety as possible like that's just that i think he's saying i don't want to learn new things i just want to get my oss contributions well that's fair that's fair you have to i mean if you want to do oss contributions by that very nature you have to learn something new and so you should choose a project you will be using a project that aligns with your views as it is does that make sense if you don't like typescript and you're building things you will probably end up using non- typescript projects at some point and if you never do well guess what then you have no projects to contribute to but if you end up do you finding something then contribute to that it's just weird it's just a weird it's just weird that people by the way it's also just weird that you don't want to ever use typescript just it's it's it takes like 16 seconds to learn just just learn it it takes like four seconds if someone's already set up a build system then it's easy and then just run with it it's like it's so simple it's painfully simple just call an f a number a number and when you don't know what to do just throw an any on it and boom you're good to go and i see this a lot this is why i made my goal setting video because developers set really goals especially new developers goals like make an open source contribution or learn javascript kind of suck because you don't understand either either of those things well enough to know when you've achieved it goals come from things you understand not things you don't start with something you understand be it a video game you play a random app you want to recreate something that you know so you know when it is or isn't working and work backwards from there but if you're starting with something you don't understand as your goal you're never going to get there and i've seen so that's really good advice that's actually really really good advice right this is really really good advice by the way i actually really like this yeah i like that uh as a person who used lua for a long time i understand and empathize the hesitance toward static typing you seriously need to use it for a decent bit to understand the need yeah i mean but the problem is is most people don't even use static typing like typ remember typescript isn't static typing it's not static typing lua has effectively very close to equal type safety with luid do right it's almost as good it's it's it's it's shockingly good uh typescript is as much typed as type is to typescript as oh my goodness tj tj stealing it tj stealing it tj you got to do it i'm not going to steal it from you type is to typescript as java is to javascript there you go you didn't type it that way by the way you did not you did not say it as good as i did you did not make an analogy you did not make an analogy like i did okay is as much okay you did do an analogy but you said is as much typed that's that's not it's not right you got to do is to is to okay everybody like that everyone lik that derivative work i everyone go like it ah tj i hate it i hate it but i'll like it anyways you got to give you got to give it the the proper analogy we'll all like it we'll all like it type safety is a spectrum that makes that is an interesting way to phrase it nts is pretty uh damn good even let's see even then better than uh getting nothing oh my goodness maple leaf normally you type very great sentences i'm not sure what happened here but i'm i'm on your team i prefer types over not types like every single day of the week can we all agree to that i think most people will agree to that there's very few people that are like types are genuinely bad for the joy of programming okay that's like the full dhh crowd right very few people like that very very few right now i've been in i'm in a js doc phase right now like i've showed right here look at this this is my auto complete i called create log right here it's autocom completing with debug erir fatal trace waren and you can see all that right here like that's nice this is really really nice it's giving me exactly what i want to know right here um js do overts right now yeah i like it a lot more honestly i like it a lot more like a lot uh but that's just right now that's just right now we'll see we'll see how it goes but devs will not respect writing js doc and guess what dev cevs don't respect people who use a fake ass type system what do you doing what are you doing what are you doing what are you doing caring what devs think dude i don't care if someone's just like oh you did you didn't use ty script you use jazz do oh my fees are hurt it's just like you know what i also did i spent zero seconds building a system of any kind i never have to build and i just say node go and i can distribute it with node i can just point someone to it and it just works right like there is something that is very very nice about that js doc is is so boast yeah it's a it's more for boast for sure for sure absolutely but so is so is what you can do with typescript don't forget that typescript also has its own verbosity that's not quite the same you will find yourself being unable to call functions because you haven't done this really clever form of of of of type uh like setting up and you'll find yourself doing a lot of types scripting not javascripting it's it's not it's not free it's it's it's most certainly not free anyone to tell you things are free nothing's free in this world there is no free system js doc is not great ts is not great javascript is not great rust is not great go's not great none of them are great and if you think any of them are going to solve your problems of programming you are completely full of it life is pain and anyone who's telling you otherwise is trying to sell you something this has been this is this is it's so obvious can you just get it get over with it my goodness anyways the name i really like this video by the way theo did a great job that was great that was great uh i i don't think that's cynic i think that's called being a realist anyone who thinks that farming will be a joyous escape from programming is a fool and anyone who thinks programming will be a joyous escape from farming is a fool it's difficult all of them are difficult just because life has pain doesn't mean it's not also wonderful absolutely you can enjoy the things you can enjoy for sure you should find the joy you have to cultivate joy for sure you have to cultivate enjoying what you're doing if you don't enjoy what you're doing and you don't cultivate it you will most certainly just keep feeling worse and worse and worse there you go and i never said a gen and the j
