foreign [music] okay so that's it the movers are gone the apartment's pretty much empty as you can hear from this echoing i've just got one or two last pieces of furniture to sell and then it's time to drive across the country it's kind of a bittersweet feeling because i'm really excited about what's coming next but this apartment's been home for a while and i've shot like 40 youtube videos in here and it's been a decent home but it's the end of an era and it's time to start something new i've honestly lost track of the number of times i've moved in the last 15 years it's over a dozen for sure but this move is a little different because instead of going internationally or to somewhere different i'm actually going home the city where i was born toronto i spent pretty much my whole adult life trying to get as far away from home as possible and if you told me that one day i'd be moving back to toronto i probably would have laughed at you but life is funny and people change and so i'm packing up my car and driving 4 000 kilometers across the country to start a new life in the city where i was born so instead of a normal educational type video this one's going to be a little bit different i'm going to bring you along for the whole drive and on the way i'm going to stop and shoot a super short film where i kind of try and make sense of the last 15 years of constant movement and figure out what's next so all that's left is to mop the floors and fill a couple holes in the wall and then it's time to hit the road so goodbye vancouver it's been fun but it's time to go home this is floyd money mayweather and this little guy is michael jordan [music] all right so it's about six a.m a little bit behind schedule but uh nothing too crazy it's time to do it six day drive back to back to toronto got my money tree it's been with me through a whole bunch of things nearly died about five or six times and now is making the trick with me so gotta co-pilot and it's time to go oh yeah and i forgot to mention i'm gonna be filming the entire thing using only an iphone get me say you want this energy [music] okay so day one is in the bag after waking up at 4 30 in the morning and driving for 11 hours i made it through the rockies to alberta and into this extremely cheap uh hotel room that smells kind of like a ymca bathroom not super nice i am exhausted so i'm just gonna run out and grab some food take the gear out of the car and then go to sleep as soon as possible because i've got another 10 hours of driving tomorrow so luckily for me this hotel room has no roadside access so i've got to carry all this gear upstairs without the cart super fun [music] all right so it's just past 6 a.m and it's time to reload all this gear back in the car do another nine hours of driving i really hope wherever i stay next is on the ground floor because i really don't want to have to do this five more times this sucks [music] crazy work karen house plans up and down the stairs last night but below freezing at night and i don't want them to die so gotta do it hope you guys appreciate what i do for you [music] so here's one big limitation of filming only with an iphone and that's audio i decided to stop at one escape one in saskatchewan which is an old indigenous buffalo jump and now a heritage park and actually where we scattered my dad's ashes after he died when i was a teenager it's a pretty special place for me personally so i made a quick detour and spent a few hours catching up at the spot and reliving some old memories so i just called my mom to ask her she remembered where the spot was where we scattered the ashes and uh as best as we both can remember it's right about here even if i'm not in exactly the right spot it's not really the point she said uh i guess on the day that we scattered the ashes as soon as we've done it it's an overcast day and as soon as we scattered them the sun came out and she looked up on the ridgeline behind me up there saw a guy walking past who looked a lot like him and the words the world is a beautiful place came to her sort of out of nowhere and she thought that was spirit of my dad talking to her so we got that engraved on a bench and put it in the town where we live in ontario so yeah pretty powerful spot pretty emotional day for both of us dad if you're out there somewhere or wherever you are love you i miss you see what you like this place again the wind blew out my audio here and honestly it wasn't all that windy so if you're ever thinking of trying to document something using only your iphone make sure you figure out some sort of sound solution the video quality has been pretty impressive but the sound not so much anyways as i was driving through the prairies i randomly saw that there was a fully abandoned ghost town called bounty and i couldn't resist stopping even though it was a beautiful sunny day i'm not going to pretend that this place wasn't just a little creepy and after an hour or so of wandering around i noticed that i kept looking over my shoulder in case there was some sort of ghost zombie behind me so i took that as a sign that i should probably move on all right the creepy ghost town out of here so if you're ever driving through saskatchewan and want to film something kind of weird or maybe shoot a horror movie don't forget about bounty [music] now we're gonna drive about 45 minutes to pike lake which is a place where i used to go with my family and the summers it's a tiny little place but yeah i've got some great childhood memories there so don't know what i'm gonna find it's probably much smaller than i remember but i'm here might as well go [music] so i'm at pike lake provincial park where my family used to have a really tiny cottage when i was a kid i remember going canoeing back here with my grandfather and like as a kid just remembering it was this massive massive lake but now it's actually really tiny cool to come back and see this place again just gonna walk around a little bit and then keep driving [music] thank you so it's been a really memorable uh two days here in saskatchewan i visited a lot of old childhood places that i hadn't been to in a long time and some some pretty powerful spots that are really connected to the past and i'm really glad i did it but i still have three more days of driving so it's time to get out of here finish this drive up [music] so apparently you can't cross the u.s border with house plants since i'm too sentimental to get rid of them i am going to drive through canada i just got turned away from the border it's going to add like six extra hours of driving cost me a bunch extra money but i don't know i'm attached to these plants so change of plans turning away from the border and doing the whole drive through canada i hope these plants are grateful [music] so i've pretty much just stopped filming the last two days as i after i turned away from the u.s border because i realized i had to do 30 -hour days of driving to make it back without spending an extra day on the road even though i definitely regretted the decision a few times or more than a few times to add six kilometers to the drive just to save a couple house plants i gotta say that doing the whole thing within canada has been kind of cool i've never driven across the country before i'm excited to start the next chapter in toronto i've also been seriously impressed with this iphone i would never have documented any of this journey with the camera for obvious reasons i did buy this iphone mostly to use as a camera and i've been super impressed so i'm just gonna get this last hour over with and then sleep for a really long time foreign so i just got to toronto i feel disgusting and i probably look like an insane person my legs have been asleep for like the last five hours and i really fell off the bandwagon with documenting this trip anyways i'm here i made it i probably wouldn't do that drive by myself again but i'm going to unload the car chill out for a little bit and then i'll let you know my final verdict on filming with the iphone all right so we're on the deck of the new apartment i just went down for like a four hour nap michael jordan and uh and my money tree are settling into their new home glad i saved them now that we're here i mainly wanted to document that just for myself to remember the trip uh but if those kind of videos are fun or if you want to see more of them from time to time let me know in the comments and in terms of my final thoughts on the iphone on one hand i was very impressed i mean i think the video quality is shockingly good for a cell phone looking back on some of the footage it looks pretty good definitely struggles a bit in low light and it's not the same as shooting with a professional camera and i would like to be able to say you know the best camera you have is the one you have with you and you can do amazing work with an iphone that's kind of true but there are some pretty serious limitations like the audio for one lack of an nd filter like you can set with if you use an app you can set the shutter speed manual but without nd it gets all wonky it gets really hard to control so you would need to build it up into sort of more of a rig and then not necessarily a rig but you need to put filters and microphones on it and then it's not really something you can have in your pocket and have with you all the time so purely from a visual standpoint i think it's really good i wouldn't personally use an iphone for professional work and maybe that's no surprise but i will use it a lot for grabbing more unguarded bts personal life stuff that i would never film otherwise because even though i've been doing this for over a year now i am just not the kind of guy who's going to walk through an airport with an fx3 and a microphone pointed at me it's just it's just not gonna happen sorry guys maybe next year but verdict on the iphone really great camera for what it is the phone itself does nothing different than my five-year-old iphone before it it's made no changes in the quality of my life at all it's purely a camera investment and really just a youtube investment for me but if you're looking for a camera to replace a mirrorless or something you know i wish it were that easy but this really isn't quite it but it is the best phone camera i've ever used and none of this footage would exist without it so lots more iphone footage to come and i'm gonna go back to sleep boats
