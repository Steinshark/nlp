not so long ago led lights were a relatively new technology in the filmmaking world and most serious professionals wouldn't have considered bringing them on set obviously that changed pretty quickly and these days i'm seeing more and more led lights on big productions aperture was probably more responsible for this shift than any other company and now i'm seeing aputure 300 600s and 1200s on all sorts of projects including a multi-million dollar an episode dock series i finished a few months ago but as good as aperture lights have gotten and even though they're still amazing value for what they offer they're still not cheap and a 600d pro can run up to nearly two thousand dollars with the base model coming in at 1100 at the current sale price so when small rig reached out to me and asked if i wanted to test out their new 450d light that costs a hundred dollars less than the 600d despite posting pretty similar output numbers on paper i was really excited to see if this budget alternative could be a good way for indie filmmakers to get a big light into their kit without breaking the bank so in this video i'm gonna run the 450d through a couple basic lighting scenario videos where i would normally want to use a big light like this to see how the new guy in the market stacks up to the reigning king and whether or not it's going to be a permanent part of my lighting kit for documentary work hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsyth and on this channel i teach the skills and tricks i've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer okay right off the bat let's get the disclosure out of the way this video is not sponsored i will not bow to any spots there small rig did send the light and the softbox to me and i've worked with them in the past but there was no money involved and i'm free to say whatever i want and spoiler alert i'm going to because unlike a bunch of reviews i saw on this light my thoughts aren't all positive i've been an aperture fan since the early days when they burst onto the filmmaking scene and my very first light ever was one of their light storm one by one panels i forget what it's called exactly but since then i've used most of their lights i've owned a bunch of them and have pretty much been very happy with them across the board i'm not married to any brand though and i'm happy to use whatever is right for the job so when small rigs started making lights i agreed to try out their much smaller 120d i'll just ignore how weird it is that they copied aperture's naming structure almost exactly you're copying me but if you missed that video from a while back the short version is that but i really like that light and i still bring it on shoots with me today it's small affordable and it does what i needed to do at a lower price point so what's not to love so when small rig sent out the 450d i was really excited to see if it could become my new heavy hitter in the lighting department and stopped my need to constantly run aperture 600s when i need a really big light on set i'm not an overly technical guy and i'd rather leave that stuff to the pros like gerald undone so i'm not going to talk about the tungsten equivalent numbers or the cri values or any of that stuff because it's already all out there instead i'm going to put this light through its paces in the type of situations where i'd normally need a light that's more powerful than the aputure 300d that i already own so without wasting any more time let's jump into the first setup so we're in my tiny living room and the first test we're going to do is get the light out of the box and see if i can fill this whole room with believable looking daylight even though it's getting darker and darker outside so like all of these lighting companies now they all kind of make the same sort of cases sure there's variations on what makes some of them better does come in a nice box everything's nicely packed away so about what you'd expect for a almost thousand dollar light fixture this connector seems pretty solid like the light itself is made out of decent plastic and i'd be really worried though if this was made out of plastic but it does feel like most of it's metal it feels really solid and actually it's a pretty clever design no worries about the light falling off so good job on that so one thing you can notice right away is that the build quality on everything you can see where they save their money it's not bad exactly but everything's just a little bit less refined than you might be used to with like the aperture series you know instead of that big braided cable you've got this wire does exactly the same thing so that's up to you how much you care about those kind of things or if raw output is more important than things like braided cables but i notice the difference we're just going to put on the controller box this is extremely cute i'm just noticing this thing is adorable this light is normally controlled all by all from the back of the unit and if you're going to raise it up on a stand that's kind of a big deal so small rig was nice enough to send me this controller unit that means you can clamp it onto a stand and attaches with magnets pretty cool little thing i guess it feels again like they save some money on this design but should work so if i knew i was going to shoot a scene around dusk and i wasn't going to be able to control the light coming in through the windows i would want to light this whole room up and that's one of the main ways i could see myself using a big light like the 450d so we're not going to win any cinematography awards with this it's just a shot straight on of a couch but let's see the difference right now versus after we turn on the small rig that's a pretty big difference i mean it doesn't look great because it's going straight into the wall it would probably be better with the soft box or with a bit more diffusion or if we bounced it into a piece of diffusion cloth and then back at the scene rather than just right up into this hard light if we fiddle with it a bit we can give the illusion that it's just broad daylight the whole time we're filming in here as long as we don't film so long that it gets clearly dark outside we can keep working in here for as long as we need it so the other way that i could see using a light like this in here would be to motivate window lighting so we're going to put the softbox on roll it into the corner right up against the window and see if we can get a believable window light coming even though the light outside is getting darker and darker foreign box out i'm used to using normally the light dome system from aperture and sort of consistently like i'm finding with this they cut corners on build quality uh to make the light cheaper so it doesn't set up quite as nicely as the aperture system but it is big it didn't take long if you have the aperture soft boxes i don't know that i'd recommend replacing it with one of these oh [music] so i just knocked the control box off of this little magnet thing for like the eighth time so it's a nice idea but this would not stand up to what i normally put my gear through to be honest okay so what we're trying to do here is simulate light coming through this window we're filming this in my apartment and i never really intended for this to be a lighting tutorial on different kinds of setups i just wanted to see what kind of output i could get out of this light to see if it could you know replicate the sun it can the power to me the shot looks natural but its huge size is also kind of a problem it does take up a pretty significant amount of floor space especially this soft box which is probably almost four feet deep so if you're used to working in confined rooms i don't know if this is going to work for you okay so the 450d handled that situation pretty well but that's not so surprising considering it's raw output it did a good job of lighting up the dark space and it probably could have handled a much bigger room than my tiny apartment but that's sort of to be expected for a light this bright my 300d could have done the job to be honest and probably even something much smaller like even a 120d could have worked so if you're mainly working in smaller spaces this massive output is probably overkill when i tried to expose for the light through the window outside and then match the exposure with the 450d it also handled that pretty well but again no big surprise overpowering window light in an interview setting is probably one of the most common situations where i'd need a strong light and it did pass the test though not with a ton of output to spare so in indoor situations the 450d performs well and has probably all the power you'd need in most cases but the more i used it the more i started to realize how small rig had managed to get the price solo while matching aperture's output on the more expensive version and that's through build quality and design if you've ever used an aperture light you'll know that one of their best features is the way the control box and the ballast are all combined into a single unit that clamps onto the stand at least for all their lights made in the last few years that is since i haven't used many non-aputure leds i guess i just kind of took this whole system for granted but when using in the small rig i realized what a good piece of design it really is instead of a single unit with the small rig you get a giant power brick that seems like it weighs almost as much as the light itself and because it doesn't attach the stand you've got a lot more cables running from the light to the ground which means more things to trip on and it makes it harder to move around on top of that all the controls are up on the light fixture itself which means that as soon as you raise it to a certain height like above your head you can't see what you're doing anymore and you have to lower it or use the app and the app does work but in a fast-paced environment where you're trying to make quick adjustments i personally would much rather be able to turn a dial than have to pull my phone out i love the fact that all these lights have apps don't get me wrong and in the right situations they're amazing but on a big documentary set especially if you're dealing with multiple lights from multiple manufacturers the need to use an app just slows me down personally that is now small rig does have a solution to this and that's the additional control box that they were nice enough to send me with the light and that means that you can get the controls down to a more usable height but at 79 for the unit it cuts into the savings a fair bit which is sort of the main advantage of this light and even though the little control box thing with the magnet clamp is a cool idea in theory in practice it's really easy to knock off and it's not nearly as sturdy as the feeling of the solid chunk of aluminum with that super clamp that aperture ships with its bigger lights i knocked the box off so often even in my apartment that i'm pretty sure if i took this thing into a real dock shooting environment out in the world that i would probably end up smashed into a bunch of pieces pretty soon i've never felt like that using aperture stuff and for me it's a real concern because i just don't have the time to be super careful with my gear one thing i will say though is that at least the way it mounts to the stand feels solid and it uses a sort of tripod head system that feels good and like it's made of metal so it's not all bad for indoor use the light passed the test though i was already finding myself getting a little bit annoyed with the user experience like i said but the real test is how it performs outside because for me the main reason to have a light bigger than a 300d is to fight the sun so we've got scott sitting in the interview chair he's filming me right now we have all the lights off or the light off what i wanted of a big light this is one of the main scenarios where a big light is super useful i want to be able to fight the sun and really fill in all those shadows on his face so let's see if the small rig is up to it well that's a hundred percent intensity it is doing what i needed to do but just barely if i'm being perfectly honest it's not as bright as i thought it would be we are outside in an on an overcast day it's not that bright so if it was full sun right now i don't think this would do it so if you don't do a ton of shooting outside this might not be the end of the world for you but for me it does impact one of the lights or one of the things i would like to use the light most for so something to be aware of all right so in an outdoor situation the 450d did manage to fill in the shadows like i needed it to but it was at 100 brightness and the subject was in the shade if you'd been in direct light i don't think it would have been strong enough but then again the aputure 600d likely wouldn't have been able to do it either for that you'd probably need something like a 1200d equivalent but so far the 450d is the strongest light small rig makes so if you think you need more output to battle the sun in direct light there really isn't a budget option from smaller to get and i have to say i kept getting more and more annoyed with the build quality as i worked with the 450d i probably knocked the control box off like three or four more times and this time it was cracked off of hard lumber instead of a carpet and just in general everything felt a little janky i found the soft box really hard to attach and when you're setting it up it's a lot harder to get the spoke things to lock and unlock with something like an aperture light dome partly because it's absolutely massive but also because the system is just a little bit worse not to sound like a baby but when it comes to unlocking the spokes or ribs or whatever you call those things some of them were so stuck that it legitimately hurt my hands and you know what that's to be expected because how else can they make it cheaper than its rifle while getting similar or even more output but for the way i work this is a real problem if you're wanting to take this light onto a commercial set or something where you'd build it once on a big combo stand and maybe wheel it around a little bit and that's it then this isn't really a huge issue but doc shooting can get really frantic and i need super tough gear that i can get up and down very quickly without worrying if it's going to break something or that i'm going to waste five minutes and cut my finger trying to collapse the softbox i know it sounds like i'm being really harsh on this light and i'm not trying to say it's a bad light at all because it's a lot of output at an extremely competitive price it also packs up smaller than the 600d which makes it easier for traveling though it's still a pretty decent size for some filmmakers this could be a great all-in-one light especially if you find 300d underpowered but also don't use bigger lights enough to justify the extra money for the 600d but for me personally once you add the control box which i would say is almost required for how i use this light it's actually really not much of a savings at all at the current prices when i recorded this video on amazon and b h the light is 999 dollars and the box is 79 compared to one thousand and ninety dollars for the 600d so really it's less than a 20 difference in exchange you're really giving up a lot of build quality and design that makes aperture stuff so nice to use so if you think you'd don't need the control box and you can afford to be really careful with your gear this is a pretty impressive light from a company that's new in the market and you could get some massive output and also save yourself a bit of cash by sacrificing build and user experience it's an ambitious light from small rig and it shows how quickly their technology is progressing and for a filmmaker who just needs raw power on a budget it could be a good option but for me and the way i work it's just not quite there yet and i'd personally much rather spend a hundred dollars more to get a light that's built better and is easier to use as time goes on i'm sure small rig will find a way to improve all this stuff and i'm looking forward to that time but for now i'm gonna have to pass on this one
