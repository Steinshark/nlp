ladies and gentlemen the game of chess is one of the most intense and exhausting physical mental and emotional activities that a human being can participate in several years ago there was an article in espn that said chess players can lose dozens of pounds during a competitive chess event so i decided to make it even more extreme you see about a week ago i was at a massive chess festival for kids and i did this this is the 4 versus one super soaker chess challenge and it's exactly what it sounds like i am playing four chess games at the same time with a clock i only have 15 minutes to play all of those games and throughout this endeavor i am getting blasted in the face in the body at full force by massive water guns i'm going to take you through game by game and show you clips of what happened let's go kind of embarrassing but none of the kids told me their names and nobody asked me to ask the kids their names so these kids are boy one boy two girl one girl two and they go straight down in order blue water gun green water gun pink water gun and orange water gun and this was very very scary i opened up with e4 you see i've got 15 minutes on the clock right i want to win as fast as possible but i got to i got to be a good sport about it all right i can't just win every game in four moves and not get blasted with the water guns because then somebody's going to cry and then i don't want to be gotham chess that made children cry at a kids chess festival so boy number one opened with uh e4 e5 which is very logical and yeah you know i wasn't feeling very uh nice in the beginning so i played queen to h5 i was just trying to go after you know his king and see if he was going to be able to defend himself oh and he did and he he basically made me look like a complete idiot and he already at a better position after you know three moves of chess so i'm like uhoh this is really bad let me slide back and let me just sort of regroup but he's already got a better position remember i'm going around i'm playing a move on every board but i'm taking you through this game and my emotions and i'm and i'm walking and and right around kier i already realized yeah look boy one with the blue water gun he's just playing good chess i mean he's just developing his pieces he's got two nights he's following the golden moves the bishop came outside of the pawn chain and stupid gotham has his queen out this is completely wrong but but all right i've played chess for 20 years i'll be able to make do with the queen and here i did something that i thought was very creative right i'm allowing him to take my knight normally that's not a good decision it's not and it's actually not even the best decision right now for me but i'm relying on the inexperience of my opponents right i'm relying on the fact that i'm going to attack at all costs they're going to be distracted going pew pew pew and they're going to be distracted doing things like this oh oh we knocked over a bunch of pieces there listen nobody's ever had a child with a water gun at a chess board of course he was going to knock over some of his pieces i was just happy he didn't knock over some of his pieces and then get my queen off the board somehow but he didn't do that so in this point i allowed boy number one to open up my king normally that's very good and it's actually very good in this position as well if he then follows up and starts attacking my king this is actually just a pure fork from boy number one with the blue water gun whose rating is 9,999 it's just a good position i got to guard this pawn otherwise i'm going to lose my queen but the idea of me opening the king like this and this is actually something you can do when you're playing extreme water gun chess and drowning you can open up your own king like this put your king in the corner and then play rook g1 and this was my idea samide castling i got to be mean to these children all right cuz in a few years i'm going to be the one with the water gun and they're going to be playing against four people at the same time and now unfortunately this gentleman did not react in the best way i already have very mean intentions of going over here he kind of had to anticipate that he didn't and he really didn't and in the span of two moves in just trying to get to my queen we see the advantage goes up uh a lot for white this is instructive though obviously we're having fun and we're trying to you know play uh extreme water gun chest and drown gotham cuz gotham doesn't know how to swim he knows how to swim a little bit but you know not when he's getting blasted in the nose and the ears and uh yeah uh my opponent went here which is not you know the worst move in the world but now they probably needed to go over here now g5 and now actually here i did something dumb i actually made a mistake like throughout this event you know i was not always playing the best moves the best move here is queen takes pawn followed by rook g1 and bishop g5 and i just win and this is a very very common beginner mistake it's a mistake which is uh pushing a pawn attacking something forgetting what that pawn used to defend i thought i was just winning and i went here i lost all my advantage this was an actual mistake and it's instructive my idea was sacrifice go here play rook g1 and i win but that was wrong because after take take my opponent can go king h8 and use the knight as a shield which i totally just in the running around i just made a huge mistake if my opponent went king h8 in this position i'm not mating anybody i'm not mating anybody anytime soon and then he's going to bring the queen and he's going to trade the queen and i i don't know i don't know how i'm going to win this position i actually made a mistake because yeah water gun chess uh luckily my opponent went here and sometimes in chess the difference is point4 or checkmate and yeah m5 is on the board i played rook g1 and now my opponent doesn't have enough time he doesn't have enough time to come back and that's mate and that's mate so two separate checkmate threats my opponent stops one but i go here and at this point well you know i went to checkmate him and uh he got revenge on me that's check i'm going to run away now that was so fast that's check i'm going to run away [applause] that was so fast but overall boy number one was actually shockingly nice he joined a super soer challenge and kind of just played chess he didn't he barely used the super soaker which i really appreciated uh cuz a little while later i tried to take it from him more on that later though uh this was a very fun game uh i started out this game uh this is this is boy number two i started out this game guns blazing i was going to go in i really wanted to beat at least like one kid in five moves but then i kind of reconsidered so i started with e4 and this kid was very nice he was telling me like he watches my videos and stuff and i was like that's really sweet i'm still going to take your soul but he was very nice he was uh he was very sweet and um we we actually played a vienna if any of you play the vienna you know that the copycat is ruthless yeah i was ruthless with it i mean i just straight up went went queen here cuz again it's the opening phase so so i don't actually know how strong every kid is and i can't just assume they're 500 cuz that's disrespectful this kid might be 1,700 you know he played knight f6 though he blundered he he developed his piece and attacked my queen he'd never really seen an opening like this and now i have queen g7 and then the poor kid had a choice between two rook moves and he should have went there defending this and two moves in a row now he made attacking my queen and it's mate on the board but at this point as i reached my hand to deliver the checkmate i got hit in the ear with a water gun like straight in the ear from the other side by girl number two who we will cover later she was a demon with the water gun so i got hit in the ear i got discombobulated and then i got back to this board and i played bishop takes f7 and i missed my winning idea i missed queen takes f7 cuz i got hit in the face that is totally what happened in this game i totally did not feel like being nice king went up to e7 and then i took the rook with discovered check and then i went back and i said you know what i can't believe i missed checkmate but we're going to keep the game going a little bit now lesson for my opponent anytime your opponent's queen is brought out early just just like in the previous game just make sure the queen can't do any damage so just defend stuff just defend right just defend stuff it happens it happens and then i crazy that i miss checkmate because i got hit in the ear with a water gun that was nuts anyway my opponent took on e4 and um you know i i i saw in this position that i think my opponent in this game was a little bit too distracted was trying to blast me with the water gun and just has to take a little bit better care of his pieces it happens you know uh and uh i was i was really messed up at this point already so i you know i didn't see this i missed this i played pawn to d3 and i was like all right young man let's go let's see what you got and at this point i came to my senses i was like wait a minute i'm going to checkmate him i'm going to checkmate him the next time i get back to the board and he started a big counterattack sacrificing his bishop now my best move in this position is to move the king out of the way so he doesn't have a check at which point i would deliver a mate but then he finds this sniper of a move attacking my king okay pawn to g3 and now something in this something very funny happens i threatened mate right and then he went here and then he made a second move in a row and he played the move queen f7 yeah if you're confused i'm also confused i have no idea what happened i just i didn't even know this happened at the time because i was so focused on getting blasted with super soers i don't know how this happened i think maybe like we had a conversation and he just thought it was his moover i don't know what happened maybe he forgot to press the clock and he saw his clock was running and he was like oh my clock is running so then he went here and he pressed the clock it's actually a great move and at this point my young opponent started playing really really really well it's kind of a shame he waited this long in the game to start playing perfect it's a shame that he he he made a lot of blunders early on cuz his defensive skills were actually really good so at this point i'm like all right i know i'm winning obviously i have more pieces i'm i'm going to try to get some pieces over here but now he goes here right targeting my queen and getting out the light squared bishop and uh and i'm trying to checkmate him but i can't his king is pretty safe i i have a zigzag checkmate here which i actually miss i have check queen here and check back which i did i didn't even see did did not even begin to cross my mind um so i played rook a4 which which i thought was logical trying to bring the rook over here and like i said i mean he played really well he got all his pieces in he just didn't have enough pieces so i brought my rook and now i uh i'm i'm i'm ready to go rook to e7 but the game ends in a little bit of style uh with rook g8 and around here boy number two started getting assistance from boy number one like this was crazy you know as if like the two moves in a row and the kids having the ability to shoot me with the water guns wasn't good enough they started colluding and i tried to get the i tried to get the gun back from the kid i i was like hey if you don't want to use it well let me just show you all right guys i just want to i just want to i just want to see it i don't want to just let me see it ah you're not even playing anymore now two of my opponents were seated on the other side and these two girls were were so ruthless with the water guns and unbeknownst to me one of them ran out of supplies she blasted all the water from the super soer just to have a member of chess.com staff secretly slip her another water gun we got four kids we got 15 minutes on the clock we got four super soakers now we got five five super soers and we got kids making as many moves as they want in a row cuz i can't even track it cuz i'm dripping water i mean this was nuts all right this girl had the pink water gun and she she got started really early i mean move to she was just i was like okay fine you're going to run out of supplies we played an italian opening all right we had a vienna uh in the first game we had a we had a we had a wayward queen attack uh which would did not go really well uh and in this game we had we had an italion and then i played pawn to c3 and i played the joko piano which is uh a very very old opening trying to put two pawns in the center and unfortunately here i think my young opponent was a little bit too excited to start the game she put her pawns and knights and bishops out and then she castled she was not paying attention to old gotham what you're supposed to do here with black you're supposed to take relieve the pressure and before white swarms you with the pawns you're supposed to give a check because now white kind of has to address the check and then black can decide what they want to do frequently they can put a pawn in the center or they can take the pawn and that's what they do but she made a blunder early and listen i'm telling you i am nice to children but now when there are four of them and they are loaded with water guns all right and i only have 15 minutes i got to take what advantages i can if i lose a game they would have thrown me the deal was if i lost the game the kids got to use a water gun that was this big and just soak me with the whole thing also they were allowed to throw me out of the second floor window of the charlotte convention center that's what i was told i don't know if that was true or not but that's what they told me we were going to perform a stunt where i have to fall like 300 feet out of a building i don't know so i wanted to take the bishop she took my pawn on e4 castles and then she played d5 now i'm a barbarian you know i understand that in in this position i have to play the move on passant but she's giving me the pawn it is protected twice that's counting right so we take on d5 i'm trying to keep my queen on the board very instructive under normal circumstances i probably would trade a queen like if i'm playing magnus i probably trade the queen cu i know he can't beat me without the queen there but in this case i want the queen right i want to keep the queen on the board cuz i want to i want to deliver a checkmate so i decided to take with my uh bishop instead bishop f 5 i develop my bishop to e3 and i develop my knight and the idea here is i'm going to develop some pieces and then i'm going to trade and then we're going to go on the attack we're going to try to keep about 8 nine minutes on the on the clock to have enough time to generate the attack while the other games are going on while all of this blasting is going on uh but the girls they were ruthless and when i was in the process of trying to generate this attack they were letting have it you miss you miss i'm going to be so excited when your water guns run out of the water i'm just going to like so after knight to d2 we traded knights and i knew right away i need to bring my rooks to the center i need to control the d file and the e file i need to prevent black from getting into the game a really good move here for black probably would have been to just pin my bishop not let me move but my opponent went e4 which is a which is obviously a very natural move especially for a young player this is just attacking the knight it's safe but it allows me to put my knight into the center of the board and now my opponent did something that looks clever but unfortunately backfires you probably have to trade i'm also threatening to take the bishop my opponent goes here and sometimes in chest it's just bad luck my my opponent thought knight takes bishop queen takes bishop cuz my knight is no longer right my my queen is no longer defending my bishop cuz the knight is in the way but unfortunately i can take the bishop and now my queen is defending the bishop so i get the bishop for free and i'm able to protect my bishop yeah and now this next move was just very mean this is the top computer move and i had to do this and i apologize i got to go for this king all right of course i can trade the knight and i can try to trade the queen and play and win an endgame but i had to do this i had to play bishop 2 h6 and the idea is very simple if takes i get my queen in and that's checkmate and i'm able to do this because i'm up material but i'm not just up material i'm up very useful material i'm up material that is swarming the black king and black can't get over there that's the most important detail this is not even hope chess some sometimes you play move you're like oops you put on like a weird scandinavian accent you're like oops but that's not what's happening here cuz i'm going here next like i'm clearing out the way for the queen so this is not just hope chess my opponent actually does a good job plays g6 gives up the rook trying to defend but i'm bringing in the queen and um in this position my opponent should take the bishop and then in this position should go queen e5 and what i would do here is i would play knight e7 check and i'm threatening a mate can't take with the queen so you got to take with the knight at which point i would take the queen and then we would play from there but king h8 i swarmed in and uh in this position unfortunately my opponent stalled a little bit tried to make sure i didn't checkmate try to negotiate a peace offering but there's checkmate on this board and oh my god do as much as p do more do more i don't waste it i don't want to waste you can get checkmated can't check you it's here if you can't see he can't checkmate you i have my helmet right here uh by way of water gun but the checkmate had to be delivered and uh yeah that um that that brought things to an end on that board but the last opponent that i played had like three minutes of highlights this girl was was unstoppable she was so ruthless with the water gun her water gun was replaced i told you she had a water gun secretly replaced like i thought her water gun ran dry and all of a sudden it was like and i was only told after i was i had no idea it happened during you talk about brutal chess.com staff members i mean my goodness my goodness the the the deck was stacked against me plus her openings were very very good so e4 d6 and she played a ps defense this is how i knew she was probably pretty good she's playing a very serious opening she playing a pier probably knows it as the kings indian type of setup and uh you know i knew right away i got to i got to go long and this is if you're playing somebody that plays like this and you got to win like no questions asked like if you don't win the universe blows up castle queen side storm your puns that is like a surefire way to at least get into a fight i don't know about when but get into a fight so castles castles and um you know this girl was ruthless oh my god i'm just going to like my my chest thinker uh face right here i'm done okay yay i had a feeling she was lying the water gun and you're playing good moves so not only was she playing good moves she was also she was also using the water gun really effectively and she was teaming up with the girl next to her i was like oh this is going to be a long day this is going to be a long video the first shot of the whole thing she hit me straight in the ear that's why i put the hood up i didn't have the hood up to start i thought you know what i'll let the kids blast me like it's good i was over here she shot me straight in the ear i don't know how she got me straight in the ear i think i have an ear infection to the day from her hitting me in the ear i might have brain eating amoeba all right knight c6 i have that anyway f4 bishop g4 and i played knight f3 and like you see i'm trying to set up some sort of attack i'm ready to go here she should keep the bishop here it it's not a good decision to trade the bishop i mean of course she's young i'm not you know but i'm just saying this only helps me because this trade strengthens my center and also opens the g file which is going to be very useful for me in the future when i attack at the very least black should wait for me to go here at the very least because then i got to move this pawn again at the very least but she took but she's got a very solid position and if she's not playing a fully grown adult she's she's probably going to have a great time if she's going to play like this she needed to start a pawn attack a little bit faster you kind of see i'm already playing h4 a move that would have been very annoying here is knight to h5 just stopping my attack if i try to continue attacking she just builds up the pawns and if i do something like this my bishop is dead like what's he doing there he's stuck just's going to go here oops so knight to h5 it's a good rule of thumb you see an opponent attacking you like this you may want to blockade with the knight now i would accept this as well but it's not the best move because it weakens your pawns and i can play a move like f5 and i'm very happy so h4 knight h5 but she went here and you know i started i started going for it i started giving up the pawn i'm giving up the pawn in order to open up the h file right right now i'm blocked so i play h5 she took with the pawn that's a mistake and you know she took with the pawn it kind of makes sense but it would have been better to take with a knight again if she had taken with a knight i would have played bishop here to try to take the knight she would have went back i probably would have brought my queen over and you can kind of see why you don't want to allow white to have an open g&h file cuz it just looks really intimidating it's not winning yet but it's really close and that's sort of what i went for here she took like this and yeah now i kind of was like all right bad news doubled h pawn open g file still not hopeless but a really tough position to play no matter what level of water gun that you have king uh she played b6 now i i brought my queen over not even the best move would have been better to take right away but at this point i'm winning and here this young lady i mean you talk about a gamer you talk about a hustler she started sitting there and not moving she started sitting there and letting her time tick which is bad manners if you're playing one to one not when you're playing a four-on-one super soccer challenge so she her time is ticking she's telling all the other people how to how to blast their go i mean this was crazy this girl i'm telling you she was a beast all right finally she decided to make a move she found the only way not to lose knight6 right knight6 and i can't checkmate her so i took the bishop now i have mate and one no matter what anywhere the king moves i showed up to the board i swear to you she moved the bishop to that square she moved the bishop on top of getting a full water gun unloaded on me and a second one in her hands and helping other people use their water gun she tred to put the bishop right there if she put the bishop right there this game would have went on at least five more moves i was like h put that bishop back she was like what are you talking about it was on the g6 square it was a big it was a big thing it was big it was a big debate we had about the positioning of that bishop you best believe it was on the g7 square finally i said hey you're going to get forfeited if you don't play correctly i had to call the arbiter the super soare arbiter came by and said rip the bishop is on g6 no bishop was there and yeah unfortunately the attack broke through and um i was able to deliver a checkmate on the next move after pawn takes and uh queen takes g7 but not before we got a little bit of this let me think what should i do i don't know oh i know i'm going to shoot face some water so all in all a very very fun event i would consider doing more extreme chess challenges if you have any ideas leave them in the comments i've already done hot pepper chess but i would do another edition on this channel i've done super soaker chess i'll do underwater chess should i do skydiving chess i don't know you tell me if you enjoyed it maybe i'll go film some stuff anyway glad to i have survived glad to have not been blasted by the big super soer or thrown out of a second floor of the charlotte convention center might have lied about that for content i don't know but this was a lot of fun shout out to all the kids for being good sports and uh for being hustlers and gamers and uh making this a whole lot of fun and uh well you know the drill get out of here
