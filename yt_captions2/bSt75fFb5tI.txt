ladies and gentlemen it's currently february 2023 and millions of people are playing chess for the first time you may be watching this right now as a beginner as an intermediate as an advanced player i'm not too sure but in this video i'm going to show you how to crush your friends your enemies loved ones co-workers in chess in as little as four moves now some of you experienced players might be thinking oh it's just the scholars mate what a waste of a video no i am going to show you how you can effectively defeat chess players in this video by bringing your queen out early and breaking the traditional rules of chess that you have probably been taught the video is split into two parts in the first part we'll just look at the moves which are also in the description you can put those into a chess.com analysis board if you want and then i play one training game against an intermediate subscriber of mine let's go so you are the gotham subscriber with white you get an honorary grandmaster title and this high rating your opponent is goofy and is a random noob and you will start the game with e4 so all of these moves are in the description the very first thing we're going to look at is e5 queen h5 now this might be completely ridiculous to something you'll be like no this breaks everything i know about chess well in this segment of moves i'll show you that this is not what you think it is now for the untrained folks all right you starting with the king's pawn and you getting e5 if you play e4 on the first move of the of the game you are going to face e5 60 of the time queen h5 sets a trap your target this pawn with check and many beginners here will play the move g6 that's number one get ready to beat a whole bunch of people if you're watching this as a beginner you are going to gain a hundred points maybe two 300 points just from capturing this and if they go here you block let's say like this and get the queen out g6 is a huge mistake now the more common move is to defend this with the knight okay and we will be looking at that in a moment it doesn't really matter if black plays d6 you can continue the same way that we will against knight c6 some people go here against this obviously you take with check you trade queens if it's possible if the bishop locks you defend your pawn like this and you get out and you're just a pawn up the computer likes to think that black can catch up in development with moves like d5 and being really aggressive but with white if you just consolidate and play smart you will be fine the position is equal and more often than not your opponents will just try to castle and chase your queen around and if you play in a smart way like bring your queen back and consolidate you'll be in great shape computer thinks it's equal your beginner opponents are not computers so knight c6 is by far the most common move and now you play bishop c4 and you are threatening to win the game right here i again beginners many of your opponents will do this game over in four moves you can feel like a genius but this is not the end of the video you see i'm actually going to tell you that many people will stop your four move checkmate i got news for you it's not that bad it's actually not that bad it's actually a lot more poisonous than you might think let's take a look you can now not take this pawn because of this so you come back and threaten it again beginners a lot of your opponents will go here thinking they forked you good game queen f7 is made so a lot of people when you come back will block if they block with the queen you're not worried about a queen trade but it's not checkers you do not have to take you can go there and force them to try to take you if they do this you have three pieces out and here's a way you can win the game in seven moves knight b5 attacks the pawn on c7 threatening a fork and what you do here is very simply damage their pawn structure like so while chess.com lags a little bit because of servers d3 damage structure two bishops which is considered an advantage in plus 1.4 all right so queen f6 is not good knight f6 much more common all right oh did i tell you by the way that i will also give you early queen attacks not just an e5 yeah well i'm going to give you early queen attacks against almost all of black's major defenses aren't you happy you clicked on this video i'm happy you clicked on this video everyone's happy win-win-win terrific knight c6 bishop c4 let's come back and now folks very important you must stop this by playing 92. okay and the rest is actually very simple you play d3 knight c3 and you castle you just castle the position is equal i mean it's a balanced position it the computer thinks it's a 0.1 or whatever but as a human this is a tough position to play with black and you're gonna see in the training game exactly what i mean by that white has a lot of different attacking possibilities you can play h3 and you can play knight g3 and bishop g5 when you pin the knight to the queen you have ideas of knight d5 applying even more pressure i wouldn't rush with this move because of the move h6 and uh i don't actually think that trading this bishop for the knight is the goal the goal is to play like this so having that that and that pressure on that night very very common here uh for white to win like this um i wouldn't rush with the move bishop g5 but the position is still very very decent now if you want to play really aggressively i don't condone this way because the engine doesn't love it but if you want to go bishop e3 and then play like h3 and maybe g4 and maybe long castle you have my blessing if you want to play like that where you do this and then just launch these pawns forward that's another really interesting way of playing this position it i mean it's it's there are fascinating possibilities to build behind your active queen and you will be shocked at the amount of times you get to this literal position right here and newbies if you want to be a little bit more risky you have to stop knight e2 but then you can also play like g4 g5 like straight away but that's not what the engine doesn't give that the blessing but that's the general idea and the position is equal i mean the engine is the engine your opponents are your opponents you're gonna see how a 1300 a little bit later totally fall apart just one or two moves on their own in this position so this is a very trappy and actually mildly underrated way to play chess for fun now you should not play queen h5 if you want to go you know be a grand master necessarily but if you're just an adult a teenager you just want to have a little fun she's a few people win a few games quickly like when you're on the toilet at work you know five ten minutes and then you gotta go back and do your stand up because you code or some something play a couple queen h5 slap a few fools around you're gonna have a great time and the amazing thing is there are ways to bring out the queen even in the sicilian defense now i don't necessarily condone this but you know you can play like knight c3 and then you can play d4 take with the queen drop the queen back and actually the even this is a variation this is called the magnus carlson sicilian you can fiancado you can castle and uh you're actually in a relatively decent position the sicilian you could play queen h5 that has been played before but the difference is that your opponent hasn't pushed the pawn to e5 that is the major difference so if you try to do this what might happen is they will go here defending their pawn and your queen's a bit dumb but you're more than welcome to try i'm telling you against the sicilian it's not that possible but uh against the carl khan defense this is called the goldman variation knight c3 and queen f3 hello i mean it's it's a potent weapon look at this trick if they attack your knight you have bishop c4 hitting f7 if they take your knight you have queen f7 obliterating their position you can even do this bishop out castle you're just winning on in five moves so i mean there are ways and here's another really nasty trap against the karo khan it's uh knight c3 d5 queen e2 with the intention of lining up a threat here and if take take black tries to go here to enable this move this is a very famous trap and this is checkmate in five moves five moves they cannot take you because of this ridiculous and if they you know if they play knight f6 and they don't blunder checkmate then you take you damage their pawns and then you just develop knight f3 take the center develop the bishop castle you play a little bit more normally there are ways to bring out your queen early against other openings as well they are not as emphatic as e5 but if you're an e4 player you will face this 3 out of every five games maybe more three and a half out of every five games something like 7 out of 10 games i got news for you this is not as bad as it looks and i'm like you know you gotta know how to equalize with black but this is not a losing move it's actually shockingly potent like it it and i if you want to go and give it a shot and see what happens and try to you know memorize this line with queen f3 knight e2 and the knights like you you'll be shocked you will actually be quite surprised at how decent this is um especially if you play it right and if they ever jump their knight into the center you can just take come back or this way trying to get this pawn you can also play knight d5 black doesn't get a whole lot here another very common blunder that happens is uh knight d5 and then bishop g4 where they attack your queen defended by the knight but you take the knight with check and then you win the bishop this is also a very very common thing that occurs um you'll be surprised anyway look folks uh i've made a lot of instructional content on my youtube channel and sometimes i just gotta give you the goodies like this thing is not as bad as it seems go give it a shot if it doesn't work all right no problem but i am telling you under the 800 level this move is going to psychologically rattle some of your opponents and when you're below five six hundred get ready to start catching fools with with this nonsense because oh my goodness and so you can use queen h5 up to a point then you can retire it it can be a thing in your past but this thing works and it's deceptively strong now let's go look at the game that i played against the 1300 and we are going to try to test out our very very bad habit opening queen h5 knight c6 on the board played very quickly by the way all right so we are going in fact four scholars mate opponent is very confidently refuting it my opponent doesn't know that it's coming but i assume that you know by this level of chess you have seen this enough uh that you do in fact know what you're doing so now i'm going to drop back to f3 and this is everything we've studied so now it's important to cover this move which we will do with the very natural knight e2 and we will just play from here so as we already have described these two moves next make a lot of sense it really doesn't make a huge amount of difference how you play them uh and my my opponent did not know that any of this was going to happen i just told them you know i asked who plays e4 e5 and this is how we got here so in the study i looked at d6 a6 is also a reasonable move but it's not really meeting the demands of the position you can go bishop g5 as i described earlier uh you can also just castle and just sort of relax for now i think to build mildly good habits outside of playing this you know very silly opening we obviously should uh should castle our king bishop g5 will always be met with h6 if the opponent is clever so let's just play we can play bishop e3 to stop knight d4 uh and uh bishop g4 we just slide over we're not really worried about that this is always a good move and if you don't want your bishop to get trapped you can just play a3 and bishop back to a2 and your position is actually very decent like just because you play a form of scholar mate doesn't necessarily mean that um you know you're gonna lose by the way queen e7 uh now bishop g5 is a very powerful idea the point of bishop g5 now is that knight d5 actually attacks the queen the difference when the queen was on that square is that when h6 happened i actually have to move my bishop but right now i can go danger levels you don't have to move the bishop you don't have to acknowledge a threat if you can create equal or exceeding danger and now here comes knight d5 and we're already winning you see that's actually one of the incredible ideas here that i don't have to move this is what i wanted to accomplish anyway and now black is lost i'm now going to be winning a queen for two pieces which is still not an advantage that is like absolutely game over uh but uh it's uh you know it's you it's a very big advantage um but of course we should teach you how to convert this position as well when you have a queen you obviously don't want it to be trapped uh and uh you got to think about what your opponent wants to do i would imagine that my opponent wants to play something like f5 in the future and get the king out of the way uh i want to make a few pawn trades and i don't want to allow his knight to jump in so i'm going to start with c3 the idea is to prevent his knight from coming in and then i will slide my knight over here okay that's just a very natural move i will play bishop b3 it's actually not the easiest position to win i mean a queen is good but it's only going to be good if i can actually trade off enough of my opponent's pieces that my queen is left alone a queen is most powerful when it's teamed up against weaknesses or when it's just dealing immense damage against the position that doesn't have a lot of resistance right now black actually has a pretty good amount of resistance here i would love to play this move successfully at some point okay king h8 is very smart trying to prepare this i've already described that this move is likely on the way but let's continue with our plan now our queen always has a getaway square it's a powerful piece but we do need to protect it like a gem you know like a precious gem if f5 happens don't be worried queen can always escape and i would love to trade off a night and then maybe trade off a bishop and slowly black black's pieces will lose resistance in a perfect world i trade the rooks with no rooks on the board no amount of material is going to be able to save black because a queen the value and power of the queen will increase as uh you know as as everything goes on as the game goes on this is a bad move it is a free pawn but you do not want to make captures that end up pinning you so viciously to your own pieces so bishop f7 there is this or this and that would just simply not be good for me um i can go for a pawn trade i can also bring my queen just out of you know out of danger and and see what's next because we both have eight pawns in this position it's a closed position and in a closed position you want to try to find those opportunities to trade there is one pawn trade so every time a pawn trade occurs something changes in the position that bishop opens my rook opens the e-file opens a little bit now of course in a in a dream situation i can completely shut my opponent down in their side of the board and just try to kind of you know steamroll them but i i think it is a good idea to kind of back out with the queen at first but this is everything that we and i didn't tell my opponent to play this all i told my opponent was that play if i didn't even say e5 i actually asked for a volunteer who plays e5 and then i said you know you can play knight c6 on the second move and that's it everything else my opponent completely did on their own just to show you how natural this type of play is even at the 1300 level so you can win these games like bringing your queen out it it it's not necessarily great but it's also not as bad as you might think now we need to think of ways we can be attacked which is of course how you have to think about things in chess now this is a very different story okay so i can trade bishops and now i can trade rooks that is an excellent simplification for me now i think what i will do now there's a lot of good ideas that's a good idea to target both pawns this is a good idea but i want to stick to simplification all right and by the way if any of you are still watching this far in the video uh one of my courses middle games master class is uh one of the chapters is on converting winning positions and this is one of the ways simplifying bishops off rooks off trade upon trade another pawn if you leave a queen against the knight in a bishop the queen will obliterate the knight in the bishop but on a full board like that you have to be a little bit careful so rook f1 is coming i'm going to take a little bit more central space and then we will start kind of poking with the pawns all right so i'm going to take the center space just a good move you know a little bit more activity in the center of the board maybe d5 in the future now my queen sees that right so here comes a4 look at that utilizing my previous pawn move knight is going to struggle to move here i can't really do a whole lot i could have played e5 by the way just a little moment here i could have played e5 which would have attacked the knight forced it to move and we're just going again pure simplification that's what we're doing removing the rooks this is a very instructive moment here beyond the opening you know the right way to simplify one of these positions i don't want my opponents to resign either i would you know if they run out of time they run out of time but i do just want to show like that is the way you would convert this position that night is in the corner i can go after it for simplicity i'm just going to take the pawn and i gotta be careful like i i don't want to move my queen and lose my pawn but i'm gonna go here i thought that was hanging actually that was a blunder by me uh well not a blunder but you know i want to go there and i want to just start hunting and just showing you the power of the queen when it's left alone against other pieces nothing can move you know so i can go to c6 which targets that and that and that and that of course e5 can be taken and i will take on a6 yep i have to avoid forks and i have to be careful about checks that's that's the only thing um i can continue to hunt i can bring my queen here just make sure that that's actually you know okay that's i can even play what's called an in-between move checking the king and then going here and now it's queen versus two knights and they are just simply not strong enough as i will push and the queen can also go backwards but let's say you forget about that right let's say you don't take just make sure that the knight cannot check you once again the knight cannot check you and uh just don't hang your queen and even if you do you'll make a new one but uh yeah this is just very clean b7 is on the way and uh this is the way you would convert this position nice and simple three seconds left and black resigns that was a nice game now again just a very quick analysis this is literally everything in the video with the one exception being okay black played a6 but we had a very reasonable position early you know i could have played h3 here maybe i could have played a3 to prevent you know the bishop from getting stuck i decided to go bishop e3 awaiting move but you can play either of these and the reason why this move didn't quite work is because of h6 and i don't like taking i i don't think this gives you any advantage um but you can go bishop g6 and then come back and just try to target that but personally i thought you know going bishop like this was nice and the only way my opponent could have prevented that was to probably play bishop e6 and they didn't so we just immediately got a winning position so that goes to show you that the four move checkmate as dumb as it is actually packs a punch beyond the four moves as long as you know what you're doing and you can play aggressively and still try to beat people but you can also be in it for the long haul so give it a shot don't count this as a completely stupid option it works best against e4 e5 but as i've shown you there are other ways to bring your queen out early when you play the king's pawn that are not that dumb and that are still very very possible to put opponents under pressure so you know the chest pureist the experts might look at this and say oh this is just bad what a terrible habit you're built well actually it's not as simple as it looks and the better you get a chess the more rules you can break uh the more principles you can go against as long as you fall follow it up with good fundamental play afterward you can beat a lot of people by bringing out your queen as early as four moves but in this game you know 10 or 15 and the game is over so enjoy hope you liked the video and the moves are in the description once again for you to copy paste like on chess.com in an analysis board for example and that's it i'll see you in the next video get out of here
