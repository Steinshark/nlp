ladies and gentlemen we're all different people we all come from different parts of the globe we all grow up and ultimately live in different circumstances but the human condition is to go head-to-head in competition we're competitive by nature and there are few activities where one can prove true intellectual not physical but intellectual dominance over another some examples include how fast you can get wle how fast you can solve sudoku your score on a geography test but they all pale in comparison to a head-to-head game of chess and sometimes you play a game of chess so dominant it is coined your immortal game best game that you've ever played and in today's video i will be sharing a game with you that was breathtaking an abs absolutely dazzling display of a bunch of brilliant moves according to chess.com and an average accuracy rather an accuracy score of 100% here we go this was a widely requested game on this channel for quite some time and we're actually going to be looking at this game with the black pieces our protagonists are leavon aronian who at the time of this game was rated over 2,800 it's one of the biggest secrets of i mean secrets for newer chess fans who know no magnus hikaru myself and like that's it um leavon aronian has been 2800 a bunch in his career at the time he represented armenia now he represents the united states this was a game played in tata steel in 2013 uh in the prestigious tournament and uh player with the black pieces is vishan unand five-time world champion legend of chess from india tiger of madras and this game was sensational it opened with d4 and nowadays in 2024 the meta at top level to put the knight on f6 it's actually not to allow a queen's gambit for whatever reason and the reason is that nowadays systems with e6 are very popular knight f6 and e6 just seems to be the norm uh and the the lines are trending toward cataland or for black to put the bishop on b4 targeting this knight which would be a nso indian defense but back in the day d4 d5 was all the rage and one of the reasons it was all the rage is because of this move c6 this is known as the slav defense yes vishan doing his best slav impersonation after he played this game he proceeded to get himself a lot of car throw on some adidas and in fact squat down to the floor i have no visual evidence that i was in fact squatting but i was i promise uh knight of3 knight f6 uh knight f3 knight f6 knight c3 this is the main line of the slav and generally here black has the option to play the close slav or the triangle or the semis slav i don't know what a semis slav is it's like a slav with the adidas but not the l or the zaparas or whatever it's called um or the open slav all right the open slav taking on c4 uh white tries to win this pawn back black tries to develop their pieces but vishy plays e6 this is known as the semi slav uh semi slav is incredibly complicated it's a wicked opening basically black doesn't develop the light squired bishop but black wants to take on c4 play this move b5 getting energetic space on that side of the board and uh open up the position with queens side play sometimes strike back in the center this is one of the most studied openings in chess by the way highly recommend this opening to people above 2,000 it is a very powerful weapon white now plays e3 this is uh the main line and it's um it could it could turn into a miron not a a meon it could turn into a lot of different things knight bd7 black is ready to either attack in the center or attack on the queen side you'll notice that black has not committed this bishop that's just the meta strategy and now and only now does black take why does black take well you waited you waited for white to make the natural developing move with the bishop now you make the bishop move again right you lose control of the center but you make the bishop move a second time and not only do you make it move a second time you make it move a third time and basically that is the silent debate among the parties here uh in this conversation you're taking on c4 you're making the bishop move you're making the bishop move again and uh now it goes back to d3 and so here we have our first branch okay top level chess is characterized by these sort of branches these variations this position has been reached tens of thousands of times the most popular moves in this position are a6 bishop b7 and what vishy chose in the game which is putting the bishop on d6 and they all have different ideas right vishy comes to this game with a very specific idea in mind white by the way black is not extending here a lot of you might be wondering like why don't we just attack the knight shortsighted move uh you you actually would like your pawns to sort of create spikes restricting the pieces rather than advancing because after this you kind of haven't made any progress and this pawn could just be a liability in the long run plus you reactivated this bishop but i understand if you're thinking of that move now a6 is designed to enable c5 in the future but if you wait a little bit too long white will take the center completely and then white will marge down the center and there's a lot of complicated lines like pawn takes pawn knight sacrifice take back pawn takes uh etc etc like there's also bishop b7 e4 and etc etc etc this she plays bishop d6 bishop d6 stops e4 because the answer to e4 is e5 so you will do this you will trade black will be completely fine bishop d6 right uh levon castles because 2802 or 802 or 208 or 082 that's not possible but you still got to castle your king and now vishy castles as well both sides have castled white's game plan is to advance in the center with e45 if we were playing torpedo chess white would be able to do just that uh what black wants to do is black wants to play this move c5 black is not really looking for b4 black is looking for a6 c5 as is very common in these positions so again rookie one e4 levon plays queen c2 this is a very popular move this position has happened hundreds and hundreds of times uh so far so good so far nothing immortal you understand we're just in the opening the brilliant moves are about to arrive un plays bishop b7 because that's the point he's trying to again prepare this c5 move and now white can play e4 i mean white can play e4 now he could have played e4 in the last move as well but instead of that he plays a3 a3 has two ideas idea one stop b4 idea two play b4 yourself it's actually a very interesting idea so for example the idea to play b4 yourself is actually very valuable because it stops c5 if black cannot play c5 black's in trouble like if black spends the game not being able to play c5 at a certain point white is going to make a lot of preparatory moves and finally play e4 or if not e4 white's just going to make it impossible to move right so that is the point right a3 trying to play b4 now here black has played a5 black has played a6 and then a5 black has played a lot of things but vishy again plays the third most popular move he played the third most popular move here he played the third most popular move here rook c8 this is a fascinating move vy's team of of of trainers and coaches and water boys like people who just bring him a glass of water uh they discovered that the rook on c8 enables c5 without defending the pawn on b5 so against queen c2 which puts the queen on the c file the team of anand came up with an idea where the pawn does not have to be defended black does not have to waste a move i mean that's you know making life more efficient is is is good so you don't have to waste the move so basically against anything that white does like rook d1 black is going to go c5 and you don't worry about this pawn being taken the analysis apparently proves that in many lines black is okay now you may be asking how is that possible because how is black okay in this position well black goes queen c7 and just begins opening up an attack on this side of the board okay now leavon is a very aggressive player which is why he plays knight to g5 he goes after the pawn on h7 now black has a greek gift in this position black can actually sacrifice a bishop with check it's called a greek gift sacrifice do this you play knight g4 check the king goes here queen g5 and this is possible but you're not mating anybody trust me it's not going to happen look e4 queen h5 looks like mate it's not now you don't have to play e4 you can also play f3 you can't take because then you'd be walking right into a pin so after you go back you know but but he played this move fully anticipating that and maybe h6 as well and his idea was to rotate back to the middle that was the point of knight to g5 it must have been a really really really cold shower for leavon aronian when in this position vishi anand uncorked not any of those moves he did not play defense and in this position vishy played c5 anyway that's bad news if your opponent ignores the threat completely also ignores the counter strike not to be confused with the video game and goes here anyway with this and this just completely hanging not you could take that and attack the bishop by the way that's bad news now in this position white can take with the bishop and if you take you get mated it's not checkers though you could go here and then the game would go on why can play f4 blocking this defending the knight that is one of the better lines that you can play but he doesn't do that what instead what he does is he takes with the knight so leavon takes the pawn on h7 with the knight now he's attacking this rook and again levon probably calculated a handful of lines first of all greek gift sacrifice king h2 knight g4 if this now queen h4 and black is winning which is why king g3 is the winning move for white okay so that doesn't quite work what about c4 what about pawn takes d4 now what about if you trade well if you trade then white is going to go back and trade the bishop and you're not going to have any attack you have queen h4 i just go g3 it doesn't work the knight takes h7 unfortunately here vishi anand shows his idea and plays brilliant move number one knight g4 this is brut brutal he leaves his rook to die says you know what levon take my rook the idea of knight g4 is twofold number one we're attacking the pawn but number two we are opening the door for the queen and if the rook is captured black wins not by playing queen h4 but by forcing the king to the corner first it's very important now it's game over unstoppable checkmating attack one of the only ways that can survive here is to play like knight g6 sacrificing the knight rook d1 trying to clear some space but uh it's over it doesn't work knight g4 and now the best move for white is h3 allowing in some sort of queen h4 and then you have to cover up and play defense and then i would rip open your you know your throat over here and then you know you take the rook and then i go knight df6 and i just keep attacking you this knight is is stuck it has no way out if knight h7 i can always take it i can always take this knight as well very very scary stuff levon plays f4 which is given a question mark exclam which means dubious f4 is deemed a dubious move blocking out this bishop but why is it dubious why doesn't vishy just show us all right i'm going take a sip of my water and then i will show you why it's dubious it's dubious for a really disgusting reason in this position white no longer has to fear this because of h3 so knight g4 is just a horse standing on the outskirts of town pressuring the white position but here comes the real idea pawn takes d4 pawn takes d4 and if i ask you what is the most natural move in this position for black some of you by the way might still be looking at this and go rookie 8 it's too slow rookie 8 is nowhere near forcing enough a forcing move creat creates danger and right now we're looking at relative value of pieces that is not a five-point rook that is a three-point rook we need to get some more pieces into the game you ask me what the most natural move is i'm going to say queen b6 because it attacks the pawn and it threatens check to me very natural move white has no bishop e3 because we take of course you got to go queen b6 queen b6 is not right it's not good enough king h1 white is safe there is no knight f2 check if it's not queen b6 what on earth is vishy going to do in this position may i introduce you to brilliant move number two bishop [music] c5 i can't even begin to explain that move that is another way to attack the pawn on d4 but not with the queen the queen is still reserved for queen h4 you attack this pawn with the bishop but this is like a beginner chess left lesson you don't attack a piece with a piece if it can be captured well if he took the bishop bishop would have gone here setting up queen d4 but also setting up knight d3 and if the bishop moved out of the way queen d4 check king to h1 knight f2 take take and you can't stop mate if you move the bishop you lose the queen so white can't stop the attack white can't stop anything knight takes i would have won queen d4 king h1 knight d3 and you are getting completely swarmed by the horses they you can you can barely survive here absolutely barely if you play all the best moves you can maybe escape but that is the point of bishop c5 bishop c5 opens up two pieces into the game the knight and the queen this bishop sacrifice but it's not even a sacrifice you also threaten the pawn it is completely ridiculous you have to take the bishop too levon doesn't he plays a slower move okay he plays bishop e2 trying to get rid of that knight and allowing bishop takes d4 check and now the king goes out of the way and here black can play knight h2 threatening queen h4 but it's not working it's not working cuz this knight gets out threatening a made of their own don't fall asleep at the wheel so bishop to e2 and yeah this next one is um again black sacrifices a bishop to open up his knight and his queen white says no thank you leaving the bishop to take the pawn with check i mean there is literally no no move more natural than bishop takes d4 check not a single move on the board may i introduce you to brilliant move number three knight to e5 losing a knight in the process the knight is hanging and the bishop is hanging two pieces completely can be captured knight to e5 activates to two pieces as well it activates the queen and it activates the knight so if bishop takes you'll play knight takes g the knight is getting into the game now there is such a sneaky idea behind this move of knight e5 do you know what the idea is the idea is as follows queen takes d4 check creating a battery with the queen and the bishop and now not knight f2 but queen g1 sacrificing the queen it has to be protected by the bishop so the king can't take it and white smothers their own king knight e5 activates the knight and it activates the queen and it absolutely activates the queen because queen d4 queen g1 is a threat now this is absolutely absurd knight to g4 then bishop c5 and then knight e5 just turbocharging every piece 1 2 3 4 5 pieces playing in the game 21 points of material attacking the white position now it's still not totally lost because white can start getting rid of the pieces levon is worse but he's not totally lost if vishy takes here he's going to lose his bishop so instead of that what he does is he plays as vin zogan in between move he does in fact give this check white puts the king on h1 and now knight takes g4 so vishy just hit his opponent with a crazy combination all right he hit him with so many punches he ducked underneath he hit him again and yet despite all of that it's equal if you actually count the material it's equal somehow it's one two uh three three pieces queen rooks and five pounds each now black gets two moves in a row black is going to win knight g5 is a very good move in this position another good move is to take the rook it's given a question mark exclam because the computer actually doesn't realize how bad the situation is black will take and then you know black will go here but white will go here simultaneously attacking and defending no vand loses a full rook full rook a rook gets taken out of his position and queen h7 is a threat and he responds to this move with yet another vicious hook he plays f5 the idea of f5 is to prevent queen h7 and reenable queen h4 and this is so brutal white now can move his knight out of the position white's knight took a full rook and vishy allows it to leave and allows it to stop queen h4 but the position is so winning he has time to walk up to the night threaten it take it recreate the threat m and despite white having all these pieces there is nothing white can do i don't understand how this is possible vishy cultivated this attack with his entire opening idea vish's entire opening idea rook c8 setting up c5 made this possible this energetic approach to the position with bishop c5 knight e5 and when it's all said and done what ultimately happens is he's got these monsters staring down at the white position he goes queen f6 and the only way to defend the position now is to play queen to d3 that's the only way and probably levon did not see a way to continue the game after queen d3 you would play here and you can't play queen d4 because this threatens mate again but the way you survive here is you play queen g3 and you just hope and pre knight f2 check take take oh oh oh oh oh sorry sorry take that first of the queen get escape sorry autop piloted and now black is winning in the end game this is just the winning end game black has absolute dominance here not the way i played it but this way but instead of that he plays h3 un un takes and if you thought we were out of brilliant moves we're not the threat of queen h5 is queen takes h3 checkmate because of the pin the only way to defend that is to play rook f3 chucking the rook yeah well plays here and now the kiss of death from vishy anant punctuating the best game that he's probably ever played bishop e3 this one is a light brilliant it's like a brilliant appetizer this is called interposing you stop the queen from seeing the pawn and the threat is queen h3 and the threat is queen h3 and queen g2 or queen h2 you can go here or here you could also prolong the game and but bishop to e3 that and there's nothing there's white can't do anything rook f3 you just take there's just four brilliant moves and a perfect game of chess and this was just purely out of a semis slof an opening that vi has played a 100 times at the highest level if not more he came up with this unique idea with his team and levon decided i want to get an a fight bish she said this might be one of the last fights you're ever going to get in and levon could have been a little bit more accurate on the way right he could have he could have played bishop takes h7 and f4 there is certain moments but sometimes it just so happens your opponent walks into the battle ground where you are more comfortable you are aware of all of the ideas bishop c5 is disgusting what a way to activate your pieces 95 sacrificing every piece activating all five pieces of exotic out here queen the the the the bishops and the knights oh my goodness and then taking taking letting the rook get captured and just f5 with the intention to walk up to the knight and just there you go and that is how you're going to win the game i mean it's just absolutely ruthless it is disgusting despicable and it is the best game that vand uh has ever played and what's funny is that he's he would say it's not what's funny is that vishy would say there was too much reliance on openings like there was too much reliance on memorization too much reliance on understanding the ideas you know chess games are are one and lost sometimes because one player is just more familiar with the opening tricks and traps and it's true but we can still stare in awe because we can't replicate these types of things so uh no vishu still gets full credit in my opinion and a lot of people have requested this game over the years on my channel and now you have it so there you go that is probably the best game that vishan anand has ever played although it is a long list of awesome games that's all i have for you today get out of here
