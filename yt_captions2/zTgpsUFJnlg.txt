[music] hello a friend and i recently took part in the movie game jam creating a game where you quote-unquote ack your way into the government by completing various minigames this was inspired by an amusing hacking scene from the film swordfish and the rather dramatic approach generally taken to hack a million movies so i began by modeling the euro the wild set-up of stanley the hacker the most important part of this was unwrapping the screens so that i could lay out how i wanted elements to move between them in unity i then had two cameras one for capturing the actual game and the second for drawing objects to a render texture which was then used for the computer monitors for the different minigames i first created a simple falling words typing challenge and then in the film they speak of a worm called the hydra for sniffing out digital footprints which i thought could work nicely as a game of snake finally something to represent evading the antivirus system a missile dodging game there were two main problems i encountered with the missile behavior the first was that over time they all tended to clump together this was fixed by making the missiles repel one another within a certain radius this immediately made things a lot more interesting since now the play often has to weave back through the group of missiles that's pursuing them the second issue was that if a missile missed the player it would often end up in some sort of stable orbit which looks terribly dumb i took a rather crude approach to fixing this which was to check if a missile had remained roughly perpendicular to the player for some length of time and if so force that missile to temporarily target a new location on the screen before locking back onto the player i then made this silly decryption task where you literally just have to mash the keyboard and finally the actual login screen the idea was that through the different minigames you've been able to hack open the password hints file and now you have three attempts g at the password correct using those hints i did also experiment a bit with a little brick breaker challenge as a sort of analogy for breaking through a firewall but it never really felt fun to play for some reason so i ended up leaving it out with the minigames roughly in place i could finally spend a bit of time and making things prettier i began by adding a few essential items bottle of wine a wine glass and a sandwich and of course a healthy serving of post-processing effects over here by the way you can see the door through which the police were going to charge in to arrest you should you fail but that sadly never happened i also worked on transitions between the games for instance when you complete the snake game the body disappears leaving just the head of the snake which can now move freely around to dodged the incoming antivirus missiles i did manage to sneak the idea of a firewall into this level at least preventing the player from escaping off the screen around this point my friend liam came over to help he created the music and also worked on balancing the difficulty of the different games one of our main concerns was the falling words game because it has to be completed in order to access the rest of the game but of course everyone types at different speeds we ended up with this curve from which the speed of the words is sampled based on how fast previous words have been typed this took a fair amount of manual tweaking and is probably still not quite right for many typing speeds so there must be a better way of doing it anyway next i experimented with doing some voiceover stuff come on faster faster but i really didn't like the way that that sounded instead i tried adding some speech bubbles because i thought those worked well in one of my previous entries but they just ended up looking weird and distracting here so that was dropped as well i then spent some time making various success and fail animations for the game win animation i initially had stanley doing a silly little dance but it felt like a bit of a poor payoff for completing the game so i spent some time making something a little more elaborate where stanley puts his feet up on the table leans back in the chair grabs his glass of wine and toasts the monitors which at this point are showing the government money being transferred and that is the end of the game looking back at it now i have two main regrets firstly not being more creative with the minigames i like that their simplicity and familiarity means that the rules never have to be explained but some sort of twist on each of them would have been cool for example the hydra mentioned in the movie is supposed to be multi headed so it perhaps there's some interesting where that concept could have been incorporated into the snake game secondly i wish i'd been able to make the voice-over fit since stan's random mutterings are such a funny part of the original scene anyway here we'd love to hear your thoughts on the game thanks for watching cheers
