all right we are back with one of my favorite series to do on youtube which is what is the highest paying jobs exploring what is the highest paying jobs in tech with coding without coding really breaking it down now you might be like tiff this seems like a bad time to talk about the highest paying jobs in tech have you seen what's going on in tech yes thank you i have i i don't live under a rock no but in all seriousness i want to be very mindful of the current environment when it comes to the tech industry and really keeping in mind that the purpose of this video in particular is because we love exploring what jobs are out there what to work towards so yes they are some of the highest paying but more importantly they have really incredible skills that are very in demand that we can be working towards today so really keep that in mind as we are going through this isn't to say that you need one of these jobs to be the highest paying or that any other jobs aren't good enough that's far from the case and i hope our community already knows that but you know i needed to do that check off that fine print that the internet needs nowadays all right right i think i got that cover now with that let's get into it okay steve right steve like yeah let's get into okay that was a bad joke let's get into it all right before we dive into the highest paying jobs in tech in 2024 i want to share with you about something i've recently been loving up on screen here you can see link to so this is really cool link to is a great way that you can start investing in leading startups with affordable minimums for broadening investing opportunities for anyone now i think this is so cool oftentimes when we think about investing we think we need to have large amounts of money to be able to do so so if you are someone who's more interested in the investment world or wants to at least dip your toes in it this is for you okay so here's how it works so they at link to assess the risk and make the investment then they deliver the opportunity to you so they are kind of doing all the heavy lifting behind the scenes link 2 takes out the complicated aspects for you by conducting thorough in-house research and they essentially will take a step back and evaluate each company they are the ones who will invest first into this company to see how it goes from there the process is really streamlined making it literally as easy as you can go in point and click to participate within the investment opportunity presented on their platform now what i love about link to is they give you the opportunity to invest with a lot of early startups and i think this is really cool not only early startups but i like that part too because often times i'll and i know this is all for you techies as well you see different startups that are really booming quickly and you're like if only there was a way i could be part of investing with that link to has you covered i link them down below so make sure to go sign up today all right i want to start off with a job that honestly i wasn't too familiar with hence why we do this series which is data security analyst now i've heard of different roles similar to it but i never really educated myself as to what does this role entail and why is it so highly paid so let's start off with before we get to the salary number let's start off with what does it entail so at its core data security analysts ensure that different computer systems and networks are protected from hackers and viruses sounds pretty important part of this job ensures that when you are working for a certain company you are ensuring that they are up to date with all their systems their software their antivirus and ensuring their antivirus software is all running effectively you can think of them as the person who goes around and evaluates the current security systems that are in place are they strong enough where are their vulnerabilities for these hackers and viruses to find their way in now let's get to the fun part you know the fun part which is money is money the fun part i don't know sometimes the stressful part but let's talk about what do these data security analyst make all right i tried to get all my resources from the same place there are some that i wasn't able to find in glass door but for the most part i'm going to be referencing glass door just so we can stay consistent now this one i did not find in glass door so i went to a website called crn and they really dive into what exactly uh different salaries are and for data security analyst the median is200 ,000 so this is this is a high-paying job how do i get one of those the good thing is there are so many different courses you can take online there's one actually on cybrary i love that name cybrary which is the best way to learn cyber security skills online so this you can actually start with today for free i'll link it down below this is a really great course i also found that ibm is doing one i'm just trying to see right now if it's free i think actually it is which i'll link down below too so those are two great courses if you you are looking to upskill or get into the cyber security world which definitely is not going anywhere are great to take all right next on the list is a role or a job that i honestly when i for such a long time and if you've been watching my videos for a long time you probably already know this about me i wanted to become this role for a long time and i ended up going in a different direction which i'm very thankful for not cuz i didn't want to do that role but just because you know you got to be open to opportunities which is devops engineer i think devops is so cool and so underrated as far as a really cool role to be doing now why do i say cool mainly because if you are someone who wears likes to wear multiple hats it's a great role for you because you're kind of in this area where you're bridging different teams so you're bridging between software development teams operations teams but then you're also working on automating different workflows and uring efficient software delivery so i mean working between different teams automating parts of the workflow ensuring efficient delivery like those are things i love to do and i know we do a lot of like automate this automate my life with me different kind of videos like that on uh this channel which yes is totally different but the automation part is really fun so what exactly does it take to become a devops engineer well i have up here red hat's website and here's how they explain what does a devops engineer do so devops is all about the unification and automation of processes okay we already talked about that a little bit so within an agile environment developers system admins and programmers can be siloed so working on the same product but not necessarily sharing the same information across different channels so then that is where devops engineers come in they are that middle person if you will who's able to really work between different teams uh communicate well but also is very technical it's such a cool role all right but let's get to the fun part what do devops engineers make all right according to talent.com i'm having trouble with glass door i thought i had all the links for it and now it's being weird to me glassar is a finicky one because they always want more information from you before you can get information from them which might be really smart but according to talent.com that i have pulled up here a devops engineer in the united states keep in mind the median annual salary is 130,000 so entry level positions start around 110 where more experienced workers can make up to 170 us so this is a really great paying job and that salary can continue to increase and then also too we are talking about adding in bonuses uh different kind of initiatives or incentives i should say that you can gain on a yearly basis all right what's the next one this is one that when i make these videos and i often don't include it i get in trouble for people are always like tiff this is still very in demand why are we not including this so i got you we are covering it this time which is blockchain engineer and i know for some of us we might be like blockchain really i feel like that was a few years ago but the reality is blockchain is a technology that is here to stay and it's used in so many different industries it's not going anywhere it just gets such a bad wp because of the whole crypto world and the es and flows with that but the technology the underlying technology with blockchain is so useful and so many different areas i mean when you think of for example healthcare and using blockchain to ensure that each record for patients is unique and tied to them and it can't be tampered with that's huge that impact can be game-changing for the healthcare industry and there's so many other examples with this so blockchain engineers even when i go on linkedin or any job posting site those are probably the most common jobs i still see people are hiring for people who are experts within blockchain on talent.com they say the median annual salary for united states for blockchain developer is 146,000 us with the lower side if you were more just starting out being around 125,000 and working its way up to'5,000 these roles honestly are really in demand and i feel like because of the hype cycle if you will with blockchain or crypto i should say they aren't as people aren't learning about blockchain at at the rate they used to and so what's happening is these jobs are sitting vacant and companies are having to pay you a very high salary if you are an expert within blockchain now the next role i want to talk about is one that is less technical i know we've been going through a lot more technical roles but it's a side kind of bar side note the reality is all of these roles are within different sectors within the tech industry so for example the first one we spoke about being data security analyst that is in security then we just finished speaking about blockchain that is in the blockchain world so even if you aren't looking to get into a technical role in in these little sectors or big sectors there are so many different opportunities too so if you're watching this and you were saying tip all you do right now is talk about technical roles where's the non-technical roles they're within those sectors as well and very high paying too now okay now that i done that second spiel of the day let's get into what is this non-technical role which is product manager and listen i know when i was a developer i used to i'll be honest with you not love product managers i thought what do they actually do but now i really as i've you know become more experience working in tech grown in the industry i can see how vital a good product manager is and i say good just because like any role there are some that maybe slack off and don't work as hard but when you get a good product manager it will completely change your team's work ethic it will completely change uh looking ahead at the road map i mean it honestly when you go from having a good product manager to a bad one you really realize how important product managers are now a lot of times developers or technical folks will end up going into a product manager role if you are looking to get more into that management role and i think product manager is actually a really cool job you are that person who bridges the customer needs with the company needs so if you are someone who likes speaking about tech likes understanding the technology but you also like interacting and communicating with customers this is a good role for you now what does this pay well on salary.com the median salary is 122,000 by the way median is so hard to say i don't know if it's just me but median not median med median i always have to like open my mouth when i say it very wide thanks for listening to that there's a lot of sidebars today all right but yes 122,000 and it can go up though greatly you know um up to 150,000 and start just below 100,000 now this is in us as well so there's a lot of opportunity to grow a really great career within product management coming in at number one and i feel like it's been in the number one to number three spot lots of these times when we've done this list is cloud architect and this this role and roles within cloud we could talk about cloud engineers cloud architects are continuing to grow in demand and we haven't seen this sector slow down at all the good thing about understanding or really knowing about the cloud is there are so many certifications you can get really specialized with even online from the comfort of your home without having to go necessarily back to school for this role which i think is i mean so amazing look at all the different courses that amazon offers or aws offers the opportunities to learn and get certified within the cloud are feel like they're endless so that's a really big bonus to this role so what exactly does a cloud solutions architect do they have a really interesting role as though they kind of bridge that line between being very technical but also customer focused so as a solutions architect your job is not only being able to really understand and build technology but the other skill you really need to have is being able to communicate that with your customers understanding as to how they will best understand what's going on break down what is working what needs improvements all in a way that you know as you're talking to customers is very positive and optimistic well hopefully anyways so what is the average salary for a cloud solutions architect well in the united states it's around 157,000 so it's a very well-paying job now on the high end we are talking over 200,000 and then then on low end we are talking starting salaries around 130 now this is in united states and this is average uh just for the record based on over 3,000 different salaries so this is a pretty accurate salary all right we have gone through some of the best highest paying the top highest paying salaries in tech in 2024 as i started this video with it's important to note that aside from being high paying roles there are so many opportunities within these different sectors that this video yes we talk a little bit about the salaries of these jobs because it's exciting but the bigger picture here is skills we can learn within these sectors and apply them to our own roles and see ourselves grow as well all right i hope you enjoyed this video i linked link to down below so if you are interested in the world of investing startups all of that good stuff i mean with keeping up to date with tech it kind of comes hand in hand we see what's going on we hear the latest before most people do so it's a really interesting space to be in i link them down below
