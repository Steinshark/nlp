first off thank you chad jippy for giving me the title of this video appreciate that second off vang or how i learned even open-source communities can operate as fascist regimes one day as my stomach began churning from spreading another or spending another 30 seconds of my life waiting for an incremental compilation of a change to a single character in a string i started to recognize a horrible taste developing in my mouth okay so i feel this whenever i'm doing any sort of sur website thing going on it it this happens and like i make one small change so one thing i've always been doing is i never make changes to the main file i always right away the main file calls a singular function that starts the program like the main file is like one line and that's it and that helps kind of reduce it down a little bit but man it is still still it is still so slow i i understand the the the the taste in the mouth okay this rust programming language i was using which i was previously enjoying was instead causing me physical pain yes love this what a great this the energy of this article is incredible it's incredible i mean i i i get it though when you are compiling and the like linking is so slow and so painful sometimes it just makes you feel so angry things changed when i finally the enormous unnecessary complexity of the language want to create a string easy just use string or stir or perhaps ve8 u8 or uh slice of u8 uh there's actually quite a few more did you ever see that meme of c versus rust string let's see if they have it let's see if i can just find it right off the rip come on come on come on yeah there you go like look at this thing is it a is it a reference to a stir is it a string is it a is it a slice of u8 is a slice of u8 with the length is it a v of u8 is it an is a is it a reference u i'm not sure about that one what the hell is that thing is it an os string stir is it an os string is it a path is it a path puff is it a se stir is a c string is it a static stir string this one and this one is kind of like the same thing you know what i mean they're not really different you know kind of you're kind of getting away but still there's a lot of straight no this cannot be real this is real okay this is real this is what happens when a language is very safe what about boxer missing where's my box what about my rcer my rc ster yeah cu remember rc's rc ster remember how like fast that was we talked about that arc sters on that one you know that one video you can have much faster string passing around and coping by using a an rc and or an arc rookies all right anyways want to do the most common thing you would probably need to do with these types and convert between them best of luck well there's just a lot of cloning i understand why these distinct types exist and how they provide safety and predictability for their use cases that's usually the trade-off you're making uh but being given so many similar things without a consistent way to use them feels wrong and slowed my progress towards becoming a better programmer i initially started using rust because the internet was abound with claims of memory safety things which are ironically and sadly null points when most external dependencies are riddled with unsafe blocks is uh is that uh i don't know if that's true right i don't know about this whole thing right here by the way i have recently okay we're going on a tangent for a quick second i recently had somebody tell me uh wrong wrong wrong see greg thank you greg thank you greg greg leptos greg appreciate that i i it didn't feel right it didn't feel right because it most libraries i've seen i haven't seen but i got to go on something here so typically whenever i read something on the internet i say hey you know i don't know if this is true cuz i don't even know right like how would i know this to be true i haven't done a state of i haven't like examined the top 100 rust crates and and found out if this is true or not last time i did this with ruby on rails and i said hey i just don't even know we are watching a video guess what someone made a tweet saying that it's my responsibility to not make videos if i don't know i have to know everything and that i was spreading misinformation it's like i don't know i i don't i don't know i don't even know like i i just don't know ruby off rails uh i'm not going to know every answer okay it's just a fact of life uh but greg appreciate you i'm very curious about this article though because it seems exciting these dependencies often bring in their own by the hundreds and are pretty much required in doing any of the higher level things okay i mean the second part is definitely true in the sense that every rust project underneath the sun has s okay it has satur jon it you know like there is definitely like the list of things that exists in every rust project that has been compiled like the heat death of the universe is going to be caused by compiling sde okay it's just a fact of life okay return to monkey that's all by the way cargo is implemented nearly the same as npm yeah but it's way more convenient because it can build you know what i mean if procedural macros were easy to work with as declarative macros i would be happier person i hardly doubt there are more than 20 people in the world that actually know how all the internals of proc macro system work now this is actually a fair statement i agree with this statement it's one of the reasons why zig is so dang beautiful you know what i mean zig is so dang beautiful because it has comp time and comp time is like procedural macros for the dummies you know what i mean it's just really really nice it's just really really i just love it okay zig mentioned let's go the amount of people that fully understand all the internals of the rustling language itself at this point is probably zero complexity is a back door and can be misinterpreted misinterpreted as sophistication i do like this i do like the statement that there you know rust has grown in complexity and i think it is a very difficult language to know everything about rust i think that if you were to work in a large rust project you'd be like in a continual mode of discovery for quite some time which is a very appealing thing as well like i think that that's a good thing for a language to be deep but it's also a bad thing cuz i think you just have more ways to shoot yourself in a foot and lifetimes always will suck okay it's a leaky abstraction um i wish it weren't so but it's always that way i do think o camel got it right i honestly think that o camel got it right that's why i want to learn o camel that sounds great to me never gets boring yeah exactly i think o camel truly got it right uh let's go you know why o camel mentioned i know o camel already the reason why i think o camel got it right is that they have those three identifiers or four identifiers whatever it is i i haven't used enough to be super understandable of exactly how it all works but i do know that i know how it works just not how to use it uh that you're able to specify the the locality of the variable so it can be stack allocated and you can specify the lifetimes and if it's a ed once if it's mutable all that kind of stuff and so that allows you to have almost exclusively the same safety measures of rust just with instant compile times and only op in and there's no lifetimes like it's it's truly it's it's it's absolutely incredible so gc on crack well it's gc plus you can kind of specify and help hint it into not needing to be gc like oh this is a stack only one it should only be allocated once right it has a bunch of super cool things built in especially around file handles and all that it's very very impressive o camel 5 is going to be very impressive language i actually think it's going to be worth learning fos show faux show all right also i don't remember where i read this and i only mentioned it due to its absurd absurdity another thing i saw russ laed for in an online article no doubt drafted indirectly by its foundation okay anyway dunking on the foundation okay that's a plus one is the russ performant behavior was power or saving power making it a green language well if again i my my just initial gut reaction counterargument is that if everybody compiles sday is it a green language i mean really is it uh i am not sure if you are well versed in recognizing horseshit but anyone that tells you anything is green or restoring the planet other than a biodiverse uh permaculture farmers are giant horses lifting their tail right above your all to receiving head no farmers don't spread hype fuel propaganda because they're too busy doing important things this beautiful sentence beautiful sentence right there beautiful sentence boom goes the dynamite i mean there it's very this is very hilarious all right all the cop reputation required for compiling the simplest gui along with the ci utility uh utilized everywhere even for the repositories that don't justifiably need it is probably consuming more energy than the led street lights of every combined city on this planet fair take fair take this right here is probably a fair take but i mean i think the inverse is is that let's just let's just play this out logically in our head the inverse would be that you have a program programming languages that is decently easy enough to make fairly fast okay 50 times faster than javascript therefore if you have a billion people use the thing you get a very large combined savings there right so it's like you know the trade-off is not one to one right you could just because the the the the creation one would argue that the creation is probably not as big as the use if it is so just use goang goang would be the more appropriate usage you're right goang would be the win here if you allow yourself to believe articles like the one i'm just like one i just described you are falling one step behind in life every time you do there are thousands of articles spread across the internet search engines filled with tiny plush crabs which have nothing to do with code and levels of praise that i now find highly questionable eventually the language experienced a legal overthrow by corporations that would undoubtedly try to imprison anyone attempting to even mutter the word rust without their consent approval tens of thousands of car detailers across the globe justifiably didn't give a series of stuff okay so this must be a jab at the rust foundation okay so what's the thing what's the thing we're trying to get at here because i i do want to know i do want to actually understand the the crux of the argument okay so we're kind of getting away like hey hype's too high we got that we get that uh the foundation probably a little too tight gripped also comes from mozilla mozilla has a huge history of just making really intense things right this is not their first road io this is not their first time being in some some doubt some dubious water all right i started to use this language actually the first language i properly learned because of two things its tooling made it really easy to install and get going this is a great part about rust i absolutely love this part uh i would say it's it feels slightly better than goes goes is pretty good but it just feels better than goes it just does cuz when you go get and you have to go like like i'm never going to remember the the the github address right i'm just not going to remember it but i'm going to remember tokyo and so i like that feeling right i like that but i totally understand its implication which one thing that makes go really great is that you always rely on some sort of versioning system as your form of hosting so there's not some central repository like car crates.io and so i i like that i i like that developing it uh in it was actually fun if not timec consuming yeah developing rust is a great time i like programming in rust rust is a great time however i'm not a fan of the threats made against people trying to share educational knowledge and i am definitely not for corporations that fire their underpaid laborers for being sick i felt contributory to these external things by continuing to use the language so i scraped all my r projects and started looking for a different language to use i i don't know about this one uh is this a reference that i don't understand is there is there like a reference here that i'm not understanding i know i know i know russ can import uh repos paths and all that but their main thing is that they use crates iio like their main one i i don't really understand this reference right here uh i felt let's see okay uh some of the people i can find ways to separate to these concerns i cannot please note despite everything i've just said i don't think rust is a bad language at all people who make such claims especially those who are uh novice programmers such as myself are idiots okay that's i i actually really like this i i think rust is a great language and so his so it sounds like okay so the crux of his problem is that he does not trust the foundation okay that's fair i think that's a fair claim uh especially if you're trying to create uh rust learning content and all that uh remember the guy who just created a javascri or rust for javascript developers just got a uh a lawyer from oracle saying take down the site because it contains the word javascript and we did not approve it the same thing will happen with rust once all this thing goes through to think that it won't happen you know you're just kind of nuts of course it's going to happen anything with the word rust in it that's in the that's in the that's in the website title they're going to they're going to take it down they have very strict rules this is a real thing this already happens with javascript and to think it won't happen elsewhere it's just kind of foolish right it's just simply foolish russ gives us an awesome and usable approach for safe manual memory management agreed it's great it's compiler uh manual doesn't feel quite so manual it's not quite manual i wouldn't call it quite manual it's kind of semi-automated uh its compiler error messages are still better than any other language i've used absolutely i really enjoy learning it the rust book is extremely well written it can be really fast but most importantly it was a project i initially developed by people with a passion to create safer better system/ internet yeah it's great in fact i liked it too much which is probably why i'm so upset i think this is a very natural feeling when you really really like something like perhaps a little too much and then you feel kind of jabbed in the back by something it it is really hard to separate it out like it is really really hard to to separate that out you know what i mean what i don't appreciate is how it was sl is being per uh perpetuated through discourse online media as a solution to everything whenever i notice such behavior it's normally because i'm trying to be sold something now yeah you're trying to be sold safety come on dog it's safety uh i you know i think my my general rule of thumb is that when it comes to a c i really like rust i really like rust rust is really really nice for a cli it just it's it's just all i love the string processing utilities i think it's just a fantastic language um go's also really good go's also really good go is my other one hold on i got i got i got to do this sorry i just got to do this everybody here you you're gonna get out okay file get out okay i i've watched you over and over again hey if you if you don't like how i like a word that's fine you can say hey i don't like it but if you're going to do it like 19 times over and over again come on hey come on hey come on come on don't do that hey come on hey come on bro bro hey come on bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro come on hey hey come on i'm just going to have to get you out first off karen i want you to add something to the rule book okay if if someone says bruh to me i want you to get them out the oldfashioned way yeah exactly bathroom ramen onto the keyboard and then throw the laptop out the window okay you know what i'm talking you know what i'm talking about karen you know what i'm talking about i'm not your bruh brow okay well hold on another easy ban we're just going to get this guy out cuz i don't care what he has to say we're just going to do that okay it just makes life easy you know what i mean sometimes you just got to make life easy it just makes life easy because if you don't let because you know the guy's going to be like dude i'm joking i'm joking what i i was saying it's a nothing burger she's like i don't want it twist his dick off yeah we're going to twist the dick off all right now that i am trying to be sold and why i don't have the answer to that and i'd rather not find out okay i think these are actually fair fair things is that rust was very hyped i think there's things that are really really great i still think leptos is such a fantastic library i absolutely love it leptos 5 has made everything easier you don't have to pass these little contexts around there's so many good things about it absolutely think greg is a champion if you don't know anything about leptos or that you should strongly check it out it's really really really great i absolutely like it uh it's full stack framework okay you can call full stack framework i use it just as a serers side renderer in hdmx on the front i love it i absolutely love it now i have to ban greg now now i have to b ban greg the old fashioned way thanks greg um but really it's it's it hdmx plus lepos plus axom or actic whatever one you like uh it's it's fantastic it's a great experience it's a great experience uh at the let's see at the time many interesting newer languages were in the earlier stages of development and didn't have enough tooling or stability for what uh i needed it for i wanted something compiled less complex and more subjectively readable in retrospect i should have just learned o camel he kn he knew he knew okay he knew lis or c or another established language v claimed itself to be many many things including three primary things i was searching for yeah v is kind of interesting because i know there's a lot of doubt and skep skeptical around v i'm curious if it's better because again when i tried v a year ago or about a year and a half ago on stream i built a doubly link list and the generics could not be specified to build a simple node class like it was not ready yet they said they fixed that great but nonetheless that like to me that says hey we're not ready yet you've never heard of v uh v yeah v looks cool it looks like go right anyways now i don't take part in the online communities of any kind but for some reason i do not fully understand i decide to join the v discord channel on the surface everyone there seems very pleasant open and inviting if you have any experience on this planet you should shame me for not having the foresight to predict something may be a miss oh may have been a miss oh no is this also crapping on v see i thought this was going to be like vlay being the savior and rust being f are we about to have the double turnaround here are we having the double turnaround right now did did jity lie to us uh one day a user came into the channel with a screenshot from v's telegram channel claiming they were unjustifiably banned he was very upset and frustrated about being banned without being given a reason and seemingly without good cause after reading the message i'm going to do this it's please don't make me upset here we go hello vcam i just got kicked out the telo channel by alex for stating that go is more suitable for microservices than v before this uh the day before i showed up uh showed that the v author is cheating with rps in the v web claiming that he has 28k uh throughput or 28k per second something like that although on my vps it was only two and other people even more powerful servers had five to seven i see your community you can only praise the language i mean i will suggest uh so okay so one thing i think one thing to to keep in mind here that's probably missing so i'm just going to try to i'm just going to try to put some uh some fairness on this which is that going to a languages discord and being like you should just use uh you should just use goang instead like you know you know how many times they probably get that you know you know how many times they probably get that it's probably super annoying and so they probably just you know just like how that guy in chat said what he said and i just banned him straight up it's because you know you get it enough times you just kind of know what kind of person you're about to have so is this completely unjustifiable probably not you know i'm just i'm just letting you know from a a different perspective different perspective here uh shortly after nearly everybody in the chat began dis uh dismissing his claim stating that he was making no sense in utilizing other manipulatory circular rhetoric to belittle him anger him further and subvert uh subvert the subject one person actually uh uh anal analog analogized an analogized an analogized an analogized what word is this do i not know how to say this word this word is all w is it anal my my brain like analogy analog analogized is it analogized analogized am i just saying this wrong it's analogy yes it's analogy but i don't know how to say it in this way analized analogized is that a word analized it is well damn analogized analogized okay sounds fake sounds fake news analogize the community to north korea in defenses of it okay maybe maybe i'm not reading this correct but typically you would never want to be on the side that says you are like north korea right for any reason right like typ typically you just don't want to be on that even if north korea does something great i would be very questioning what i'm doing if it lined up with the values of north korea right i'd be like whoa what has happened in my life what what have i done with my life i felt a strong sinking feeling in my stomach while this is just an online chat room the base operating patterns of a community defin it when such societal patterns become accepted in any community they are more easily viewed as acceptable behavior in other areas of life yeah this is like your typical kind of i mean this slippery slub fallacy but i mean it's a fair critique right if if if you feel like you can act one way online it's inevitably going to slowly bleed into your real life i mean but this is i mean this is classic right this is like classic jesus right here out of the out of the heart the mouth speaks right um yes i mean i i'm not saying that modern warfare probably had worse things going on in it modern warfare 2 lobbies are just the mo modern warfare today has worse lobbies than whatever is occurring here soon afterwards the content was removed without notice of redaction and the user was banned when questioned by one admirable user in the chat who removed the messages and why the only response received was from a moderator who stated that they couldn't even say who uh who was capable of doing that people continued their conversation as if nothing occurred i mean it's it's it's kind of a nothing burger i mean i think it's more just annoying i i get it a general rule of thumb is that i think a much like when i read the stuff that's happening right here it's just like a better way to go about it is that if you feel like there is some sort of misleading on someone's stuff and you feel strongly enough to go into the chat rooms and start arguing about it it might just be better to start looking it up and testing it yourself look at any of the projects how are the projects done how are the projects measured and then maybe try to like help shape it or say hey like i went through all of your stuff here's the things that i feel are wrong could we make these fixes could we do something that you know could like try to be like maybe a slightly more positive force in this because if you're a positive force you typically aren't looked at as like a big jerk and you don't get banned and then you don't make these huge scenes and then articles like these don't really exist because you just took a little bit different of approach and i think that will always be a better way and if you don't care enough to do like the leg work to prove someone is incorrect then maybe you don't care enough to make a scene you know what i mean like why why does it matter if you're not willing to put in a day worth of like investigating something i don't know if they could do this out of fear ignorance or some insane sense of communal superiority but i do know that during those attacks multiple people claimed that there was no leader of the vl and that it was a community i thought back on human history and the gut let's see and the gut rod i felt with rust and i knew i had to get out of there poor rust okay lot of rust communities are fantastic i'm just going to be real here there are some community members of rust that are genuinely some of the nice greatest people you'll meet and so i it's hard to put it in the same bucket vi is a much more niche group of people so maybe it's a little bit better to kind of put it in that um but rust is a much larger community uh blink twice if you're under duress i know i'm complimenting hey i'm complimenting rust okay because rust is not its leadership okay the foundation is a much different group the foundation doesn't even represent the the project leads right there's several groups within that thing cu it's big enough you know what i mean i removed most of my messages in the discord because i did not want to support a community that utilizes such totalitarian tactics to manipulate and control its members so freely and without any opposition from its other members which is real concern here one thing that i share was educational article i made years ago entitled what is a computer the document is simple overview of what a computer is and how they operate alex m the leader of the v community took the article and put it in extremely makeshift repository with my article as it as it's the only real content i previously did not mind sharing educational knowledge but after witnessing this happen i did not want my words associated with these people and whatever their unknown mission is so i polly asked him to remove the article from the repo this is the resulting conversation which got me banned from the discord and subsequently wiped from chat history determine for yourself what's going on please uh rebase repo with my article removed why okay this yeah may maybe a little bit more context is always good i don't feel comfortable being a part of an open source community that reshapes its message history without taking accountability for it acknowledging it happened particular when the person that started the conversation was clearly making an idiot out of themselves he was even on team that guy was acting like an idiot okay so i mean that's uh the type of censorship this guy okay so this guy is definitely a freedom guy i mean i understand both sides i feel like uh that type of censorship even on the uh even if the intent is to clean up message board is dangerous and makes uh me feel extremely uncomfortable being a part of the community so i don't want to my work associated with it that's just cleaning up trolls messages simple moderation what's wrong with that we don't get that many trolls anymore i don't think it happened over the last year i don't find let's see i don't think you'll find a single open source community that doesn't moderates its forums in chat it's true uh it was more so what's her inquiry in the v chat being dismissed than actual deletion of the messages that's pretty transparent we have few rules i didn't see that message i didn't read every single message here besides it was obvious it was removed by a moderator what else uh what else could have happened perhaps in the future i feel differently but at this time i would just like the article removed he also got respon uh a response from a moderator so it wasn't dismissed it has been 7 hours since my request i'll take the nicest stance i can right now and assume you think this conversation is still happening and you are waiting for my reply to take action removing the content in a manner which leaves no trace that it ever existed is not obvious in its uh anti antithesis of transparency a moderator uh did reply but the response was stating that he wasn't even capable of stating who was accountable for the removal or why it occurred it okay so it is kind of funny okay just just like just just a moment here there is something funny about asking for a rebase remove and totally removing himself from something because they removed someone in some sense a discord rebase of it you know like there there there is something kind of there is there's something a bit offset here that i feel like happening which is in a sense he's asking for what he does not like or things should not happen so in the online uh community he wants to have a a series of all the things that have you know happened that you should keep around these stuffs but asking for himself to be removed like why why the special case i don't understand the special case under this um i don't really i don't i i don't i don't get it and i think the t yeah i mean the tone could have been a little bit better maybe a little bit longer of a response right here i think could have been really nice you know just like hey you know i've been feeling kind of uncomfortable and i'd like my you know just if you just make it kind of straightforward in a way that everyone can kind of agree with uh you know you might have got a different response i'm not exactly sure how how i would have gone about it i would have definitely taken a nice little night sleep that's always a good move sleep on things uh since bbs's have existed 40 plus years ago and has been common social practice to provide a notice of any redactions or a reason to anyone being banned from a platform even if that reason is simply two-word stop trolling however the person that posted seem to have a legitimate concern in the question as to why they were banned his opinion was just deluded through his anger his expression of frustration at such a situation assuming a screenshot and claimed to being banned were truthful can hardly be considered trolling at this current moment you are refusing to remove any of my content at my request which which uh was put in a repository without any license which legally implicates that you claim to be the copyright owner of my work that is direct plagiarism and the exact opposite of sharing community so also not not necessarily a great not a great way to get things going here by refusing to comply with my request you are putting the language at risk of legal action being taken against it uh for something frivolous as an educational article that doesn't have even have to do with the language if you are the leader of this community then it is horribly dangerous leader because if anyone here does receive income from being a contributor contributing developer to this language you are putting their income at risk for no other reason that i can see uh other than personal pride i will ask once more remove to remove my article from the repository and this is that request yes copyright does work that way but it is quite hostile i do agree with that it is pretty hostile i i would be i i mean this this whole thing just seems like a cluster festival right i mean i bet you there's a lot of people that have done some things right we probably don't have the whole story do i feel bad for a lot of the people involved you know even vlan guy alex m he's probably you know like he has to trust his mods are making the right decisions like i can't review every single ban i just have to assume right i just have to assume that people are making the right decisions and so my my general natural first stance is that i just side with my mods even if i don't know why just because i just i first have to start there you know what i mean and then from that i will go you know i will then try to figure out what happened and if i think something wasn't good i'll kind of you know then reverse it so i i totally get his stance because you know when you deal with it a lot it's hard not to you know it's really really hard uh despite the fact that i stated that the article needed to be rebased in the repo is essentially serving little purpose other than a plagiarizing my work he merely removed the file from the repo with a second commit intentionally leaving my content in the g history apparently another user found my request reasonable and asked alex m again to rebase the repo and his response was uh i think he wanted a repo to rebase the file can still be seen in the commit history or implement a time machine so that it's never been there interesting okay so he just doesn't want to do it okay so that's that's what we saw here he just he he just he doesn't want to do it all right to be clear i did not threaten any legal action against him by refusing to comply with my request you are putting the language at risk of legal action being taken against it i mean it's pretty close you know like you know like you know in the old mob movies uh this was actually like a pretty common mob practice perhaps other prominent people have also taken uh taken ac uh taken part in this but typically you'd have the dawn call and he be like hey how's the weather oh the weather's good okay how's the family doing okay the family's doing good okay i'd hate there to be bad weather okay take care right that's a tacid threat slash that's tacid authority given to whoever is on the other side of the phone right the guy's like look what i just did i just call i it's the dawn speaking you know i have access he's just letting you know weather could be bad at some point right just saying it's it's it's strange to say that uh i simply stated that his actions were putting himself in a potentially bad situation for seemingly no reason other than pride i i mean true syntactically true syntactically true to be fair syntactically true i personally do not believe in this concept of justice and find it very okay i personally do not believe in the concept of justice but in some sense you are demanding justice uh i'm confused i'm riddled with confusion at this point um and i find it varies a little from the concept of revenge it's actually significantly different uh i have however used the tools currently available to file a dmca request against the repo to hopefully prevent my content from being related to them when i shared my educational article i stated that i did not need attributions of my name/ handle in the article but i by no means gave anyone permission to upload my work into a repo with proprietary license license license list yes that'd be license list license list comes with the like a strict licensing by default so in the wake of all this if you do not practice uh uh permaculture it may be beneficial to ask yourself the question am i a decent person this is taking a rabbit hole i did not i did not expect this turn okay i did not expect this turn at all i did not expect it i got to re we got to retitle this one so much lacking of selfawareness i it's it's a little it's a little w i'm actually i'm having a hard time trying to understand this in the sense that i mean justice and revenge are are very very different um second i mean you are pursuing justice-based behavior like justice is one of the few things that separates us out from animals that's it's important concept i'm shocked right now i'm i'm shook i am shook um anyways if you have already answered that question you may be incorrect i i am i a decent person i am not a decent person okay for those that don't know i do not consider myself a decent person uh i don't know if i can consider myself a decent person acceptable perhaps societally acceptable but when i meet people like the uh like i did in this community of v programming language i felt uh relieved that i at the very least was not like them so there is a so so there so you may not be a decent person but you're leer not that guy i mean you i'd always be careful with this kind of thought process you know again because then you're kind of just sugar coding it because now you kind of said well these are the real bad guys and i'm not a good guy but i'm not a bad i'm not a bad guy right careful about this this kind of thought process can be kind of it can be trixy for you i felt relieved that i at the very least was not like them mind you there are most definitely good people in that channel who did not express or endorse such acts my previously stated gripes in no way represent them the first two languages that re i really got into have unfortunately been disappointing experiences primarily due to the entities communities related to them what i learned though is that i don't part uh particularly care if a language is the fastest or that has the has clean syntax milliseconds of computation time and pretty symbols are no trade-off for my soul know i think something that's really really really important that maybe is missing in this entire article here is that you'll always be disappointed meeting your heroes in some sense i'm just throwing this out there like you find you you fell in love with russ the language and found out that it was ran by people right you fell in love with v and found out that it was ran by people you know and that is it's real you know it it is absolutely real true i'm going wait wait what i'm going to the prime agent's house next week yes t will be at my house and i think that's one of the hard parts is that is that if if you think that somehow there exists this place in which is like this idyllic place in which everyone gets along and all problems are reasonably and amicy amicably worked out and everyone's better at the end it's just like it just doesn't exist i would like it to exist i would like to pretend that i am someone that could live in that land and be a person of that proper repute but i don't think i am people are people it's only a communist utopia that exists like that it's only utopia it's not reality and so i think that one of the problems here is that you uh you go into this and and you've developed a picture of what should exist and then you see what does exist and you feel really sad about it you know and i feel for this guy i do i actually feel for the guy writing this because he obviously wants to find a community he wants to be a part of something you know i think it's easy to dunk on him but i don't want to dunk on him right like i think some of his his concepts are kind of silly which is especially like the around like the justice versus uh revenge he most certainly believes in justice everyone believes in justice uh okay here i just we're again how how how are people so weird dude
