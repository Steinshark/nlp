do you have an extra 150 bucks laying around that's how much it'll cost you if you want to buy a standalone version of microsoft office you know without paying those monthly subscription fees meanwhile you'll need to pay even more if you want an office license for commercial use 440 bucks just for one pc even if you just need excel for your taco truck or whatever buying just one of the office programs is60 bucks holy cow it might be easy to assume that these prices are another example of inflation run a muuk but it turns out office has long been a very expensive product in fact office 97 started at a cool $4.99 when it first came out over 25 years ago but even with these outrageous prices there's a very good chance that you've been using word processors for years without forking over hundreds of dollars because for the average person typing at home plenty of viable alternatives have existed over the decades before cloud computing came to dominate the tech scene it was common for pre-built built computers to include some kind of productivity software whether it was from microsoft or someone else and even if you didn't get anything like this with your new pc you'd at the very least be able to use wordpad a very basic word processor that's still included with windows 11 today of course online alternatives like google docs are available for free and office itself actually has a free web-based version you can use through a browser so why are they trying to sell you office at a king's ransom we'll tell you right after do we think anyes anyes is a remote desktop application that works for windows mac linux ios android chrome os and even raspberry pi it's great both for personal use or for business people cuz it's got enterprise features like sso a customizable client and collaboration tools business people love that stuff they provide extensive support and can help onboarding your team which saves you time if you want to get started for free or learn more about any desk's business plans click the link below it turns out my microsoft isn't actually trying to sell office to you the typical home user office is expensive partly because its key customer base is well offices what may seem like a lot of money to you may end up being peanuts to a business of course no business wants to pay for software if they can avoid it but an office suite often doesn't end up being a massive expense especially considering larger businesses often negotiate volume licensing with microsoft meaning that they'll get a license for many employees at a discounted rate moreover compared to some of the traditional open source alternatives the programs in the ms office suite include a number of advanced features that businesses are willing to fork out money for not to mention that they get support from microsoft and larger organizations often don't want to rely on a suite that's mainly browser based as that's potentially lots of downtime if there's an internet outage of course we have to mention that office primarily operates on a subscription model now microsoft actually isn't even using the office name for the current version of the suite anymore instead rebranding it as microsoft 365 it still isn't cheap if you stay on a yearly plan for 2 years you're paying nearly the same amount as just buying a standalone version of office outright but this also means that microsoft doesn't really have a reason to make standalone office cheaper even if you pay more over the long run $7 a month sounds a heck of a lot more palatable than 150 bucks up front and unlike standalone office microsoft 365 also dangles the carot of extra cloud storage and future updates with their subscription service as well as ongoing support and of course microsoft stands to make a heck of a lot more money over the long run with a subscription model than they would if they just kept selling individual licenses which businesses may or may not choose to upgrade every few years so they aren't going to make the standalone version cheaper as they want to incentivize you to pay for a juicy microsoft 365 subscription and on top of everything we've talked about there's there a great deal of inertia in the sense that many businesses have been using office for so long and they don't want to switch especially when you consider lots of businesses employ university graduates that came from schools that also got volume deals on office but the good news is there's still no reason to shell out money if you just want to turn your computer on and type and thank you for turning your computer on and pressing play on this video cuz you know you watched all the way to the end that and that's special um oh now i tell you to like dislike check out other videos comment below with video suggestions don't forget to subscribe and follow tech wiy but i you know i just want to be in this moment for another second wow
