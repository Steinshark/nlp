ladies and gentlemen it is my absolute pleasure to bring you an absolutely bombshell piece of news in the chess world and maybe by extension to the overall worldwide audience now first of all if you're a returning viewer welcome back i'm obviously on the move again i apologize for the poor camera quality uh i'm currently on vacation in europe i'm with my family it's actually 11 o'clock at night and i'm recording here uh and if you're a first time viewer welcome i have a lot of chess videos normally with better setups than this but bad setup aside um today for the first time in some six to eight months we got an update in the massive lawsuit filed by hans neiman versus magnus carlson hikarnakamura and chess.com and that lawsuit was for some 100 million dollars and the case was dismissed is this the end of the story i don't actually think so and in this video i'm going to take you through day number one until today which is some nearly one year later in 2023 it's currently june 27th i'm going to take you through the entire storyline what exactly the decision was what that actually means moving forward you name it let's run you up to speed and also many of you probably got into chess during the scandal let me know in the comments if you did a lot of you played you know queensland got into because of queen's gamut or whatever or whatever it might be so let's jump into this we're going back to september 5th 2022. actually we're going back to september 4th 2022 because that's when this game happened hans neiman defeated magnus carlson in a game in the sinkfield cup in st louis missouri uh in in a tournament where he wasn't even supposed to play hans neiman was a last minute replacement to a tournament that was full but a player couldn't make it due to some travel restrictions visa issues and hans demon plays in this tournament and he starts red hot and he defeats magnus carlson in a classical game of chess that's fine people have beaten magnus carlson the classical game of chess before that became a massive talking point uh and that game was actually the game i'm about to show you i apologize i'm kind of in the way again travel set up a little bit ugly not the most uh you know not the most important thing in the world that game was a nimso indian bishop to b4 was played i'm not going to get into the the nitty-gritty here but basically magnus played this variation pawn to g3 which he almost never plays and that became a massive talking point and then hans grabbed the pawn early in the game and he counter-attacked uh he he attacked magnus the center with the move c5 and he kind of uh very early started this ridiculous sequence where he ignored the threat on his queen by counter-attacking his opponent's queen and they got into a very complicated and messy end game and right around here was actually when i woke up that day and i thought oh magnus is just gonna go to work and then what ended up happening was hans slowly methodically outplayed magnus carlson in an end game now you'll notice that hansen is now up a pawn with the black pieces i'm you know my face might be covering a little bit of the screen so you might not see that you know he's got a pawn right there but i promise it's there as you can see from the eval you know that's sort of uh that sort of sustains the the evaluation as well my point is my friends this is not really going to be a chess analysis video and inaccuracies were made along the way but overall it was a game that was more or less smooth sailing for hans neiman as he took down the world champion of chess at the time and arguably the goat magnus carlson in some 57 moves in an overall game that many people called not it wasn't supposed to be that easy to beat magnus with the black pieces especially your very first time so hans beats magnus okay so what well then he sits down in the post-game press conference and he says the world champion must be embarrassed to lose to an idiot like me he says that man i'm not saying that here where i am right now he said that the very next day magnus carlson said i've withdrawn from the tournament i've always enjoyed playing in the st louis chess club and hope to be back in the future and he tweets out a clip that says if i speak i am in big trouble this one jose mourinho famed uh football manager says if i speak i'm in big trouble and i don't know to wish to be in big trouble a lot of people uh assumed and insinuated that this was essentially an allegation of cheating an insinuation of cheating unfortunately what had left the door open to was tremendous massive speculation did magnus say that he cheated in the game against hans cheated in the game against him that hans cheat in general did he did even insinuate cheating like some people were trying to argue he was unsatisfied with anyway it it came to light later um and magnus actually did put out a statement that said this was three weeks later at the 2022 singfield cup i made the unprecedented professional decision to withdraw from the tournament after my round three game against hans neiman a week later during the champions chester i resigned against hans demon after only playing one move so a couple of weeks after that game on september 4th 2022 these two played in an online tournament that they already were going to play in and magnus refused to play he protested he refused to play i know my actions are frustrated many in the chess community i'm frustrated i want to play chess i want to play chess the highest level the best events and essentially if you look down at the paragraph it says i believe that neiman has cheated more and more recently than he has publicly admitted his over-the-board progress has been unusual throughout our game in the same field goal i had the impression he wasn't tense or even fully concentrating on the game in critical positions while out playing me else as the black in a way i think only handful of players can do this game contributed to changing my perspective we must do something about cheating my part going forward i don't want to play against people that have cheated repeatedly in the past because i don't know what they're capable of doing in the future um after this came out uh some week later chess.com published a 72-page report on hanzim and cheating in general and i have made videos about this we don't have to rehash it and shells.com themselves said hans has not fully admitted admitted to the extent of his cheating han said in an interview at the same field chess club he's cheated when he was 12 and 16 years old but he's never dared to cheat over the board he would never tarnish his name and and do something like that um and he's very apologetic and chesla compass held this report that says here is our methodology we've caught many people in the past who are grand masters not just uh you know we haven't just caught hans and then this hans demon sues magnus carlson for a hundred million dollars accusing him of defamation this is now october 2022. this is after the chess.com report this is after the uh the magnus follow-up statement and he also sued hikaru like hikaru was in this lawsuit as well um again like it's kind of a weird situation because i was also making a lot of content at the time based on this lawsuit because it was going to bring in views if it brings in more views people are going to stick around and play chess so that's a benefit for me like i'm not gonna bsu i'm a chess content creator is it in my best interest that people are interested in the game of chess which is what i make content on yes i've said this many many times but what i refuse to do in my content is i refuse to kind of like angle it toward one person or another i tried to stay on the side of i can see it from magnus's perspective i can see it from uh the perspective of hans neiman because like i kept saying in my videos if god forbid this man cheated online as a teenager but has truly never cheated over the board this is horrible for his reputation this is horrible for his career and i'm going to touch on that a little bit more later i mean can you imagine being the focal point of something like this even you have past mistakes you've done things that some would argue should just kick you out of chest permanently so i was talking about you know all this whole thing big picture and just trying to think understanding from everybody's perspective uh hans neiman sued magnus carlsen chels.com and he called for 100 million dollars in october of 2022. um and um neiman wanted a federal court in missouri's eastern district uh to award him at least a million dollars in damages um there was a lot of claims in this lawsuit um that were interesting and fascinating to say the least um and uh he publicly admitted he used some devices to uh to cheat in the past when he was 12 and 16 years old um this just basically has kind of like the the recap of every of everything but it does say things like uh provides neiman's fullest account yet about his high stakes dispute um and uh you know it says that best just learned history being notorious for inability to cope with defeat it says that magnus carlsen uh is an inability to cope with defeat uh that he gutlessly forfeited the game after making one move and he said that he was going to you know not to play against neiman and neiman said that um he's been blacklisted by tournaments like imagine you're a tournament organizer in the world of chess and you have magnus carlson who is the five-time champion like i don't know who would be his comparison to another sport but like you know the top of the top the messi the ronaldo and essentially it was a situation where he is for the you know for lack of a better way of phrasing it has essentially said like look i think this dude is a cheater like what are you gonna do right like if you're an organizer which one of them would you rather have play in your tournament right so this was this was uh this was sort of the argument here it's that uh you know he that he said the tournament started blacklisting him right as a result of this situation right like again that that was one of the that was one of the things that's ongoing defendants malicious defamation unlawful collusion has by design destroyed neiman's remarkable career in his prime and ruined his life i gotta admit uh hans absolutely was like it was and continues to be in his prime he's like 19 20 years old he's 2700 he keeps going up in hilo um this was definitely an unexpected hurdle it's not even a hurdle it's like a concrete wall um and um that was sort of like that was a lawsuit and it's had some updates um you know it was like dismissed in some areas and then it was uh not dismissed it had to be amended in some areas essentially han suit for some defamation there was some antitrust component with chess.com and play magnus uh and there was uh there was a lot of moving parts and if you like actually went into it there was like 70 different clauses that like cited little moments and things and interviews and um today june 7th june 27 2023 i was scrolling reddit chess and i saw neiman vs carlson case dismissed um now i'm gonna get back to this thread in a moment uh this is the first thing that we can see uh it says plaintiff right and um a person went to the memorandum an order issued here and on this day hereby ordered that this case is dismissed counts three and four are dismissed with prejudice uh and you cannot read because my frame is in the way i'm gonna move me the court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining courts the remaining chords are dismissed without prejudice let's bring me back because i'm handsome um again apologies travel setup this lawyer alleged lawyer could just be a redditor simple analysis from a lawyer the court did not dismiss the case in its entirety but did dismiss the anti-trust claims without any opportunity to refile them as it determined that even accepting all of the allegations has strewn the complaint there was no case under that statute essentially they're saying if everything that hans neiman claimed in the lawsuit is um reality it's still not antitrust i mean it like it's not an industry thing there's chess is a small like we have had a massive explosion chess ain't like football all right um as for the defamation claims the matter was filed in federal court defamation and other less exciting claims are state claims federal courts of jurisdiction to hear federal claims in may of jurisdiction other instances to adjudicate state claims eg the parties are in different states there's also federal claims of the same litigation here the only federal claims were dismissed so only state claims remain court declined to hear their state claims uh hanza is free to file a new lawsuit with those claims would have to take place in the state court do you think magnus would make a statement yeah i think kikar already has a video up so essentially this dismissal as far as i'm understanding it is is not like as bullet my gut instinct is defamation is still like the major discussion point as as far as like a like again uh i anal i am not a lawyer um but that seemed to always be the biggest one which is like could a public insinuation slash allegation of something like this potentially remove hans from participating in tournaments because he's not going to get invitations and can he sue for that and what would he sue for and defamation is the predetermined knowledge that something is incorrect but then saying it anyway which i don't think applies in this case um this wall street journal came out article came out with this and we're going to take a look at the shops.com one and then we're going to summarize be good you still hear terrific your attention span is longer than 12 minutes um this was filed today uh explosive battle allegations demon is she the 20 year old neiman's anti-trust claims against the parties were dismissed with prejudice meaning they cannot be brought again uh we are pleased the court has rejected han's name and attempt to recover an undeserved windfall in missouri federal court i'm assuming that means money neiman's attempt to chill speech through strategic litigation that form his fails craig reiser a partner accent attorney for carlson um attorneys for neiman terence oh and their note said their intend to pursue the defamation claim in state court there you go all right so again that's the big question um i i don't really think it's defamation i'm not a lawyer um i don't even know how you would argue for something like lost wages the trickiest thing about this entire thing is like nobody actually like i keep saying this in every interview i give nobody knows if hans neiman actually cheated except hans neiman that's like the weirdest thing about this thing right because the only way to physically prove somebody is cheating a chess is to somehow catch them actually physically cheating at chess you can go to the toilet and be on your phone right that's one way you can have accomplices that's provable but if a person is just having spectacular results isn't going to the toilet it's just sitting directly in front of you and yes has a device on them or not right and if he's not like again there are only two realities he's cheating or he's not cheating right that's it both of them are very trippy both of them are very uncomfortable to think about because if he is cheating what the hell man if he's not cheating what the hell man just in completely different ways right just in completely different ways i mean we both of them are like black mirror episodes like it's just they just don't make any sense there's so many things in both in both of those realities that simply do not make any sense the the people that have messed up and said things um and so on and so forth so just just a really really weird situation um and uh this was an international spotlight and i'm sure those of you who have watched this entire video up until this point probably are are thinking of um beads that get inserted into a certain area um again another fallout of this was uh was hans neiman uh in some reddit copy pasta essentially uh somebody said that you know you could cheat with vibrating device or the vibrating device in your anus and this became a worldwide sensation it was tweeted by elon musk who then went on to delete the tweet then this was picked up by literally every international news publication that i am that i can see which was like 10 um i was asked about it in like every chess interview that i gave to uh to i think to wired i think to some others and um i mean this thing just spread like wildfire um and um this was the statement this is all summaries and essentially this is uh this is a summary of what's going on neiman responded by filing a lawsuit um created a monopoly an elite chess competition and defamed him with the cheating allegation at one point the case even cited a meme from an avengers movie tweeted by play magnus as evidence yes uh the neiman legal team was tweeting out what was attaching to their case like various tweets where people make jokes about beads and listen like in a world where the man actually didn't cheat i can kind of see why you would do that does that make sense like imagine he didn't actually cheat like it's not a good thing that these memes are spreading out there it's not but the truth is nobody actually knows which is what makes this case just so weird and so fascinating and why i have avoided answering people's questions like do you think he cheated i got no idea if he cheated or not all i know is we are living in one of the two types of worlds where it either is or it isn't and right that's it um neiman has played some chess he's gone up he's gone down he's maintaining a 2700 elo what does that mean um and uh right i mean this is essentially a summary and then she has not come put this out uh eric and danny from just like com said we're glad to see this ruling we thought it was a meritless lawsuit that burned it a lot of time and money but we have a stewardship to protect the game we appreciate our amazing legal team for their diligence and commitment to the cause where do we go from here we remain 100 focused on what we've always been doing growing the game and serving the community uh this was a tweet that chess.com put out and then a little bit after that somebody responded to that tweet and said you you are not stewards of the game of chess the game of chess has existed long before you existed and will proceed to exist much longer than you you are just a profit-making it was like a it was a really like just mad tweet like i feel like that person has a splinter or like maybe recently one underwent the root canal or i don't know a colonoscopy or both like at the same time maybe i don't know that person seemed very unhappy but it was a good statement look and um i i look i think it's time to put a bow on this uh until the lawsuit of defamation is filed in a state court which is also a very fascinating one because where would they file the lawsuit of the defamation but they say that it occurred in the state like wherever the tweet went out would that be it was that where the tweet was sent because like hikaru lives in florida if i'm not mistaken magnus lives in norway um i don't know i don't know where hans lives nowadays would it be in missouri i that's another thing and now i do i expect that to happen most likely because i think if that wasn't thrown out that's still kind of like the big fish to catch um it's to me it's not really a case of defamation but it is a very weird case it is a very weird case and i'm i'm very uncomfortable with with either of the situations with with either the cheating being legitimate or the cheating being completely incorrect and it not happening and the truth is we will never know if that happened we will never know if it didn't happen will i continue making videos about it when we get updates yes yes i will and you are not a rocket scientist in figuring out that i will be making update videos on this because of two reasons number one as i've said i'm not going to bsu i am a chess content creator if you would ask me if i would have 600 000 people watch your video about chess or a million people watch a video about chess assuming i'm not you know shoving the chess pieces far up my nose or other places um then i would choose the million um but another reason is like i i would like to think and if you're still watching this video feel free to drop your a thought in the comments um i would like to think i am the biggest individual spokesperson for chess in the world meaning if i talk about chess or if any individual talks about chess perhaps they can reach the you know one of the largest audience they could reach perhaps is myself vichy anand in india india you guys kind of win you have like over a billion people there like but i don't know if that many people are gonna listen but on youtube in particular and i think i've been pretty level-headed about this whole thing i think i've done a pretty good job summarizing it and i make videos for you about it even though it's like 11 30 at night here in the mountains of a remote region of europe so that's all that's all the hans neiman lawsuit dismissed no antitrust uh and we're gonna see if the defamation in state court becomes a thing if that attorney team is working hard they probably already have a case prepared because they had a feeling it was going to get dismissed in federal but we're about to find out i'll see you in the next video get out of here
