imagine for a second that you could learn things 10 times faster than you can do now like seriously just think about that for a second what would that mean for you what would that allow you to do there's roughly two ways you can think about this on one hand if you could learn things 10 times faster you could learn 10 times more things and then use that knowledge to create sometimes more things and on the other hand even if you're not the type of person who wants to create more and more and more all the time being able to learn 10 times faster would allow you to just learn whatever you need to learn in 10 times less time so you could then go ahead and use that extra time to do whatever you want essentially whether you are a hustler type of person like i am where you want to do a lot or you're not it's always useful to be more productive and to be able to do things and to learn things faster and being someone who wants to do a lot i'm consciously learning more things wanting to do more things and when i was a student outside of my studies i was always doing a lot now making these videos learning to code so that's why throughout my life i've really been focused on figuring out the ways to do things the most efficiently as possible and that's really all that productivity is it allows you to do things much faster and a lot more efficiently and most people think that the only way to do more is just to put in more hours but if you'll figure out the right ways to be productive and work smarter rather than just harder i don't know if it will be ten times faster or five times or even two times faster but i guarantee you that if you apply the tips that i'm about to share you you're going to be able to learn things faster and to do more things my first tip is to use the five minute rule to end procrastination let's say all of us know the situation where you should be doing something you should be writing your essay you should be starting with your coding project or whatever but you just keep postponing you just keep procrastinating so how can we make sure that we don't just end up procrastinating for the whole day because i know this is a problem that everyone has the five-minute rule refers to a technique where you in a way trick your brain to think that you will only perform a task for five minutes okay i'm only gonna do this for five minutes but if you tell yourself you're only gonna do it for five minutes it's pretty easy to start right but the trick is that the hardest part about starting is just starting and once you start it's a lot easier to keep going so that's why if you trick your brain to thinking you're only going to do something for five minutes you're gonna allow yourself to get started much easier when i first heard about this trick i was sort of very skeptical like okay this sounds like a gimmicky thing this surely this can't actually work but ever since i started using it i've actually found that my productivity has increased substantially whenever i was in university and i was thinking about writing an essay for example essentially i would just tell myself okay i will just write the title and the first sentence of the essay that's easy to do i'll just do that but once you start you sort of get into the work then you actually want to keep going and you might find yourself you've been going for like an hour or even two hours so that's why being able to just trick yourself to star by any means necessary it's really important and the five-minute rule is a good way to do that heck even newton's first law states that an object remains in the same state of motion unless a resulted force acts on it so even newton's laws of physics are in favor of the five minute rule and team number two is to use something called time blocking to reach something called the flow state being able to do work in this state of flow it's probably the single most effective thing i've ever done to increase my productivity so the state of flow essentially means doing work in a state of extreme concentration so instead of having your phone constantly distracting with you with notifications or something like that you're gonna let's say put your phone away tell people to not distract you so that you're able to work in a state of extreme concentration so you're not distracted at all and you'd think that the difference between this and working in a non-state of flow would be like quite minor it's actually substantial there's like research around this like if you're working in a state of flow you can literally get done in one hour while you might get done in a full day of a non-close date work so the flow state is critically important so how do you actually reach the flow state one thing that i found really useful for me is using something called time blocking where you're literally setting time blocks in your calendar to sort of tell yourself that let's say from 10 a.m to 12 you're only allowed to work on your coding project or whatever you're doing so then you're telling yourself beforehand that during this time i am not allowed to be distracted the whole entire rest of the day i can do whatever i want but during this time block i'm only allowed to be working sort of making this deal with yourself okay i work for two hours no distractions over the rest of the day i can reward myself by doing whatever this is one thing that you can do and then obviously to actually not be distracted you need to leave your phone away even one notification that you get you might think that the effect is minor but you look at your some message it sort of gets your brain out of the work so that then you have to go through the hump of getting started again and this sort of context switching is really costly and if you're just able to keep your brain focused on that one thing for a really long amount of time you'd be amazed like how much more you can actually achieve by work like this but maybe you can put like low fun music there's a lot of things that you can do i'm probably going to make a full video around the state of flow deep work and time blocking because using this technique has probably been the single thing that has helped me the most to get so much more done tip number three is to write things down our brains are generally very good at executing tasks but they're very bad at storing large amount of information that you need to be able to remember that's why for a very long time i've been using a to-do app to literally just write down all the things that i need to get done but i don't need to use my brain power to try to remember all the things that i need to get done after i use is simply just google tasks the basic one write down any tasks i need to get done and whenever i forget what i need to do next i can just go here okay today i need to edit my website video for example and i'll just i'll just do that essentially and so i can just use my brains to focus on getting the things done rather than trying to remember what i need to get done i don't need to stress about forgetting something important because i know that everything important is always going to just be there tip number four is a set artificial deadline does it sound familiar you have an essay due in one month and for the first 30 days of that month you do absolutely nothing and then just cram the whole essay in the last day the power of energy drinks and coffee you've definitely done that haven't you when something has to be done given a certain deadline us humans are very good at making sure we do actually get things done before that deadline but the thing is if the deadline is very far into the future they're very bad at just getting the things done way before the deadline and then not having to worry about it for the rest of the time instead work tends to sort of expand to fill the entire time frame that you have to do something but wouldn't it be nicer to just get things done faster so let's say even if you have to get something done in a month you could finish it tomorrow and then just not have to worry about it would be one less thing to stress about for the rest of the month wouldn't that be nice what you can do is impose artificial deadlines for yourself even if you don't have an actual deadline to get something done like i don't when i'm self teaching computer science or when you're self teaching anything but you can do is set these fake deadlines for yourself so that you act as if something needs to get done by a given deadline and preferably make the deadlines a bit tighter than you actually think that you can do that way you're creating urgency for yourself and your mind will be more likely to find a way to get things done early and leave you with a bunch of extra time free from the burden of having that project be still unfinished so despite all these sort of mechanical tricks or things that we can do to improve our productivity at the end of the day if you're not enjoying what you're doing it's going to be really difficult to sort of push yourself to do it and now sure you should have the discipline you should have the ability to do that but if like in the big picture the thing that you're trying to do is something that you absolutely hate maybe you should think about like is that thing that you're trying to achieve or do really what you want to be doing anyway let's say you've chosen a university degree that you absolutely hate is that really thing that you want to be doing maybe you should have chosen to do something else but regardless sure i recognize that sometimes you have to do things that you might not want to do look at that look at that giant icy thing is what finland is like anyway yeah i recognize that sometimes you have to do things that you might know what to do so why should you do that well one thing that you can do is try to sort of gamify the system and sort of create these like milestones that you are trying to achieve or sort of take it as a challenge let's say you're preparing for coding interviews and you don't particularly like grinding glee code just take it as a challenge take it as a game that you're trying to win you're trying to win this game of getting good at solving these coding problems for example i think most things can be made fun at least to some extent by just changing your mindset if you instead of thinking oh i have to do things try thinking just try thinking oh that i get to do this this is fun it's great that i am in a position where i'm able to do this let's say you're in university there are a lot of people in this world who wouldn't have the opportunity to do that at all just be sort of grateful for the opportunity to do these things sort of find the interesting and the fun parts about even the things that you might not think are that fun you'd be surprised how many things you can actually turn into something interesting but you actually try to make it interesting you try think as if the thing is interesting yeah just try to enjoy the process because if you're not enjoying the process what's the point anyway i hope these tips were helpful for you this is a part of a series where i talk about my favorite techniques to learn how to code faster if you want to learn more about this a great book that i've read recently is make it stick by karma bow the author is well put it right here it's like the best book on the actual science of learning the science of the best learning method and for now for learning to code specifically i made this video about my favorite method to really internalize very complicated coding and computer science and math concepts really fast a lot of people have been telling me that it's really really helpful for them i'm sure they'll be really helpful for you too
