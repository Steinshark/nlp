sometimes games are like magic which is amazing but also confusing how does that work that was cool that was actually the amazing thing about games is that they can make you experience something might seem completely impossible in the real world i think there's no better example for this than so-called non-euclidean games they seem to bend reality and it looks like they completely change the laws of nature you're familiar with in real life games like anti-chamber super liminal and even portals show with a mind-boggly experience games can deliver but what does that mean exactly let's start with your everyday euclidean by the way portal was like one of the greatest games of all time i love portal portal is just like so good it makes me just happy happy as can be geometry with that going too much into the math behind it portal top 10 game all time changed my mind you could think of euclidean geometry as a geometry they teach you in high school certain rules that apply here apply specifically to the euclidean worlds rules which likely seem completely logical to you to give you an idea of what we're talking about let's go over something someone says what about portal 2. the thing is you can't the genie was already out of the bottle by the time portal 2 came you know what i mean the thing is is that portal was a game in which i didn't even have like a state four in my brain but portal 2 i already had an expectation coming into it so when i played portal 1 it was incredible right these rules first we say the shortest possible line between two points is one without curvature you can see how introducing any curves in this line would make it longer so forgot about airplanes traveling to places around spheres dummy rule number one got em a straight line is the shortest line between two points next say that two parallel lines are at all times the same distance from each other no matter how far they stretch makes sense right we can stretch these lines damn it you know i i should have used that as an opportunity to promote flat earth theology because that would have been such a good time if lines if if we were on a sphere then a straight line wouldn't be the shortest distance between two points far as we want but they will always be the same this loser rule number two parallel lines are a constant distance from each other finally we're going to look at triangles a euclidean geometry we say that the angles and triangles always add out to exactly'0 degrees something you might still remember from school i do rule number three the angles and triangles always add up to'0 degrees keep in mind that in reality there are actually five rules called euclid's postulates which described i've been meaning to go get my postulate checked out by the way you know i've never done that i've just always been really kind of nervous to go to the doctor you know and do that but you know i'd like some point is at some point you got to do it for your health get your get your postulate exam going on it's just a requirement the euclidean worlds for now we can just focus on these few simplified rules okay now how would we recognize if we're in a world with non-euclidean geometry well we'd have to see if anything around us breaks the rules of euclidean geometry we know of but how is this possible how could two parallel lines ever cross or diverge or how could the shortest route between two points not be a straight line yeah well luckily the answer isn't very complex the most important observation is that the rules of euclidean geometry only apply to a flat world piece of paper as soon as we bend the paper or we try and draw our examples on a sphere our rules no longer apply you see that that's a really crappy sphere you know i'm not i'm not a math magician but i'm just saying that's a turn up okay i saw that in mario too you use them all the time you hold them above your head and you throw them okay look at the rules we set before no longer hold as soon as we introduce a curved space for example try connecting two points on the spear the shortest distance between those points is no longer a straight line or try looking at two parallel lines suddenly they start to get closer and closer together that's right what about our triangle rule well take a look at this suppose we take a ball and we wrap an elastic band around it north pole to south pole now taking the old north pole or south pole i've been there another elastic band and wrap it around the equator of the ball with a 90 degree angle to the first one finally take a third elastic band and wrap it around the ball in such a way that it's all orthogonal oh shoot that's 270 degrees like so the way we've done it all rubber bands make angles of 90 degrees with each other oh no however my life is ruined is that an xbox logo why is my life ruined oh no i oh no i've never once thought about this but i could just see the 270 stared me in the eyeballs right now if we look at one of the triangles we formed we could see that we make three 90 degree turns to form a single triangle this means the angles of our triangle now add up to 270 degrees instead of the'6 we had in euclidean space generally when we're talking about non-euclidean geometries we're talking about such curved spaces two possibilities are usually mentioned does that mean a triangle does that mean a triangle contains the space of somewhere between'0 and 270 depending on how big it is is that is that what happens nope okay i'm wrong no what does it mean can contain 360. oh shoot i'm too stupid for this that's how i feel right now hyperbolic and spherical space in hyperbolic space parallel lines diverge like we're drawing on a saddle shape and in spherical time in the saddle i know what he's talking about no space they get closer together a fantastic visual example for what hyperbolic and spherical spaces might look like are these great visualizations by twitter user xenorogue take a look at these snowballs and hyperbolic space notice how all the parallax we had a euclidean space is gone everything seems to come at us at the same speed regardless of distance and what about spherical space this seems even weirder where snowballs that are behind us look like they're in front of us again and everything seems to be moving back and forth either i'm gonna vomit or this ain't real life one of the two one of the two get dave from the dentist in here right now i got some questions cool for another fantastic explanation and the visualization of non-euclidean geometry check out this devlog of hyperbolica ew well as you can see things can become pretty trippy in non-euclidean worlds so what would non-euclidean worlds look like in games one of the best examples i found was this non-euclidean world demo where space is compressed and expanded based on the player's position to achieve this what is this like pre-doom graphics what am i looking at the demo uses a technique called ray tracing which yeah it's really upsetting to look at the basic principle is that you're shooting rays from the camera which simulate the way that light rays hits your eyes this means that you can build the environment around you completely using the race you shoot from the camera now imagine you can stretch or compress the length of these raised wheel and because the rendering of the world is completely dependent on these rays suddenly you can stretch and compress the world itself part of your world to have different effects on your rays achieve these strange non-euclidean effects where the space around you is morphed another great more recent example i mentioned earlier is hyperbolica shows you exactly what it would be like walking around a different kinds of non-euclidean worlds and is the best example of a non-euclidean game i could find to date to find out how that works it's best to go to their youtube hold on i'm recovering from vomiting i i oh my goodness why why is that thing a a golf ball stand i've seen in i i i've lived in non-euclidean space one time i drank a lot of lsd and uh i i saw a non-euclidean space once channel they have some great devlogs explaining the inner workings of their game as well as the theory behind it but most games you see with seemingly non-euclidean behavior achieve their effects in a different way what relying much more on clever tricks and a lot of smoke and mirrors to create the effects of impossible worlds in traditional game engines but that is precisely why game development is so interesting so let's take a deeper look at two popular non-euclidean games and uncover their secrets the first example most people think of when mentioning non-euclidean games is anti-chamber that's not surprising as the entire game is built around mind bending and counter-intuitive puzzles some of which even seem to define a logic of space itself well it's time to lift a bit of the curtain and see how it's done we'll start with the stairs illusion the puzzle goes like this you see two sets of stairs red and blue you pick one okay you walk down turn a corner and you see the same set of stairs okay so this time you think you got it and you pick the other staircase you walk down turn the corner and it's just multiple levels that's all that is dog there ain't nothing there ain't nothing going on here just standard multi-level platform here same thing neither staircase and you just walk back where you came from and the puzzle is solved i can tell you the first time i counted this my mind was blown how does this work how the rooms infinitely repeat and how did it do it so seamlessly if you're having similar questions then you're in luck because they're all about to be answered the way the hallways are constructed give something away about how the illusion works you have one room with the two sets of stairs and you have the hallway leading up to the stairs you're supposed to go back into okay both have two corners with a stretch of identical white hallway you see what actually happens is that when you turn the corner and walk far enough you're simply teleported to the identical looking hallway leading up to the stairs and because of the flat lighting of anti-chamber there's no way to tell when the teleport happens so do you it seems completely smooth however we can trick the game a bit into giving away its secrets you see we can take a cube with us to break the illusion of the identical hallways and now when we walk through the hallway we can see the exact moment we're teleported such teleporting tricks are riddled throughout the game sometimes with parts of the wall you need to focus on and sometimes they're combined with a window you can see through to see how that is done you can watch my video on how portals work because a similar technique is used here as you can see a lot can be done by cleverly teleporting a player and copy pasting rooms to give the illusion of a non-euclidean world another mind-blowing trick to me was this impossible you know i love the idea of this game this game looks absolutely incredible but i'm not gonna i'm not gonna lie to you the touching wall simulator game i don't know how much i want to solve those puzzles you know what i mean i'm not sure if i want to just go touch walls for a while it's kind of like tarkov you know i i don't really want to just do looting simulator followed by uh spreadsheet management simulator right like i want something a little bit more don't touch grass touch walls i need something a little bit more in there i mean this this is super cool but it's a little cube in the museum i don't know if i on every side you see in completely different scene but how is it possible it looks like multiple scenes exist in the same space isn't that just like well camera the trick is very simple but it does require some knowledge beforehand you see the graphics card isn't that just how shame is it shame please go is it shame i can't spell either that's fine uh copying my joke wait which joke can you just render different things how do magnets work how do magnets work starting your computer gives us a little buffer which can mask and discard pixels on our screen oh usually this buffer is used to mask out parts of our screen with stencils therefore this buffer is called the stencil buffer what can we use it for well think for example of rendering a rear view mirror in a game you don't want to draw the entire rear view of the car on top of the frontal view you just want to draw it in this tiny rectangular mirror for this we can define a stencil using that the rear view will only that looks like such a shitty game that they're playing right now this game looks awful you're like driving all slow this t-rex clearly should catch up to you and yet here you are you're not even getting away from it be rendered in parts that overlap with the stencil pretty handy developers always like to abuse the time are you provide it with which is running into things so often what is this you see the stencil buffer can have multiple channels to illustrate let's say we have a red channel a blue channel and a green channel a stencil assigned to the red channel will only render objects assigned to that same red channel so if we look through a panel with that stencil buffer we'll only be able to see objects in the red channel all right now we create two more of these panels one for blue and one for the green channel and if we stick these panels around the cube and place our objects inside you can see the illusion unfolds multiple rooms within the same space wow it's like magic wow i agree this is magic to me i mean to me this is sufficiently magic but still wow another game that blew people's minds was super liminal especially their forced perspective mechanic the idea is that you pick up objects and while their perspective size remains the same their real size changes dramatically oh yeah so objects that appear really big i want to play that pretty cool so how does it work well this is everything to do with the angular diameter i want to play that or not the words the apparent size of an object in your view trick is to keep this angular diameter the same regardless of the distance to an object so how does it work well if we look at the formula we can see the angular diameter is determined why is the answer always arctan why is it always arctan two variables diameter and distance obviously give it the big d twice the little d ones everybody knows that the skill of an object always scales together with this distance to us so if the distance is twice as far we just make the skill twice as big and if the distance is halved then make the skill half the size this ensures our object always stays the same size in our field of view now the way we get our force perspective effect is like this as soon as we pick up an object remember the distance and scale somewhere now when we move the object around we simply push the object we're holding as far against the wall as possible while keeping its apparent size the same if we remember the starting size and distance all we need to do now is check how far the object is and compare that to our starting distance ratio between the current distance and the starting distance is how much we should scale our object and voila we have our mind-boggling force perspective mechanic now are these games really non-euclidean well yes and no on the one hand you only need to break one of the euclidean rules to be considered non-euclidean but on the other hand they have little to do with real non-euclidean geometry their effects are all achieved with deceit and trickery but in the end aren't all games like that i think they still give you the same sense of amazement and confusion as real non-euclidean geometry with just some clever applications of a few simple tricks and in the end that's what i like most about it the simplicity of it the programming behind it is based on some pretty simple principles and yet developers managed to create these mind-blowing experiences with it to me that is the most beautiful thing about game development it's almost like you have to make the object bigger you don't have to be incredibly smart or talented to be able to create these wonderful things sometimes all it takes is some creativity some insight or a flare of inspiration to craft something that will blow people away and i strongly believe that can happen to anyone all you need is a love to create and a passion to learn so keep creating and keep learning everyone and if you've come this far you can at least say that you're already a bit wiser [music] that cheese was so cool that cheese i okay you know what you know i just center i just sent her text and divs okay i just sent her text and divs i uh like the video subscribe i'm i just touched some divs you know what i mean all about that div touching both hands on the divs every day you know what i mean centering text and div still makes more money than bending space and time it's a fact of life somehow that is true you work less hours and make more money touching divs than you do bending space and time why is that it's unfair that's what it is it is unfair it is just simply unfair the name div touch a gen
