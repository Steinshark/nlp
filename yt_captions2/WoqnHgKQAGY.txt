ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the candidates 2024 this is the biggest chess event of the year and the winner of this event will play for the world chess championship later on in 2024 this is round number six going into this round we have a very close race at the top of the men's and the women's standings and one player tournament in particular after today is all but over decisive results left and right very dramatic day and once again thank you so much for joining me i appreciate you all very very much these recaps have gotten up to 500,000 views so if you have a friend that played chess over the last few years send the uh send them these videos i really would appreciate it get them to tune in uh to the biggest chess event of the year outside of the world chess championship and uh here we go first game we are going to kick things off as always we do with hikaru uh gukesh versus nakamura this is a very close match karo yesterday with a very big win with black gets another game with black normally you are alternating but uh he gets another game with black and he has to play gukesh gukesh is in first place and gukesh opens with e4 and yesterday hikaru played e5 but today he plays the sicilian defense hikaru is ready for a fight he plays the most combative opening with the blank pieces because he wants to win because gukesh is in first place i mean you got to love this stuff gukesh plays knight f3 and now karu doesn't play knight c6 he doesn't play d6 he doesn't play e6 doesn't play any of the main he plays g6 which is known as the hyper accelerated dragon yes that is his name if you want to play the dragon generally what you do is you play knight f6 knight c3 and then g6 this has been known historically as the dragon variation but modern day analysis has shown black has certain problems in this opening well black might have some problems in the g6 setup as well but hikaro plays this played this before in major top events but it is not very popular and gukesh plays c3 you'll also notice gukesh spent about a minute and a half like he could have played d4 but he opts for c3 this seems to be the opening that he would like to play because he probably prepared c5 g6 on the side of hikaru this is much more solid and also this might remind you of the alipin the alipin sicilian with c3 a little bit less boring not letting hikaru get the kind of position that he might wants and now karo plays this move d5 and the idea of this is to put the queen into the center because white has now taken away that square for his knight kash plays e5 so he says no trade and actually karu has had this position october 2023 in a tournament at the aisle of man against andre yeno when he played the move a6 this time karo plays bishop g4 and that gets gukesh to spend six minutes so by the fourth move of the game i mean talk about good preparation four moves is all it took to get gkes out of his prep now the thing is in chess you can get somebody out of their prep they still have an hour and 57 minutes to play the best moves and ges is really really strong so he plays bishop to b5 which just so happens to be the best move bishop to b5 hikaro develops the knight and now gcz just plays very very very principled he just takes the knight he just gets rid of the knight so he alleviates the pressure on his center and then he just castles and what he's expecting here in all likelihood is a move like bishop to g7 at which point he will get a big center then he will kick out hikaru's bishop and be very happy but hikaru plays c4 which is a move that has literally never been played so karu shows up has a very interesting opening idea and uh he surprises gukesh who spends another 10 minutes so by the eighth move of the game hikaru is up 20 minutes on the clock with the black pieces he's playing in a very very very provocative way in fact after a move like b3 the engine is already saying that black has f6 immediately confronting in the center if you take like this black will go here and try to push for e4 this is nuts i mean hikaru is taking monumental risk and the tournament is not even halfway over he is playing in a very very very aggressive way with black but kukesh kind of stops a lot of it he plays d3 gets his queen out very comfortably and now the best way for black to play is to take the knight which hikaru does bishop g7 attacking the pawn and gkz just doesn't even doesn't create any weaknesses rook e one very solid hikaru plays e6 with the intention to play knight to e7 and you will notice hikaru spent some 20 minutes on the move queen c7 that means that both players are now out of their prep gkes here playing a very very nice move understanding that black either has to play f6 probably not right now cuz that loses everything or something on this side of the board and he just plays this accurate move b4 a very nice idea taking some space not letting hikaru mobilize and uh despite hikaru's best efforts it's going to be a very tall task to to win this game let alone even get a decent position to try to play for a win gukesh expanding on the queen side with a move like c4 uh hikaru castling maintaining the tension and now the only way you're going to battle here is over here because if again if you play f6 i take and that is not where you want to do battle so karo plays a5 they have a little bit of tension but very quickly we have a trade we have a trade of rooks hikaro trades a pawn and brings out the knight to trade the knights and essentially it's 1 2 3 4 versus 1 2 3 4 these pawns cancel out white has a tiny bit more space but it's kind of meaningless and you know i got to tell you this was a really really really good attempt by hikaru to cause trouble like that is what he tried to do in this game but gukesh was up to the task and he played quite accurately and even here it's probably black black who is playing for a win because black has five pawns on the opposite color complex of his bishop which is very important in the end game because your light squares are are under control and your dark score bishop will target your opponent in fact gukesh has a pretty bad structure all things considered like the fascinating thing about this end game is that like if you do something like this you just get a really bad position with white so you you do have to be a little careful but gcash is a very experienced player and hikaro might have had a tiny bit of chance but it they just trade all the pieces and they make a draw but hikaru did his part hikaru listen i got to tell you hikaru showed up and he tried to get it really complicated i mean you got to give the man props but chess is hard you give a guy 10 minutes like gesh to kind of solve the problems of his opening he doesn't fall into any of the opening traps like he doesn't you know he doesn't accidentally mess up his position get something no he just he played very solidly he he kind of got into a a relatively straightforward position it was tense for a little while and gcash has four points out of six and karo has three points out of six they make a draw now one of these two gentlemen is about to really regret qualifying for this tournament ali resa fuja and vidit krati now some of you have been telling me and i get these comments a lot during these events chess.com saves people's names as their last name and then their first name and i'm just going to put vided gti so his name does not cut off now the w the the the the thing about names chinese names are written the way you and i would say like in reverse so actually the first name is written first i don't know about names from indian chess players because this is how they're saved by default like if you look at the online databases it's not gti vidit it's vided gudi so i would be very curious to know actually for those qualified to tell me as opposed to you know standard 12-year-old youtube comments just writing levy never fails to do random things i actually don't know but this is i'm not doing that it is autop populating like that so he's vidit k goodra um both of these guys have had weird events ali resa has lost a big a couple of big games vd it lost two games in a row blew a completely winning position but he shows up again and he plays e4 and just like hikaru just like hikaru the you know nobody's playing e5 nobody's trying to kill the game we're trying to have a fight knight f3 open sicilian ali resa plays d6 hikaro played g6 we have this and after five moves we do not have a nider of sicilian but we have a classical this is called the classical ilan defense very very popular very very good and um here the main line is bishop g5 this is known as thea variation but instead we have the second most common move which is bishop c4 fine completely normal move targeting this putting the bishop back on b3 maybe and deciding which way we're going to castle ali resa plays a very provocative move plays queen b6 um i just realized there is no time stamps something went wrong wrong when importing this game uh well i will tell you what happens on their clock but every other game has time stamps uh the clock did not play a big role in this game it it really didn't uh so i will just let you know queen b6 targets the knight the knight goes to b3 and black plays e6 now what black likes to do in a classical sicilian bishop goes to e7 bishop goes to d7 a6 and black sometimes strikes on the c file it's very very provocative it's it's kind of like keeping the pawns back for a little bit and then b you know like you're just weaving you you got a little weaknesses you know and then like that's it that's that's that's what we do um sorry neighbors um so bishop f4 now important bishop f4 is not the most popular move it is much more common for white to play other moves but bishop to f4 induces knight to e5 and after knight to e5 white goes here and then black frequently will play something like a6 and bishop bishop attacks the queen and then queen c7 f4 here take take queen f3 this has been played many many times however after bishop f4 ali resa barely spent any time here and played queen undevelop back to d8 this move has been played like five times this position knight e5 has been played 800 times this has been played five times this is ali r's prep he is taking vidit away from known territory vidit spent quite a lot of time here and just played a regular developing move queen d2 and then was going to go castle oliv resa plays a6 because it's very common in the in the sicilian and now this nice interesting move a3 useful move it's it's basically trying to fight for the b4 square it's kind of like the point like if you had castled and b5 bishop d3 has to protect the pawn maybe i'm going to go b4 so he says you know what a3 and ali resa plays b5 and the bishop goes back and now black has to go knight e5 this is the final moment you have to go knight e5 you have to go knight c4 because if you don't you're losing aliv resa loses this game in 11 moves why i don't understand he can no longer go knight e5 because knight takes b5 is winning for white that is the point you gave white too much development if you don't develop enough pieces and your opponent does he has the right of first attack and knight takes b5 is lethal knight takes b5 a takes b5 bishop takes not quite because the bishop blocks so what you do is you take the knight first and you're completely winning because after this this is over king e7 this is made it's just made queen d6 it's just checkmate ali resa fua blunders his move order and is completely lost long castles he goes queen b6 and it goes from bad to worse because here he's worse he's not completely lost but he's worse you'll notice the queen went there and then there and then back and then now ali rza just decides you know ali rza goes out like korean zombie if you watch that fight against max holloway if you don't watch mixed martial arts you don't know what i'm talking about he just decided he's just going to go for it he's going to swing as hard as possible and if he lands a shot on vid he didn't actually get up and punch him but he did the equivalent he takes the pawn at f two black has played 13 moves one two three and four have been with the queen and he has not gotten de veloped and vid just pops him straight back down the pipe just e5 when your opponent's king is on the other side and hasn't castled you can shred open the position aliv resa goes back you may be wondering why he didn't capture because then the queen is basically stuck the queen has to hang out over here let's say it goes to h4 bishop g5 let's say the queen comes back something like rook f1 knight to e4 and queen to d7 i mean and you just you you can take on f6 it's just a completely winning attack down the down the file uh e5 knight d7 vidit takes and then vidit bulldozes the queen side queen d4 queen a7 what a move alira had maybe one or two chances but look watch this beauty bishop a7 that is a savage move now the bishop is targeted the king is still in the center b5 is hanging and it takes vid gudra an astounding number of moves in this game yes the rest of this was most mostly conversion he slowly cleans it up he doesn't get mated he has a pass pawn and um was actually i don't even remember the game going this long which is kind of funny okay 40 moves 40 moves and the reason it took it it went to the 40th move uh is because right around here vidit had about 19 minutes so vidit had 19 minutes to make 19 moves and we know that he's gotten into time trouble before but this position was so dominant and vidit stayed focused he was up two pawns al resa did his best but sometimes the hole is just insurmountable like you he got to castle but vidit stayed cool calm and collected picked up material and just simplified and you just can't lose this vidit with three out of six he's now on 50% uh and um yeah i mean you it doesn't get better than that i mean he's tied with hikaru he's a point out of first it's incredible what a huge win for him and ali resua has one and a half out of six you yeah that's shocking that is ab i mean it's a shock and there was a chance it happened because in the last candidates he was in last place for a a big chunk of the first half uh and he ended up getting second or third to last and it was very close but um yeah wild uh nothing was peaceful today uh on the women's side as well yesterday they made four draws uh not today and uh i will take you through a couple of the games uh ling j and and humpy i i'm a little all over the place in this recap like the they don't have the points here anyway then we will come back uh and we will cover uh fabiano versus uh nepo that was a fascinating game and then prague versus n let's all take a little snack break hey we're 16 minutes into this video roughly the average watch time of these candidates recaps is almost 20 minutes which is incredible like the fact that people even have it so give yourself a pat on the back and make it to nearly the 20-minute mark today all right i guess i won't even put it i won't put any ads between minute 15 and minute 20 how about that we have a little agreement between us um all right vali versus katarina lagno this one was a spanish it was a mainline spanish this position has been reached many many many times and the move d5 is important black does not move the d pawn black gives the d pawn right away up on the d5 square uh if if black had gone to d6 it was the traditional but this is known as the marshall and it is one of the most complic at and explored openings and chess and you give up the pawn on e5 but vali doesn't take it so normally what people do nowadays is they play things like a4 which is called the anti- marshal but she plays the marshall but she doesn't play the marshall she plays the marshall and then kind of doesn't play the marshall katerina plays bishop to b7 insisting the pawn on e5 is taken for free vali says no thank you she's just not taking the pawn and the reason she's not is because black is going to get get a lot of active counterplay and it's quite well known that it's scary for white now vy plays a5 a nice idea disconnecting the pawns disallowing knight a5 disallowing knight b6 and basically just putting karina under pressure who plays king h8 after spending 10 minutes king h8 gets the king off the diagonal and prepares potential attacking chess vali plays d4 both players out of prep we have takes takes we have takes takes and that series of exchanges opened up the e file left white with an isolated pawn and gave vip access to the b4 square which black promptly takes over it's a very tense position both sides have their trumps they have their benefits c5 is a nice idea from um from katarina and now all the center pawns have faded like all c through b through uh e completely gone no pawns that's made but it seems like the players are just going to start trading knight to f4 played nice idea leaving the knight hanging you can't take the knight because after bishop f3 white's king is a little bit too open but take and she must have just overthought the situation black's position like look it looks very scary i ab you know i completely agree knight bd2 this is actually still playable because black plays knight to d3 but the best move after knight f4 is rook e3 queen d1 looks really scary but you can actually just block now don't get me wrong it looks terrifying but vali takes the bait and after bishop f3 and queen d4 she is completely lost like the game flips immediately and lno just plays knight d3 and and white just cannot defend all the threats we have this knight before and there's still a fork at the very end and when the dust settles lagno is just totally winning she's completely winning bishop d5 and white resigns because the bishop is going to be traded the pawn is going to be hunted down and uh yes you could play this out like if you're playing this you should play this out but at the candidates level this is um yeah this is just a win for uh a for black and a very nice one i mean she won a very nice game she played this kind of marshall concept and uh a tough game for vali she clearly came with some sort of opening idea it got complicated and she made one mistake and sometimes one mistake is that's literally it she's on two and a half out of six katrina on three and a half and she's doing very very well leting j going into today had um two points she has not been having a good tournament these are the standings after five rounds and humpy is um it also has two points so they are actually tied for last which is kind of nuts because they're both 2550 gms but that's the candidates i mean that's just sort of how it goes sometimes and they both wanted to win this game and they both showed up and they went straight for a kings indian defense which like if you're going to be playing the kings indian defense of the candidates hold on tight because it's going to be crazy e5 castles all of this has been played before king h1 now black uh is going to go for this f5 idea both knights get out of the way knight d3 f5 f4 striking right back now humpy as you can see with this kind of 10 minutes uh spent a little bit less comfortable we see lei playing quite confidently plays h6 to play g5 and humpy plays c5 giving up a pawn to try to take the center lay opens the position this is not what we normally see in a kings indian what you normally see in a kings indian is something like f3 f4 g5 h5 blah and then and it's like a pawn race and it's insane we're not seeing that we're seeing a position that actually looks extremely open right so both players a all the lines are open knight e5 now we have a trade de and inbalance has been created white has been granted a pass pawn she pushes it black defends knight comes into c5 it's it's a really nasty position i have to say both sides look like they could win at any moment the knight comes back and leia is defending herself with her bishops all right white is very solid in the center very strong pawn both players time is ticking humpy down to 4 minutes to make 14 moves and she plays knight e3 starts trading we look like we're headed for an easy end game but the pawn has fallen now white does get that pawn queen f6 humpy has a minute humpy's going to lose the game on time unless she plays every move instantly queen f2 they do have bonus time by the way it's a different time control don't ask me why i think that's what the players decided e4 knight f5 and here black can just very easily trade and make a draw but she says no draw she wants to continue to post problems humpy has three moves to make she makes the 40th move she gets her extra time but she's losing knight to b5 white needed to play not c4 inviting in the knight white actually needed to go knight to g3 lose the knight get this pawn back lose this and try to defend this end game like this which is like i it's like impossible to do as a human being but the point is you will have time to run your king that's just the point you have a two-on-one you're gonna run your king the way humpy did it she did this but now black just runs the pawn and believe it or not out of nowhere leting yeah pawn is on 82 and it's over i mean the game is just over you just lose like out of nowhere you play a back and forth game this is the end game you you you know right but but humpy just didn't leave enough time on the clock she just didn't and then the the black knight strolls around and that's it and like she grabbed the pawn and just out of nowhere it was uh ling getting her first win of this candidates tournament knight a3 c4 coming whites defenses are just completely falling apart also you can just queen and obviously win the night but oh my goodness i'm allergic to end games and uh l on the board she has three out of six she's back to 50% uh nepo and fabby i mean you talk about a matchup of the big boys i don't know what their weight is but um i uh yeah uh first place yan ponesi tied with gukesh fabiano half a point out yesterday both survived a hurricane all right where they were running around naked like in the middle of a field about to get struck by lightning uh today we have e4 e5 knight f3 knight c6 and as we have seen we have essayed the spanish we have essayed the italian we've essayed the ponan no just kidding that is not going to be seen at the candidates there are way too many easy lines there that simply hold everything and um you may be shocked that in this position yan she basically offered a draw and move three played knight c3 uh if you want to kill the game in chess you play knight c3 like if nepo wanted to win this game he would have went for the italian or he would have went for the spanish because that's where all the cutting edge theory is yan plays knight c3 knight f6 the four knights completely playable at beginner and intermediate level at the high level takes takes bishop b4 takes takes bishop d3 d5 takes castles castles black here can just play cd but fabby actually had a position of cd on the board versus hikaru he had a very similar line and hikaru played some weird sideline and this instead of that hikaru uh in this game fabiano plays bishop g4 not the most popular move but it puts white under pressure and you see the engine on a low depth thinks that you know there's some sort of advantage bishop h5 comes back and uh yeah you they played a lot of theory nepo here thought a little while there was a check queen e5 rook e1 you cannot take the knight because bishop h7 uh knight e7 and then you know we trade we trade the queens and uh we make a draw i hadn't even checked in on this game and the players had already you know just traded all the pawns and this is just a uh a dead draw and they barely spent any time they spent less than 20 minutes each nepo spent 15 minutes on the game they didn't want to play uh well you know maybe fabby wanted to play but the thing is an easy draw with black you take it all the time in the candidates i think yan i don't know maybe he didn't expect knight c6 maybe he didn't expect uh e5 maybe he thought you know i i don't know but it's like a little bit of a bonus res day you get half a point you keep moving forward yan tends to time these draws very well i mean like i said 30 uh at this point uh 144 so he's at like 34 candidates games where he's letter been tied for first all right but the rest of the games weren't like that and um actually important this game i started recording the recap right before uh this game actually concluded believe it or not um and uh i'm going to fill in the couple i i wasn't intending to it's a today's recap has been a little bit goofy uh and garin's name is so brwc it it it also cuts off the screen i mean i gota all right anyway uh nurul salimova international master from bulgaria gachina alexandra grandmas 2600 we have a catalan we have a main line of a catalan we have dc a6 trying to play b5 to meet white's queen oh and then we have two more epic games uh just in case every recap has been about 30 minutes you know the drill bishop g5 all of this has been played some million times rook c1 and white just tries to put nagging pressure on black in this position position bishop d5 played by gacha we have takes e d queen b3 and you just look at this position you go wow i mean white has got some nice things going on here which he must capitalize by playing e4 you have to play e4 here putting pressure on this diagonal if you don't play something else like she did in the game she played bishop h3 suddenly black is better what like you get all of this and then you know e4 would have been kind of the next natural approach she puts the bishop how can you even blame white for doing this but suddenly white doesn't have a target and the plan n chooses in this game to kind of put the knight on c5 that is not the best plan gka puts everything on a light square and then uhoh uhoh uhoh this is not supposed to happen you realize white accomplished like nothing you go back to here it's the same position look at white's pawn structure over the next 10 moves nothing happens white is just unable to make any progress she had a moment and now suddenly she's under a massive attack and these two played in the world cup final gkaa definitely sens that she had the upper hand against her opponent we go into an end game and it is uh it is black who is calling the shots here white has good drawing chances nurul is fighting back but watch as gachina just just plays like a python i mean she just suffocates her opponent she walks the king to the center puts the knight on h5 and look at this look at that's mate rook takes king f7 this is a checkmate on the board rook g2 and now an absolutely brutal technique you just push the pawn white cannot move you cannot escape this whirpool c4 bishop e2 rook d2 and even here resignation was possible but the game ended rook h6 check king e7 rook h7 king d6 rook h6 the king walked out of the checks to c5 rook h5 c3 rook f5 c2 it could have ended in a variety of ways you could have played rook h6 king e7 and put the rook on c6 as well the pawn still would have went to c3 white has no moves you can't move the bishop you cannot move any pawn you cannot move the king because you lose the bishop i mean you literally have five pieces which cannot move this is a brutal game from gach and a very big win for her she now has four points which is incredible uh and another big winner of the day was a winner in this game we have two we have a tale of two tournaments we have a tale of tanong taking all the chances that she has been getting and making for herself and amuzu chuk who has missed three chances to win a game which is crazy uh and in this game we had a we had a sideline of a d4 we didn't have like a queen queens pawn we had a kali system all right bishop uh coming to b2 bishop b7 this is like the chess from like the 1920s i think tan e just trying to take her opponent out of her comfort zone and just goes for queen g4 just come and straight for her opponent nice idea here b4 restricting the queen side black strikes back with a5 and now knight f3 and the queen is an attacker but it's also a defender anna castles she says you know what you want to go attack me go ahead tanang says i will let me make a couple of preparatory moves and now h4 and this is the difference of having three and a half out of five and being in first place and having two out of five and being tied for six seventh and eighth it's like tanong is just confident she's flowing like water rook a4 she gives the pawn up she doesn't even she does not care the rook is arriving in attacking the queen because now the center is locked and she is just going to pound away on g6 g5 play 23 minutes spent on that move and just bishop c3 she's going to ask the rook to move another pawn comes to the attack and fg is an idea but so is f5 f6 and f5 fe and within the next few moves tandi has a dom minent attack she had an even better move here she could have played ftes g5 but she goes here and black just doesn't have the sufficient time to defend herself she's not even losing if you look at the engine but practically speaking look at this how on earth do you deal with all of this you do your best but then white sacrifices the bishop like the terminator walking into the position knight c6 and it's still not completely lost but queen g5 is beautiful and the bishop from the corner queen g7 rook g8 takes what a move what a move she sacrifices her queen because if it's taken rook f8 and she gets it back because of the discovered attack so bishop f6 here and believe it or not it is still not lost believe it or not this end game this game bishop e6 and musuk is holding she's holding the game because there is no way to get mated but she plays rook e four and that loses because of knight g8 queen f5 and not even queen f5 the absolutely brutal move queen f7 check which forces black to trade and the pawn cannot be stopped and tanong y has four and a half out of six she is playing chess like the freaking terminator it is absolutely crazy like the freaking terminator and this game is our last game of the day prague is going to try to put some pressure on his opponent opponent who is struggling all right he is struggling he is the lowest seated player right at 2630 and i said before that this was probably going to happen i called this i also said abasov is going to have a really tough time once the white games are over he is now playing with the black pieces and uh we are going to see if he can survive or if somebody will maybe overextend against them so we have d4 d5 we have this abos of plays a very solid line a very reputable very good line and uh this line has been played many many times we also saw this in a ges game earlier in the event i think was it ges versus f i can't even remember at this point so many games have been played but this is maybe it was abasov actually ab bosov who played like this but this is uh this is a very very stubborn and a very annoying line and what prague does is he plays c5 and he plays c5 just for this he just wants imbalance two on one it's all you need as a good player you don't want a position of complete symmetry b4 knight a4 castles castles and now he's going to go to work and we don't have to wait very long to go to work because first prag gives up the bishop for the knight okay now we have the knight coming to f5 f uh fabby prague is giving up the next bishop now now abasov rips open the center of the board we have takes takes the rook is coming and you see you see by the way prague working on that imbalance right he's working on a and b we have d4 very complex game the bishop goes to g5 the position is about to explode g4 my man prague is like bro i got to beat you i'm sorry i'm 115 points higher rated all right h6 the the queen goes to the center giving up the bishop to take the knight now it's horses versus bishops rook a7 giving up the pawn in the center of the board proc is up a pawn but the pawn comes here you cannot take it because it's protecting the rook because then bishop c5 so instead you have to move the knight now i take the pawn near your king with a check oh my god now i bring the queen now we trade the queens now it's knights versus bishops and four pawns each bishop b8 a mistake it was better to keep the bishop around here and be active now prague is pushing the pace but prague has 13 minutes to make nine moves rook c7 and actually here after bishop f4 it would have been better for prag to go rook h1 but he goes here and here the advantage is still hanging very much in the balance it's super complic at the pawns are having a staring contest prague doesn't want to take because if he takes he brings the king and this pawn into the game abasa doesn't want to take because he doesn't want to open up his king and now abasa plays this ridiculous move g5 it's actually the best move by the engine it's evaluated as a very decent move and suddenly prague has no advantage anymore in this position what it was even better for abasa to play king h7 and come here it's very complicated however when i say no advantage is because the engine you know the eval bar say it's back to equal but in reality again practically speaking these pawns are much more ready to run than these guys and so prague trades the rooks and he plays rook a8 and in this position abasov has to avoid tak this pawn is meaningless what's meaningful in this position is to get here so that if white starts pushing g3 is well timed the knight would come back the rook would stop the pawns and in this position black is in time to create counterplay so abasov has to decide does he eat or does he come down to the second rank and he chooses the wrong way and this is this is how abasov is going to lose he's just going to lose late in the game critical decisions he's an incredible player but these guys are 2750 for a reason rook a6 and a boss of this is by the way a brilliant move by prague knight d7 disallowing any access to f6 protecting the b8 square for the promo and now the rooks get stuck in a staring contest this rook is trapped and prague plays a4 and that's it he's going to take and advance he completely ignores everything abasov is doing and he plays pawn to a6 and if the bishop comes down the knight will come back seal the door shut and prague wins what a big game kukes ties for first vidit and prague with massive wins for india and uh these are your overall standings the women side is still a two-horse race i would say we have gachin and we have tanong but lagno right there so it's really it's really close the men's candidates is a six-horse race six guys are separated by one point anything can happen but abasov was always destined to have a tough tournament ali resa on one and a half is a complete shock ali rza could go absolutely ballistic now and just play every game for a win but i have no idea if it's going i mean that is a shocking turn of events i will see you all for round number seven get out of here
