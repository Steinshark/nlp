ladies and gentlemen i'm sorry i'm sorry because i probably named this video something extremely ridiculous and i would like to stop my apology right there because i'm going to make it up to you you are about to witness one of the most incredible chess games you have ever seen in your life in fact for some of you this might be the best chess game you have ever seen in your life that's all i have to say this game happened a couple of days ago here in may 2024 it happened at the charer masters a very very strong chess tournament and i actually made a video about this same tournament a couple of days ago and i misspoke in that video and i sounded like an idiot i said the charer masters is also played in dubai and what i meant to say is the charer masters is also played in the united arab emirates because right now there is a series of tournaments going on in the united arab emirates the uae this game was sensational sit back relax i highly recommend watching this game sometimes you put on the video and you just you know run errands around the house i would recommend watching this game just give me like 15 20 minutes this thing is going to brighten your day okay our two players involved are vladimir fv formerly representing russia now slovenia and salem salem the pride and joy of chess in uae i mean he is the arabic falcon uh he is uh he is incredibly strong always brings very enterprising and interesting chess and when you got a banger like this sometimes when you have two people who play each other or fight each other and they have matching complicated styles you get something very boring not today vladimir opened up with d4 and you don't have to look very far in this game to get excitement because after knight f6 c4 g6 already salem is playing something that is not very popular nowadays nowadays people with black are too scared to put the bishop on g7 and enter either the kings indian defense with d6 or the grunfeld with d5 at the high level of chz the meta is for black to play simple solid chess with knight f6 e6 looking for queen's gambit decline type of setups g6 is already very interesting fv doesn't wait he plays h4 i mean this is a warning shot like this is you know i'm watching a lot of the nhl right now hockey playoffs extremely exciting go rangers barely beat the hurricanes we'll see if we can make a run to the stanley cup in hockey teams send each other messages like in baseball i know very american if you throw the ball at someone you're going to get in trouble in hockey you could slam someone into the boards and laugh at their family members sitting there and it's kind of accepted this is a warning shot being sent to salam like if you just keep playing your opening i'm going to go h5 we're going to open things up over here and then we're going to destroy you so now salam has to make some sort of decision and in this position he opts for d6 not the most common move order but it is what it is now we go knight c3 back so now we have forced salem to play a kings indian defense we don't know what salm wanted to play maybe salm was going to play a grunfeld and by going here we have now forced him to play a kings indian defense knight c3 and now in instead of just developing naturally with bishop g7 he he plays knight bd7 okay and now he's preparing to push a pawn into the center like that this is one of many many many options in this opening here fv instead of playing e4 which is the most common move he plays queen c2 and as early as the fifth move of the game fifth five moves have been played there are a grand total of zero games and the in the master level database obviously this is very rare this is a pretty rare move order but the way that fedf chooses to play this with queen c2 nobody plays like this most people play e4 very quickly and black puts a pawn on e5 instead of c5 so the way this has been played resembles other openings but nobody has ever played the specific way that's very hard in five moves to leave known territory to this extent so now instead of of just developing normally again bishop to g7 and castles resembling other positions salm plays a6 and he has a very clear idea the idea of a6 i mean he can't play b5 because white can and now now not only can he not play b5 white completely controls b5 plays b5 plays b5 anyway why because this concept of losing a pawn on the queen side comes straight out of the bango gam in the b gambit black plays b5 and gives up two pawns and gets one of them back but he gives them up now again if you look at the structure it's not exactly the same but as you can see there my arrows indicate you are going to be taking two pawns so b5 so salem plays this in a way that resembles another opening he's gambiing a pawn he's playing a gambit if you want an interesting and exciting game you got to take some risk cb he doesn't take back he plays bishop g7 he's allowing fedf to attack him with h5 he's also allowing ff to take him on a6 now f here plays b8 he does in fact oblige he says look this is probably the best move now the crazy part is it's not this very natural capture on a6 is incorrect because the way white has played this white does not play h4 in the b gambit in the bko gambit in this position yes you can take both pawns and then let's say black plays you know i'm playing completely normal stuff white in the banko gambit does not waste time on queen c2 and h4 so the inclusion of those two moves compared to the game that we have now is wrong and that is why the computer doesn't like it for white and now after castles vladimir here plays h5 he decides i'm committed i mean i i played h4 like why would i play h4 if i'm not going to play h5 he just gives up the pawn completely completely gives away the pawn now if you take it with the g pawn you're a really bad chess player because you double your pawns you create just easy weaknesses but knight h5 is the real question and now the question is will he sacrifice the rook it's good for the memes but not in this particular position i mean you you don't there's no followup you don't even get the queen to take the pawn cuz you move the queen over here so the idea of h5 is really simple he's just giving up a pawn to have the open rook on the h file but when fed of plays h4 h5 he's not going to castle i mean and and his next move is really going to prove he's not going to castle because in this position he plays g4 he plays g4 attacking the knight again and forcing the knight backwards so at this point salem what salm is doing is he's covering up and he's trying to he's trying to move out of the way he's rolling with the punches he's trying right and fed sa just got him up against the r ropes he's digging the hook he's he's he's going up top he's throwing the uppercut he's looking for the knockout look at this g5 marching him down the board and the idea of g4 g5 is to take squares away but at the same time the other idea would be to play f4 bring the queen over and my man fet would look like leonardo da vinci with the way he has created this this this contraption and i mean he's just boom he's just going down the h file but salm plays knight h5 the idea of knight h5 is very straight forward right block the rook but what's the plan after bishop to e2 you can't move the knight anymore and now you're going to lose that knight and you're going to get mated well salm had the whole thing worked out now he goes bishop a6 and now he basically tells white look remember how gotham says in the bano gambit you're going to trade the light scored bishops and that's going to be good i don't know how he knew i was going to make a video about this game or what i would say but the point is in the banko frequently these bishops trade for each other other if you go and take the knight which is what fed have did in this game yes you get an attack but black as the light scored bishop fetv is playing very aggressively if fv does not checkmate the arabic falcon he is going to have long-term problems and complications with the position plays f4 the position's still relatively in the balance you got to remember this over here the the engine is the phd student in a classroom of toddlers all right its evaluation doesn't mean much because if you give white a couple of moves white will generate a very powerful attack but salem is an experienced veteran grandmaster and he knows when you are being attacked on the flank you should strike back in the center unless it like hangs a queen strike back in the center opening up some pieces e file looking nice very tough position but fv brings another piece to the party he does not take opening up his opponent's position he prefers to be taken and get a knight into the game and then maybe trade this dark squared bishop and then maybe get the rook and the knight over here so knight e2 now salem brings the heavy hitter thanks for 12 minutes plays queen e8 with a very clear idea to open up the position you may be wondering why didn't he go queen e7 i'm wondering the same i think he didn't like ver like that it was too close to the white position it thought he thought maybe the queen could become a problem we have queen to e8 very ense moment now in this game apparently this also serves as a kind of a tactical defense of this pawn so rook h5 there is f5 and a lot of counterplay sent back whites way but as you see from the engine it thinks this is fine fv must have really panicked after queen e8 because he proceeds to take he takes on e6 and he opens up the position with fe6 and says you know what what is stopping me going on my own attack with knight to g3 and my friends from this point forward you are going to witness absolute greatness take a look at the position one final time this is the last time the position will look kind of normal although it's obviously not it's very complicated very dynamic and now in this position with this incoming an attack incoming on the king side the arabic uh the arabic falcon takes flight night to e e5 the engine needs to consider this move by the way it's like still thinking about all of the complexity so knight to e5 is a full giveaway of a piece the idea is that after you take it black takes with the bishop and now there is an attack here there is an attack here white has to play the only move which is queen to g2 now salem plays rook b8 so he has a sniper bishop sniper rook sniper rook queen is ready to get into the action as well as well as d5 opening the position the white king is not particularly safe but fv best move on the board knight h5 thought for 10 minutes he's ready with knight into f6 i'm going to turn off this evalar so nothing gets spoiled knight takes on h5 there is an attack brewing on the black position as well queen to g6 okay very tense moment in this game many options for white you cannot just barrel in because the queen is pinning the pawn to the queen and rook f6 is a simple move that wins a knight so since you can't do that you play bishop to e3 it's a very dangerous position and i don't you know i don't blame him but everything is defended like this is defended by that this defends that this defends that so black doesn't really have a way in which is why in this position salam plays d5 it's all he has remaining if white takes on d5 there is bishop c3 bc3 rook b1 and somehow the king is completely mated king d2 is queen d3 mate rook b1 queen d uh queen b1 king d2 you lose your queen you lose all your pieces so it's actually incredibly dangerous here one innocent pawn capture this diagonal opens up and you get absolutely butchered you get absolutely butchered here all right i mean it it is it is insane this position for white and feda finds the best move he castles he castles into all of this why because chess is all about dynamics he's up a piece don't forget about that if he's able to survive this he's just going to be up a piece which is why this move is a massive question mark now what he's forked this is as good as it's going to get and this is probably what cem saw from a distance from a distance like all the way back here he went what about knight e5 take take queen g2 and then we go to this line where you know i'm going to get d5 d4 i'm going to win a piece back i'm going to be happy yeah but there's a very good resource here for white and actually f kind of finds it you just check the piece you go knight f6 check you check the piece you go knight f6 check knight f6 is the idea black has the option of which piece to take he probably should take the bishop by the way it's probably better to take the bishop but it's very hard to fault mr salem salah for taking on c3 because he was attacking the king i mean you can't really blame the guy right so we took and in this position as well uh white can go for stuff like queen h3 now the best line is like after d3 you go for various knight f6 stuff but dc3 is played he plays b3 and actually believe it or not white is still better white still has a little bit of an advantage the position is in the balance but even though white's king is very restricted and i mean very very very restricted i mean bishop pressuring pawn is close to promoting all this stuff it's actually white who can simplify the game now there is one moment he can can play knight f6 check and that move forces a series of exchanges it forces a series of trades bishop f6 pawn f6 now i am very curious i have not spoken to fed of why in this position he opted to go queen to h3 instead okay it might have been he missed his opponent's next move but i think he thought queen h3 is just winning he probably looked at queen h3 king h8 cuz the threat was knight f6 check you still play knight f6 this is now mate by the way that's straight up checkmate bishop f6 pawn f6 you can't take you're winning it's a winning position queen e4 bishop h6 bishop g7 like i think f have went here and thought the game's over because i'm just going to go knight f6 next and i completely open up the position and i oil up the black king and that's it like that's what's going to you know it's just that's it it's game over uh i'm just getting in but now salem turned everything around turns out that queen h3 was inaccurate and the best move after bishop d3 was in fact going for knight f6 and maybe maybe fv just didn't think this was winning he just thought this is not a winning position but it was the problem with queen h3 is the fact that in this position my man salm sle can play the move takes b3 sacrificing the rook takes rook takes b3 oh my goodness what even is this move what are we even doing what we're doing is we're getting to the white king first rook b1 is mate the only move is to take the rook and when you take the rook black plays rook a8 rook a8 and now the threat is mate again you gave up a rook you bring the second rook you threaten a checkmate the game is over but once again the move knight to f6 is very important here the point is after bishop f6 queen e6 maybe white can survive queen f7 pawn f6 maybe ff saw king h8 and he was like this is over he's not completely wrong but he has this completely ridiculous move queen c8 check and after rook g7 he will lose but it might be a very long end game you probably saw this and was like this is losing anyway which is why he went king to d1 as you can see king to d1 is completely losing why king d1 is a very simple idea if rook a1 you go bishop c1 right what's the well sometimes in chest it's not the first mistake that hurts you it's the second mistake rook takes b3 open up rook a8 king d1 and salem salah what he did next was so incredible he sacrificed the queen the knight which could have moved to go to f6 at any moment he sacrifices the queen the queen is sacrificed and the reason for this the reason that you deflect the piece all the way up is so that the queen no longer protects any of the third rank queen takes h5 rook a1 check bishop c well it's not bishop f4 because then actually black gets made salem puts the finishing touch on this game and sacrifices his other rook rook takes c1 and white resigns because of king c1 bishop f4 king d1 c2 e king e1 c1 queen king f2 queen e3 king g2 queen g3 is check mate a forced sequence of moves beginning with the supernatural rook takes b3 punctuated by the supernatural queen takes h5 and ending the game by giving up the other rookie sacrificed both rooks and his queen in a sequence of four moves and he wins the game with two bishops and a pawn mik tal makei rest in peace is looking down at this game and smiling and smoking a cigarette in heaven that's what that's what he's doing this is we don't get stuff like this in the modern era this is absolutely crazy what a game and once again fetv probably should have just gone for that position with knight f6 check but this is chess and sometimes there is a margin for error and sometimes that margin of error is uh is exploited and my god i don't even know what to say i hope you enjoyed this game get out of here
