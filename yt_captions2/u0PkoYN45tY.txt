this is after you guys spent eight hours cable managing this maybe our server room here at the lab looks like an absolute cluster fine but beneath its ugly facade a shockingly well-oiled machines taking form quietly humming did i say quietly because this space next to it for our social media team is completely unusable even with the door closed i mean we've solved some of the problems since the last progress update for example we sealed this gap in the wall that was bothering our mac people our bfcs or box fan cooling system has been replaced by 15 000 watts of cooling capacity and if you just tilt the camera down a little bit the cable management has actually improved yeah but it's freaking loud and we don't even have the really loud equipment in there yet now you guys criticized me pretty hard when i diy sound dead into the studio server room and well i get it it wasn't pretty but it worked shockingly well and it isn't a fire hazard reddit though that doesn't mean that we're just going to do the same thing again our diy philosophy isn't changing but we're gonna do it way better this time and we'll be doing the entire room for less than two grand which sounds like a lot of money because it is but compared to the cost of a professional solution it's a steal in the original server room we used recycled denim insulation as our sound absorbing material and that stuff worked great but it's on the more expensive side it's tricky to source locally and it is a pain in the scrotum to work with so this time we're going to be using a few different materials first up is a layer of 3 8 inch osb or oriented strand board this is a really inexpensive wood sheet product that we already put on the walls to make mounting our installation easier if we hadn't done this what we could have done is try to hit studs or use drywall anchors but that would have made the process take forever unless we just didn't worry about any of that and just hoped our nails would stick into the drywall next up we're adding a layer of what's called sonopan this stuff is super cool and i wish i'd known about it when we did my theater room it's a recycled wood sound insulation material that's unfortunately only really easily available in canada it's kind of like if mdf and fiberglass insulation had a baby but in spite of the fact that it's practically made of sawdust it's still strong enough that you can screw it onto the wall with drywall screws if the goal is to eliminate reflections within the room this might not be the best product for you it's a very dense material but if the goal is to prevent sound from escaping the room this be your guy and this ain't hurting things because our goal though is to both stop sound from escaping the room and also to eliminate reflections which helps keep sound from escaping the room once the sauna pan is on we're gonna basically do what i did last time but way better first up instead of ultra touch denim batting we've gone with rockwool safe and sound which is a sound specific insulation material that's meant for the interior walls of houses yeah linus the interior of walls why didn't you put it in of course i thought of that it's already in the inside it's still loud we're adding more and i'm adding this segway to our sponsor build redux looking to level up your gaming experience build redux is here to help build redux creates custom gaming pcs tailored to your specs at competitive pricing compared to building your own follow the link below and start building your dream gaming rig today where do we start a baseline loudness sound pressure level is measured in db but there are different kinds of dbs you have dba you have dbc the a and the c are filters and they exclude some part of the spectrum from the calculation so we want dbc because we care about this broad frequency we're going to get both of them first we want to see how how much noise we have in different parts of the spectrum for a few seconds we have to be quiet impossible this is the spectrum of the noise we have quite a bit of noise at 120 hertz which is the sound of the transformer upstairs but the rest of the noise is actually pretty uniform throughout the spectrum maybe it's a bit less in the triple range but you have a lot of noise in the bass a lot of noise in the mid-range and this is what we would describe as like a white noise yes so so why broadband noise which if you have all of the noise at the same level enough at all frequencies you get white noise but even and white noise is annoying if it's loud enough and what we're looking at is what about anywhere from 55 to 60 decibels yeah so the overall numbers that i'm getting is 65.2 dbc and 53.8 dba but again we care about dbc more because we have a quite a bit of noise in the bass range as well okay now that would make for a pretty unpleasant working environment yes for comparison here's jake's desk so green is here red was downstairs a bit more noise in the base range here this is going to be less audible it's going to be more rumble okay because that's our hvac right yep dbc here is actually louder it is 67.5 downstairs was 65.2 but dba is a lot quieter here it's 43.3 dba here the low range noise is more like rumble so it's less less bothersome this is more annoying from an evolutionary standpoint like we're tuned to hear this range way more again for first speech on dialogue yes got it last time around cancellation with long nails through the outer duveteen at the end to attack both my cloth and my insulation onto the wall and while it's mostly intact all these years later we've ended up having to do a fair bit of red green engineering to keep everything happy so we went back to the drawing board and designed our own custom insulation holding plates inspired by the plastic washers they use when sound deadening some music studios we even added teeth because it makes the rock wall stick a little better oh that's cool they're 3d printed yeah each plate gets an oversized number 10 washer and a four inch wood screw then we just hold the rock wall up and it's just long enough to reach through our sauna pen into our osb without mushing down our insulation too much that's not something we want then like last time we're going to be using duvetine to keep the insulation from shedding all over the room and clogging up our servers all these years later it's still one of the cheapest fire retardant fabrics that we could get our hands on and since it has some thickness to it there's a chance it could help contribute to our sound deadening i really don't think so anyway the plan is to use some custom hanger plates that we also 3d printed to hold it up to the ceiling then we're going to use some of the super strong magnets that are going to be part of our upcoming cable management arches and for the walls we're basically just going to put down the duvetine stick these magnets to our oversized washers and bob's your uncle but first we need to do some prep most of the installation we're using is pretty good about not shedding but we're definitely going to want to cover up some of the non-essential equipment that's not running in the rack so it doesn't get so dusty garbage big and some tape foreign go down the side of that piece now oh you're already on it look at you go don't worry about it it's sealing to the wall worry about the face yeah now between each panel you can see jamie is using some goop this is called acoustic seal it's kind of like a butyl rubber that doesn't really ever dry it sucks it sucks and you can see he's wearing gloves it's because it's incredibly messy if you get this on your hands like that's the the cheese pull you don't want sonapan recommends using this to improve the effectiveness by filling all of the gaps between the sheets but we don't technically have to use it it's just that we're going through all this effort already so adding 30 seconds to goop well 30 seconds of jamie was a little faster but 30 seconds to goop uh it's worth it i do really like screwing it's a very important art form the sona pan doesn't shed much when it's just sitting there but when you're bringing it into the room and like cutting holes and trying to tuck it into tight spots it starts to shed a lot so the air in here was getting kind of crusty and we devised taking this furnace filter and putting it on the back of this box fan to try to pick up a bunch of the the dust i guess and it's starting to go green can you see oh that's a lot of product the only redeeming quality about using this stuff is it doesn't really dry so if you put this up here and we put this sheet on in like an hour it's still going to be pretty much just as supple as it is right now while the other guys are working on finishing up the sona pan i'm installing a door seal on this door but the real secret is this drop seal it mounts on the door itself and when you shut the door this little pin pushes in there's the seal down when you open the door it goes back in this is really starting to feel like when you're drilling into a wall and it's not going anywhere and then you find out you've been drilling into a water pipe yeah [applause] [music] the maximum gap this seal can cover is just over 20 millimeters and i just measured the bottom of this door is about 13 or 14 millimeters gap so we have a bunch of extra playroom that means i can mount this just flush with the bottom of the door thank you i've set that where i think it needs to go so when we shut the door it pushes that pin in which pushes the seal down so in theory cool well it sounds like a bmw nothing it's a metal door so we have to use self-tappers like this that drill into the door and it's a little more time consuming but [music] it looks like a room out of a horror movie right like some bad stuff is happening in here yeah the results though and oh my god it's so much quieter it's still mostly through the door so i think what i should do is put another layer of the green stuff and then with the rock wall i think it'll be pretty good well the dbc number hasn't changed because we're still dominated by the 120 hertz sound from the transformer you heard it here first i'm dominated but the dba number has gone down from 54 dba to 49 dba and this is what it looks like so pretty similar to jake's desk we do have a solution for the transformer that we're going to buy these rubber isolating pucks and put them underneath because they're hard mounted it's a resonance thing you can tell just from the sound of it yeah there's like concrete and it's just bolted to it it's like giant concrete speaker linus was hyping up this bandsaw but alex said it's really easy to cut it like this so let's see wow that cut through it like it wasn't even there as much as having a window to the outside in your server room is kind of awesome it's not very good for sound and not very good for security now to fix that there is a big set of metal bars that go in front of here but we also want to sound isolate this a little bit because this reverberates back really hard what we're going to do is stuff rock wall behind the bars and then put the bars in place i put rockwall on the bottom the top piece of the window i was thinking i'd just leave open because having a little bit of light is kind of nice hey watch it all right should we put duvetine behind the bar can you measure the height and add three inches on either side there you go cameraman oh thin dues i love just like every time i see dan i'm like what is wrong with him but like in the best way oh this stuff cuts wonderfully wow it's like paper so many amazing materials we're using in retrospect probably should have cleaned the windows before we put the bar back on well you know i don't want it to look like but this is all stuff that i put on there myself so i'm just having fun being a glorified garbage can yeah look at how much better the window looks we've pretty much finished every last piece of soda pan there's a couple around the hvac unit but it might need to get service so we're leaving those for now and it's finally time for rock wall we're trying to plan out the best way to do it and because the rock wall is roughly four feet by two feet and these sheets are roughly four feet wide we're thinking we can place them vertically here and vertically here and then on the top we twist them sideways and that should fill most of the gap [music] 15 minutes and we've already got that whole back wall done and this wall almost done this is way faster than hanging up the green stuff and to be honest these little hangers are working beautifully i'm actually stoked every part of this project so far has gone pretty close to mint aside from a little bit of a mess up there but that's fine it looks good now though right i like the natural light so yeah i cut it perfectly right amazing see like didn't even screw up at all i didn't actually i left extra so it would butt up with this nicely [music] these are the worst scissors ever oh look at that man most of the hair that i cut off has nothing in it i mean you can't look any worse than you do if this piece feels funny okay that one's good oh there's a lot in that one yeah the rock bowl is basically done finally oh my gosh this is like almost the end of day two at let's put some duveteen on time we 3d printed some little washer plate things alex has got one in his mouth right there to hold the duveteen on a little bit those are going to go into the ceiling and then it should just hang down we'll put the magnets on and tuck it in the bottom all right i guess it's time to go get sam and measure how much of a difference this rockwool makes it's wild because no matter how many times i experience this it never fails to weird me out as soon as you put this less dense absorbing material on the wall it's like you can only hear the server coming from that side and then this side is just quiet and it is the rack itself is way quieter like the sound level in here is like feels like half of what it was before anyway let's fire it up so that all the exact same servers are running is when we tested before and let's get our after measurement i haven't told jake but now what we got to do is treat the whole studio like this right that's still very impressive i mean i already know the answer because i can hear it with my ears but please do quantify i haven't measured it yet so we're going to find out together let's let's be quiet for like a few seconds i've been really funny to slap them in the nuts all right well the first number we had was 53.8 dba the second number was 49.1 dba the last number is 47.3 dba so actually the wine the wine is pretty much did get rid of the wine because because curve going that was annoying and five to almost 45 yeah and you said 10 decibels is roughly half perceptually it's half as loud yeah yeah so this this looks like a pretty subtle change but because it's right in that annoying it is it's a huge difference and it affects the office side of things too that's a lot better to be clear this door is not really treated yet yeah it's going to be even better it doesn't have a proper seal on it it doesn't even have this segway to our sponsor gorgeous gorgeous help desk is a customer
