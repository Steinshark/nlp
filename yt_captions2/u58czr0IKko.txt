hey everyone welcome back to talk tech with 
diff on today's episode i sat down with adam   pearsall who is the founder of quantum we had 
a really interesting chat about how quantum has   evolved i hope you enjoy it welcome to my new 
series called talk tech with tiff where i am   sitting down with industry professionals to hear 
about their career journeys and current roles   i created this series to hear from people 
who are established in the tech industry   so that we can all learn what these individuals 
do in their day-to-day jobs and the type of   opportunities that are out there okay let's 
get started hey adam how's it going it's good   tiff thanks for having me thanks for coming i'm 
really excited to sit down with you today and   hear a little bit about your story and really how 
you started quantum pay great so how so give me   a little bit about your background as to what you 
did before quantum pay and and why you started it   sure uh definitely been a serial entrepreneur 
uh mainly because i could never hold down a job   definitely did not fit in a cubicle yeah and 
i've always enjoyed always enjoyed the hustle   yeah you know started off uh young age of 16 
making parisian style crepes on the street   um grew that into a full-blown catering 
company realized i love food didn't love   the food business and ultimately moved on to 
educational tours where we're taking grade 11   and 12 students to see all the different college 
campuses across canada sold that business and   began my career in marketing and working for 
various uh family offices and consulting roles   always in the marketing space and ultimately i'd 
say if there's one common thread throughout my   entire career it's hospitality no matter what 
business you're in you're always taking care of   someone and taking that approach into everything 
we do creating uh meaningful experiences for our   partners and communication yeah and you really 
brought that into uh quantum pay i can see as well   but before i keep on mentioning quantum pay so 
let's just get right into what is quantum pay for   those who don't know sure i set out three years 
ago to to build a global digital banking platform   and that was a you know heavy lift uh perhaps 
you know biting up a little more than i can chew   um but it was our desire to do more 
and create opportunity for those at a   disadvantage out of the gate and you know it was 
born from the thesis of you know our dislike of   banks and you know being being bled out with fees 
and terrible experience and the bottom line is if   your bank can afford to give you an ipad to open 
an account something's probably not right yeah and   on that on that thesis we set out to 
build the first lifestyle bank catering to   that younger generation that values experiences 
brands that support their lifestyle yeah you know   our one of our original conversations was you know 
how do you bring in city guides through curators   into into banking and you know how do we automate 
that and that was cool because that was sort of   our first time working together and that started 
a conversation and really bridged the world of   technology and service yeah anchored anchored 
in finances so you know how does that evolve and   as a disrupter i thought financial technology was 
was the main disrupter and you know i was half   right uh i believe you know financial technology 
is a great vehicle to advance traditional banking   but it's not the ultimate disrupter it's a you 
know great ui ux on top of a legacy system yeah   the real disrupter in our view is blockchain 
technology and the power of cryptocurrency   and that's where we've really spent the 
last' months redefining our offering   and building a platform back to where i started 
my career and that's storytelling you know   giving a platform for brands and audiences to come 
together and transact and add value and it's been   it's been a wild ride yeah that's i love that and 
going back to when you start started quantum to   where it is today and you said' months ago 
it really kind of maybe took a bit of a shift   towards blockchain more right would you say yeah 
and then based on that i think a lot of things you   speak so like it's so maybe for some people who 
just have that entrepreneur spirit in them it's   very simple to do but i think a lot of people who 
are starting companies struggle because they start   one way and they're so focused on the direction 
it's going they don't see other opportunities   that maybe are really building the future and 
you saw that you saw okay we're starting this   you know we started quantum one way but then 
when you saw the potential and opportunity with   blockchain you kind of shifted was it what was 
that like shifting kind of into blockchain more so when i say our goal was never to build a product 
for today yeah everything that we've been building   is you know for five ten years out and it's not 
always easy going against the grain yeah yes   so if you're in it all day every day blockchain 
web three cryptocurrency nfts these are in your   vocabulary yes if you're on the outside you're 
like you know i work i earn i build something   i start with nothing i build something 
i sell it yeah i have a real business   okay great you know congratulations you have a 
real business you know i'm i'm working on you   know how to bridge that gap yes between what's 
out there and you know the wonderful world of   better verse what is a metaphor yeah right like 
answering answering all these questions and   what what are what's the next generation going 
to need to empower their success yes and i   believe that's going to be not only a blockchain 
offering but traditional fiat offering as well   and bridging that gap and providing the platform 
for these brands to evolve into the world of   of of web 3. you know so that's sort of where 
i have made my focus and you know if you're   out there and you're starting your career 
and you're trying to build something new   leverage subject matter experts you 
know if anyone tells you that they're an   expert in blockchain run yes run i work with 
some incredible technologists and you know   deep heavy teams we learn every day yes 
right it's forever evolving and we're as   anyone in the space will tell you it's the early 
innings right like the the adoption rates are   super tight and right for disruption yes yeah 
it's so true there's there's leaders out there   you know if you're on the marketplace side of 
things there's the the open seas of the world   that are always going to excel but i believe that 
there's a real opportunity for niche marketplaces   or whatever your passions are yeah and there's 
going to be currencies that reflect your interests   and whether you're into sports gaming collectibles 
philanthropy whatever it may be there's a   blockchain application for that and there's 
passions that i'm certainly not into yeah that   someone's going to come up with a great idea and 
figure out a use case for some great technology   that's going to empower their communities yeah 
exactly i love that and kind of going back to the   experiences and that quantum is really focusing 
on i know one area is through the blockchain   blockchain toolkit that you're working 
on uh what can you tell me about that   so for us it's leveraging my background in 
marketing and always struggling trying to find   that balance of art and science and now adding 
that technology financial layer it gets a little   more more complicated but for us you know it's how 
can we help yeah yeah right and it's tapping into   brands and companies that we're passionate about 
that we want to work on and work with incredible   founders and provide the technology they need 
to advance you know so finding like-minded   individuals that you like working with where 
work doesn't feel like work and you get to   take on a heavy lift yeah like what is what is the 
future yes and those are those are fun challenges   to take on and you know we're we're super humbled 
to be working with some of the brands that   we're privileged to to work with uh you know 
starting off in the world of formula one having   the pleasure of working with mclaren and 
gaining insights to that whole world and   the success that drive to survive has 
brought to that sport is absolutely insane   and racing right like i i've 
i'm i'm new into the sport   but i love it and i think that's a huge 
opportunity where you have all of these household names that are trying to figure out 
how to play in the world of blockchain and web3   yes and if we can provide the platform to advance 
global adoption in these great technologies and   facilitate and add in our expertise and 
our partners expertise to help deliver   uh fully compliant product it's ready to go 
to market and you know that's what that's   what we're building and i think it you 
know the word compliant is important yeah   as as there's been a lot of discussion around the 
regulations of blockchain and everything else and   what are assets and what are not assets and i 
believe that everyone eventually is going to be   put in a regulatory landscape right as 
much as the hardcore decentralization of   the communities are end of the day if 
you want to take that out of the system   there's no more big brother right 
big brother knows big brother knows   it's like if you want to you want to trade 
out of your crypto and you want to go on a   you want to go put a deposit on a house yeah 
sure there's there's companies that'll help   facilitate that for you and they'll lend against 
your crypto and this and that but they still need   to know who you are exactly there needs to be 
some some of that and that and that comes back to   another one of our offerings which is identity 
and working working with leaders in the space to   create that global identity so you know we're 
we work very closely with the team at global id   and that's the first step yeah that's really cool 
you mentioned uh i know you mentioned you've been   working with some in the past already such as 
mclaren some really cool partnerships uh is   there maybe maybe you can't share everything right 
now but are there any upcoming partnerships that   you can share uh with us yeah we're super excited 
to announce our partnership with gumball 3000 um   which has always been a brand that i've admired 
and respected over the years as there's no one   more authentic than maximilian cooper yeah like 
he's just an incredible entrepreneur visionary   and being able to work with him and his team 
to assist in the evolution of what's next for   for gumball is super exciting as it checks all 
the boxes for me yeah you have automotive you have   let's call it culture i don't know yeah yeah 
i would say culture yeah oh it's automotive   fashion music and it's historically been reserved 
for those on the rallies in those in those cities   who can enjoy the energy that gumball brings to 
town you know it's the ultimate traveling circus   where gumball's in town you know there's going to 
be a wild display of the craziest cars individuals   and a festival around that exactly but up until 
now you really had to be there to experience   it would you say sure so as we're as we're 
working on what what does gumball look like   in a web 3 environment yeah so starting off 
with the gumball marketplace getting into   the tokenization of the gumball community and 
really adding value into that community through   our utility based offering where those token 
holders will get priority access to merch drops   they'll get access to starting lines they'll get 
access to community events as we get going and   eventually you'll be able to engage with 
the entire gumball ecosystem in a web 3   gaming environment which is super exciting that's 
so cool and i think through these through these   new ecosystems that are coming up such as you 
know with gumball 3000 it's really going to allow kids or adults really anyone who maybe haven't 
had the opportunity to get much exposure to that   to through this new ecosystem be 
able to get more involved in it and   feel more connected to it and inspire 
others and i think people get a little overwhelmed when they hear metaverse yeah but the 
reality is is we've all had our own metaverses at   one time or another right so i i did a mini rally 
with the gumball guys and that car i was in was   was photographed it was sent to a member of the 
gumball community they created a rendering of   my car and two months later my kids are racing 
that in forza wow yeah right so for me it's like   is that a metaverse yeah well you know my kids 
are driving like they want it for me it was 225   points or whatever that that virtual currency 
is in a closed environment which are points or   whatever that is and they they bought me that 
car and i get to go rip with my kids and like   that's a trip i totally agree it's not something 
yeah you're totally right it's not something   necessarily new we've been having it different 
kind of you know metaverses to various degrees   especially through i think gaming i know earlier 
um before we were sitting down we were talking a   little bit about fortnite that's a great example 
as well and that's the perfect example right in in   forza sure uh you get to drive your skins and 
and and this and that but it's ultimately the   performance of the individual that gets you the 
finish line before anyone else exactly and i think   that's been super important as we're architecting 
what that blockchain game looks like for gumball   where we don't want it to be about money yeah 
where okay i can come in and i can buy this   whatever mclaren senna that was driven 
by a you know 10 times gumballer and   this and that so for us it's about sure 
that's your flex yeah but that's the   skin yeah exactly right if you want to put 
that time in you want to work on your car   and you want to you want to build out your look 
and feel of it but ultimately it's going to   come down to the merit of the individual not his 
bankroll yeah and the difference between a forza   and a gumball 3000 game is those tokens are not 
are going to be tokens not points and ultimately   you'll be able to trade out of those tokens to 
buy merch or you know if you're accomplished   take your homie for lunch exactly go buy a coffee 
and that's the real world utility of play to earn   gaming yeah that's the success we've seen with 
axi infinity and they've really set the benchmark   and what's next yeah exactly they're they're 
the leaders in the field but we're we're still   way early exile way early it's it's like like 
we were saying as well before you know whether   for i think us or for anyone who is really excited 
and familiar with blockchain or passionate about   it just feels like it's this huge world but then 
there's other people who maybe aren't uh maybe   aren't uh haven't had as much exposure to it or um 
haven't really dove into it so it just feels like   there's kind of the people who are really into 
it right now and then people who are like what   is this i'm not i'm not too sure yet uh have you 
found that when you share about quantum pay there   to be that do you really see that gap um for sure 
and you know when when we set out quantum pay was   a great name right quantum is the evolution of 
what what you know yeah and pay that's what we   were getting into uh but we're at a stage now 
where we've outgrown that box and we're dropping   the pay and we're going to market with quantum dna 
quantum dna stands for dreamers need acceleration   i love that dreamers need acceleration and that's 
what we're all about right rather we're helping an   individual where we're helping a corporation 
and we're we're getting heavily involved in   blockchain philanthropy and providing our platform 
for those in need and if we can ultimately end   up funding an olympic medal on blockchain hell 
yeah i totally agree yeah it's so interesting to   the different routes you can take you know you 
mentioned uh blockchain philanthropy and it's   it's such a this past year i think we've seen so 
much of that really going on um you know even with   i think the the biggest um amount of donations 
or it was for a long time for ukraine was   through blockchain actually and just hearing 
other uh ways that it's being used for good   there's no easier way to move money around yeah 
right which is why these governments are calling   for regulation and everything else but it's it 
traditional banking is archaic yeah right when   i can get your wallet address and send you coins 
or i can send you an nft or right that's insane   exactly right away here you go thanks jeff 
you know onwards and upwards where it's like   okay what's your what's your swift what's your 
banking what's your address what's the bank   address yeah it's arcade it is it is and it's 
it's expensive exactly right you're spending   upwards of 30 to 45 dollars in north america 
to send or receive a wire exactly for what   i know for what i i don't want to spend that 
money i know i'd rather just send you some dough   i know and it happens instantly that's the other 
thing or tokens or however we want to interact   you and i are getting into business why isn't 
it on a smart contract yeah yeah it's completely   transparent easy you complete the work you get 
paid yeah money's in the account yeah exactly and   i like how to uh with you renaming uh to quantum 
dna i know dna is an acronym as well but also   too it really is about the dna that blockchain 
brings you know with the uniqueness of it and it's   um you know it's it's one of a kind you can't 
uh whereas i think we were talking about before   is you know you can complete a course or you can 
do say you did this or that but did you really do   it whereas with this you can't you can't do that 
there's no smoke yeah exactly no smoke it's fully   transparent you know the way it should be open 
exactly open honest transparent uh that's what   we love about the space and you know we're we're 
in a wild time yeah we're we're in a really wild   time where we're gonna look back like yeah we 
lived through that and we thought it was normal   i know it's we're we're gearing up we're already 
in it right i was buying a pastry on the way here   and said sorry our prices have increased due 
to inflation yeah our generation doesn't know   from that yeah we've never had real bad times 
right our parents have our grandparents have   and for us you know it's time to buckle up right 
like it's not it's not like go in the mall and   buy whatever you want because you're not worried 
about what's happening tomorrow uh and for us we   see this happening and we see the cost of 
living going up and we see the cost of goods and   cost of everything yeah and a nine to five doesn't 
cut it anymore it doesn't right so how do how do   we support those in need those with the dream 
give them the tool kit they need to get ahead   and if that's you know traditional financial 
services if that's accounting if that's   marketplace it's you know whatever whatever 
we can do to help create opportunity to   you know find that next budding entrepreneur 
that needs some help you know and it's not easy   raising capital right you might have the greatest 
idea in the world that we're working on the best   technology but if you don't have access to capital 
and a team to bring that together yeah then it's   gonna die and you're gonna be stuck in that nine 
to five and where are you going i know it's it's   so true adam i always when i end this interview 
i always ask the same question to everyone   uh which is and it's a broad question but what 
advice would you give to your younger self stop buying things you don't need i love that 
you can never wear a thousand pairs of sneakers   it's so true that's a good note to end on 
well adam thank you so much for being here   today and talking more about quantum 
i'm gonna say quantum dna from now on   i'm gonna link everything down below as well 
the website and just more information about   yourself and the company and it was really 
awesome chatting nice one thanks jeff thanks
