ladies and gentlemen welcome back to freestyle chess this is a new type of chess event where all of the players are playing fisher random chess a type of chess where the back row of pieces is shuffled randomly selected about 15 minutes before game time and then the players just go and have at it we have magnus carlson taking on ali resa fua in the first round of the quarterfinals it is now a knockout we have dingly ren versus nobe abdulov we have vincent kimer from germany the hometown hero taking on leavon aronian and we have fabiano carana going up against gkes dearu from india uh it's very exciting stuff they are playing classical chess now 90minut chess for this and um it's a very fascinating format because there are no openings so this is the setup that was randomly selected before the quarterfinals begin today they play like this and tomorrow they flip colors so they got to invent opening theory basically on the spine no abdor is the number one seed he went undefeated in the preliminary stage then of course i will show you the game of magnus i will show you the game of leavon and all the players who play black and all the players who play white do have the option to discuss among themselves prior to the game beginning so that way they don't interfere with one another and remember the positions are randomly generated every round so you're not really giving away any specific preparation so uh nre plays e4 and these are two players on vastly different wavelengths nre five and a half out of seven in the preliminary stage ding had half and he had no points after six rounds but this is classical now this is 90-minute chess this is not 25-minute chess and ding plays b5 opting to bring out his bishop if white wants to castle he needs to play knight to f3 and he needs to castle like this if he wants to castle the other way he's got to move these three pieces out of the way and then he will land his king and rook like this uh we have b4 though so we have both players moving out their b pawns and the good thing about this this is that i will have the exact same setup in every game and that way we will look at the intricate details of the position so now you know e5 is a is a good move probably to fight back for the center ding plays knight f6 all right so you see that the players you know they spent five minutes on the first move they're thinking from move one which is really interesting and ding plays knight f6 um nob plays d3 there are already many setups but you will notice actually that it's equal but the computer wants e5 and knight h6 stockfish thinks putting the knight here will be good in the long run ding puts it in the center which under traditional chess principles might be right but no deerb puts his knight like this and that's very interesting and i think the point is that this type of setup really wants the f pawn to be mobile the knight goes here the center is strong and then you get the f pawn going with the the bishop and the point is that the sign to commit the king first might turn like basically give a give a a big tell like in poker to the opponent like if i bring my king you're going to attack me well ding doesn't wait he strikes in the center right away so ding is taking a center based approach we have pawn takes knight takes but now the pawn here is hanging but if ding hadn't played d5 if he had played for example castles nck would have went f4 and then he would have had a direct line of assault on the black king and you see the advant already very big for white which is just very interesting not to mention white can also castle and have a rook active in the attack so d5 and ding gives up a pawn he just straight up he plays this in the style of the marshall and if you don't know what the marshall is the marshall is this we have a regular chess setup we play a spanish opening with knight c6 bishop b5 a6 i know i'm you know i'm uh i'm kind of i'm i'm i'm going deep in the tank here a little bit you know by trying to show you this kind of like you know normal preparation uh but the point is basically like b5 bishop b3 castle c3 and black plays d5 and loses the pawn in the center and in the marshall which is an opening that ding plays black is down a pawn but gets very active counterplay but that's not interesting to us right now what is interesting to us right now is that ding lost the same pawn in the center will he get that marshall style counterplay so ding is applying some concepts that he knows from regular ch to get marshal style compensation and say like look i'm a pawn down but your extra pawn is right here and it's not going to be felt yeah but think about like the fact that ner beck is up a full pawn on the sixth move now here's something interesting the players have something at this event called a confessional booth so mid game to provide content for the audience they can go into a booth and they can say their thoughts and ding said he lo he made a big mistake on the second move can you can you imagine a top level chess player in regular chess making a mistake in a second move no but in this type of format it's very common and ding says you know what i got to i got to bail out and i got to play this position so no plays bishop to f3 um and uh right rookie eight i i don't one second i'm messaging my um one of one of my editors mid recap and the thing is if i don't if i don't send a message right now nothing will happen it's tough so i got to send a message now if you'll excuse me i'm going to take about 10 seconds anyway there we go and now i will go back to uh talking to you about nob versus dingler ren bishop d4 bishop b7 nck takes which is a which is a interesting decision um he could just play a3 but nbe decides i want to get rid of the knight spends 11 minutes making that decision and i think his point is like look we need a little bit of imbalance we need bishop bishop knight versus knight knight bishop and i'm not going to send the game into opposite colored bishops unless i have to think about what we know about chess opposite colored bishop end games are very very frequently drawish now dig to his credit does have a lot of compensation here a lot of active play the bishop is out and you know it's kind of tough for white to get anything going and then this happens and we see ourselves inching closer and closer to an endgame which is traditionally a draw however what's very important in this particular case of this endgame is that it's it it it was born out of a unique type of structure right it was born out of chest n 60 so white has a pawn that's a very different type of imbalance and white has attacking chances all right we have a3 now ding tries to get rid of his weakness noj takes and plays rook e3 and basically says all right let's trade ding says no noj plays h5 and f3 he has five out of six pawns negating the effect of this bishop ding is solid can noer break through against ding he's just starts moving forward ding very accurate move f5 splitting up the pawns if you take with white you break everything apart so i play rook f4 you can't defend everything and it's probably going to be a draw that's why no goes here a very well-timed pawn strike yes black can capture but then nck will go here and yes black can capture this as well but then this and black is getting mated so out of nowhere remember obstacle bishop is a draw end is a drawn endgame but it benefits the attacking party so suddenly thing is on the back foot now nock takes and he finds f6 a very important counter pawn sacrifice both guys sacrificing pawns to try to damage each other's structure pawn takes d3 and even though this is classical chess i mean this is this is classical chess i mean this is a real like 35 minutes on the clock even though it's fisher random c4 and all this and ding does not find the right idea does not find the right drawing mechanism and all of a sudden is just completely busted bishop d5 played he's trying to defend nock re regroups wins the pawn but look at his pawn look at the powerful pawn that he has rook e7 rook d7 and uh rook takes rook g7 and that's it that's the game right there that's that's the game he wins a piece he trades and it's a completely winning end game white can't actually uh black can't actually get over here in time because the pawn just runs up the board and um if you push it to draw you push it to draw but you don't push you go here black can't get closer so black is going to run out of pawn moves and then black is going to lose the game look c5 king d3 h5 king c4 h4 bishop f4 h3 bishop h2 black has to move this way the pawn promotes isn't that fascinating you don't take the you don't push the pawn because if the king gets to the corner it's the wrong color corner to draw it's fascinating right but no wins dingly ran is now half out of of eight now admittedly it's fisher random right so maybe in fisher random it's just a matter of like he made the wrong he made a big mistake on the second move it's not the first mistake you're going to see on the second move today but oh my god he's half out of eight and tomorrow he has to win he has to he has to win they're going to play tomorrow the second game that's crazy now fabiano versus gukesh this one a little bit different this one c4 but all right the difference being in this game right like look at the opening white plays e4 b4 in this game he plays c4 b4 all right interesting knight f6 very different story because there none of this is happening right knight f3 and and now we see fabiano advancing on the queen side so he chooses this setup where he advances a bit and he takes away gesha space and now they they have a very different structure they have a structure where they've both castled and it's it's clear that white is going to play for a d4 approach like this right and there is an opening in chess in the kings indian where black puts this pawn on e4 four and starts attacking but it's not regular chest cuz the pieces are all over the place so gkes plays it like this and it's just a very tense position i mean both guys pawns are clashing very unclear what's going to happen um there is a chance fabiano is going to have to move this f pawn because if not you know black could overwhelm you over here he has a massive space advantage so now knight e2 knight g3 big maneuvering going on takes ges starts relieving the pressure but structurally this is very ugly if we go to an end game and white gets a rook to pressure black is gonna have a headache and it's not going to be because of the rain over in germany it's gonna be because of uh of the position queen e6 bishop d5 but gash starts you know bringing some pieces forward and now fabbi does in fact move his f pawn all right he moves his f pawn and a big moment for gukesh if gukesh plays onas which makes sense white will sneak in e4 and if black backs up uh white just is a great position a little bit you know a little bit loose but he's going to try to advance right so he plays at four ukes doesn't take and black is better black is better because white's bishop is pretty bad like white's bishop is is pretty bad uh fabby starts rerouting to the queen side because he has to he has to improve the situation on the queen side if he's going to do anything in the position queen to back to e6 now fab's fab's he's very smart it's a very very genius idea that fabiano comes up with here it's very instructive um and uh it's worth noting that maybe black should have not left the center like maybe black should have made a few more preparatory moves got the rook more into the game he tries to leave the center and if white just goes here he's going to put a knight here and fabby will lose um he will lock down the center none of fabiano's pieces are ever going to get into the game this bishop is just going to live a hundred years of solitude over here on a1 and it's just it's going to be really bad so fabiano here unclogs his arteries a little bit takes a deep breath of fresh air like you're sitting in the back of a hot taxi you open the window and you don't even ask permission cuz you know you're the passenger and the customer's always right d5 that is called a clearance sacrifice so he is clearing the squares and just exhaling even though ges is able to take now in the in the in the a a switch is flipped knight d4 queen g3 knight c6 like an avalanche bo boinging boing bo like for a cost of one stupid pawn what a position fabiano has now and suddenly all the momentum has flipped and gues is sitting there going why did i play queen e6 like i knew he could have played d5 but to's point he's probably like well i'm a pawn up i mean a pawn counts for a lot a pawn is a pawn even in germany so queen g3 knight c6 knight c4 but fabiano just he's he's regrouping and you know he's going to put something on e5 he's going to play f5 and we're going to get into a trouble queen f5 bishop e5 both guys around 10 minutes 6 minutes now ges spends a lot of time remember a while ago i told you that this pawn is really weak it's cuz it is i didn't lie to you right queen g6 he's trying to trade f he says no queen trade knight back to d4 oh my goodness and suddenly these pieces are playing twister you ever play that game you put the mat down you all try to like touch the colors and stuff what is happening i mean it's a it's a it's a huge cluster you know what of pieces gz tries to get rid of the pressure with 4 minutes on the clock and fab's going to win material like gash should have played king g8 he goes here fabby just takes the knight goash takes but now queen a2 and this queen is stranded it it can't get back to help anybody rook d7 oh my god queen h5 and i i told you a long time ago that pawn will fall and i and i'm forecasting what's going to happen because here gash has the option to create counterplay with this rook or this rook and he chooses this rook and uh faby just defends himself it doesn't matter if you can check my king with queen h4 i just go here this is falling if you go back oops f6 played queen a3 check queen b3 and in this position gukesh resigns because there is nobody who can protect the rook if you play knight c7 i take it if you play queen f5 i play g4 and uh out of nowhere out of a position where basically everything was locked down ges gives pano a chance one pawn move how instructive is that one pawn move and white's position came alive and suddenly despite being that pawn down and yeah black is still has an advantage according to the engine in this position i mean but it's like i don't know it's uh it's symbolic it there's nothing really i mean it's a very difficult position probably gu should have played a6 i mean he should have probably fought back with that pawn and then put his queen here uh b7 not a7 sorry if this knight moves he would go to a7 but um he didn't and he loses and fabiano wins what a comeback i mean it was hardly a comeback it was just a complicated game this game was also nuts all right this game was also nuts this is c4 c5 b4 okay so this is like we have this opening in this game we have this opening in game one and we have this opening right it's just so interesting to see which direction all these players go takes the rook comes out what the what the why is the rook out now levon plays bishop a5 activates his bishop activates his knight vincent plays c5 vincent has nothing developed knight e4 is threatening the knight look at this you could lose knight e4 knight b3 guards everything and now it's like what is levon doing bro well he's inching closer and a3 is a double pawn set back like he wants him to take this so that then he can push the knight out and play what the f what these openings don't make any sense and you'll notice like the guys have spent 40 minutes on the seventh move which is what what makes this so interesting that they have to think like this right bishop c5 right knight c5 knight c5 d4 so vincent says you know what you can have the pa pa but what i'm going to get is i'm going to get active lines for the pieces that want the active lines and the extra pawn is here which we've seen in the gukesh game the extra pawn on that side of the board as he had it right the extra the extra pawn it's not really you're not going to feel it so d4 e4 e5 look at this he's just taking a bunch of space away what a complicated game this this is knight h3 now this type of structure you see how every game they play overlaps with something else that type of structure is from an advanced french just like i in the ding game right this is an advanced french structure look oops take take this structure is bad for white it's a bad i mean it's it's not good this is a big weakness in many positions if if black can deal with you know the light squared bishop you go back to this game it's what they have it's the same exact structure which is what is fascinating so you know from certain chess openings the way certain structures look but in certain chess openings the bishop is there and the bishop is there that doesn't exist here so vincent immediately goes to attack leevon i mean look at this energetic chess he doesn't even castle he doesn't even castle lavon forces the king to move but instead he wants to trade pieces and now h6 the bishops are staring at each other the queen is staring the knight is under attack takes on f5 takes on g5 opening up the position rook to b7 defending himself oh my goodness what would have been a little bit more energetic is even knight e6 to try to open put it up like this that would have been crazy but rook b7 is played rook g1 oh my god he's bringing all the rooks castles yeah cuz you could castle he never castled he could castle and now in this position vincent should just take the pawn that's a mouse slip he should just take the pawn and keep the attack going we have fe rook f8 king f8 and just keep trying to attack like this but instead vincent plays e7 so vincent gives up the pawn to try to bring the rook over here which is what happens then he takes now f6 a well-timed move rook f5 the attack is still there the knight is rotating backwards very complicated game bishop c3 trying to bring in the bishop he takes slides his king to safety keeps and but now leon might have more pawns on that board on that side of the board which are active we have take take take rook g7 check kingu very complicated game oh my god levon's coming in with the attack now would have been a better to play king here first defending himself instead he opts for knight g5 knight e oh this is this is that's a really big problem and now we're going to an end game where probably only black can win he brings the knight back he brings back the knight queen is calling a lot of shots here bishop d2 oh my goodness he's hanging on by a threat and now those pawns are moving and now the only way you'll create counterplay is with the h pawn if he doesn't move the h pawn black is going to walk in you are overwhelmed so you got to go h4 h5 h6 that's the only way your queen protects queen f5 like again if in this position he played b4 ab ab h5 b3 guess what that's a problem this pawn is an issue because of h7 and uh yeah queen f5 instead and in this position the players just make a repetition of moves and the first game ends in a draw so we've had results all over the place this one very complicated you know kimer sacrificing aon early every game completely different different flavor different style and that brings us to our last game of the day all right so let's compare the opening of every game thus far this one was a pawn gambit this one was like this and this one was like this what's going to happen in this one well in this one we have what could have happened in this game noding but instead of committing a pawn right magnus did this and by the way the best part is we have no idea if magnus is right or or not for once we have a format we have no idea if magnus is good at this format or not like we straight up don't know um and he has no reference he has no historical you know base to look at so we're going to see how magnus does again we see the same kind of concept we see the same concept that nobec used right but in this game it happens on h3 and magnus spends 22 minutes on his next move goes to the confession booth and says this move is made out of desperation because i have a terrible position after two moves that might just be the way it works i don't know sometimes in fisher random going white is worse than going black sometimes going white is better than going than than going first is better playing white is better than playing black or playing black is better than playing white that like that sometimes it just that's what it means so knight e7 f4 a pawn attack castles now he opens up this magnus plays knight g6 trying to defend himself and we have the same structure the same structure look at this like identical basically as we had in this game but in that game there was a pawn sacrifice by black well in this game there is no pawn sacrifice we just have knight f4 and now magnus plays queen e5 but black is behind white black is behind so we have queen g3 and now i'm threatening to win the game with the discovered attack now if if if uh if knight f4 was played in this position and like rook f4 and castles by black then you know white would build up an initiative probably play queen f2 knight knight b3 move the bishop bring the rook but instead of that we go to an end game we go to an end game we have take and ali resa basically says you're the endgame god let me beat the endgame god plays rook b3 right it's going to put pressure here speaking of which remember the ges game remember how in the ges game that pawn was really weak you notice how patterns just happen in these positions like that's so wild to me that you know on the first move it's like well do i play b6 no the players have determined it's probably better to play b5 and they're right according to the computer it's better to play b5 but then your a pawn's weak and we're seeing that we're seeing literally the inner workings of these positions now you just have a weakness that you have to defend with your bishop then i come back who's going to guard that pawn you're not going to go c6 cuz then you're going to kill your bishop that's the best move according to the engine but the engine does know a damn thing about fisher random knight b3 and ali reza just has a menacing position look at what he's doing to the best endgame player in the world he's literally just dancing around him and picking him apart and there's nothing magnus can do because this is fisher random he has to lose his aon magnus and ding the only people in the world that have a world championship well hikaro has the fisher random world championship he's not playing in this event i i don't even know why by the way like i was seeing mixed reports he he went on a recap he said uh he wasn't playing wesley wasn't playing because of a lack i don't know it was like communications i but then i saw on social media that and i saw on his stream as well that he was invited he just chose not to play i don't know cuz he has to prepare for the candidates i don't know what's happening i don't i can't relay anything that i don't know all i know is that magnus is defending a pawn down endgame against al resa fuja and let me tell you something this is not looking very good rook to e1 rook e8 and the question is will the knight take the bishop and go to a rook end game and the answer is yes now one thing magnus will not do here is this if you are defending a rook end game you do not want to end up with one rook each you're only of counterplay will come by keeping your rooks on the board i tell you guys this every recap hopefully you're learning something rook e7 rook d2 and the way white is going to win this end game is white is going to uh go for something like this uh i'm not saying right away but white will go for this and this is completely winning in a you know with a king here like provided there's no counterplay if white gets the pawns moving the game is over completely rook a2 that's it you you just it's too many pawns it's too many pawns i i don't care if you have one rook two rook three rook five rook eight rooks doesn't matter if i have eight rooks you have eight rooks you're going to lose um that's the idea so aliv resa is just making preparations magnus knows his time is limited he has to fight back so d4 fine that's another way to play to try to play rook c5 right cuz al res is looking to simplify rook e1 check rook f1 the only way is the only way to play ali resa messes up magnus here was trying to put the pawn here and make the king that's and maybe go rook a1 and maybe go rook a3 he's trying to defend this actively right ali resa's best option was to go here apparently and the point is that if black plays f5 you go for a rook trade that's the point um if rook h1 king here then you know maybe rook e2 maybe aliv resa probably wasn't comfortable giving up this but apparently he can just walk his king and he's fine um in city he plays rook c3 and now magnus is back in the game and in this position the move g6 leaving this rank completely covered is supposedly holding for black you can lose this pawn because after rook e3 king h2 f4 white's king is in a is is stuck in actually black is winning can you believe that so you can't take on c7 what you can do is offer a trade of rooks f4 king f3 rook g1 and if white go king g4 you can play here and if there's a trade and i started eating your pawns wait wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute you can't take because rook takes g2 and this that's the i mean this is crazy stuff this is absolutely dank this is ridiculous and you know what you do in this position you move your king because you can't take that's what the what what so magnus's drawing idea was to play g6 and if rook f2 he had to find this this this o oops this this this this this king g7 king f6 king h6 because of the mate i mean i mean i he's the best endgame player of all time but that's crazy and he plays the human move which is trying to bring the king to join the pawns but that gives ali resa time to go here which is the same setup and again it's just a matter of time f4 king f3 and remember previously black has to avoid a trade of rooks because that's the only way but now now king g4 now king g4 and um the difference between this king g4 and this king g4 rather not this king g4 uh this king g4 the difference is position of the pawn the position of the king and uh those squares were cut off but now they're not cut off so because those squares are not cut off you don't have any checkmating ideas do you understand the point in this position the pawns create a wall and it's actually a mate but in there's no mate here so you don't you can't have that ali resa is now two pawns up and he's the best endgame player of all time but the king escapes which the king couldn't have done in the previous version of this because the pawn was on g6 which is crazy stuff there was a mating idea defensively ali reses up two pawns uh al resa wins the game ali resa just beat magnus carlson for the first time in a class ial chess game now admittedly we got this goofy setup it's not a it's not it's not a real chess but this event is blowing my mind because ali reza the young guy won no abdur of is six and a half out of eight murdering people and tomorrow if ding doesn't beat him he's going to be undefeated he's going to be in the semi-finals he hasn't lost the game is this was this the goal like is the goal of events like this to level the playing field because i feel like we're we're we're we're going to make some very serious question marks about the top chess players in the world is noirre the most talented chess player in the world like i straight up have no idea i have no idea what this means is this going to be as equally respected as a form of chess as regular chess where there's no openings don't know but no wins fabiano wins this one is a draw and magnus is on the ropes magnus has to beat al res tomorrow with white so does ding listen i put more money on magnus if i'm a betting man cuz he's going to get the white pieces and he's in good form ding is half out of seven i mean half out of eight he's half out of eight oh my god oh my god that's all i have for you today i'll see you all tomorrow get out of here
