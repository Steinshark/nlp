you can cool a computer with hot air and heat from a computer in a small confined space equals well uh a whole lot of swath fortunately i have a solution by encasing my computer and this here grow tent i want to be cool as a cucumber cool just like our sponsor zoho desk over 50 000 businesses worldwide trust zoho's contacts to our help desk to improve productivity and ensure their customers are kept happy get 50 off your annual subscription with code zdesk50 at the link down below to start i'd like to thank the mining community for the glut of cheap gpus that they just flooded the market with and also the idea to encase your computer in a land grow tent now with gaming computers just drawing so many watts these days it might make sense to do this with a single gaming computer instead of a whole mining rack before we get to it though i want to just describe why this idea actually isn't all that dumb there are a number of ways to try and cool down in the summer you could just point a fan at your face but that doesn't fix the fact that your room is still super hot cracking a window can also work when it's cool outside but on the days when you need it the most the air from the outside is probably hotter than the air inside your house another option would be to install an air conditioner but that comes with its own whole set of problems if you only have a single circuit in your room there's a good chance that running an air conditioner and a gaming pc at the same time will result in tripping a breaker second cost our grow tent cost us only 65 dollars while an okayish air conditioner starts at 10 times that also i'm sure your friends on discord won't be super stoked when you're running a compressor right next to your mic and it doesn't get to the root problem that we have you're creating a bunch of heat in a small little room i have air conditioning that's in my apartment but that does not help me when i'm sealed in this room just poaching in my own sweat which brings us to the final option just open the door maybe well if you live alone then sure but yelling at your useless teammate in rocket league can be rather disturbing for the others in your house and unfortunately the doors here have to stay closed so alright then row 10 it is let's go and build it all right let's see what we're working with here i got this grow tent from amazon for sixty five dollars the reviews for it were fine but at the same time no one was using it to cool a pc so i also saw this one's two feet by two feet but some reviews of grow tents not this one specifically they were like oh it says it was two feet by two feet but it's actually more like one and a half if that's the case we're screwed oh my god that's a that's green right there i can already tell this is not going to be a girlfriend approved setup but there it is look at these instructions step one frame step two put the thing on they're not wrong but that's not the most helpful [music] [applause] in fairness to vo sun this seems pretty self-explanatory i don't think we're going to have any trouble putting this together one slightly unfortunate thing about doing it this way is that this is a lot bigger than my computer in one direction two feet is about perfect to fit a normal desktop problem is uh my desktop is definitely not two feet wide and it's definitely definitely not 36 inches tall this is going to be way bigger than it needs to be but at the same time the smallest one i could get wait david what do you think these are for horizontal reinforcement did not improve the structural rigidity at all we can worry about those later yeah why is this what's holding it together okay feels not too bad now i can dig this i am slightly confused about all the other stuff we have i wonder if we get better performance with or without the intakes covered we'll find that out later oh yeah it's one of those things where they said that it was adjustable but never mentioned how adjustable it was or like what the sizes were or anything like that i don't know if our tubing is going gonna fit in there okay well this is pretty unfortunate i asked for insulated tubing specifically because it was black on the outside um we did not get the right one this is so weird okay is it gonna work though can we just chuck it in like that duct tape it up and call it a day it'll need some work but that's gonna be just fine here's the basic plan i have terrible terrible awful casement windows need to make a big ol adapter for it that's what this is going to be so we have this right here hose adapter also a big acrylic paint so hopefully i don't block too much light my favorite thing about this design though is that i had sarah go ahead and draw me an elephant this right here when the hose comes out it should look like the elephant's trunk i'm very stoked okay let's do it before we try cutting the big elephant which is going to take about half an hour i want to just try etching a couple small ones get the settings dialed in and then we can do the full thing and know that's going to turn out great i'm super glad we tested out the etching of the elephant first because we had a little bit of a problem the laser you know it travels fast but when it has to do a tight corner it slows down and then accelerates back up normally what you do in that situation is lower the amount of power that it's putting out problem is we're already pretty much as low as our laser will go it's too powerful what we're doing today instead what i've done is defocused it so you know we have a nice large beam it disperses way more heat and hopefully we won't just have an elephant fall out of our piece at the end as a bonus with these settings it's only going to take like 10 minutes to attach your big sheet of acrylic to the window i'm going to make a bunch of little clamps out of hdpe the material is a little bit overkill but it also is the absolute perfect piece of material for the job and i had a big piece of it laying around it actually made this right here the little extractor thingy what the is called david i don't know dust collector there we go got it [music] i love this we have such high utilization of the shop right now we're going to be doing this at the same time the laser's cutting our stuff out and if you come over here our 3d prints have just started this is going to take us 14 hours i really wish we had the pantheon at this point in time but uh we don't so we're running two of them because one of them fails we are completely screwed when we arrive here tomorrow to cut our hdpe we're using this absolutely beautiful single flute we can send it through the stuff at like 160 inches per minute freaking crazy actually it's going to take half a while because i need to swap out the tools for every single one i'm trying some new scalloping stuff should have just set it up on the tormach but whatever looks like our elephant's done i'm excited let's see here oops look at that we need to take the backing off but heck yeah all right first clamp hope this goes well [applause] we need to get a tool changer for this thing avid cnc make one i would love it everyone would love it okay i didn't need to slow it down a little bit got kind of wavy there on the side but overall parts good just need to make seven more of them and i'll see you tomorrow when that's done instead of yesterday taking the time to make all of them i took the time to optimize the g-code for it so no more tool change look at that david and was all done with this flat end mill one of these only takes one minute and 30 seconds now it's wonderful we'll have a bunch of them just in case something goes wrong anyway let's go over here i don't know why i was ever concerned that these might fail both of them turned out perfectly only problem is that uh it's blue it's very blue so well the router makes a couple more of those parts i'm gonna paint this black unfortunately nicholas who actually knows how to paint things is way too busy today so i had to do it just don't look too closely out of david pretty please a wonderful thing though this shop jacket we're finally releasing it holy frig come on over here so as you've probably seen in a bunch of our videos i have absolutely tortured this poor prototype and it's held up very well we took a lot of inspiration from the savage apron if you're doing things like grinding welding that sort of crap this will keep you nice and safe go and grab it you can put a pens here i was slightly concerned about the acrylic it's just kind of a brittle material so if we're getting halfway through the day and it explodes we're just completely screwed so i made this one right here out of wood as well it is going to block the light coming through the window but at the same time i know it's not going to explode we do have a little bit of a problem it got a little bit burned and i'm having trouble cleaning it off instead of screwing around getting all the charcoal off for a while i think i'm just going to give it a little bit of a burn and then it'll look consistent hopefully all right i think it's about time to pack her up and take it all to my house and we can see if this actually works what you want to do first david in case the computer or figure out the window figure out the winner figure out the window yeah i was thinking that too all right let's do it i think the easiest way to go about this is to just remove this whole desk it's going to be a pain thank you nice you could also just go kind of over yeah over now i did do the math it should take only about two and a half minutes to heat that room up by five degrees using my computer irl there's so many more factors like how warm your walls are they're going to suck in a bunch of heat how much heat's coming in or leaving through your windows like how where the sun is is going to make a huge difference depending on if it's coming in through the window so calculating is a bit difficult we did run a test though in 45 minutes that room increased in temperature by three degrees which is a lot when you think about it difference between 25 and 28 degrees is the difference between me personally being comfortable and not not to mention that typically we'll have a gaming session that lasts for longer than 45 minutes and you can see what ends up pretty unpleasant after a little while yes the best parts trey in hindsight this is a bit overkill eight quarter 20 bolts like these especially high strength ones probably good for most deep sea pressure vessels uh definitely gonna hold this together though i don't know if this is gonna work the kerf of the laser was a little bit too much and it means that some of our holes aren't quite large enough now i did try drilling it out but it's it's just going to blow it right up like also try the deburring tool it's not working i think we need to swap over the wood we're gonna want to protect it a little bit just got some simple mineral oil here it's not perfect for this situation but it's way better than nothing okay this is working i do think i will swap to the acrylic later because uh this side plus a grow tent neighbors might not be too happy oh pretty please oh we did it where did my hammer go oh he's taking me out of 105 for just a little bit it's suddenly william osman vibes all over the place but haven't i fixed a kit and multiple sets of hex keys guess which size i don't have all right this is really solid i'll put the cad files down below so if you guys want to you know do something like this with your casement windows you can to move the air from our grow tent out the window we are going to be using this ruck six inch fan does not show it off at all david okay perfect the good news is also it has a low setting if you don't want to have it be quite that loud oops where do you think we want this fan david maybe just down here on the floor it seems like a not too bad spot okay cool fiberglass dust don't breathe this one thing that's very unfortunate about this is that the uh tent is pretty freaking big so this monitor i feel like it's just gonna have to go funny story by the way i got this as an upgrade for my main monitor it is in every single way a better monitor except the osd is so bad that i don't use it okay what's the best way to do this because if we go like that all the cords can come up in over there and this goes out this way oh i really wish they had a smaller one yeah i guess it's gonna have to be how it goes yeah there's all the cords i was excited for like a little bit there when i was like oh this is probably actually gonna work i'm not what do you think out the side or out the top he goes at the top right now at the top it's one of those rare times that duct tape is actually getting used for its intended purpose i watched a bunch of red green last night can you tell should we dry run it see how she goes yeah that was kind of underwhelming if i'm honest like it is working really well sucking lots of air this isn't the best zipper in the world i might have to crack this seems to work though way quieter than i expected there's so much airflow coming in under this door all right let's put a pc in there plugging in peripherals is not the easiest um i have to remember to turn on the pc before we uh close her up there we go all of our air is going to be intaked right beside where our computer is bringing in air and then hopefully all of it just gets yeeted out oh this isn't great it's a bit intrusive it's uh you mean i can't even see it uh maybe up on the desk that's good i'm sure the missus will really like that this is her uh office space now in fairness the missus does way more work here than i ever do at mine so this will probably get way more use now i think we've done it let's turn it on barely can hear it bare okay i can i can hear it the temperature of this room has started dropping because just pulling in air from the rest of the apartment that is a little bit cooler right now moment of truth no prime95 vermark it's currently 26.6 degrees in here so if it's what 30.6 when we come back we failed in the last 45 minutes we have dropped 0.4 degrees in this room 0.3 right now actually so it does look like our cpu got 3 degrees hotter than our original run but that said if we just simply played games for another 45 minutes with it before the ambient air would be hotter the cpu would be hotter you know the speeds are exactly the same it got a tiny bit hotter in here but this room is absolute night and day and what's extra impressive by this time normally even without a computer on this room is getting pretty hot and now it's so cold this was a huge win david yeah i love it draw
