i have coded well over a 100 projects as a programmer in all kinds of languages from python javascript to even the abomination that is java so in this video i wanted to give you my five favorite projects that i've ever built that you can possibly take inspiration from and all of these projects have a special place in my heart for different reasons some of them are great beginner projects that were some of the projects that really made programming click from me in my brain that you could do if you're a beginner some of these are especially great resume projects that will make your resume stand out and help you get a job well some of these are just extremely fun and will make you appreciate the art and skill of programming by building something truly enjoyable and interesting i believe every coding project that i have made whether i finished it or not has taught me some lesson or has left me with at least one new skill that i can add to my programming repertoire and if there's just one thing that you take away from this video be it this coding projects is the pathway for anyone to go from zero to become a great programmer because when you actually apply your skills in practice that is when these skills actually get ingrained inside of your brain so you don't have to c these projects but i hope that either these projects themselves or just the lessons i've gained from these projects can teach you something that can make you a better programmer and if that happens make sure to hit the like button it's completely free by the way so let's start with the first project which is a tax calculator application now this has a special place in my heart because it was the first big project projects that i ever coded with my coding skills you might remember a course called cs50 which i've talked about a bunch in the very early days of my channel that was a course that really sparked my interest in programming and this very project was the sort of capstone project that i built for that course and it was the first time i really felt like damn i actually know how to code i actually coded something interesting that i would actually really want to use myself the way it would work is that you can input a gross salary in any currency be the us dollar and then the application would out put the net salary of the taxes in any given country that you input into the application now in terms of a coding project is not actually the most complex project even though it might seem like it the most complicated part of the project is actually just figuring out and reading the tax rules of every country which can get quite complicated but as a programming project it is definitely on the beginner end and it's a really great beginner project if you're into very boring tax stuff like i am and it's great because it's useful it's easy to understand for any anyone within like 5 seconds and it was related to something that i genuinely was interested in and i wanted to so and it showed me that even just with quite basic programming skills like literally just the basics of python and the basics of floss which was the server where i hosted this on i was able to build something like this now of course it doesn't look the nicest you could expand it by actually making the ui look a bit nicer but it was useful and that was just really cool to me but the bigger lesson from this project is that you want to start off building something you actually want to build even if you just have basic coding skills if you just get creative you'd be surprised how many things you can do with just the basics and if you just pick something that you actually want to build even if you don't know how to build it yet and you just stop building it you'll be surprised how far you can actually go with just the help of google.com second one is an algorithms visualize it now this is one of the best resume projects you can build and i will tell you why in a second but essentially the idea is that i just took some computer science algorithms like for example the death for search and breath for search algorithms which are essentially graph path finding algorithms and i figured out how could i visualize these algorithms because i was also learning about these algorithms at the same time so i was like why not combine this into an actually interesting coding project where i not only get to practice coding up these algorithms but also applying them to a nice visual fronted i've also built one for sorting algorithms earlier where basically works like this where you just click on different sorting algorithms and it just visualizes how the sorting happen which gives you an idea of how these algorithms differ from each other and the reason why this project is such a great resume project is because it hits the three key building blocks of all great resume projects number one they have visual i.e when a recruiter looks at the project they can instantly understand what it does a recruiter is not going to spend ton of time trying to understand what your convoluted project does no no no it needs to be visual and easy to understand number two while it is easy to understand it still shows deep programming knowledge literally by building a project like this you're not only showing that you have front and development skills because you can build a cool ui like this but it also shows that you understand death resarch and breath for such algorithms which are exactly the kinds of skills that these employers actually look for and number three it solves a genuine problem like something like this is genuinely a useful educational tool for anyone who wants to sort of see the difference between these two algorithm now i've actually built a full mini course on how to build this maze path finding visualizer over on zero to mastery which you can access for like literally like 30 bucks or something like that if you're not aware zero to mastery is basically a coding course platform it's like the netflix spot for coding course where just pay one very affordable subscription you get access to like 60 coding courses in just one platform and if you're not sure where to start they have a career quiz where you can essentially just answer a few questions about what kind of developer you want to be what your goals are and it's just going to suggest to you different courses that you can do on that platform they have full road maps for all kinds of different programming paths like web development they have javascript python blockchain development literally anything you could think of they've also just released a brand new career path called the become an ai developer path that will teach you everything you need to know to become an ai developer from zero including new courses like the prompt engineering boot camp as well as a project course on building a chatbot with no typescript and the open ai assistance api then they also have project related courses where you can go through some of these courses and build the project together with the instructor as you go and as you learn something new as well and on top of the courses they have a discord support community that you get access to with 400,000 active members where you have different channels for different program programming languages and things like this they have instructors and t who will help you inside of the community if you're stuck they also have courses on making your resume different career hunting tips and of course upon completing any course you get a full certificate to prove that you have the skills if you're interested in zero to mastery i partnered with them for this video and if you use my affiliate link down below with a discount code friends 10 you also get a nice discount on the platform so with that said let's move on to project number three which is actually going to be just a category of project it's going to be finance automation project now this is another sort of passion project for me because i'm really interested in personal finances tracking my personal finances understanding how much money i'm saving where i'm spending my money things like the i've built several scripts to do that i have a full tutorial on my channel like one of the earlier ones that i did i've made better ones ever since and i'm now building a full finance dashboard where i get to connect my bank accounts to this dashboard and see a full review of my finances in one place i think is really cool and i'm making another video on that topic by the way that's going to be linked somewhere down below when it's ready the way this works is that you get to essentially import a csv of your bank transactions and then you have a script inside of python that will automatically pass it it will find the transactions it will categorize them and then over time you get to build the sort of database of your financi information and the reason why i didn't want to use just the banking apps is because i have a lot of different bank accounts in many different countries as well i want to have one place where i can integrate all of it in one place and this is genuinely something that's been very very useful to me and something that would be super again impressive on a resume as as well specifically because it solves a real problem it's easy to understand and it also shows the programming knowledge because i'm combining multiple different skills like passing csvs python scripting even visualization of the build full dashboard for myself these are the kinds of projects you really want to think about where you can combine multiple different skills together to really solve a problem and the fourth one is my most ambitious project that i've ever built and it's really more than a project it's actually my tech startup that we built last year it's called boxio it's essentially a productivity app that lives on your desktop that allows you to essentially automatically close different files tabs and apps inside of your computer when you're moving from let's say one task to another for example let's say you're working on a coding project you have certain tabs certain apps and certain files you want to have open when you're working on that project but then let's say you want to stop working on that and go do something else like plan your travels for example i'm traveling right now it's a bit cumbersome to manually have to close everything on your computer and then open up everything new related to the new thing that you want to do with boxio the idea is that you can create these boxes inside of this sidebar you have on your computer and then just by clicking between these boxes you can open up these different sets of tabs files and apps in just one click now we were doing this as a business with two other co-founders actually the business side of it didn't succeed we've actually scrapped this data but the application still exists you can actually still download it for completely free on the website we just didn't see enough retention to warrant spending time on this and really trying to grow this into a business so we decided to scrb it but from an engineering perspective it's pretty freaking impressive what we were able to build but as an aside it just also goes to show that just because your project is impressive from an engineering perspective doesn't mean that it's going to make for a great business as we blood but i'm still super glad i did this because building this thing which is like my ambitious project of my coding career literally made me into a totally new engineer i learned skills that i would never have learned as coding smaller project like not just on the technical side but on the interpersonal side as well coding a real project with someone else that you don't have to code a full startup to do this but you can literally like take someone else who you know is learning to code and try to build a pretty ambitious project together if nothing else this is literally going to show to employes that you have software engineering skills because you have gone out of the way to build something a lot more ambitious and impressive than any other candidate that they're probably going to get so the lesson here and what i recommend to all of you maybe not if you're a beginner but at some point just pick one really like big and impressive like a bold project that you really want to build and just startop building it just like don't you not have to rush it but just like build a couple of new things every single day and like over time over months or years that is going to grow into something pretty impressive and without noticing your skills as an engineer are literally going to skyrocket to the next level you don't have to build something this big straight away but do start thinking about having something like this on the side because who knows maybe it turns out that the next billion dollar tech startup probably won't though and last but not least we have something a bit fun i actually built a tinder bot that is actually super fun this is like my fun project on this list essentially the way it works is that i was using the web version of tinder and i built a web scraper essentially just go and automatically swipe on everyone on tinder and then automatically send messages to all of them as well essentially i didn't have to spend any time swiping or even messaging i would just message everyone some generic message and then i could just see who responds now of course the problem is i got no matches so um it's a bit of an issue but other than that it was a really really fun project and i really got to use web scribing skills it was really the first web scribing project that i built and this was really fun and it really reminded me that really the skill of coding at the end of the day is really just about having fun like you want to be having fun throughout the process when you're coding because if you're doing that again you're going to stick to coding a lot more if you can build something that's really cool you can tell your friend like oh lol i built this thing that does this like this is really really interesting so that's the lesson there don't just build serious projects try to build something a bit fun as well that's just going to make you so much more excited about the skill of coding now i hope you enjoyed this video the point of this video is not even to talk about these specific ideas but sort of the lessons along the way what kinds of projects you want to be thinking about building what kinds of projects you might want to have on your portfolio as a programmer at the end of the day it doesn't matter what you build as long as you're building something new every single week every single month that is slightly harder slightly more complex than what you built before that's teaching you new skills you are going to be moving forward as a programmer with that said if your goal is specifically to build the best resume projects to just get that first job as fast as possible so you can start actually earning money with your coding skills i recommend you watch this video right here where i specifically give you five really impressive python resume projects they can finish in literally just one weekend this is literally the fastest way for you to build an impressive looking resume that's going to make you stand out as a programmer so i recommend you go watch that video right there if however you want to see the video about the tinder ball i actually made a video about that on the channel you can also watch that right there with that said keep on coding projects and i will see you in the next one
