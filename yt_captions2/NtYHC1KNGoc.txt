it's a debate as old as time or roughly eight years whichever you consider older which language should you learn first sea or rust to help me settle this debate i've recruited some friends of mine from college to give us their opinions on the topic so my name is kyle uc berkeley2022 go bears and i'm a rust programmer doesn't know what a segvault is hey i'm chuck carnegie mellon 1984 and i couldn't see now before i tell you which language you should learn first it's important that we talk about what c is versus what rust is c is the foundation of basically everything that's on the internet every device you hold in your pocket or it runs in your house like your router your fridge your phone are all based off the seed language actually the entire world really runs based off of devices that are coded in c now c is a language that's like literally 51 years old at this point so it's a language that has definitely seen the test of time but because of that doesn't have a lot of the same safety features that other languages like rust have actually that's that's not really true and see you can do like whatever the hell you want you can access memory at any address that's mapped to your process you can allocate memory on the heap you can free memory from the heat you can do basically whatever you want see it's pretty awesome but with great power comes great responsibility using c you're literally able to do whatever you want which means you're able to write code that is dangerous and unsafe if you don't know what you're doing okay he's got he's got a point there now rust is an entirely different language that's meant to do the same tasks as seas rust is defined as a systems programming language which means that it's meant to run in places where c can also run to think operating systems embedded platforms they need to be able to have high performance and rust can give you that all right here's the deal all i'm going to say blazingly fast type safe keg stands yeah listen i know that no one uses a language it's complicated to use now while rust is a young language it is slowly coming into maturity rust actually last year in 2022 made its first appearance in the linux kernel it's it's in it's in the linux kernel technically and kind of windows what that's the only place that it's used in real life yeah i mean that's that's fine i mean safety rust does have a higher barrier to entry if you're not an experienced programmer things like the borrow checker for example make doing things that should be simple or feel simple in a language like c much more complicated than but there's a reason for that rust is not letting you write the code again pilot and violating the borrow checker because it's not letting you create unsafe code this is an extremely important distinction between the two languages one c gives you all the power and all the responsibility rust takes some of that away from you but also gives you guard rails that stops you from making dumb decisions frat parties i'm doing them you're not you we we can't say that we can't say that here okay my bad my bad so to answer the question of this video which language should you learn my answer is both and before you get mad at me and say that i debated you with this video the answer is both but in a very particular order the order you should learn these languages in is learn see first learn rust later and there's a reason that i feel that way learning c first allows you to understand how processors work by writing programs that use variables that use pointers that use structures that read data off of a file off of the network you learn the fundamentals of how computers work learning c even if you don't use c makes you a better programmer you know the ins and outs only one layer above assembly of what is going on inside of the processor that is so important for a programmer to know you literally have to know that to be an effective programmer and i would argue any field except for maybe web or if they just don't care about memory performance anymore and every web app that i see takes up giga bytes in my browser but other than web you need to know how the computer works and that's really what you get from c have you heard of garbage collection who gives a now rust on the other hand should be learned second the reason it should be learned second is because rust puts guard rails around you that may be frustrating if you don't understand why they're there by learning c first you will make mistakes you are going to write code that is going to crash your computer you're going to crash your program you're going to write network code that's vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks your second ball you're gonna make a whole bunch of mistakes you're then going to go in from c and you're gonna go learn rust and be like wow i cannot make these mistakes again no matter how hard i try in rust once the code compiles i can't make my code vulnerable by doing that you'll take the knowledge that c gives you and the power that rust gives you and take that to your next job and be a 10x engineer i guarantee it but before you do that go watch this video that will also help you in your programming journey click
