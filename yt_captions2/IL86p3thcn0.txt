the rust foundation is recovering from what may have been one of the biggest public relations blunders in the history of programming we're not sure what i'm talking about the russ foundation recently put out a request for comments for the initial draft of its trademark policy regarding the rust language every language typically has a foundation and associated trademark this is very common for a programming language to do but why was the response to russ so bad so bad actually that a particular set of members forked the rust language and renamed it crablang in protest to the trademark policy and the anticipated clampdown of the use of the word rust and cargo so how did we get here what is the history of the trademark policy and why was it received so poorly so in august of 2022 internal to the rust foundation the rust foundation and the rust team came up with their first initial draft of the trademark policy in january of this year the russ foundation and the russ team sought legal counsel to make sure that the trademark policy was legally binding and then in april of this year 2023 the rust foundation put that trademark policy as a request for comment to the community we're looking at it right here the initial draft there are a couple things that make sense in this policy but a couple things that don't make any sense let's walk through them the first one is pretty straightforward basically you can't use the rust name or the rust logo to make a profit or selling commercial goods so for example if i'm at a low-level learning t-shirt and i had the russ logo on it i would be using the rust logo to turn a profit for myself and that violates trademark policy sure that makes total sense as we go down the list here they start to get a little a little weirder though so for example showing support of rust while showing your support for the rust project on a personal site or blog you may use the name or logo as long as you abide by all requirements in the policy basically you can't show that you have a commercial affiliation with rust and that you're not a member of the rust foundation again not so weird but you're getting into this territory where now there's a weird gray zone about what is and isn't okay after this it gets a little more odd where for example you may use the rust name in book or article titles and the logo and graphic components as long as you make it clear that the rust foundation has not reviewed approved or endorsed your content so people started really getting mad about this one because the ross foundation you would think is trying to make the rust language as usable and as widely spread as possible and you could argue that this rule here makes it difficult for content creators like myself to make tutorials or videos about rust without fear of being of infringing the trademark policy and then the rest of these say basically that you can use the word you can use the logo ferris for example for as freely as you want and a couple other questions a couple other points that you know don't really matter it's important though that we talk about do other languages have policies like this one being for example python python the language is owned by the python foundation the python software foundation and yes the python language actually does have a trademark policy you'll see that it has very similar things to the rust policy that came out in april so for example you cannot use the python thong logo or the or the words python company or python language to make a commercial profit for example the commercial use of the trademarks is strictly prohibited also you have to get explicit approval to alter the logo of python and use that in any setting so why was this received the python trademark policy so much better than the rust policy i would argue it was the transparency and delivery by the rust community if you read the first paragraph of the python trademark policy they explicitly call out the general goals the spirit of the law as it applies to the trademark policy for python all they want is for the words python or the trademarks to not be used to refer to any other language in a way that is misleading about the modules or tools and make sure that nothing is commercially associated with python that was not put out by the pothon software foundation or in a way that confuses the community as to whether or not python is open source and free to use basically taking a module and commercializing it and selling it as a for-profit module for python this is in my opinion the primary difference between the python execution of the trademark policy and the rust execution of the trademark policy no one from the rusk foundation put out a blog post or a video and said hey this is the reason why they kind of just dumped some legal jargon into a document and basically confuse the community the community came back in that request for comments and gave a ton of comments either in the form that the rust foundation put out for comment or on twitter for example and in response a few days later the rust foundation put out this blog post which was received even worse in the request for comments so on april 12th this blog post came out where they pretty much say what was the purpose of making the trademark policy how did they approach it and they try to touch on the feedback here but they actually don't go about addressing any of the concerns from the community all they do is they highlight a bit of harassment they've been getting which again is a bad thing but this blog post made a lot of people feel like the rust foundation was going on the defense like they were trying to play victim here and not actually addressing any of the concerns that the community had this trademark policy left a lot of people confused like this one redditor here who says hey i have a package called rust maven plug-in the use of the word rust is in my cargo package am i going to get in trouble with the rust foundation for doing it this way and he he or she or only one of a lot of people who are equally concerned can i say i'm a rest of my resume etc right so in response to all of these comments and concerns on reddit twitter and in the formal process that they documented the russ foundation wrote this article on april 17th basically saying during the consultation period it became clear that many people in the community had questions concerns and confusion surrounding the policy draft and the group overseeing it the consultation phase of the policy drafting process intended to give russ community members the opportunity to review the first state basically they go about saying that they acknowledge that they weren't transparent enough and in the future they're going to go forward with more transparency i would argue that the dan image is already done there's already been a rift built between the community and the foundation as to the execution of this policy trademark law is intentionally vague granted i'm not a lawyer but the idea is that it just creates a framework that if a bad actor takes advantage of the trademark of rust of cargo it gives the rust foundation an opportunity to hold them accountable that being said it does create a very odd gray zone that if you don't describe what the purpose behind it is or the purpose behind the law is it can leave people in a state of confusion and concern for not only their content but possibly their careers this is the primary issue with the russ foundation's delivery of this policy unintentionally they gave very vague and unclear guidance as to what the purpose behind the policy was and in doing that essentially confuse the entire community and left people worried about the state of the language let me know what you think down in the comments below also hit subscribe my fingers over here in the wrong alongside i got a green screen going on and then also go watch the this video which i think you will enjoy just as much as this one
