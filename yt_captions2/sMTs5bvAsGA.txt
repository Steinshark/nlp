when this happened earphones with wires went out of style practically overnight but bluetooth headphones aren't perfect there's the connection issues the poor repairability the limited battery life the list goes on which is why the wire has been making a big comeback lately but what to buy the best selling wired earphones on amazon are these they're certainly affordable but they sound like crap these meanwhile use premium planar magnetic drivers for audiophile grade sound but they cost a month's rent where's the middle ground right right here now i was skeptical that a 100 pair of headphones could possibly offer similar performance to a pair that costs over a thousand but then i heard they were tuned by the one and only critical and that you can turn these wireless for a total cost that is less than a pair of airpods which made me think what's the catch and where's the message from our sponsor thorum thorum makes elegant rings out of unique materials from meteorite to dinosaur fossils use code lct to get 20 off today and stay tuned to learn more this isn't the first time we've covered planar magnetic driver technology on this channel but it's likely the smallest now hold on linus you keep saying those words planar magnetic but what do they mean let me explain most headphones well really most audio products at all use dynamic drivers a dynamic driver consists of a coil of wire that is attached to a flexible diaphragm typically a cone like in this woofer or a dome like this tweeter the coil is surrounded by magnets and is suspended in the magnetic field when an electrical signal is applied to the coil it moves back and forth translating its vibrations to the diaphragm which then moves the air around it creating sound planar magnetic drivers on the other hand use a flat diaphragm made of lightweight plastic typically with thin conductive wire etched along the surface the diaphragm is positioned between two magnets on either side of the driver and these magnets move the entire diaphragm at once why is this beneficial well in a nutshell it offers more precise control over the diaphragm's movement reducing distortion and contributing to the planar magnetic driver's unique sound signature which is often described as clean and punchy planar magnetic drivers also tend to be larger contributing to superior bass response does this make planar magnetic headphones automatically better not really dynamic drivers benefit from a 50-year head start over planar magnetics so a lot of engineering and manufacturing expertise has gone into overcoming their weaknesses plus compared to planar magnetics they are more compact and they require less power to operate there's always trade-offs right but anyway we're not talking about headphones today we're talking about earphones thanks to some recent manufacturing advances great sounding planar magnetics can be so small now that they will fit inside your ear canals and over the past couple of years an explosion of planar magnetic in-ear monitors or iems has flooded the market how does an explosion flood anything how great do they sound well twelve hundred dollars great according to odyssey one of the best known innovators in the planer magnetic space but how could something so small be so gosh darn expensive when the competing product is less than a tenth the price let's take a look the outer box of the odyssey euclids leaves a fair bit to be desired but the inside is simple filament is that a gosh darn pelican case like pelican brand ip67 water and dust resistant case yes and inside that is plenty of goodies like eight different pairs of ear tips a cleaning brush a little pouch to hold all your accessories oh and a pair of swappable mmcx cables that terminate in either a three and a half millimeter headphone plug or a 4.4 millimeter balanced connector what's the difference you might ask well for you the end user pretty much nothing in terms of audio quality other than that one is bigger yeah they also include some pretentious nonsense why would you have the user guide on a piece of paper when you could have it on a card that you can use to spread thermal compound very handy thank you but this is not nonsense look at these these gorgeous specimens consist of a milled aluminum housing with the caps adorned with carbon fiber these are bound to be a conversation starter when they're in your ear but they are kind of monstrous maybe they won't stand out that much compared to some wireless earphones but the thing to remember is guys these don't have any antennas in them no batteries what they do have though is an' millimeter driver that is nearly three quarters of an inch for context the sennheiser ie600s that i liked so much when i covered them on short circuit used dynamic drivers that are less than half the diameter which sounds smaller but in terms of actual area is less than 1 6 the size but wait what's that is it the sound of an incredible deal from a chinese audio manufacturer it is let's talk about the 7 hertz x critical sal notes dyoko an iem with a long name and a short price the much much lower price doesn't stop them from including six sets of ear tips and a surprisingly nice carrying case i mean it's no pelican or anything but it still feels like the sort of thing that could easily be sold for 10 maybe 15 bucks standalone which is an impressive value but are the headphones themselves impressive too well from a design perspective they sure are definitely something the outer shell is sapphire coated tempered glass making them kind of reminiscent of jewelry it looks kind of like you're uh plugging your ears with precious amethyst bobbles the body is made of cnc aluminum and houses a pair of 14.6 millimeter planar magnetic drivers that is significantly smaller than the odyssey euclids but still much larger than the ie600s like the you clips that come with a nice braided cable though perhaps not quite as nice due to the lack of rotation at the earbud and the less common two pin connector what makes these notable though is not just the fact that they offer planar magnetic tech at a price that people can actually afford but the fact that they were tuned by audiophile extraordinaire critical he worked with 7 hertz the manufacturer to create a product that both met his quality standards and aligned with his sound preferences and tuning a headphone is no small task it involves many many different variables the dimensions of the driver the electrical signal processing the amount of air on either side of the driver and so much more and with his reputation as a taste maker i've got to say having critical's name attached to a product does give me a lot more confidence that these things won't be crap like this isn't some you know athlete celebrity endorsement or something but still confidence isn't enough let's send them away to be measured oh my god he had one job starting at the low end we can see that the docos have a prominent bump in the sub bass that will provide plenty of rumble and power odyssey opted to forgo this which is not inherently bad but it does show us right out of the gate that these two companies have taken a very different approach to their tuning in the base regions both headphones look largely the same meaning that you can expect a similar intensity in the bass notes that you hear rather than the ones that you feel then making our way into the upper mids our specimens start to diverge again the diocos have more presence in the midst with some peaks near two and three thousand hertz which could make them sound shouty but could also accentuate upper female vocals then there's these peaks at 8 000 hertz and 10 000 hertz that could be cause for concern especially if you're sensitive to sibilance it means sounds like s and t in speech could be loud and instruments like symbols and crunchy distortion on guitars could come across as sharp or fatiguing the euclids meanwhile offer a much milder treble experience that to my ears sounds great i mean there is no question that these are audiophile great i mean they bloody well better be for twelve hundred dollars but really they will impress your snobby friend that only listens to hotel california and steely dan and will definitely show you the benefit of the higher audio quality on our videos over at floatplane.com the euclids manage excellent detail and smooth response in the upper treble that some might call laid back but for my ears felt just right i'd call them pleasantly warm i did find the base a little lacking making my preferred pop tunes sound a bit dead though ballads really shine and the reality of it is that's nothing that can't be fixed with a little bit of eq tuning as for critical's offering well the diocos have the sub bass that i was missing with the euclids for sure but i found that the upper base was lacking like they rumble but they could use a bit more punch and those high peaks in the treble range made things detailed but i found them to be a bit much in some tracks as for the dipped low mids they made even fine male vocalists sound a little boring the rest of the treble region though was detailed and quite delightful as for the sound stage it was fine and comparable to my ears to the euclids overall i actually ended up liking these a bit more but most of the reason for that came down to comfort not audio quality both of them are massive and heavy but the diocos ended up fitting my ear shape significantly better although your mileage will almost certainly vary because they don't even offer any rotation as i mentioned before so they might not work great for you a nice thing about both of them though is that they're going to sound fine whether you're listening from your phone or a more powerful amp and dac so if either of them tickles your fancy we're gonna have links to them down below but don't go there before you hear our complaints compared to bluetooth headphones of almost any kind both of these are feature bear neither has any kind of active noise cancellation a button to summon your digital assistant of choice or even an inline microphone and this one's a personal gripe but neither of them has the little chin cinch cable thingy that makes you look like a big idiot but is great for cable managing your body also the odyssey connectors came loose really easily making the product feel unnecessarily cheap i also prefer by the way the carrying case of the diocos i mean it's no pelican brand and it isn't ip rated but i mean i'm the sort of person who would just wrap up my headphones and throw them in my bag anyway so maybe you should just ignore what i have to say about that now at this point you might be wondering how odyssey has the audacity to charge 10 times the amount for a product that is better but only marginally so well they've certainly earned the brand reputation for it but there's also the small matter of manufacturing odyssey builds all of their products in costa mesa california which means that they're not only paying u.s wages they're paying california wages meaning that if a pair of headphones were to take just a couple of hours to build and quality control their labor cost on them would already be beyond the entire sticker price all in of the diocos i'm not saying that all of odyssey's components are made in america they almost certainly aren't or that that would even account for such a large discrepancy in price if they were but it's at least something for your consideration especially compared to the relative opacity of seven hertz's company who are these guys what is lin's soul is it a store a manufacturer who knows something i know for sure that i haven't addressed is the earlier claim that i can turn either of these solutions wireless and i haven't addressed why i would do that either star story time my workhorse wireless earbuds are starting to lose battery life and the idea that i will have to just toss them in a year or two is pretty disappointing to me now this could be easily remedied by making the batteries replaceable but apple who currently makes up about 40 percent of the market for wireless earphones likes it when you buy a whole new set instead of fixing your old ones and they're just not going to do anything to fix the situation unless they are forced by the government and as for their competitors well they have little incentive to do anything differently from apple what that means is that we're about to see a lot of people throwing away their old airpods only to replace them with something that will last them again anywhere from two to five years max before they will be thrown away again that sucks even ignoring the ecological impact let's say you don't care about that spending hundreds of dollars over and over and over and over again will add up in the long run i mean i've already spent as much on airpods as i did on my now 10 year old sennheiser hd 600 headphones like my airpods i use my hd600s every day but unlike my airpods they are still in excellent condition and will likely last for 20 or even 30 more years i mean it sounds crazy to say that but it's true in an industry that is so focused on the next shiny gadget audio remains one of the few domains where you can buy once cry once a good pair of headphones or earphones for that matter can and should last you a lifetime unless they're tied to batteries though i do of course understand the convenience of wireless earphones and i actually wish that both of these came with microphones and volume controls on the cables and creature comforts like that luckily you can just unplug them from their cables and swap in any cable you like even one with a bluetooth adapter and a little battery on it like this one from odyssey that costs a hundred and thirty dollars okay that's pretty expensive but you could also buy a cheaper one that wasn't made in america and that's how we reached that uh hey you can get these and wireless for less than the price of airpods claim that i made at the beginning of the video now is this an exact analog to modern true wireless earbuds no there's no active noise cancellation there's no handy charging case and there's still a wire hanging off you to get caught on things but the diocos plus an inexpensive bluetooth cable are less than a pair of airpods and sound markedly better i'd like to see more options for wireless accessories by the way that have replaceable batteries in them but hey at least this way we never have to ditch the earphones themselves like i would never ditch our sponsor thorum thanks to thor room for sponsoring this video thorm has been in business for over a decade
