i'm so excited i'm soaking wet here ladies and gentlemen i'm not in the rain what were you thinking of earlier today i spent all my money and not on some kind of dumb influencer flex garbage but on a testing lab that is going to completely changed the way that we test computer hardware consumer electronics and pretty much any other technological doodad that you can think of did you bring the keys i didn't thankfully the cavalry just arrived okay we got keys yvonne's here we're ready to show you guys the inside of lab 2 where we are going to have a team of over 10 testing engineers you know the writers are moving in here too right there's gonna be like 25 people immediately and there's gonna be our sponsor because we kind of paid for this thing zoho marketing plus manage execute and collaborate on your next campaign with a unified marketing platform designed to keep customer and marketing data all on one screen so try out zoho marketing plus today using the link down below welcome everyone this is going to be the entry lobby one of the staff kitchens and then i think it's actually going to be the staff kitchen because james wants to put writers on the other one really yeah well we haven't decided yet but the room that was labeled lunch room on the floor plan i actually think would be better for desks so we're gonna have a second lounge yeah i'm thinking more like maybe two dining room tables and maybe a foosball or something i got the quote for changing all the interior lighting out do you want to know how much it was 20 000 just for the office space yeah yeah i don't know i don't know if that's happening anytime soon how about these fluorescents okay who takes their paper towel dispenser oh are you serious yeah what happened really you guys at least they left the toilet paper dispenser thanks guys this room feels like it's too big for activities wait there's a shower in here what is this room i don't know but they used it for storage that's for killing but why is there a shower in here the toilet's here and the shower's in a completely can this be the server room there's water cooling oh my gosh hey james i found your office hey right now we're networking and hold on that's the wrong door right now our networking and server is in one room but i think it might be in two places in this building with this being the networking closet yeah unfortunately there is absolutely no cooling whatsoever oh my god there's no light in here even this is all cat 5e super cheap it might not even be a problem this might just turn into a regular closet and we just rip all of this out i think in the long term seriously i do intend to put writers in here probably riley techlink squad and jonathan mac address squad the only problem is those doors right there they don't block nothing for sound how's it going how's this blocking for the noise is it's not bad i thought it was gonna be a lot worse than it is i mean i can also clearly hear what you're saying from out here i know i know the next question is if this is the server room does that mean that this is gonna be closed and soundproof and no one will walk through yes we are going to put sound proofing in crap can i open that again oh james what about the fact that the networking is in the middle of the floor here it kind of pigeonholes you in terms of where you can put desks okay um well that's interesting there's also some networking here and oh and up there look up in the sky i don't know what this video is guys it's half management team meeting about how we're going to use the space half tour half getting locked out of your own room if you wanted to see the server room this way and then we'll see the we're not going to have lunch anymore because james canceled lunch room you tell me if you want to have lunch in this room i thought that little kitchen area was actually in this space but the fact that it's separated like that i think that's fine to have off this bee office space and this sad little room no one is going to have lunch in here no matter what you call this room and we used to have a dark lunch room in the other building that no one really used okay so now you're going to make it their permanent desk space that's why i'm asking for a coat of paint what's interesting is that over here they've got outlets top and bottom so it seems like for the original owner this might have been set up as some kind of a workshop space wait is this plumbing maybe this was a counter look at the edge on the wall um this is plumbing yes maybe they did have a kitchenette in here that's actually a sharp observation sherlock just look with your eyes why do they have power and not one but two network ports in this corner what am i doing here and then again around this corner i feel like i'm in ijustine's house now one of the most exciting things about this building is power this is just one of many sub-panels and we're going to take you and show you the big fat power that we've got upstairs which ones are they let's find out what they had there it's a portable heater and a water cooler plug wait 32 and 34 are server room so is that server room like what was the intended usage of this wait did they i don't think they take their doorknobs the deal's done baby when we did our original walkthrough they did have doorknobs right yeah they're not crazy no well the good thing about this room is there's hvac already in here it's already kind of frosted and we are directly below where the main power comes into the building any additional power we needed to run here bob's your uncle no problem is this gonna be quiet enough if there's offices on either side of it i already talked to jake about it and he's like your solution was actually very good we're going to take shredded up denim we're going to staple it to the wall and it's going to be as good as it was at the old place above the ceiling oh does that wall go all the way ah i do think this one stops here because if you look the ceiling tiles keep going on that side so i think this one does go all the way up then this one doesn't i mean we could find out oh was he vaughn right oh yvonne nailed it i've gotten completely disorientated i was gonna say i call this room the aquarium but actually i'm out in the warehouse we're not ready to show you that yet do not dump mop water in here and this is what i call the aquarium where are all the bloody light switches in this place because you came in the wrong side they're very intuitive actually clearly we need motion sensors the thing i like best about this room is that you don't just feel like you're being watched you feel like you're being watched from all sides my plan for this is i would actually like to have the development team in here including luke and gary who's going to be the lab's lead so these guys are going to be essentially at the very center the heart of the building the tip of the spear looking out over the entire testing lab and then with quick access to the stairwell up so that they can talk to the ltt writers and quick access through there to the rest of the writing team i want them serving as the beating heart of the lab i have one thing i envision this as the main thoroughfare for people who are over there who want to eat lunch over there is that going to be okay for these people working in the fishbowl there's also a bathroom over here and some lucky person gets to sit near it yeah there was a sign on this bathroom door before that said no pooping they took the towel dispenser from in here too seriously yeah what the heck guys oh my gosh these light fixtures are horrible well twenty thousand dollars where are you supposed to find a bulb for this i like the mood lighting they should keep that one but only if pooping's allowed i noticed ceiling tiles were missing and they're ceiling towels and stains punched in them yeah kind of looks like a pig sty right now on that note it's raining pretty heavily today and this stain actually looks new yeah it does no it's dry there's another one behind you evan oh yeah they were supposed to replace all of these before we moved have we retained anything uh no i'm going to let the lawyer know honestly with these deals sometimes it just is what it is the amount of time the lawyers spend doing that versus us just replacing ceiling tiles i don't know we'll see we'll see how many things we find but at least i have this great adidas wall art we should get people in the office to pose and we'll just put them up oh i love it chop their faces just put faces on them i love how girthy this stairway is this is gonna be super handy this is a good stairway this is gonna be the writers area for ltt we asked the writers what would you prefer open floor plan cubicles offices and nearly unanimously they said we'd like to have offices well that was never going to happen in fact i think we're moving over exactly what we have to this place and setting up basically the same stuff the same way because we just spent all our money but it's still going to be a big improvement because now most of the riders are going to have their own window in their station and most importantly i am going to have line of sight from my desk to your office okay you know you have no networking right i don't care that's fine i use wi-fi real work anyway that's exactly right you know what's really funny though is create a warehouse everyone asked to be by the windows and then the minute they moved in they all asked for window blinds what there isn't out there is a good amount of parking if you guys have been paying close attention you probably already saw enough space for like 50 60 people we have a grand total of i believe it's about 25 parking stalls we're gonna have to get pretty creative about packing in the number of people that we're gonna want work there is street parking yeah i think it should be fun there's also not as much of it there's also not an outdoor eating area like the picking table we have in the other building but i have a plan to donate a bench to that park across the street i have bad news i know the city's development plan for that park and it does not involve being a park i'll set up my lawn chair i intend for this to be my office it's significantly smaller than your current it's actually way smaller than my current office but it's a corner office uh your office now is a corner office you feel good about this it's okay it's good i'm not even gonna be able to have meetings with people in here this is stupid all right what do you mean i'm moving this wall over what are you talking about if you put your desk right here you'll be able to put yeah but i'm gonna have beanbag meetings you will have room your desk is like 24 30 inches which is here wait you're gonna have me facing that way why not privacy i actually can't face that way here's the macarena office this one's totally bigger is this one bigger i think so we do have a plan for these offices i plan to take one of them two of them will be dedicated meeting rooms for the writing team or labs people and then one of them the smallest one is going to be for luke he finally has an office again ladies and gentlemen and this is it honestly i expect him to spend most of his time with the lab's devs downstairs this is what i don't understand my understanding was that it was just another call room and when he wanted to be in here he had he had that's what i understood but then he just said something different he has first right of refusal but he also has an office down there that's where he'll work most of the time so if luke doesn't step foot in this office in two months then we should be able to take it back you guys take it up with him did we miss anything up here yeah the bathroom oh yeah oh wow there's a big hump in the floor there yeah do you guys notice that i was practicing my putting down this hallway i'd really need to bring it out to the left a little i really didn't understand their hvac system why is this midway between the tiles i don't know i don't think this was like this when we saw us there's two bathrooms here i have a proposal one of them is your office ass man i propose one is designated whatever you want and the other one is peeing only the reason is then all the bathrooms are occupied you can count on one of them not being occupied in like 30 seconds if you just wait this building has a lot of bathrooms in it though yeah but they're far you're counting on people to read labels and obey them when we have people who still pee on the floor the words that i use to describe my team that i think are best hands down world-class totally world-class team a world-class video production team the people who work here are world-class employees world-class absolutely world-class we should just get one of the whole wall urinals like at a sports facility yeah trough with ice here's the back stairwell finally headed to the really cool stuff ah you hear that hum that's the hum of performance ladies and gentlemen we have about in the neighborhood of 300 000 watts of power originally this building was used as a sheet metal fabrication facility kyle from our engineering department was super excited about the way it's laid out we have 600 volt pipe throughout we have i believe it's 480 volt in various places internally and then we've also got 208 volt kind of scattered around in the warehouse there's also storage up here and the roof access is also up here wow cool and here you can kind of oversee the entire warehouse or bring a forklift or bring a forklift up back ah what are you doing what are you doing i'm going on the roof what does it look like i'm doing why because i want to see the roof i just bought this thing i wanna see all the dangles of it hey i should wave to you guys through the skylight over there i'll meet you in the warehouse this is the most like what's the i still don't know the word for it dingy hallway yeah yeah up here on the roof scoping things out one of the coolest things about this place see this building right here just over on the other side is our existing office we should be able to hit that office with a microwave dish and do high-speed wi-fi and get anywhere from three to ten gigabit per second hopefully we won't even need a separate internet connection here wow i don't think they're gonna be able to see me through here okay linus is knocking all right let's go find this skylight yeah that's a very plastic skylight i guess i'll just go meet up with them inside i think he gave up oh got a couple of hvac units those are only for the office space though and because we're gonna have people working out in the warehouse we're gonna have to do warehouse air conditioning which is gonna cost a pretty penny i can't figure out how to close it do you need help yeah so the um skylights are not very clear but what is really cool about the skylights is that uh there's a little button over there that you can press and they actually open bad for filming though empty space always looks so much smaller than when it's full of stuff to be clear it's really big this is somewhere in the neighborhood of' 000 square feet a lot of it's going to be taken up by testing apparatus i still think that this should be enough for us to hit pretty much every major category for consumer electronics not only that but we have to bring over from the other building the logistics department or most of it they are future proofing their plans so they currently occupy about 2000 square feet and they're asking for about four and this tiny little area here is what they've designated for camera land why don't we make camera land upstairs we haven't actually shown that yet the main camera land is still in the other building this is only for the rare shoots that we're going to do over here i don't think it's going to be that rare it's going to happen pretty often and upstairs is not necessarily the greatest idea if you have rolling light stands that you need to bring and this is why i'm in charge of planning hey don't bother to sweep or anything previous occupants this is just a small kind of storage area this is access to power if we wanted to put in something like an air compressor the hoses terminate here and it's pumped basically throughout the building do you know what they did here so to take out their air compressors they cut this railing instead of taking it out properly that's why there's no safety railing here we're not gonna pass code oh these are starting to add up aren't they absolute jackasses did we take any pictures of our walkthrough because there's a lot of stuff now that i've seen some of the crap that they've done i'm wondering if they've messed with other things that we're just not aware of it's hard to tell though like how fresh is it yeah i don't know where would that hat that hat get left here pacific headwear pro model thanks for the hat actually you know what forget it i don't even want your hat get a better hat lttstore.com hey this was included oh no they thought of that oh my god it's like a braking system almost do you know what happened here i know that there's a neighboring building enjoying this and that it used to be open the original owners who created this actually have that lot over there so they built that created these holes and then when they sold the buildings they sold them separately and just concrete blocked it back up so linus is already talking about how he wants to approach them and well it's just an investor that owns it so i figure with an investor money talks right we don't have any right now yeah i was just gonna say but if this goes really really really well mr sebastian knock down that wall thanks that's good i like reagan i told james the quote for the cellulose in here have you heard what it is how much is it going to cost anywhere from 75 to 150 000 just to do half up halfway up yeah and i actually don't know if that includes the ceiling yet i have to find that out that's insane yeah cellulose is the material that we use to spray on the ceilings and walls to make it stop doing this given that we're going to be shooting in here and we might have to build rooms that are sound deadened for you know acoustic testing the more we can do to quiet the base building the better this is really loud unfortunately these are really expensive so what about the prospect of building more mezzanine in here i'm from this vantage i can see the office space and how it could be expanded we can't do that because we're limited by parking sure we could potentially build this place out to almost 40 000 square feet and stuff 200 people in it where would they park we had our own bus route how much did they charge us for the racking about six thousand dollars for this is that even a market rate wait [music] this isn't even bolted down okay this is a problem feeling a little bit of buyer's remorse james not uh not gonna lie once we've got the place all set up i know that i'm gonna be singing a different tune because it's going to be awesome you can see from the original owners there and there are set up for like mondo fume extractions and i believe this one still functions i have no idea how to use this can't say i know what that means that's right do these like open properly at least oh man one of my favorite features though is this green belt right here it turns out it is continuous all the way to the back of our other office so what jake and i were thinking was armored fiber cable if it was sitting in there would anybody really notice it that'll definitely be a future video and i'm sure there'll end up being some behind the scenes shenanigans we do tons of behind the scenes on floatplane.com now by the way so you guys can check that out at the link down below there is so much work to be done at this building though it's definitely in rougher shape than i originally thought yeah i should have looked at it a little i mean okay it's big enough that we can actually meaningfully expand into it unlike the other spaces that we got that hey anyone want to buy lab one ah i mean we tried to find a much larger space where we could just consolidate everything and one fell through then another fell through then everything fell through and meanwhile the costs are going like this it's okay it'll be good we'll make it good yeah it's gonna take a lot more work and money money from our sponsor micro center what can i say it's the place to shop for desktops laptops computer components or any other tech your heart desires they've got great prices and
