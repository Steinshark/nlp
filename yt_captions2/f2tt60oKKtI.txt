ladies and gentlemen in this video i'm going to be sharing with you one of the most hilarious cheating stories that i have ever seen many people choose to cheat at chess because for some reason it makes you feel intellectually dominant it's somehow even better than cheating on an exam in college or something along those lines and today i've got a a an incredible story this story begins with a person that could not improve at chess past the level of 700. i went back and i looked at this individual's games they were not getting better at 700 elo which is very common but it's actually not that hard to get better at 700 elo just takes a lot of practice and then this person started cheating and this person would cheat in different ways they would log in for a week they would cheat for 20 games in a row and then they would log out and somehow they would escape getting banned because they weren't logging in every day i don't know what happened but i'm gonna share it with you because this is super super super funny stuff there is everything in this video they lose to a cheater at some point then they um i'm not even gonna i'm not even gonna spoil it if you're new to the this channel uh welcome i cover a lot of different chess stuff and uh one of the chess stuffs that i cover is people cheating right people cheating so how do you know somebody's cheating very high move accuracy uh consistent use of time uh massive win rate etc so first i'm going to show you how our cheater played before they started cheating and then after showing you a couple of those games we're going to look at the beginning of their cheating career how they grew by some 1 000 rating points uh and yeah all of the all of the incredible stuff in between so keep in mind this person was rated about 700 okay this is the first game that i saw our cheater uh play our cheater used to play uh pawn to d5 in fact this person really enjoyed creating a little trident of pawns uh cheater used to play pawn to e6 and f5 in literally every single game so i don't really insult people or make fun of their intelligence when they play chess i make fun of the moves and thing and i'm theatrical but if you cheat oh i'm gonna be ruthless so this person used to play this kind of trident chess opening uh and it's not very good because it just loses a pawn right so you know white being 700 developed a knight and a queen not the best way to play chess but it's life black plays f5 and loses the pawn in the center and then doesn't even take it back so takes and then goes here losing yet another pawn so this is you know down two pawns in the first seven moves that's not good that that is what happens when you aren't cheating at chess and then proceeds to make it even worse by attacking the queen with the pawn which blunders queen to e5 check fork this is a very common trap in the scholars mate with queen h5 g6 where the queen takes here attacking the king and the rook and that is actually exactly what happens in this game it's the exact same pattern check here and black resigned so this was the career of this person before they started cheating in all of their games they were 700 they sometimes did dumb things in the opening they played an opening that is just terrible i you know one of the things you need to start doing stop doing as a beginner is making up your own openings because you can't really do that that's like making up your own ways of driving a car there's really only one way to drive a car you know like the way they teach you you can't just be like well i drive my car with my hands and my feet touch the steering wheel no you're just an idiot like you need help so all of this to say that you know um this is how they used to play chess uh and and there were some good games you know this game didn't last seven look i i told you this game didn't last seven moves another trident little stupid thing a bishop to b4 check uh good play here by black um you know we have a trade of pieces and now of course white should develop develop castle you don't want to make multiple moves with pieces you've already made in the opening because you're going to open up your position you don't want to initiate trades in the opening while your king is still stuck in the center that's exactly what white does uh and then just gives black a really good position and now our cheater before cheating plays bishop to d3 now bishop d3 is a garbage move because you just literally just traded queens to get there and then you give up the bishop then black attacks the bishop because black is 700 we've all been there i haven't but you have now two things attacked this bishop our cheater completely doesn't see it loses a pawn knight to knight takes e4 now rook f1 bishop g4 this is knight takes bishop for free instead white goes here um 93 is made in a moment rook d1 hangs me white spent 15 seconds and played literally the worst move on the board that's not i'm not exaggerating the alternative would have been going here and getting mated with the knight i mean white literally moved the rook to a square that it could get taken three different ways and got checkmated like this person had a rough career okay before they started cheating they were 700 here's another game this time they didn't get to play their trident opening instead they they did whatever this is they took the pawn instead of the night they put the bishop behind the pawn just not good chess you know not not great um 95 attacks this right like you should castle here or block white he goes here i just allows knight f7 and these games are chaos like losing the rook not even taking it back now white somehow loses the advantage as well here queen f3 i mean it looks like oh my goodness knight g6 bishop takes now somehow white starts losing the game because you know 700 chess is crazy now black is winning bishop a6 rook d8 now now it's back to equal and and and now and now our cheater is just gonna get mated and and they they get made okay so look um they were losing games in less than 10 moves they were losing games in 15 moves they were losing games then winning games and losing games my friends this is where this person started cheating and uh yeah it's been a wild time ever since um they started cheating and the one of the very first games that they play just look at look at the difference in ability between cheating and not cheating one of their first opponents was named jon snow and and our and our cheater played a king's gambit okay now some cheaters try to avoid getting caught by not always playing the best move or by stalling the clock out in certain situations or by playing bad openings and then catching up in the game what i'm about to show you is some of the funniest stuff that you might ever see a person cheating and discovering things about their chess they didn't want they didn't otherwise know so black gives this check because black is 900 okay black thinks this is checkmate it's not now the queen has to go back and now what white is going to do is win time against the queen and develop their pieces so the cheater takes on e5 you'll notice that white is spending like a lot of time on these moves for example on the move pawn to g3 which is literally the only logical move in the position the alternative being here the cheater sometimes was thinking about making the second best move and you're gonna see this during the video instead of the best move so take take develop and develop and you'll notice white already has some advantage uh because white has developed pieces better queen e7 and now the computer decides queen to e2 to try to prepare long castling so the cheater plays queen e2 all right in about 12 seconds uh black takes on c3 uh white takes with the d-pawn to open up the bishop uh spending you know again 12 seconds like look at that look at this 12 seconds exactly 12 seconds again okay now the best move is to develop the bishop right some you know you can go bishop g5 or e5 or bishop f4 so like i said sometimes cheaters they like to play you know the second best move or the third best move so bishop f4 played after 13 seconds 12 12 13. all right bishop g4 castles uh excuse me bishop g2 14 seconds all right now a lot of different moves are are equivalent here bishop g2 now castle short okay guess that's not you know we're not castling long castles long and now the cheater plays queen f2 also about 16 seconds every move being played between 12 and' seconds okay queen f2 now knight f6 and now white has an opportunity to get an advantage white gets an advantage after spending 13 seconds on the glock the reason for that is the cheater is inputting this into a computer then letting it think it and and then going back and going oh i see okay knight to d4 is the best move you unpin yourself you try to trade off a knight you try to infiltrate the opponent's king take take and now pawn to c5 now in this position the best move is just obviously rotating the queen i feel like any human would do that but the cheater plays the second best computer move because they are trying not to get caught and then the second best computer move here doesn't make any sense because you take a pawn which is defended by two things what well the idea is that after this you have a fork no 900 sees that what are we even what so the cheater doesn't understand how crazy their move looks they're just like well i don't want to always play the best move which is why stockfish gives this an inaccuracy because queen a4 is the best move with bishop d6 is the second best move bishop d6 now black is like well if i take the queen they're gonna take my queen so i'm gonna take the bishop yeah but you see the cheater had an idea right that's why they you know this 11 seconds every move is coming between 12 and' seconds look that that move was even faster that was nine seconds takes check and now e5 and white is crushing just forking things the rook the night hanging has a very very big advantage black goes here and any human being here sees this and that and goes boom but most human beings aren't cheating when they play chess the best move in this position is that so queen d6 ed6 you know interchangeable he takes d6 very nice move if you take my queen i take your queen and uh queen d7 and now the queen side steps to b4 lining up and attack over here now what you're about to witness is so sick when i saw this i knew i had to include it in the video because we are talking about a person who about three days prior was losing games in nine moves the cheater in this position plays the move rook to f5 as you can see from the arrows drawn the rook can be taken but then queen b7 is mate most 900s here play this but that is actually the top computer move remember the cheater is trying to not get caught but the cheater accidentally plays a brilliant move black plays b6 setting up queen takes and then this now the best move in this position is rookie five to go there the second best move is rook a5 which is what the cheater plays because the cheater thinks well you know i'm not gonna get caught if i play the second best move my friends do you understand the idea of rook 2a5 some of you may go oh i get it you can't take because of the pin that's really clever my friends that's not the idea the idea is to sacrifice the queen and mate to this is a person that was losing games in less than 10 moves and three days later this dude just went rook f5 rook a5 queen sack mate hahaha what what are we even look rook f5 rook a5 this person was trying not to cheat trying not to get caught and then they saw this move and then they didn't even realize why it was made they spent another nine seconds queen b6 do you know why it took white 24 seconds to play this move because they didn't understand they were looking at the computer going why is the computer telling me to sacrifice my queen then they realized people don't realize when they cheat how stupid they look oh my goodness are you kidding me i think my friends it only got better this person cheated like i said they would log in they would cheat for 10 for 15 games then they would log out okay they would log in they would cheat they would log out then they ran into a cheater by this point this was like months in the future and on the one hand it would be great if like chess.com could flag these people right away there are hundreds of thousands of people playing online at any given moment i'm not sure you could ever come up with an algorithm strong enough to detect all of that right away so yeah you know what i love to see these people banned before they can take rating points like this uh yeah i i just don't know i don't know what it's like to run the chess website i have a courses website do you know it by the way it's called it's called chesley it's where all my courses are you can check them out you know in case also have a book i like to promote things anyway um here's the game that the cheater played against the better cheater e4 so the players develop a four knights and um this should be five bishop d6 castles castles and now you know any normal human goes here or here but the cheater's trying not to get caught so they play the third best computer move which is retreating the bishop black plays knight to d4 uh black is cheating every move so black is just playing basically the top computer move every move white is trying to play not the top computer move every move and also they're using different computers to cheat white might be using you know something on a phone that's better than all humans but is worse than other bots so knight takes d4 pawn takes d4 now if i'm if i'm a human i go here to try to win this pawn computer goes here though so that's hanging that's hanging the bishop is there knight takes e4 and now again i would just go somewhere like this but instead our cheater plays queen g4 which is not it it's not up there with the with the lines of the computer but it's probably the second or third best move and then they win the pawn like this and black comes back and black has a slight advantage here okay white develops the rook to e1 in 13 seconds because they're cheating black plays rookie now white plays queen f4 which attacks the pawn on c7 uh black plays d5 so black completely disregards the pawn counter-attacking this but i mean again any human being here at 1500 just plays pawn to d6 which is a very reasonable move d5 the bishop goes back and now again we hang the pawn into a fork because the idea do you know do you know why black played this allowing this because that loses to bishop d6 hitting the queen and after you take it rookie one nobody saw that neither of these cheating idiots saw that bishop d7 allows a fork but then bishop d6 is a haymaker nobody saw that they have no idea what they're missing because they're cheating every move they don't actually know how to play chess instead of that white plays rookie 3 which is one of the best moves trying to rook lift i i don't actually know what you're trying to do because in that h542 really i have no idea uh black plays d4 losing a pawn two different ways but if you take like this this is a fork so you can't do that so you've got to take it with the queen and now the best move is knight to what the best move is knight to g4 putting pressure on this and this and this and now the queen is a target so bishop two f6 hits the queen queen c4 slides out of the way and now the black rook can infiltrate to the first rank but before we do that we need to kick this knight out for some reason you still can't take because of rook c8 that one i at least see knight goes back now black starts launching the pawns okay now you'll notice black every move look at black's moves look at every one of black's moves 12 seconds 16 seconds 10 seconds 14 seconds right everybody's cheating everybody's now bishop d4 is a major problem and unfortunately our cheater with white is getting outplayed by the cheetah with black has to sacrifice and now the cheater with black uh it starts bulldozing so here uh again the third best move is to take which is why it was played and now at this point i think basically the cheater gave up bishop takes f2 is a is a nasty sacrifice and now black absolutely swarms with the queen and the rook and our cheater cheated but not well enough queen c4 and now a brutal move rook e2 disconnecting the pieces look at black's time by the way black is spending a minute and a half on a move because black is pretending to think all right every cheater is different up here psychologically every cheater is trying to you know pretend that they're not actually doing it but unfortunately it's made in a few moves check and now check check you'll notice every move now for black look look every move like 11 seconds 13 seconds that one came in six seconds and that one in two uh the reason black saw those last few moves is because quickly in two seconds because black is actually you know probably decent at chess like people cheat because they're like 900 a thousand anyway black was banned shortly thereafter um very funny game punctuated by like a punctuated by white setting up an attack on a pawn which black just allows but white doesn't understand how stupid this is think about this a human plays this move because you attack that obviously what else could you possibly be doing this move okay at least fine any human on the planet plays this because they think their opponent messed up and probably their opponent did at most level this is what's gonna happen it's so funny that that both players are cheating and they don't even realize what's in the position now foreign this is a cheating blooper i've i never thought i could discover something like this until i took a look at this person's profile at this point there's 1600 so cheater versus cheater is actually common it's very common like two people cheating hundreds of thousands if not millions of people playing chess around the world it's common for a cheater to play a cheater um i choked i got so excited i've never seen something like this have you ever seen a person cheating at chess lose in nine moves how can you cheat at chess but lose in nine moves e4 e5 cheater is cheating every game knight f3 knight c6 all right why plays c3 white is trying to play the ponziani very good opening for beginners and intermediate players black of course since their cheating plays the top computer move of the opening and now queen to a4 is the best move but white takes and plays bishop e2 so white is already worse white is worse because this is not the idea of the ponziani you've taken away a very natural developing square for your knight and now black has a lot of activity so rather than develop actually black now just starts punishing you pawn in the center now your knights gotta go it undevelops to you to g1 knight f6 bishop all of this is good but black plays knight e5 taking advantage of the loose square and now d3 i mean it's just a very difficult position already for white who lashes out with ponta f4 you can take on passant but the idea knight to d3 is brutal uh and black is already winning in seven moves because black is cheating okay uh how is black winning in seven moves but losing a nine well in this position white takes the knight and offers a queen trade now black has a couple of ways of dealing with this uh black can play knight f6 going you know to defend the queen black does not want to trade because that just helps white develop black hasn't done themselves any favors there and also black doesn't really want to move away because that just gives white development so in this position the best move according to the computer is to play bishop to e6 defending the queen with the intention of attacking the pawn if that trade happens but in this position black mouse slips black was trying to play the best move but instead mouse slipped lost the queen and resigned i mean you cannot make this stuff up this person has been cheating for like 40 games at this point and mouse lips and by the way by the way would have probably won this game had they kept cheating because they would have defended themselves and then white would have gone here and then black would have done this and then you know slowly black would have worked their way back because the you know a computer can beat a human but instead they just resigned after mouse slipping their queen and probably thought well if i lose a couple of games then i'm not going to get banned um oh my god this is incredible and this was this game was really funny because this game shows exactly what i'm talking about throughout the video just constantly oh my god oh my god okay the cheater plays e4 the better cheater plays e5 and we have a four knights and now knight to d4 very similar opening that we had to the other cheater versus cheater game so uh white plays castles uh black doesn't actually take the bishop black plays c6 white goes here and now black does this helping white develop that's a really weird move i do not understand that at all but remember black is cheating bishop c5 queen g3 attacks both pawns black just castles can't even be bothered to defend one queen e5 because black is going to go here and then after ed5 black is gonna play bishop d6 all of this happens so black loses two pawns in the opening you look at this you go what is black doing they're just down two pawns right if they take and then take and then take and then take and then take and then take black is just completely lost black's just five pawns for seven it's completely losing position but black is cheating black is cheating at a higher level than white is cheating bishop d6 queen goes back to e2 and black by the way the best move for white was to go here or here but white is trying not to get caught so white goes here and gets hit with a great gift bishop takes h to the greek greek sacrifice luring the king into the open onto g3 because if you go this way queen h4 is just lights out you're just gonna lose you're gonna have to sacrifice your queen so the king comes out now watch as the more brutal cheater cheats in a better way and wins rook 2e8 attacks the queen puts the queen on the open line the queen slides back to d1 black now plays the best move which is h5 defending the knight restricting this and h4 is actually a brutal threat so white has to play the only move not to lose their cheating again f4 so you're gonna slide the king over here black plays h4 forcing the king over here and now queen to b6 now there is a mate threatened this is mate you cannot escape onto the e-file or those squares and f2 is covered by the queen so white by a miracle plays g3 in 13 seconds by the way because white is cheating so white is spending a consistent amount of time and now creates an escape path now pawn to h3 now so we just saw black we just saw the cheater mouse slip and lose a game this is perhaps the funniest moment in the entire video i mean mouse slip was pretty damn good um this is hilarious so remember white is trying not to play the best move all the time because white thinks if i play the top computer move all the time i'm gonna get banned but if i play the second or the third i'm gonna survive right so the top computer move in this position is d4 which blocks the queen so this is no longer checkmate and you can run over here because the queen is the only other way not to get mated in one is if you go here it's still made in one so the only other way not to get mated in one is to go here and lose your queen and that's and that's white doesn't realize that this is just losing a queen whereas this is at least prolonging the game a little bit so white is like i'm not gonna get caught and place queen to each list just loses the queen and spends 17 seconds on that move and then loses the queen and then spends one second taking [laughter] black just develops all the pieces and then brings the rook bishop e2 pawn two and i mean the pawn just walks down the whole board queen d4 and uh the best move for black now which is so brutal in this position [music] sacrificing the queen in order to promote another white resigned they had enough oh my goodness this cheater was good but they they were in nothing compared to these others my friends this is why you should not cheat at chess because you're gonna take rating points from innocent people but one day i'm gonna find you and good lord am i gonna expose your intellectual capabilities chess does not correlate to your intelligence it doesn't correlate to your self-worth it let's get philosophical for a moment you're gonna lose like half the games of chess that you play if not more chess is a lifelong learning process okay i go to play tennis at the local park i don't hit 100 of my shots in and i would i would never expect to because i'm terrible at tennis i just play it for fun you have to be willing to lose you can't cheat like this because you don't realize how absurd you look consistent time management thinking you're clever by playing the second or third best move even if it means giving up your queen or mouse slipping trying to i'm done my friends oh my goodness get out of here
