ladies and gentlemen i've got a question have you ever blundered your queen in chess now i've got a second question have you ever lost 60 000 us dollars well regardless of the answer is yes or no to either of those questions hold that thought in today's video i will be showing you a queen that essentially cost sixty thousand dollars we are in st louis our protagonists are wesley so and hikara nakamura and i'm going to show you three games that they played against each other uh in their very very closely contested double elimination finals match and then i will show you the blunder of the queen timestamps on the video player if you don't have the attention span but i mean come on these videos are fun you skip this you never know what you're gonna miss anyway these two anytime they go at it barn burner of a fight it all started uh when my mom met my dad and then they had me hi i'm ryan or whatever that meme is anyway in the early going it was hikaru where's the eval bar there it is what the heck is going on here we don't want to evaluate the position hikaru played a very offbeat russell limo with the move e5 bishop to d6 and it was a very close position early as you can see this is game one keep in mind there's four games there's really three games the last game is the game that cost the sixty thousand dollars but there's gotta be a little bit of build up knight f6 d4 and early in this match hikaru was playing this kind of offbeat a little bit of provocative variation of the sicilian defense the black position is a little bit loose a little bit airy night on c6 looking a little bit potentially targetable same with pawn to a4 wesley played knight d2 hikaru played uh king h8 very clearly setting up some stuff over here to get the king off of the diagonal and a couple of moves later he did in fact play the move f5 now it's a very complicated back and forth affair all right uh as is typical in the sicilian defense the games are quite unpredictable and hikaru early on was trying to take wesley very very far away from where he might be comfortable because wesley is a both of these guys have a similar playing style especially in slow games we had fe4 knight went back to f6 and in this position hikaru took over he played the move d5 now glue back up for a moment how did this happen because it looked like white's position was completely reasonable well it's not an easy position to play black has a lot of natural plans like the move f5 for example and white according to the computer has to play moves like queen f1 which i mean the king and the queen love each other very much but uh they don't want to be around each other this close all the time all right so bishop b3 and f5 and hikaru played d5 now why is the like what is so good about this well white has no center pawns white just doesn't have any center pawns all right and if you take one of these pawns i got news for you i'm pinning you impossible to guard your bishop you can play c4 i got e4 can't take take your queen you go knight e4 maybe um i have uh knight takes b4 fork and uh bad position for white so we back up for a moment queen takes e4 there it is hikaru has now created this very powerful barrier in the center of the board and he's coming in with his bishop and in their first head-to-head matchup uh hikaru got the better of wesley he applied this very odd style pressure uh with the sicilian defense something that i've never seen him really play much of ever and then on top of already having a bad position it went from bad to worses wesley just blundered a discovered attack now don't worry the queen has not lost that quickly uh we have queen d3 and hikaru chop down the white position up upon traded down rogues took on c3 and this bishop is not under attack because queen takes rook a very nice win i mean it's not every day you get to beat wesley so with the black pieces uh it's not every day you get to beat him with the black pieces and make it look uh relatively straightforward so hikaru played this very obscure line of the rosalimo sicilian and and he did a great job and uh he won that's not like the end of the video hikaru knocked out wesley the first time they met in the finals but now chess is trying to adopt this double elimination style format so guess what it's them again it's them and not only them they're playing the same colors alright but this is the next day and wesley was back for revenge you see hikaru got the early early push on wesley unless they said bro all right i'm gonna go for your spanish hikaru play in the berlin this time hikaru plays uh with the berlin the reason why hikaru didn't repeat the exact same line is because if at this level of chess if you have 24 hours to prepare for somebody bad things are gonna happen for that somebody if they try to repeat so knight f6 and wesley played the ansi berlin the berlin of course is a age-old variation where black takes only four castles and so on and so forth right and hikaru played this line knight d4 which is where black trades bishops comes out and is like i'm good wesley went knight a3 to try to play knight c4 which he very promptly played some moves later and he tried to go after hikaru's bishop now hikaru has an option here he can give away his light squared bishop he can give away his dark squared bishop or he can give away nothing but when he tries to give away nothing white now gets a little bit aggressive and i just gotta say visually speaking i like white's position i like the root going to d1 i like the rook going to e1 i like b4 a4 a5 visually speaking i like white's position hikaru damages his pawn structure and castles long here's the problem and a few moves later black is going to play king b8 the kings are on opposite sides alright and it's a recipe for disaster when the kings are on opposite sides uh because the position is going to get very complicated now keep in mind wesley has to win wesley has to win because he just got knocked out he came back out of the losers bracket he's like hikaru my business here is not finished and uh now they go to battle plus uh both guys knew that you know they might need to blunder a queen later on in this video so i could entertain i don't know how many people are watching this right now a couple hundred thousand eight hundred thousand 1.2 million i don't know but i would have to entertain you so wesley went queen f3 and hikaru went g5 and h5 now this is the type of position folks i'm gonna try my best to explain this to you if you get confused let me know just kidding i can't hear you or see you um this is the type position where it very well could be that the best moves are to play moves like g5 h5 on the one hand if you think about it what is hikaru playing to win for he already won yesterday what why does he need he just needs to not lose right but it's a type of position where the best moves are inherently going to be to create imbalance and as you see here hikaru is trying to attack wesley and he is playing a lot of the best moves um but it's very aggressive right they have four f6 knight f4 like it's very complicated position is very very unclear very unstable you see wesley playing bishop d4 and a4 i mean like both guys are showing up to the park with their friends all right i mean like everybody's ready to fight okay everybody's ready to fight by the way is that a thing in school do kids still fight or do they just like cyberbully each other like back in the day you know i'm 27. uh i still remember like if two 13 year olds had a really bad argument they'd be like meet me after school like we're fighting we're gonna settle this you know away from the basketball courts like there's a little area of the trees teachers don't see us we're gonna fight and the kids have to keep it a secret and at three we would all kind of sneak out pretend to walk home sneak off like to the woods everybody would fight not everybody but people who had the beef would fight so dude does that still happen i don't anyway bishop b3 point is wesley and hikaru are sneaking out back behind the woods and they bought a scrap they're about to repeat moves though no they're not king a8 queen e7 very tense position someone's gonna have to move upon wesley's gonna have to do something there it is b5 uh oh is he is he is he in there is he breaking in bishop d4 he undoubles the pawns look at wesley's pawns every single pawn is up and the blockade around the black king is about to come down cb cb b-a and wesley finds a very clutch move here rook b6 all right rook b6 applying more pressure to this pawn on a6 i know the computer the computer there would be safe you should have played bishop g6 and king a7 and then you should have played rigby 6d i think stockfish just sounds like cartman from south park like i honestly i think i'm just gonna start doing this impression uh i think it's like hey wait you guys you're too stupid dude why did you play ruby you should have given him a check dude anyway rook b6 and uh the point is that after rook b6 ab6 there was the move d5 which is apparently holding hikaru didn't play it because he's a human being and wesley kick the night out knight is kind of locked in here now white's got some good attacking possibilities but hikar was not i mean hikaru is still going this queen looks like it's falling off the board but wesley does a nice job here of getting to this h3 pawn and uh this knight is stuck hikaru tries his best but he's got to sacrifice the uh knight for the bishop and this is a winning end game for white because he just has a pawn in h4 and he's gonna bring the king so the pawn walks all the way up all the way up the board rook h2 rook h5 and uh wesley's gonna go get himself some pawns and folks it's game on all right it is game on now before i show you the game that i would like to show you which features uh 60 000 you know dollar queen loss uh the two of them also had one more really hilarious game which i i just have to show you and i gotta reward you for having an attention span that can last 10 minutes uh this was a hilarious game that they played alright it began within english it was a four nights english and it was a very locked position the two of them have played each other so much that it they struggle a lot to kind of poke holes and uh find uh kind of problems with each other's repertoire so there was a very close position that featured a big set of exchanges and in my my humble opinion i think white is better here i mean i know it says 0.4 but i just mean like white's got more space and i like white's bishop versus knight and every close position close position of course characterized by the amount of pawns on the board and in this case there are eight pawns on the board per player which essentially means they still have a full squad of pawns which therefore means that it's a close position in every type of position you are looking at pawn breaks d4 and f4 for white and kikaru very much does achieve the move f4 and i mean i just love this position but it gets real tense real quick all right c6 chomp f6 and hikaru just blows open the position with d4 and yet the engines i it's equal i mean there's not there's nothing happening here and e5 take take rookie one it looked like for a while like hikaru's god i have something here he goes queen e2 wesley plays knight c4 and hikaru sacrifices the queen rookie seven rook g7 but wait a minute king is safe king is safe knight e3 is coming that could be made that could hang a rook who is winning 93 who's winning this position wait a minute hikaru finds h4 h4 is such a ridiculous idea the point of h4 is that if you play knight takes f1 i play rook g5 and it's mate bro it's mate and if you don't get mated the pawn promotes so h4 is ridiculous queen d3 now rook f4 i mean how is the black king not mated queen d1 king walks out queen a1 rook chief how is there not a mate well hikaru blunders knight d knight d5 and suddenly he might be losing all right he might be losing in this game this is one of the weirdest things i've ever seen a queen and a knight beat a two rooks any day but not when the king is out here all right being tarred and feathered all right in the late'th century style american revolution style tartan feathered out here in the in the town square rookie 4 king g1 kikaru makes a queen look at this position and he plays king h2 now here wesley was winning wesley was winning and i got news for you folks had wesley found this little continuation here we wouldn't have this youtube video butterfly effect and who knows maybe in that timeline uh i discover uh i don't know cure for some disease or maybe i discover how to actually play chess in this position wesley could have given a check and wesley could have played queen f7 and the game would have been over it would have been over because hikaru can't play rookie 5 because queen e7 kicks the rook out and once the rook goes my friends this king is no longer going to be tarred and feathered knight e4 queen e6 white is no longer attacking queen c7 and queen f7 and hikaru resigns but wesley didn't play that wesley went here and suddenly realized he got nothing he got absolutely nothing here black is paralyzed black can't move the king black can't move the pawn black can't move the pawn but i can't move the pawn but i can't move that up i can't move anything the only thing that black can move is the queen so he tries moving the queen a little bit gives a check looks like it's gonna be a draw right well i just needed to show this to you because in this position wesley so played something so nasty this is so funny how do you force a draw here for black will you force the draw by playing queen takes h4 white takes and it's stalemate i have never seen something like this white is up seven points of material and its mate on f6 on the next move but he has zero legal moves that is so absurd i've never seen something like this what a stalemate all right what a stalemate so look folks we let these two guys get 72 hours and about 20 games between each other to figure out who was going to be the winner of the american cup and i swear to god it all came down to this it came down to something you could have done you could have done that what you're about to see 60 big ones on the line that's a lot of money for some that's a pair of shoes for some that's a one year in uh in college if you're american if you're normal and live in europe you barely pay anything um you know hey listen in new york city there are private schools that cost sixty thousand dollars for a four-year-old can you imagine having a four-year-old go to school and you pay sixty thousand dollars a year for that for that that's what that kid could like walk down the street and learn something from people yelling at him or her anyway sixty thousand dollars is a lot of money this was the final game between wesley and hikaru hikarad white wesley at black 60 grand on the line knight f3 e3 it's a rapid game 10 minute game not a 90 minute game you're not gonna believe what you see b3 bishop b2 so far so good right so far no one's moved any queens everything's all right c5 now in these kind of neo-ready structures with english and a delayed d4 delayed queen spawn game white play c5 black should play pawn takes pawn that's just what black white should play politics spawn and then play d4 so kikaru plays pawn takes pawn but rather than play uh d4 himself uh he plays rook c1 now he he should play d4 um that is uh considered the top move of the engine uh but uh in in in interchangeable but there is a clear drawback with the move rook c1 drawback okay the drawback is that black can play t4 right now hikaru can get away with playing rook c1 and allowing d4 because one of the best players in the world okay uh if you play d4 you're gonna lose because you've got no space so that's kind of the drawback of rook c1 but okay d4 knight a4 but now key card is attacking the pawn uh wesley took on i'm allergic to taking pawns wesley took took defended his pawn like this all right it's equal what can you do two top players playing an opening it's equal hikaru develops his bishop hikaru castles rusty plays knight c6 very complicated game very back and forth game car plays queen e1 the idea of queenie wants to put the queen on g3 and maybe wesley won't see checkmate in tragic fashion wesley does in fact see checkmate and uh this is it folks i hope you've enjoyed today's video uh because what i'm about to show you should make you feel better about yourself uh it should make you feel like uh as long as much as you play chess it could be two decades two and a half decades you could be one of the top three players in the world you could be a champion of various events nobody is immune to doing stuff like this hikaru traded the bishops brought back his knight from the edge of the board wesley played knight b4 opening up his bishop eyeing this maybe knight will jump into d3 and in this position white is actually unable to move this knight because then queen takes d2 would happen so there's not a convenient way to stop this but then hikaru played knight e5 knight e5 activates the knight and takes away d3 but doesn't it hang upon well anytime your queen ventures to the other side of the board like this you got to be thinking it's gonna get trapped but no because even though the queen's escape path backwards can be caught off with a rook move the queen can always come out this way or so wesley thought you see after 72 hours and 20 games of chess against the same individual wesley so experienced what we think all the top players in the world never experience which is fatigue blind spot and it turns out that after rook d1 queen b2 the queen is not escaping at all knight c4 from a position of complete and total equality even the computer saying that black could be a touch better wesley takes the pawn and gets his queen trapped and hikaru wins sixty thousand dollars and so folks before we sign off this video i would just like to ask you once again have you ever blundered a queen in chess have you ever lost sixty thousand dollars now get out of here
