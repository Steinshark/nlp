i failed again sort of but in a really weird way this was necessary for iron codes to succeed today is not going to be a coding video it's more of a stream of consciousness thing i wanted to talk about my backgrounds the mistakes i made things i've learned while i try to create launch new software products i'll also talk about my most recent failure maybe that's useful for you if you are thinking about launching a company yourself or you just want to learn what kind of things can go wrong when you create a complete software product or if that's not interesting to you that's also totally fine in that case i'll be back for you next week with another coding video until about six seven years ago i always thought i was going to have a classic academic career now i studied computer science at university then i continued doing a phd in computer graphics then i became an assistant professor and ultimately an associate professor and the idea would be that at some point in the the far future i would then become a full professor and then i don't know what but basically that's like the standard thing you do when you're an academic but one thing that i noticed happening over the years that i really started disliking some aspects of the academic career so to speak what i found the most annoying part of it is that it's very individual focused everything is about you your career your achievements it's already like that when you're studying like you have to get your diploma right it's all about you and then for your phd if you do phd that's the same thing you have to finish the pc and that's a personal title that you get when you then become a professor or teacher it's all about extending your network becoming an important person that everybody knows about that has been being invited to speak at conferences papers that have your name author name on it and so on so it's all about you you you you and it's kind of creates a culture an environment that really focuses on the ego and the person being extremely important and i started getting a bit frustrated i started getting a bit frustrated with the personal titles and the politics and everything being so focused on persons instead of trying to help society even though research at its core is trying to do that it's very easy to get lost in ego boosting basically and another thing was that i always had the idea that i wanted to launch a company and build software products seemed to me like it would be a really great experience for me to do something like that so when i was in the end of my 30s i just had a kid it started really nagging at me this feeling of okay if i want to do this launch a company i should probably do it soon otherwise you're just gonna be stuck at the university forever so that's why and i think it was 2016 i decided to basically quit my job and launch a startup company with a friend of mine who already had some success with launching companies before it was not such a smart thing to do like i quit i completely secure job with a really good salary to go ahead and start a highly risky startup while having at the same time kid who needed you know care and cost a lot of money um so yeah that was not the smartest thing to do but well in the end it worked out fine but i wouldn't really recommend doing it that way anyway the idea of this company was to create a sort of website builder for bands and musicians and then their fans could get like a paid membership via that websites and then see additional content kind of uh patreon or only fans except i think we picked the wrong target audience we worked really hard on developing dev technology and i think within one and a half years something like that this company actually fits and that happens mainly because of my ego you know i thought i was the smart professor who could solve this problem when we would make millions within months and it was like completely ridiculous to think that because launching a company is crazy hard and most of the times that actually goes completely wrong and i had to learn that the hard way but that was actually really good lesson for me because it helped me get rid of that academic mindset of the person being important because in the end i mean a company has to provide a service to their customers if it doesn't then a company won't sell anything and it's going to fail and that means there's no place for egos it doesn't matter how many titles you have if the product isn't good the company is going to fail it's as simple as that and it's video took me a failure like that to learn that but i'm really happy that i actually did learn it because it helped me in the next steps of what i did another problem was that we developed technology that was actually not really good because as a ex-university teacher i mostly had a theoretical background i didn't really know the area of web development all that well even though i played around with like javascript and web frameworks a little bit on my free time so we kind of built it in the wrong way and trying to do everything ourselves instead of using relying on existing tools to save time basically so that also resulted in a software platform that was actually not really easy to develop and it took a lot of time to develop new features it wasn't designed very well so then we decided to make a pivot make a really big change in direction for the company and we pivoted to creating a sort of linkedin platform but for choirs and vocal groups and this is actually a pretty interesting market because there are about a million choirs in europe alone so lots of people are part of choirs and vocal groups and we thought we could build something that would be useful to them so we built this website for choirs where people could register and acquire they got a sort of profile page just like you have on linkedin they could post their concerts there so at some points it was actually going quite well we had the largest choir concert agenda in the netherlands which was not thought was really cool also we got the technology rights this time um we use reacts and we were able to write the software in a much more cleaner organized way than we had in the company before that so it was really lots of good positive changes and then our business model was actually supposed to be a ticketing system so that choirs could sell concert tickets using our platform so it didn't sound like a bad idea right but we noticed that actually we built something that choirs didn't really need because they preferred actually going door to door selling tickets because what they knew basically everybody in their village so they didn't want to use some sort of digital ticketing system so unfortunately we built something that people didn't need or want which was again really a pity but the technology was nice there's at least that so and then of course covet had all concerts were canceled and at that point we also decided to sort of stop developing that because well the wonder console so we have zero income so we had to do something so then because i needed money obviously i went back to part-time teaching at the university and at the same time i started working on new products because i didn't want to give up yet on my adventure with software startups i started working on a product aimed at computer science education because as a teacher i noticed that learning management system so these are the systems that universities use to that put their courses in are often not aimed at computer science or they can deal with programming code or even mathematics it's very hard to automate things in these systems because they're really old-fashioned so i started building a platform where students could do programming assignments the system would then automatically run tests on those programs and give students feedback and it was kind of built for let's say tech savvy people so you could actually write your own custom pieces of javascript code that did some processing on the answer that the student provided that kind of thing and it's actually really cool technology but at the same time i was still teaching two to three days a week and i started teaching a software design course and we wanted to move the course which was currently using c sharp one to move it to using python so then i changed this whole course from using examples in c sharp to using examples in python and also modifying updating some of the material at the same time but it was also coveted so most teaching was online so i created also a bunch of videos for my students and then i realized that hey actually making videos is really fun and you can do a lot with videos a lot more than i ever realized before playing around with it and there were a few things that i noticed while i was doing that the first was that actually there was very little material available on python and software design and another thing is that most of the content out there was either aimed at beginners so software design things would be too advanced for them or it was very theoretical so it was missing practical examples or it was very recipe based so a video on how to do this extremely specific thing without really explaining why so that's kind of the point where i decided to launch a youtube channel and post videos that are more at an intermediate level advanced level and that also contain really practical information and focuses on python for me doing this felt really natural to me because i had my teaching background at the university so that was really helping me in being able to prepare topics and video scripts that made sense basically and that explain things clearly another thing is that because of all the pivots i did in my companies i had to become really good at really quickly changing things and basically while i was developing the tools at my company i i was always thinking in terms of okay i'm going to assume that in one month from now i'm going to have to change everything so what can i do to make sure that in one month i'm not gonna have to do too much work so software design have become good at software design became a really crucial part of my software development journey and now the channel has just kept on growing and i started making serious money from it especially after i launched my online course on software design and i also started helping out a bunch of companies with better organizing their software development team and making sure that that team works together optimally so that they produce the best software if you'd like me to help your company as well by the way there's a link at the top to find out more about that program now i've decided to really stop with my education company for a few reasons one is that well it wasn't going that well i mean we had customers thesis were actually quite happy with it so i think if i wouldn't have had the iron codes channel i would definitely have continued with this company but that's the other reason i don't think i can focus on doing two big things at the same time but because the technology we developed at the education company is actually really cool i'm still really proud of what we built we're going to release this as an open source tool in the summer and then basically everybody can host and use it for free and i'm totally okay with that i'm going to go all in with iron codes and i've got a couple of really cool projects lined up one of them is that i'm launching a new course on software architecture later this year if you want to stay updated on what's happening with that course and you want to be part of the first group of people to get access you can pre-register now for free by going to ion.com architect also put the link in description of this video in a really weird way all my failures from the past years were actually necessary for iron codes to be different possible at all if i hadn't failed at being an academic i would still be there at the university now being in my comfort zones teaching and doing research i wouldn't have launched this channel if we haven't failed at launching several software products i would have never become really good at software design and i would have never been able to create content that i'm currently creating to me it really shows that failure is not an absolute thing if you learn something from it how could you call the failure it's not i hope you remember this when things are not going your way continue doing what you do make mistakes learn from them and then step by step you're going to get better and success might come from a really surprising place thanks for listening and see you next week
