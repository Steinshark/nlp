ladies and gentlemen today i will be showing you a very exciting game from the 2015 world chess championship of blitz chess now have you ever blundered a checkmate in one move yeah we all have i've done it you've probably done it 100 times those are great when it happens to our opponents and we find it and win the game well magnus carlsen the goat right was playing a game against vasilevanchuk it's a very very strong ukrainian grandmaster and it was a super wild and complicated game right up until the end when magnus made a move that essentially blundered checkmate in one and his opponent was so excited to play it that he jumped out of his chair i am not exaggerating i will share with you the game and we will also take a look at the live footage courtesy of the norwegian uh live tv channel that was there so enjoy the game enjoy the live footage and yeah even the best players in the world blunder checkmate in one move here we go so we pick up this game with magnus playing d4 and vasilovan shook playing knight to f6 bishop g5 from magnus is the trumpowski opening uh and this is one of my personal favorites it gets a lot of people who want to play indian defenses out of book what that means is people who want to play the nimso indian grunfeld or king's indian openings or god knows what else uh bogo indian bozo indian old indian there's a lot of different openings budapest gambit get all that out of the way and you just play the move bishop g5 and inherently the idea of the move bishop g5 is that if you are able to damage black's pawns you're happy and then you will put a pawn on the dark square dark square develop life is good evancho plays the most combative approach which is the move c5 immediately counter-attacking white center trying to get the queen out this way to pressure white's queen side and other various things uh white can take now but personally i like to go here and sort of make black decide what to do so if black comes here sometimes i slide back but in the past i've also played the raptor variation which is one of my favorites and the idea is basically to give up the bishop but you open up the rook like you open up the rook to the extent that you can even play moves like g6 which is a very very fun idea that damages black structure tremendously and leaves you know massive holes here so uh d5 is one fun idea there's also a gambit here where queen b2 bishop d2 and so on and so forth um but magnus plays bishop takes f6 and the idea of bishop takes f6 is of course to damage black's pawns you either do this and black lacks an e pawn and then you can go here and it's just black is just that tough developing uh or black can take with the g-pawn which is what evancho went for this is a totally imbalanced position so what is the imbalance white has given up a bishop for a night dark squared bishop for a knight uh and uh black damage their structure the h pawn is weak the rook is going to have an open file the bishop might come out this way what should white do now well if white trade it off with r squared bishop why should probably go here and then here and then here and then just be rock solid on the dark squares no magnus plays d5 uh and now queen b6 is an immediate attack on the b2 pawn and magnus plays queen c1 see if magnus played b3 that would be a massive weakening of the dark squares over here we don't want that all right that that's too much it's like swiss cheese i now queen c1 there are very fun ideas for black to immediately take advantage which is bishop h6 one of them is bishop to h6 which is just a completely ridiculous move uh the queen can take but then queen b2 and you know white is going to lose all their pieces so normally after bishop h6 you would play e3 but evancho plays f5 f5 has a couple of ideas you want to go here you want to open up the diagonal you want to prevent white from playing e4 for instance this is just something you need to think about so f5 c4 and now d6 what's going on why would white give up a dark squared bishop and basically put no pawns on dark squares like what is happening here what how does this mean why this but the dark squared bishop is now going to be a monster well as it turns out and as you can see from the computer it's fine i mean we're breaking certain principles of the game of chess but it is what it is right like who's gonna complain right it's magnus when you do this i yell at you and i tell you you have no idea how to play positional chess then you tell me i have a receding hairline and you don't listen to random strangers on the internet and i would tell you okay that's fine and then we would have this random internet conversation in a youtube video when magnus does this it's like oh we got to pay attention right he's he's creating imbalance so knight c3 knight d7 and already here stockfish is trying to put its mark on the game it wants to tell you how to play it wants to tell you what's the optimal developmental setup uh for instance if i told you to play f3 here you would immediately understand that that's not a good move maybe you wouldn't that's fine maybe you're 500 elo and you're just like watching my videos and every now and then you play some chess on chess.com and you don't really care too much about color complexes or improving you just like the sound of my voice you like my chess videos you like magnus carlson videos tremendous no problem f3 is not a good move why weakens the king does not allow the knight to go to its natural developing square does it lose the game absolutely not that's why the evaluation of stock which is negative 0.5 but it's not a good move so magnus plays g3 to try to get his bishop to g2 the computer here wanted him to go here not for reasons you would think you would think that after bishop g7 it wants him to develop the bishop but it doesn't because if you develop the bishop you get hit what it wants is for white but then i don't need to and the knight on g3 and then the bishop like this that's what the engine thinks is the most optimal setup of pieces for the white position however magnus does this why because he wants to put his bishop on g2 and his knight out like this and before he puts his bishop out on g2 he does this why does he do that well he probably was like if i go here evancho goes here i don't like that his bishop is too strong his queen is too strong i i i'm gonna make a move that prevents him from going knight e4 the move 92 prevents him from going 94 because if he goes knight e4 then i'm gonna take and take right i got two things controlling that now this now this life is good and since now evancho cannot play the move knight to e4 he plays the move knight to e4 well that's certainly an unwelcome surprise right when you specifically set up your position in such a capacity that prevents your opponent from making a move and then they make that move immediately not only do they make the move it actually turns out to be the best move some of you may be wondering why i'm talking so fast in this video i'm going to be completely honest with you it's because i had an iced coffee at about 5 pm the second reason why i'm talking is i'm very mad do you know why i'm very mad i recorded this video for 20 minutes 20 minutes and the file was corrupted i've actually already recorded this entire video and had to delete the file because there was a corruption with the way it's saved i'm mad i'm mad so i'm trying to generate that and funnel that anger into a better production for all of you and that's what i encourage you to do don't let your anger be destructive i mean make no mistake i yelled multiple times when i realized that recording was corrupted i was very mad that's why i'm talking very fast caffeine joel joel from the anger of talking about this exact game for 20 minutes already this was already recorded but no problem you like the energy i like that you're watching right now so let's have this moment together magnus cannot actually take the pawn in e4 because the bishop on g7 will hit the pawn on b2 along with the queen on b6 will hit the pawn on b2 that will be a fork will lead to a devastating loss of material for the white pieces bishop g2 now you can defend this pawn by doing this you can also defend the pawn by going here the idea of queen to b4 is that you're pitting the knight but you're also attacking this the only way that white can guard this is by going here and as you can see from the eval bar that would lead to more problems because it removes the defense of the knight on c3 did i take not only do you lose a knight you also lose a rook is it better to lose a pawn or a knight in a rook it's better to lose a pawn which is why magnus goes here and this and again a very fun moment here bishop c3 does not lead to the loss of the bishop because you can take and attack the rook the board is a big place so in this position ivanchuk plays the move h5 and if you have a friend or somebody that you play chess against and they're early castlers they like to castle early as you get a little bit better at chess you can kind of break the rules not like cheat not like you know on passant your opponent's pieces and not their pawns or whatever principles you can break principles you don't always have to castle if you can launch pawns at your opponent like this if they castle their king you can castle the opposite way you can wait for an opponent to castle so ivanchuk is going to castle he puts his bishop out and we have this now folks someone's gonna lose why is somebody going to lose when the evaluation says it's basically equal well they canceled on opposite sides and it's a speed game everything about this game is in balance everything uh imbalance of playing styles i mean evancho is a super wild guy loves attacking uh if bishops versus bishop knight opposite side castling when you compare the quality of pieces in opposite side castling you've got to think about pawn storms and black's pawn storm is much more violent than white's pawn storm this pawn will open up the white king the bishops are gonna stare at the white king the diagonals are open at the white king the only pawn break that magnus really has here is the move b4 and he is miles miles away from achieving that because he has to deal with this pressure right this pressure she plays rook b1 ivanka plays rook g8 king b8 first and then rook g8 so both guys are preparing openings of their positions we need three bishop f6 knight to e4 simultaneously getting out of the way of the queen and the bishop and also threatening this and b4 now in this position you would think that black now will just step on the gas f5 right evancho pierre plays such a high level move and it's such a classy move what's the best move for black here i mean i've been talking about attacking one another pawn storm opening up the position but what's the best move here for black what is the best move the best move is queen takes a2 queen takes a2 why why is queen takes a2 the best move because it's a free pawn because nothing changes you take a pawn and it doesn't come with a lot of risk how do you determine in chess when a move has no risk it's all about what the opponent can do to you checks captures attacks the most devastating types of threats to you there's no checks to this king no capture makes any sense can you attack the queen yes then i take the spawn too i'll take the second pawn to go in the bag sauce on the side and make sure to tip your delivery drivers because if you don't you're a terrible person maybe tipping culture is not normal where you live here you should tip um queen b2 and black is up two pawns so ivanchuk in the middle of his attack hits the pause button goes that way and takes a pawn and is just the pawn up now with all the benefits of the position that he had previously rook f8 and here comes magnus with b4 that's it gloves are off grabbing each other's collars skating on the ice bam bam throw and not those stupid hockey fights where like they pull the jersey and no the real ones where they're both landing punches bishop b5 queen e3 and now evancho has a situation where if either of these pawns takes the other the white rook will now be able to see the pawn in front of the black king and ivanjuk doesn't want that he does not want magnus to be able to see the rook in front of his king so evancho plays this move so now magnus's rook has to see the pawn in front of the pawn that's in front of the king so the rook is useless white is gonna have to go here and attack on the a file or battering ram the b-pawn and not to mention in all end games if uncheck now has a pass pawn so knight c3 queen a6 rook c8 and here's essentially the situation whenever black's f pawn arrives over here it will ruin this position once it ruins this position the white king will succumb to the pressure magnus tries to create a little bit of counter play by doubling his rooks on the a file evancho just goes here why there because if he went like here this could actually lead to some problems giving up the the queen could actually be very very bad for him so he goes a6 and i told you a long time ago the move that was going to essentially decide the game when it was ready to arrive was that five that's it essentially ivanchuka is now knocking on the door the rent is three months late and uh the eviction notice is going to be served if it was the old days it would be much worse than that mafia movie style that's it the white king is about to get butchered bravely magnus captures the pawn that pawn was not free but that point was not free and uh he tries to fight back but f4 is far more devastating because you can get that but i'm gonna get that and when i get that i'm getting that and then i'm getting that and it's over pawn takes bishop takes queen to e1 and now i'm not even gonna talk about the moves yet i am going to show you live footage from the playing haul shout out to the norwegian tv channel don't copyright strike me you guys are great i'm gonna show you live footage from the playing haul enjoy so it's a super tense moment low time evancho takes on g3 magnus recaptures a matcha drops the rook into the white position magnus can't believe it he's got like no time hesitating up down with the hand and ultimately he slides the queen out of the way but it blunders queen g1 and magnus can't believe it he stands up and resigns ivanchuk jumped out of his seat when he saw that move was possible look at him queen d2 and look at him boop and boop oh my goodness and that's the end of the game and uh we'll analyze it in a moment it just literally basically blundered a total checkmate not in one move but basically in one move the next move would have been a mate in multiple ways so ivanchuk beats magnus he has to sign the score sheet shout out to norwegian tv by the way uh for this awesome footage and the funniest thing about all of this was what came next so norwegian tv was live there and actually followed magnus out of the playing hall i i can't help but laugh at this clip they didn't mean it this way but it's like the walk of shame like hey you blundered babe hey hey what's up man hey magnus how do you feel about playing a ringmate in one dude like a little south park episode uh and they actually walk with him all the way to the elevator lobby uh they walked with him he pressed the elevator button and he got in and i mean it was like tmz style totally and then he you know presses the button here and he's like hey can you please leave thank you he's like all right yeah goodbye now i'm gonna punch that mirror in the elevator it's just funny stuff um so keep blunders live and i'm gonna show you exactly what happened now on the analysis board so in this position evanchook actually the best move was to go back if patrick didn't play that the best move was to go back the white queen is overloaded for defense and black is winning instead of that eventually played bishop takes g3 which is just a very natural looking move and it's not the best move because f takes g3 rook f1 magnus now can sacrifice his queen so as it turns out magnus can go here and believe it or not there is no more attack if black plays queen e3 i go here and buy some miracle of the chess gods white is not only holding white is winning because ivanchuk just invested too many pieces bishop g3 was wrong and he's actually on the verge of throwing away the attack now magnus definitely saw queen takes rook but magnus went wait a minute i can go here because i there is no rook g1 because the rook takes if queen d2 rook takes i take back and queen d2 covers f2 and so magnus went here but what he forgot about is that queen d2 literally blunders checkmate technically in two moves but it essentially blunders the mate now it's not rook g1 it's the queen coming down game over queen g1 the only legal move is king to h3 this is mate that's mate and there's also made if you delay it by a move so queen to g1 the final move the dagger the absolutely unbelievable mistake queen g1 anything happens in blitz but it's so wild that ivanchuk actually hit a brick wall but because the momentum of the game was so much in his favor already magnus instead of just calming his nerves here and playing queen f1 goes here and devastation because queen g1 is uh is is game over lights out all the spot blunders made gay man so a crazy crazy game uh wild footage there from the playing hall how they fight uh they uh they file they followed magnus into the elevator but uh norwegian tv is uh actually far ahead of their time they are essentially the only nation that like fully invested in a player yes of course they have the world champion but they always have media at all these events uh no other nation really covers chess the way norway does so despite the footage being kind of humorous and you know them following him after a loss uh massive credit to them and uh yeah nothing but good things to say about uh the way norwegian tv has covered magnus's games over the years but this one crazy even the best players in the world can blunder a checkmate essentially in one move that's all i have for you today i hope you enjoyed the video now get out of here
