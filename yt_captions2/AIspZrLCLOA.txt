ladies and gentlemen welcome to norway chess 2024 this is the first of a handful of recaps uh coming out of stavanger norway where we are taking part uh in an incredible chess tournament well not us but the best players in the world and we are going to come along for the ride we have two sections we have the open and we have the women's in the open we have magnus carlson hikara nakamura fabiano carana ali resa fua prand raish babu and dingly ren the reigning world champion what a squad of players by the way on the women's side we have the two top chinese women and uh that's juan jun and leting and that's not even including tanong she's not playing but she's the candidate so china uh super powerful up top two indian players humpy konoro uh and vali rames babu they just played in the candidates tournament uh in toronto uh about a month ago and we also have pia kremling participating as well as anna musuk so that's the field one quick thing the format is really weird there's four different types of scoring there is the win in classical chess which counts as three points and then there is the armageddon so if the game ends in a draw the players play 10 minutes with white s minutes with black black gets draw odds which means the game is over uh for black in a victory if black makes a draw but black starts the game with 3 minutes less and today after that very long-winded introduction we also had magnus carlson versus versus dingly run so we start off with a banger uh more on that later lot of fun very exciting and you may wonder why the tagline is it's so hot in this room i'm going to take off my hoodie i i'm sorry we got to we got to take our clothes off for this recap it's it it's it's the only way to make it interesting but okay all right now let's this is a new hoodie by the way i'm covered in fuzz now life is tough life is tough but we're going to power through so we are going to kick things off in the classical chess game between fabiano kowana and hikaru nakamura e4 e5 knight after3 knight c6 we have an italian we have knight to f6 which is the two knights targeting the pawn in the center on the e4 square d3 h6 very edgy very edgy stuff there's a lot of different lines here but h6 stops white from going to the g5 square prepares g5 himself depending on one of white's setups white can play c3 d4 white can do a handful of things he does in fact play c3 and hikaru actually it's kind of interesting doesn't play he doesn't play for a d6 setup there's another way you can play here like this and then put the pawn on g6 or g5 a little bit later he puts the pawn bishop on c5 he just plays this like a completely straightforward normal italian including the move h6 knight bd2 now in my opinion and clearly in hekaru as well the best way to play an italian is a5 and that and to to be aggressive on that side of the board disallow white from getting what he wants a4 knight to d7 clearly hikaru is still in his prep and th this must be some sort sort of unused candidates preparation this is sort of what happens when you prepare uh for the candidates tournament and you don't get to use your all all of your ideas bishop f5 and now by the way hikaru still hasn't spent any time he still has not spent any time he gives up the bishop on b6 knight b6 16 moves of fiano carana is down 34 minutes on the clock and finally hikaro has to think on his own and he actually plays a move the engine doesn't even like which is quite funny uh he did not have to touch the pawn the computer liked queen d6 queen g6 for example rotating the queen putting a little bit of pressure and basically saying look fabby i'm going to take this with the bishop then we're going to get a little backup here with the rooks queen g6 this type of thing queen f6 maybe knight e7 c6 knight f5 uh not not not not that but uh yeah hikaru takes on f3 and i think he was just sort of trying to you know play quickly and confidently but suddenly he realizes after 27 minutes of thought wait a minute i probably should not have taken the pawn on f3 i probably should have played something else uh like like i said one of these two moves even knight knight e7 here to try to play for c6 and and putting the knight on on this side of the board but this actually gives fabiano some life and now suddenly he's attacking so knight g6 and let's keep in mind that hikaro has won a lot of their recent matchups although hikaro had the white pieces in those games c6 and now fi finds this very nice idea rook takes f5 giving up the rook rook f5 and now he had a good move here knight to g4 it's important to start with knight to g4 because it forces king h8 if knight g4 queen h4 is played this wins because you get the knight on g6 however if you play bishop d3 first then i do go queen h4 and there is no quick knight move so that is the important thing you had to start with knight to g4 king h8 bishop d3 and now with queen h4 you go queen into d6 and that is a major difference comp to the game you cannot go queen to d6 because you lose because you you lose you queen f2 queen e1 you lose pieces and take and if you count the pieces you're down a piece this doesn't work but that's why you have to get the knight out of g4 out of h2 so you can run the king that is the major difference fabby here had to play knight g4 or bishop d3 right obviously it's very complicated position he chooses this way he continues to have an attack but this way we get here and he cars survives the worst of it queen f7 king h7 and it looks like fab's still doing quite well but rook e 6 comes with a draw offer because it's the 30th move the rule of the tournament is you cannot agree to a draw before move 30 which is very fitting because now it's move 30 it's 0.1 uh the advantage is essentially bishop for the knight that's it everything else is completely symmetrical so yeah hikaro played some very good prep but actually pawn takes f3 overall probably put him more under pressure than he would have liked i think queen d6 would have been maybe slightly better uh but he chose the way he chose he was under pressure maybe for like two moves game ends in a draw what does that mean that means they play again that means they play again and it's 10 minutes versus seven so karu now has draws okay and you will not believe this karu again you may not remember this at all these two played same color april 2024 in toronto canada round one of the candidates and in that game hikaro played this and then here he didn't play the nidorf sicilian but instead he played e5 e5 is a you know again he he'll meme on me he might he might say like e5 is a bad move it's a bad move i mean it nowadays the engine can do anything but hikaro himself even i'm pretty sure called this a garbage move he played it again i mean he played this against fabiano in the candidates you would think fabby did all his homework bishop b5 knight f5 bishop back to e2 knight to g3 you would have think fabby did all his prep and all his homework and fabby gets a worst position in 13 moves this man hikaru played this absolute garbage nonsense against fiano a second time what queen d2 h5 and hikaru just gets a completely effortless position and fabiano is now down on time he does go for a very big attack he can't take with the pawn queen g5 is mate does this hikaru trades and goes here and again hikaru is one of the best defensive players in the world you could attack him all you want but he's going to defend himself you got four minutes you got to beat hikaro in this position you can't make a draw hikaro wins if the game ends in a draw fabby keeps pushing but queen f3 you can't fork him either you can't play knight c7 fork because then it's perpetual check for black queen f3 queen g4 queen goes back to f7 again if any of you are wondering why the fork is not happening black would have very quick counterplay and my friends the garbage prep pays off hikaru completely takes over the game queen f4 queen f3 again he's trying to repeat moves here fabby has to play for a win and uh rook d1 is lights out you got to take you would lose the defense of your queen and hikaru beats fabby so he drew him in the first game and he beats him in the armageddon i do believe this means hearo gets either one and a half or two points instead of one the scoring system is three to nothing if you win in classical and obviously you get zero if you lose in classical but you get some points by making it to the armageddon now again there are only 12 players playing so we're going to go through other matchups really relatively in a straightforward manner j and jun versus vali ramish babu this is a matchup that we that we haven't seen this year because j and jun's the world champ she doesn't playing the candidates so vali recently got her grandmaster title i don't know why there's a comma there but because it should just be vali ramish bab so d4 knight f6 a grunfeld an opening you don't really see at the top level much anymore people are kind of trending more more toward knight f6 e6 kind of kind of relative uh queen's gambit decline stuff so we're going to see what the women's world champion has here she plays a relatively boring line like a line where you just kind of damage the pawns and play a little bit more of a positional game she puts some pressure knight e5 makes the game a little bit spicy but very quickly we get opposite colored bishops and not really much actually if anything uh vali's a pawn up she's going to lose the pawn there it goes and now we have this position and it's complete symmetry and this is kind of classical chest in a nutshell right now uh you kind of memorize a bunch of stuff you play some solid stuff yeah you're a pawn down but it's impossible to win because the bishops are of opposite color very important you understand this if you simplify all this down it's going to be one extra pawn versus this bishop and the bishop will just sacrifice itself for the pawn wherever the pawn goes so um you can continue to try to attack black but look at this i mean she just puts her king in the center cuz the king is actually safe and the game goes on for a little bit and uh vali walks her king to b3 cuz she's a gangster but there's nothing here you look like you're going to get mated you're not she keeps trying to hunt the pawns but yeah this one look i mean i'm telling you it looks very scary a lot of us would hang mate here she's a little bit better than us though it's why she's here and we're here where we are and uh as you can see they both have very low time it was very tense it was very stressful and v was probably like why did i do that uh but this one this one is very very easy to draw because of this you may be wondering what's going on even if you're up a bishop if the wr if the corner promotion is not the right color and the king can get there it's just a draw king b7 draw agreed because again this would this would be why you're wondering this would be why i mean first of all it's stalemate but let's just say it wasn't a stalemate and let's just say you know we got here it's still a draw it's still a draw because you can't queen the ps not possible don't believe me try it for yourself which means they also go to an armageddon and oh my god armageddon was very exciting it was like a jababa london and then it was h3 and and and and it was a sacrifice of a pawn just j and jun just hates her pawns she's just been giving them up left and right and again she has to win so from the opening she's up four minutes remember the game starts 107 so by the middle game she's at four minutes and and i it's just a hard it it's not an easy position to play suddenly vali's got a bunch of weaknesses here comes knight d6 she takes the bishop she has the bishop pair and she's up 2 minutes and she just needs to not completely malfunction and she's doing a very nice job of that rook d1 playing it slowly a lot of pressure on the black position but suddenly it's a time scramble like suddenly both players have no time there's no bonus time queen b5 f5 counterplay being created by vali but she's 30 seconds down she's 30 seconds down there's a pawn over there the pawn's going to make it to the other side of the board we're going a5 and white just defends herself and that's that's that's that's all she wrote and j and jun wins in the armageddon it was an armageddon full day prag nanda by the way i don't know why it saves vali's name fully and prague just gets an r so if somebody can help me why the algorithm does that that would be much appreciated uh because otherwise i i am very confused why it saves their names like that now this one a catalan an opening that we have seen many many times we have dc and c5 very forcing line by fuja he's trying to uh trade the pieces down castles knight c6 queen f4 typical typical stuff in the catalan you try to put pressure here here like this with the knight take take take and white is going to try to play this position white is going to try to say my bishop is better than your bishop in the long run my queen's better rook d1 bishop g you know bishop g5 like i'm going to try to put pressure on you with the position so here come white's pieces right white's getting active first plays f6 and still you know black has some problems black is worse black is worse due to the pawn structure black is worse due to the bishop oh rook ad1 i'll play rook fd1 in this position all right i play rook fd1 it destabilizes the pawn but i like the fact that the rooks clearly prognosed something queen e7 and this is his idea he's going to reroute the knight back into the middle e5 you got to play here comes the bishop trying to hunt for checkmate in a shocking turn of events ala fua does not blunder checkmate knight f3 and as you can see from the computer evaluation it's not impressed it does not like the way that prog has maneuvered his pieces if we go all the way back here probably it would have preferred something like rook d1 queen e7 and instead of this idea of knight to d2 maybe going forward which is kind of interesting maybe maybe that that's that's the way to go and and the engine actually quite likes this concept of trading bringing the queen back and obviously putting pressure on this side of the board and down that way with prg uh you know fua wouldn't blunder that but what we get in the game is complete symmetry and we've been here before and i think you know where we're headed we get complete symmetry absolutely nothing and fua did a very nice job in this game with black and we have another draw now you may be sitting they're going how is classical chess marketable at all if they make the i mean if they make these draws and by the way i have a ridiculous game for you a little bit later you know how is this going to work well yeah that's i mean that's kind of the struggle i mean in the candidates we had some very very high stakes and interesting stuff but here everybody's just trying to go to the arcade everybody's just trying to finish their homework so they can try to go play in the uh you know air air hockey and and by the way if anybody's wondering i have absolutely no idea what this opening is c3 is a trendy move it's trying to play a london and if black plays c5 you're going to take it and then use your pawns to defend each other but i have no like what the what even is this garbage like i don't even know i don't even know knight e4 i don't know bishop f5 like what the what are we doing what i don't know what this is i can't explain this i mean now the queens are off bishop d2 and uh from from from the from the early game i mean it was just verua who had a fantastic position fantastic position but the play is kind of still on prague side so prague has to win all right we know the armageddon we just saw jw and jun win we just saw fabiano lose to hikaru and uh fua just plays in a way where you know he gets this type of position look at the time by the way the time is is relatively equal but prague is still pressuring and i think fuja kind of rushed the simplification here now king f3 and suddenly fua is back down on time and uh what a gangster little king walk here from from from prague rook d1 patience patience wait a minute what happened to prague's time how did this man prague go from up like 50 seconds to down a minute what take take he got to go for it he got 30 seconds what is bro doing there's no bonus time he was up 3 minutes to start the game he's down 17 seconds we have rook d3 rook f3 rook f6 he's winning but fu is promoting but proc has 12 seconds rook f7 check king goes back to e5 wait a minute but the pawn's gonna queen oh but d2 the bishop comes back we have knight e6 now it's 15 seconds vers it's 4 seconds kick f6 bishop h5 rook h8 and bishop g4 and fuja loses on time i'm sorry i'm sorry is this accurate was it really 15 seconds versus four because if it was how on earth did fuja lose this game on the clock there is this has to be a transmission error so prong wins i mean i don't even know how that's possible but like i don't know how i don't know how you i i i don't know i don't know how you lose this game i don't know how did did you lose i i have no clue i don't know but prague wins so every game has been decided in this chaotic armageddon every single one pia cramling mother of anna cramling covers a lot of the games on her channel and at one point was the highest rated woman in the world i didn't even know that i i knew she was very good uh this is called like the this is not exactly called the huer variation i think this is the huer variation and then like e5 it's one of these variations of the of the nso but this is kind of the general idea this e5 move and black just kind of shuts down white's play and pia is going to try to target the pawn so we have f3 takes the queen and from the opening i mean pia was just this is incredible position for for for white apparently here she should have played very aggressively given up the pawn and played knight to e4 just basically challenging the entire integrity of the black position she played it a bit more slowly and that gave humpy a chance to trade some pieces and uh basically defend herself in a slightly worse and unpleasant end game rook b5 and it looked very very unpleasant and here p is winning if pia takes the bishop she's winning ab cb targets the knight the knight goes somewhere let's say to e7 you just take and and you play this position for win you you you know you you get here and you go and you try to try to win this position maybe maybe rook f8 is more accurate bishop g5 i don't know king d7 this is a winning end game apparently you just are down in exchange but you have an extra pawn you actually have two extra pawns and she cannot move for whatever reason pia didn't like that she went rook d5 which is still good i think she thought she was just completely winning here as well and she gets the pawn to g7 she is completely dominating by the way i mean absolutely dominating knight e7 rook a5 okay rook a5 makes a lot of sense she took the pawn though you would think being up to pawns is good but apparently she needed to go this way because now her rook is passive and the knight comes out and somehow she's no no longer winning because humpy wins the pawn it was crazy absolutely crazy turn of events and uh and p is no longer winning she's only a pawn up and it's i mean it's only a pawn she she had a chance here i think but nothing as substantial as she had and the players just agreed to withdraw she placed h3 she doesn't have a lot of time on the clock and the players just agree to withdraw and her biggest her biggest mistake believe it or not was to take a free pawn apparently just going here and patiently wait like knight f5 you give up the rook and black just is powerless cuz you're going rook f8 or rook f7 like i don't know rook d7 rook f8 rook d8 you don't even have to take anything you could just bring the king because everything's protected so p unfortunately she was totally dominating and and a fantastic game from her but they go to an armageddon as well and uh again white is three minutes up pia again playing into a uh a queen's gambit she plays just a very solid line rook c1 takes on c5 this is this has all been seen many many times before but again remember white needs to take risk and uh the way that humpy is playing this she is not allowing risk to be taken i mean she is literally getting rid of every piece and now we're in an end game king g7 and somehow white has to win this game and it's just it it's it's just not looking like it's going to happen and uh probably somewhere pia should have maybe played a sideline maybe she should have clarified the position in the center a little bit sooner but uh what happens in this game is black plays a very aggressive queen's gambit declined clears out the center of the board and it's just a tough situation where you're guided in your play by the result and uh white despite not having you know any sort of advantage here is squished and there's just yeah you're not winning this it's not a win and uh armageddon's very tough she kept trying she kept pushing she ended up giving up a pawn we see this a lot when you're you kind of know you can't make a draw but ultimately it's just the draw and uh humpy cono winning in the armageddon so we have uh we have a a win with black for hikaru we have a win with black for humpy because she made a draw prague flags fua and uh jan jun defeats vali and we had adam muuk the final game uh in the women's side and then we have magnus versus ding as our main event of the evening an a musuk this was a french defense from ling this line has been played actually knight f6 uh e5 so knight d7 knight f3 very solid line very very good line uh and and uh black is just very solid giving up um excuse me trading the pieces and getting the bishop pair although the bishop on d7 is not particularly impressive and uh we g4 g5 very aggressive stuff okay bishop b3 queen c7 lat sc castle queen side now another key idea in the french is h5 using the pawns in front of the black king before black castles to push these pieces a little bit back that's another major idea but both sides castle queen side in the classical game and obviously the clash is going to happen over here uh white can try to generate an attack but it's highly unlikely and as you can see that is exactly what happens the game kind of begins to heat up over there rook g3 h5 but now this is a very sneaky way of sneaking a sneaky way of sneaking i need to take a nap rook c3 look at that and suddenly leia is under some pressure bishop e3 anna is going to slowly make some progress here queen f2 king a8 now it's just about now's her moment she plays rook d3 bishop b4 trades and now what you got to start doing here with white you got to push this bishop back a3 put the bishop back and play f5 that's what she's got to do she got this key idea here to play f5 and for some reason uh she didn't like this and in this position she played bishop d2 queen b6 and repeated the position so she obviously did not like the concept of a3 and f5 maybe she was disturbed by a3 bishop b1 which admittedly is a very spooky move because now you got to decide where you're moving your queen this looks mildly unpleasant the truth is white is actually completely fine black plays h4 even rook d1 traps the bishop so you can't even play h4 but this was a big moment and here yeah anna should have went a3 f5 that was the key moment now again 14 moves she has to make she has to get to the 40th move that's when she's going to get her bonus time but she might lose on time there is no bonus time until move 40 she decides to make a draw obviously you know she spent 11 minutes making that decision so now they play an armageddon right so another armageddon everybody going to an armageddon by the way same opening so ling ch is like listen i don't if it ain't broke don't fix it i like the position that i got this time she plays slightly different and this time we don't get all the trades that we got from the previous game and this time they both castle short last game they both had long castle on the board so bishop b3 remember white's playing for a win so anna starts going to play for a win lay strikes back all right anna's playing for a win lei is defending and it plays rookie one by the way 40 seconds on rookie one like it's a lot of time spent and and by the way l clutch 15 seconds quickly 3 seconds quick moves right suddenly they're both in the three minutes so so white's 3-minute time advantage granted in the armageddon is gone and a counter strike and a move like this comes as a massive shock because now is when you start realizing wait a minute i'm not winning at all and black is actually threatening to win the game like this is game over for white queen comes in so white's got to go here bishop b5 now we start trading pieces look at that rook d8 bishop f5 very close on time now take take boom i mentioned that queen from a distance and that's it that's a nasty haym maker and that's m that's mate but look at that move look at that move some of you may be wondering isn't that a free rook absolutely it is but it deflects the rook's defensive e2 knight e2 would win the queen that is what happened it was lost anyway but l te yeah very convincing gets to this position goes here no mate make sure there's no back rank problems now it's time to go hunting and uh anna loses her bishop but she was already lost and lay wins lay wins that armageddon so now black 3 to2 in the armageddon and that brings us to our final game of the day the only game that did not make it to an armageddon some of you may may be like gotham why' you spoil that and i'm like suck it up that's what i that's what you know so dingly ren the reigning defending champion of the world magnus carlson not the reigning defending champion of the world while he is in rapid and blitz uh the unified champion if you will never actually was defeated in his match the number one rated player in the world and by many people still referred to as world champion kind of like they refer to presidents and this one is a catalan so we are going into the vintage territory of dingl ren dingly ren loves the catalan plays it all the time now some of you may be wondering some of you might have not noticed why did magnus carlson spend 15 minutes on his fourth move well at the tournament we have something called a confessional booth which is where the players come in and tell you all of the illegal things that they've done it's kind of like a you know confessional like a real confessional booth right they tell you oh i gambled on this game no i'm just kidding they don't do things like that i mean maybe they do but they haven't said that in the confessional booth so karo came to the confessional booth and said magnus just left the board for 15 minutes cuz he was eating food magnus was sitting in the player lounge eating a bowl of noodles and then proceeded to eat pizza that's why it took him 15 minutes to play bishop b7 bro he could eat before the game started i love how everything magnus does is like fascinating like i why is he spending 15 minutes like just eating i mean you talk about a level of like i'm in total control and there's nothing you can do about it so now there's a big moment in this position will magnus play the open catalan or will he play the closes he plays the clos that's kind of rare nowadays people kind of enter more open territory but you know then there's a lot of theory and you don't so he plays c6 which is just a solid opening ding plays queen c2 now ding spent 13 minutes not cuz he was eating food he just didn't know what to play there's a lot of options here probably was not expecting magnus to go here ding plays bishop f4 the bishop goes to b7 the rook goes to d1 they develop their pieces and now ding like this confrontational move knight to e5 and magnus uses that as an opportunity to target the bishop and the bishop comes back because going back to the home score would be bad now magnus comes back to f6 says hey ding if you come back to f4 i'm going to make a repetition and you're playing with white so that would be you know silly so don't do that you get a take on d5 that's what and ding repeats the position and they make a draw in 14 moves in fact they made a draw in 10 moves because they just repeated the position on move 10 three times hey i heard that there there was a post the broadcasting rights of this tournament are like in india it's on sony livv live it's in it's on tv in china what like boys if we going to do this why don't we just make it a knockout with 25 minute chest wouldn't that be so much more exciting like literally every game went armageddon i'm not criticizing the organization in fact norway chess is like the utmost strongest tournament that happens every single year with incredible conditions they have this interesting like this is the only tournament in the in the world that does this where they get the armageddon but like boys what are we doing like what i mean if classical chess is that boring let's let's just play 25 minute let's make a threeh hour media package for television with ads with you know the whole thing we watch tennis we watch all these sports let's do that let's make what do we do i don't anyway they got to play them again now so c4 ding goes for c4 magnus plays the best move which is e5 and uh kind of interesting by the way magnus doesn't play c6 and by the way for the record magnus like magnus doesn't have to win he's playing black it's a catalan i mean you literally like there are very very small differences between playing the black side of a catalan and giving yourself a colonoscopy like they're very equivalent i mean in terms of the uncomfortability so g3 knight f6 and magnus plays this move h6 i actually played this myself so um i was inspired by a game vladimir karnick played before he did all the anti-cheating stuff uh and you know obviously now kick's name is associated with you know kind of like that whole side of the but like 7 i i saw karnick an interesting game in h6 i played it the idea is basically to prevent bishop to g5 so ding goes here e4 d6 and magnus plays like this announcing plays h3 a5 from magnus and by the way d4 continues to be very strong here but again magnus is just trying to play to take ding into territory where uh he's not going to play moose very fast and this is this is kn h7 is a wild move the idea is to go here here and clam down on that center ding goes here and plays f4 very very good play from dingly ren very good play f5 the best way knight d4 take take rook b1 a3 b4 maybe an idea now right and now here comes magnus down that side of the board and uh yeah ding ding plays queen g4 but just king f8 and you have this moment where you you no longer have a plan of action with white and believe it or not i'm not even sure where you went wrong like everything ding did made sense maybe he shouldn't have played f5 so quickly but the position is still okay yeah i don't know kind of a weird one and uh what he ends up doing is he ends up going here magnus just defends himself and starts completely taking over the game takes on f3 targets the knight puts the bishop there you can't beat him so he trades all your pieces and that's it that's it completely locked you down completely neutralized start to finish the only thing you have remaining is the move g5 it's not going to work you're going to you're going to play it you're going to prep it at some point you got to make the move you got you got to play g5 if you don't play it you literally have no other pawn break at some point you got to make the move g5 you have to play g5 at some point or else you lose the game there it is and we trade everything and you will will definitely not win because that's mate so yeah tough game tough game and magnus actually did not have that much time but he picks up a couple of pawns and uh that's it queen g2 queen e4 queen d4 and what's funny is that ding actually could have probably tried to flag him he could have he could have tried to flag him but he's like he now it's just a draw so magnus very nicely with about 10 seconds on the clock wins the armag again very nice neutralization day one ends with magnus prague and hikaru winning it ends with jan jun winning uh ling and uh humpy conu and uh i could not get a photo of the standings because they were broken hopefully they are not broken tomorrow i tried but it's round one of many so norway chess uh underway on the res days of this tournament which are
