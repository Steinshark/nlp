ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the chess world cup 2023 everybody's favorite knockout tournament uh if you've been watching the event thus far you know a couple of things first of all this is the only tournament in chess that magnus carlson hasn't won and this is his fourth time playing and he has made it far but he is on the brink of elimination and that's the second thing that i was going to say yesterday magnus carlsen lost to vincent kaimer from germany and that is a massive setback in today's round he has to win because they play two games against each other if he doesn't win flying home and i will show you a handful of other incredible games and i will keep you up to date on the storylines here we go it is well here's another game that i'm going to show you but my friends magnus carlson must beat the german sensation and uh well e4 from magnus uh e4 is a very flexible first move if you're trying to play for a win if you're trying to play for a not loss you play e5 with black also just generally as you get up to the higher ratings uh you try to take a more scientific approach and by scientific i mean uh with black you try to be rock solid and really know your lines uh and so e4 e5 is a very very nice way to do that magnus plays for a spanish right rue lopez a lot of lines here uh vincent can play the immediate berlin or he can play a6 knight f6 which is just main line it's called morphy's defense nobody actually calls it that though uh a6 bishop back to a4 and knight to f6 white applies pressure here white now has to make a decision does white castle play for c3 d4 and h3 which is normal does white play d3 c3 uh knight c3 rather and d3 and some sort of approach like that magnus already takes us out of some known territory and plays the move d3 it's not uh it it's it's it's not the most popular move in the position he defends the the pawn and basically with this move he is saying i am not really interested in playing for the c3 d4 approach i'm gonna do something else now black can still play d6 b5 bishop e7 which is the traditionalist setup but vincent plays bishop to c5 uh and uh he basically says look magnus if you're going to play passively and if you're not going to play for c3 d4 i'm gonna use this opportunity to put my bishop in the center before i play the move pawn to d6 now white can take white can play knight c3 white king castle i can do a handful of things magnus plays bishop to g5 so this is the develop this night later approach he is not playing c3 d4 he's playing d3 he's playing bishop to g5 and there are lines here actually where black plays h6 and sometimes uh white actually allows g5 what i mean by that is let's say something like castles uh c3 d6 and there's lines where you're you're you're essentially hoping that the person does this that is what you're hoping uh to achieve um and black essentially tries to be very aggressive tries to punish you for putting the bishop there that is basically what magnus was hoping for uh vincent played d6 as you can see from vincent's time he spent eight minutes it's not that he doesn't know this position it it's it's more like the or i don't know maybe he doesn't know or is a little bit unfamiliar but he's trying to understand what exactly magnus wants so d6 now white will obviously castle white will play again for this white will play knight bd2 or knight c3 no no no no no no no uh magnus with his bishops on the edge of the board pinning black in a relative way in an absolute way moves the deep on again and plays the move d4 uh that is a very rare move uh he is not developing his knight he's not playing c3 d4 he just plays d4 immediately taking advantage of the pin that vincent himself created when he did not want to castle and all magnus wants here is imbalance he does this you obviously cannot win this exchange because of the pin uh black could go g5 and then try to win this pawn but then he would lose probably because of various attacks on the e-file vincent plays bishop d7 magnus takes the bit the knight with the bishop and then does this that is all magnus wants he just wanted a position where black has two bishops white has bishop knight knight there's a b file open there's a weak pawn on a6 and we just have a little bit of imbalance that's what you do when you have to play for a win but in the search for imbalance you create imbalance i don't know if you knew that but uh when you create an imbalance you create and okay i'm gonna stop you allow your opponent to also have targets and also have game plans right and here magnus could castle long uh excuse me could castle short but he chooses to play queen d3 which is a very clear indication that he would like to castle on the long side now here there's a lot of different plans vincent spends three minutes and pins him he could have put his rook on b8 he could have put his rook on e8 very difficult to decide what exactly to do here vincent decides i'm not interested in this exchange because that only benefits white uh but i am interested in this because i put pressure on the knight which puts pressure more on the center queen e7 queen e8 rook e8 something is going to attack here i can always play g5 uh and now magnus drops this knight out of the center of the board uh he guards the night with the knight and he is ready to castle queenside like this place pawn to f3 uh right around here i like was just getting out of bed um and uh i looked at this position and i went oh magnus has exactly what he wants so he's gonna try to play this for a win he's going to like what do you think opposite side castling those of you that are experienced you think magnus is going to go g4 h4 g5 blah blah blah blah blah checkmate over there i thought all right it's just a matter of time what if i told you that magnus carlsen lost this game in one move but the position says zero zero zero how was that possible magnus carlson lost this game in one move in this position vincent could have again played rook b8 or something and then magnus would have played g4 and tried to go for some sort of attack vince and played the move queen e5 idea of queen e5 is uh you're always threatening this move just the knight can't really comfortably sit there you're always threatening to rotate you're also unpinning the knight right you have a lot of different ideas like for instance if white plays g4 here uh i would imagine he would have probably tried to move his knight or maybe played d5 magnus thinks and plays the move a3 a3 very natural move my friends the idea of a3 is that you want to attack the bishop if the bishop moves out of your position you're gonna play g4 if the bishop takes you're not gonna take with a knight because if you take with the knight you hang this fork but you're obviously going to take with the queen that's what happened agnes carlson is losing this eval does not do it justice it's much worse than that you know what magnus missed magnus missed that after bishop takes and queen takes you don't have to trade queens if you're playing black instead you can play knight takes e4 with a very simple idea if pawn takes this is a fork and there is no geometrical way there is no way to protect both pieces what magnus would have had to do here is probably play something like bishop to f6 basically give like a you know a certain hand gesture with a finger to his opponent and uh give away the bishop and essentially say look well that wouldn't even be good because there would be a queen trade he would say like i'm down a couple of pawns but you have some weaknesses and if knight takes e4 uh if knight takes e4 queen takes e5 rook takes c5 it's the exact same situation it's just a fork it's a pure fork magnus carlson is now losing the game after queen takes c3 completely unbelievable knight takes e4 magnus would would just be on a plane home like as i'm recording this recap but as you can tell from my voice that didn't happen that's crazy right that is actually crazy pawn to a3 take take knight takes e4 probably game over i mean magnus is not winning i don't know if he's losing but he's not winning instead we have this crazy that's called a double mutual blunder it happens even to the best players in the world uh and you would know because you are one of the best players in the world and and here's the problem magnus has almost no winning chances here either i mean vincent moves the night out of the way uh because uh magnus was going to take and damage his structure magnus take some space vincent plays f6 at the end of the day my friends there's something going on in this position called the opposite colored bishops right it's the opposite color bishop syndrome doesn't matter how many pieces you trade or keep on the board at the end of the day that end game is going to really determine a lot and black creates a structure which is just impregnable he has a knight on e6 his king is going to f7 you'll notice that magnus's pawn moves are all trying to restrict black's pawns on the same color square as his bishop so he's complimenting his bishop by putting the pawns on the opposite color square and in the future if he sneaks in he could maybe take some of these but black is so solid the evaluation is zero zero zero no matter what you do now the one benefit that magnus has going for him actually there's two the one benefit that he has going for him is he is probably the greatest end game player to ever live uh the second thing is he's magnus so when you're upon when you are playing against magnus just inherently you're more nervous than if you're playing gotham you know if vincent kymer had this position against me as black first of all that would already be a massive accomplishment for me he would be thinking to beat me with black he would be thinking this idiot is going to do something stupid and i might even have winning chances that's not his mindset versus magnus so vincent basically sets up a some sort of defensive formation and is essentially just just sitting there going all right well he's gonna come so i'm gonna you know i have to be ready uh when he starts coming so c4 bishop c6 b3 bishop f2 magnus poking vincent dominating the b-file magnus advancing with the bishop advancing with the king and now when everything is controlled he advances with the pawn so does vincent now magnus has to make the right advancement into his opponent's territory plays e5 knocking on the door which of these pawns is going to take whichever one of them takes that's going to be weak but vincent is trying to play a4 and create problems on the b file listen takes place king f plays knight f7 defending the center inviting e6 which would allow the knight to camp on e5 so magnus plays bishop f4 take take here comes vincent with pawn to a4 now here magnus comes up with a very unique idea he plays bishop back to c3 and blocks the pawn essentially saying you've ran out of steam on that side of the board you have doubled isolated pawns which suck all of this all of this stuff allowed me to create an outside pass pawn that is going to be a problem for black it doesn't matter if there's opposite colored bishops it's going to be a problem but in an opposite colored bishop end game this is still a huge draw so rookie 8 vincent makes the time control with one minute on the clock he gets an extra 30 minutes here and now he has to draw this game magnus plays rook to d5 vincent plays bishop c6 brings back the bishop and wins magnus to spawn on g4 the more that time is ticking the closer and closer we are getting to a draw magnus is about to fly home his time is running out vincent plays knight g5 and knight to f3 he's going to get a rook and bishop end game of opposite colors there is nothing magnus can do there is absolutely nothing to be done knight takes f3 bishop takes f3 magnus's king cannot move out of the way of the b-pawn the a pawn is still too far away to be a problem of course he does push it but now vincent has an opportunity to sneak behind and put some pressure like this and he finds the best defensive move i mean nothing magnus can do to this kid is going to dissuade him now bishop to d2 hitting the rook the rook slides to a4 he is giving up this but he's giving it up because the rook is going to stay on the a file because of the bishop now the king goes to c3 and vincent plays pawn to c6 the reason he plays pawn to c6 is that the bishop can actually anchor that pawn on a light square and if you take you lose your most important pawn you cannot lose the outside pass pawn pawn to c6 king to d4 magnus doing his best vincent plays bishop to f3 magnus plays bishop to c3 and vincent plays bishop to g2 but that was a mistake vincent had to keep his bishop either on e2 or on f3 and he also needed to move his king already at this point the plan is a little bit weird like how do you actually defend this position probably you have to waste some time with your king the bishop has to keep an eye on this and this the rook has to keep an eye on this and this and if white could have it his way just so you understand white would walk the king 2c7 to b7 and push the a pawn that is what white wants while keeping everything else stable so vincent plays bishop g2 and magnus finds the only winning move rook to f5 taking away squares from the bishop the bishop now has nowhere to go and here comes magnus's king here comes the king removing the rook from the a file which allows the pawn to run rookie 8 and magnus carlson's sacrifices but not just sacrifices it's not that it's not that he's giving up the rook to make a queen it's that he's getting to the seventh rank and literally out of nowhere magnus wins vincent kymer resigns because of the threats of rook b8 rook takes g7 and you simply cannot stop the pawn from queening that outside pass pawn that outside pass pawn which vincent thought was getting him counter play magnus gave up upon blocked vincent and all he needed was a little bit of help from the a pawn that's it and the pawn made it through it took him 60 moves in the second game vincent kymer loses and now they will go to a playoff and magnus is staying in baku for at least one more day and his hopes of winning this event are still alive my friends i've got some other incredible games to show you let's take a look at alexandra godajkina versus nino batsis really from the women's world cup this game was a was a was a manhunt for the kings it began with a queen's gambit declined we actually saw a really crazy queen's gambit declined yesterday bishop before a capture and black here instead of playing c5 instead of playing knight plays knight to e4 and pawn to g5 oh my goodness getting rid of the principles of chess hitting the bishop in the center hitting the knight pinning the knight with the bishop sacrificing the right to to now rook to g8 there is not going to be any castling we're just going to avalanche our pawns forward could actually plays h3 preventing black from coming forward black plays knight b6 slight in accuracy according to the computer actually the computer preferred this or taking and now could actually plays knight to d2 at this point black has to play pawn to f6 or bishop to f5 you have to deal with the knight here instead black plays knight takes d2 and as you can see from the time spent 20 minutes in an opening this hot is very dangerous knight takes d2 and garia does not take this does not take like this instead she plays boom queen takes h7 this is absolutely nuts this knight is just hanging the rook is hanging the rook has to slide over or up it decides to go up that was obviously the plan now the king has to capture and white's king is in the center while this king is on the verge of a brutal attack here comes black with bishop to f5 laser beam knight bishop the queen and long side castling white has to act now she does pawn to g4 creating a thread the bishop goes to e4 utilizing the pin and hitting the rook probably here there was an anticipation that white would move the rook which would allow black to go here in castle but no karachi can understand she has to play f3 she has to create threats after the capture bishop b5 check again leaving the rook hanging at the cost of attacking the king pawn to c6 and now we leave the bishop to die because black is still two moves away from castling rook to f1 the other rook not this one she plays rook a f1 you can't take this because this is mate so rook f1 you lose the bishop she loses the bishop the knight comes in to hit the king the king just stands on the center of the board king's not afraid of anybody king's not afraid of two stupid pieces over here the queen is stuck the rook is stuck this rook is i'm not even sure doing what and queen takes f7 is literally checkmate knight takes the bishop there is no checkmate but now instead of doing this and allowing this to defend and then long castle but that's gonna plays queen ha check forcing either a king move or a nasty retreat exactly and now she is going to feast on the pawns queen takes d5 you can't trade queens because you're gonna get into a losing end game pawn to b4 queen takes b7 hanging yet another piece because queen f7 is now made again from another angle bishop to e7 the knight comes in good hatch gonna up two pawns black trying to defend but knight takes f6 and look at how she brutalizes the entire position she gives up the night she gives up the rooks and at the end of it all the queen can take but then queen here my friends 28 moves of action the king and queen have not moved have you ever seen something like this it has been black has played 28 moves and the king and the queen have not moved you talk about the utter disrespect the monarchy the monarchy not respecting the lies of the other citizens look at that look at this they're just sitting at home and now they have to move but unfortunately after a couple more checks why does three pawns up four pawns up queen c5 king to b3 yeah and nino can take a pawn back but just check check take this and the game is over what an utterly ridiculous game from start to finish a brutal manhunt g4 f3 check playing rook f1 leaving every piece to hang and she wins an incredible game and she has made it to the quarterfinals uh in style uh we also had obviously prague vs hikaru uh remember prague hikaru was a draw in the first game the winner of this game moves on to the round of 16. uh obviously the loser flies home and yesterday uh hikaru played the english versus prague well this time prague plays the english vs hikaru he has a sense of humor and hikaru plays a massive sideline in this position the most common move by far is either d5 to try to play something like this bishop g2 knight b6 or bishop to b4 hikaru plays a move that i have almost never seen knight to d4 i mean that just looks like this dude with black doesn't know how to play chess because knight takes e5 looks like it wins a pawn it doesn't the idea is queen e7 and if you play knight d3 or knight f3 it's me and i don't think hikaru is gonna get checkmated in six moves in the world cup we save that only for pog champs knight to d4 bishop g2 and in this position prague plays something ridiculous just utterly ridiculous not castles not attacking the bishop not a queen move in this position prague plays g4 there is no respect at being shown to the older generation and yes hikaru is the older generation compared to prague hikaru is like there's 35 36 progress to half his age d3 and prog just develops all of his pieces like this and g4 my friends is he's trying to go long and he does and hikaru attacks that pawn on g4 and rock and play rookie but he just he just gives it up project gives up the pawn completely on g4 he had never any interest in defending it hikaru's got to take because if he cargo goes like this first of all b7 is hanging he can't do that let's say hikaru plays queen c7 prog is gonna go here let's say bishop b6 he car and probably is gonna go here let's say he castle probably gonna keep going we're actually gonna keep going okay he could also take on a7 so he can't even castle but that's the idea so hikaru's got to take the pawn and prague just counter-attacks and prague counter attacks in the center he carves a pawn up but it's a very difficult position hikaru tries to seal it shut prague tries to open it up again hikaru tries to seal its shut but at the cost of one of his pawns knight g3 and hikaru has the castle long to avoid a confrontational battle e4 f3 look at this brick wall of wall of pawns that prague who plays bishop to h7 and goes takes and pawn to f5 a clutch defensive move opposite colored bishops again just like we saw in the magnus game but after take take hikaru creates sufficient amount of counter play and a good light squared setup prague trying to do stuff on the center but we are going to an opposite colored bishop and rook end game and uh prague is still attacking and still posing problems but unfortunately it's just not enough we have takes we have rookie 8 hikaru cerebral giving up a pawn on a7 it doesn't matter because opposite color bishops end games are so drawn rookie 5 he doesn't even care about this bishop to e4 this is a very smart move and the point is that the pawns could try to make it through but after this look how beautiful this position is it doesn't matter because pawn to d7 king d8 bishop b6 is not possible check king d8 bishop d4 and in this position the players agree to a draw because after takes takes takes he carves up a pawn these pawns cancel out bishop and pawn versus bishop and two is a guaranteed draw and these two will go to a tie break exciting stuff nothing to choose between them uh two more games for you fabiano caruana is just you know what i'm gonna say that for last how about that how about that our generic i see java kirsten for the second world cup in a row absolute tang from uzbekistan a couple of world cups ago uh aka the most recent one uh he beat ali reza farouza now in that legendary game where they couldn't decide which type of handshake to do now now he took down mvl our generic icy uh by the way we have a spanish just like we had in the magnus game but in open spanish this time as black takes in the center takes lots of theoretical stuff here the pawn now for black is gonna go to d4 and it's gonna go to d3 for the untrained eye this looks completely horrible for white but it's not this is real theory all of this has been played look at the fact that they have spent literally zero time in the first 15 moves in fact they have more time than they started with they are still not thinking pawn to g4 they are still not thinking bishop to g3 arjun is still not thinking he's still i'm not thinking is he gonna think now oh thank god ah arjuna regice he played 20 moves of memorized theory and didn't spend any time and at this point send out of was down 50 minutes on the clock so cindarov's prep obviously went to around here he remembered queen d7 and clearly that was all analysis and now eric icy has to find the best move and he does the best plan is knight to h4 creating various attacking possibilities and also moving the f pawn in the future and freeing up all of this and maybe even going back this way if you really want to take take d2 the pawn has been stopped and arjun has won the pawn at the cost of that one and it is a relatively balanced game but white is better uh white is better because he has a bit more of a more powerful queen these pawns are going to be liabilities in the end game especially with the a-file and the bishop is better than the knight like the bishop is just better than the knight in most end games and here comes arjun right the knight has to probably move g5 is a nice counter attack uh we have a lot of tension rook is pinning the knight pawn is hitting the queen we have takes takes takes and a rook end game white is still better white is better because of black's weak structure that is really it white also has an opportunity to be a lot faster with the rook so black's rook has not moved it's been 31 moves the blackrock has not moved rook a1 not allowing the black rook to move rook c8 rook a6 and java here could have just sat and done nothing he tries to break out of the shell take take and goes for this end game where he's a pawn down but now b4 he's just using a sledgehammer to break down the walls here every guys he plays rookie three and is now going to try to win this end game and just so you understand there is absolutely no way that black can do this black cannot do this you will lose the pawn on game it's just math b takes c3 here come the kings black still has decent drawing chances but eric geisey is going to be very annoying he walks the king all the way up the board the rook f3 king d5 and at some point he will probably push the pawn or black is going to lose the pawn on h4 and there it is and now eric i see his two pawns up and there is simply nothing to be done and send out of this entire game was struggling with his structure these two pawns are way too far apart king to b3 and syndara just resigns because there is no way to prevent white from advancing forward and advancing forward on that side of the board it would just be a slow gradual process king f4 he would play something like rook g8 you know you can continue to pin this but i will just go g5 you can't take because you lose the king and pawn end game so you can walk with me all the way but even this is a completely lost end game because the black king is too far it just can never get close so our generic i see moves on to the round of 16 yet another superstar from india all the rest of them are still battling like prague nihal sarin gukesh vidit uh moved on today as well uh after after uh beating by crow and my friends fabiano caruana is back to number two in the world he is now five rating points above hikaru and he is doing it in style he's playing his countryman ray robson this was an italian of course fabi gotta do it rookie one and this game was more or less peaceful until it exploded on move 14 with the move pawn to d4 fabi trying to explode the center of the board and robson trying to hunt him with his queen fabi stabilizes the center by giving up a queen side pawn but those b2 pawns are called poison pawns for a reason because bishop to b3 and all of a sudden the queen is a little bit stuck queen's a little bit stuck you got in there but it's gonna take you a little while to get out and robson doesn't like that very much he doesn't like the fact that for example if rookie 8 is played uh queen d3 and rook b1 could trap the queen in the future so he decides all right i'm gonna get out right now queen c3 but here comes knight f5 queen c7 that entire maneuver cost robson for tempe and my friends in chess you don't frequently get four moves like this you are not allowed to just make a rhombus okay you are not allowed to do that is that a rhombus or a trapezoid is that what that's called no that's not a trapezoid that's a rhombus or a that thing it's a rhombus i'm pretty sure anyway whatever i'm gonna say something stupid you guys are gonna let me know in the comments it'll be beautiful uh yeah bishop takes h6 and fabi just says you waste the time with the queen here comes mine you can't stop queen h6 just can't stop it robinson's like what are you talking about of course i can if i was like no you can't i can't even give up my pawn with a check it doesn't matter you can't stop queen h6 robin's like what are you talking about stupid just did it i stopped queen text bobby's like ray no you didn't no you didn't ray it it's there it is king h7 okay five and fabi just breaks down the center pawn takes even look at this gives up the rook completely gives up everything he's gonna give up every he's gonna give up both rooks queen h6 and in this position ray robson resigned in fabiano caruana five points above hikaru for back in number two in the world knocks out ray robson he's into the round of 16 my friends tomorrow we will know the fate of magnus versus kymer we will know the fate of hikaru versus prague and so much more to come i hope you've enjoyed world cup coverage get out of here
