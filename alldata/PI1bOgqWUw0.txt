ladies and gentlemen one of the most fun things to watch in chess is terrible chess low ELO chess but another very fun thing to watch in chess is nearly perfect chess chess that the best robot the best computer in the world stockfish blesses blows a kiss to drops the salt on whatever it might be and it's really fun when it's played by Magnus Carlson best chess player in the world and in today's video lucky for you I have three games that Magnus played yesterday July 12 2023 against an opponent uh in the aim chess rapid it's a online chess tournament with some hundred thousand dollars uh in prizes it was Sensational magnets getting it done with black with white in Ridiculous Ways and I'm going to show you also if you are watching this video in July 2023 we just hit 4 million subscribers so thank you that's an insane number that is a population larger than some countries that is a number that I can't really fathom and obviously that number grows and grows as I keep making content and you keep watching it but thank you thank you thank you very much I'm glad to be uh that individual for you uh for chess uh whether it's for yourself a relative whatever it might be um let's see some perfect chess from Magnus Carlson this is really really the this is this is incredible stuff the first game he is playing with the black pieces and he plays uh G6 after Knight F6 trying to play some sort of King's Indian with Bishop G7 you determine what is going to happen with the d-pawn whether it's D6 or D5 his opponent does this and Magnus plays D6 so he is not going to play a grunfeld an audio back plays G3 he is playing a fianchetto setup so he could have developed Nai and put the pawn here instead he plays G3 and Magnus actually plays a sideline he does not naturally develop the bishop and Castle which is like what is played 95 of the time Magnus does what he does in a lot of his games uh which is take young players out of their opening comfort zone he is the master of this so he plays C6 it's too early in the game to be like well there's ideas and this and that and if blah blah blah so white plays Bishop G2 and now Magnus doesn't play Bishop G7 or Knight D7 or Bishop he plays Queen A5 check that's not a good move like if that was a good move it would be played a lot more often it isn't like a very bad move no is it an inaccuracy kind of but not enough to not be played by Magnus Magnus frequently will take people out of memorized territory to make them swim on their own to make them run the obstacle course on their own with no memory and the idea of this move is to make white block this somehow and then play chess and so for example the move Bishop D2 looks really natural but now white has to deal with this maybe white will play B3 but now why is the bishop here right so he's just looking for something just a little small thing his opponent plays Knight C3 his opponent does not want to put anything on D2 so now Magnus doesn't even play Bishop G7 he plays Knight E4 he's breaking the principles of the opening he's he's moving a piece multiple times to put some Pressure Queen B3 and now he develops like this because he's pinning which is very funny castles and now he takes and regardless of how his opponent takes there's going to be doubled pawns Queen C3 he will go here here and they will play a queenless middle game or BC castles and this is what we are working with Magnus has not spent any time now he does his opponent plays E4 seizing control of the entire Center and this is the position Magnus has exactly what he wants a brand new position after some 10 moves to go to work eight pawns on the board Queen's Rooks every piece except he traded a knight for his opponent's night now he can come back or he can attack the center he plays C5 thinks for two minutes and tries to fight with this bishop tries to bring the Knight to uh C6 and a big moment white probably should not play D5 first of all it hangs upon and second of all like if you just for some reason did not take uh this structure is bad for white it's completely immobile and black will spend the rest of the game hammering away at it and trying to win these pawns so not your back plays Bishop F4 and Magnus plays Knight D7 he does not play Knight C6 because well frankly I'm not really sure maybe he didn't like D5 now and now the Knight has to go back I don't know what he didn't like I didn't ask him Knight to D7 is what he plays instead and now knows your back attacks his pawn and Magnus has to defend it in this kind of passive way Rook D1 and I told you Knight B6 to pressure this Pawn a very close structure and nodes your back over commits the queen after spending nearly half his time now there is a rule in chess uh In classical game games long games if you spend 15 minutes on a move it's probably going to be a bad move because you're just not sure of what to do and not your back spends half of his time and sends the game into a queenless position he removes his weakness but now Magnus ceases control of the game Knight A4 hasn't moved any of these pieces barely move this the Knight is going to attack the pawn it's actually very hard to defend if you go back that's ugly if you do this well Bishop to E6 I'm targeting another weakness now could Magnus have played Knight B2 yet but I don't think nojarek would have blundered the rook and then Magnus would have had to relocate so Magnus plays Bishop E6 and he is trying to get noji back to play this move so that now two pawns hang and then if you play this move I get in with my knight and then if you play this move to defend this I can take on A2 and get out so Rook C2 and now A6 poking a hole at the queen side the bishop goes back to defend Magnus now kicks out this bishop and makes it take a position that will clog the position for white and Knight G5 is not possible and the bishop will no longer see this so the Rook will get to move Bishop E3 Rook C8 every move flows from the previous move Magnus has now comfortably seized control of the game the Bishops stare at the structure the Rooks are staring at the position that's about to open Knight C3 is staring every piece that Magnus has is playing an active and participatory if that's a word if it's not I just made it a word it's a word now I have four million subscribers I'm allowed to decide what's a word and what's not a word Rook C1 I'm like a toddler who's like it's my birthday so I'm allowed to poop on the snow 6 the pawn on A2 is hanging and the Knight is going in on the C4 Square noisier back pushes his Bishop backwards Magnus plays Bishop D7 inviting an exchange Rook B1 Rook C7 stabilizing everything he trades allows the rook in but the Knight is rotating the Knight is rotating because he wants to go here and here or here or here or here or back in the other way depends what's gonna happen in the game noise your back goes back Magnus plays Rook A4 beautiful move C4 by nodular back and now the Knight no longer has any forward Mobility Pawn to B6 the idea is to rotate the Rook behind the pawn and the bishop cuts the defense so Magnus is going to win that pawn or black is gonna white is gonna have to play extremely passively now the Knight Returns to pressure G4 here here here najibank plays Rook C2 Rook A6 stabilizing one more time Magnus being patient pushing the pieces back Knight E5 again seven seconds for white he lashes out but he lashes out inaccurately Magnus grabs the pawn and now after F takes G5 here this was either a mouse Loop or something absolutely brilliant he played H5 and I think the idea was just to block White's position now of course he could have just Mouse slipped but so I don't actually know I don't think there was anything wrong with taking this and then if this there was rookie four might have been a small Mouse lip but I actually don't know but he plays H5 and then he takes and yeah White's just not going anywhere Bishop D4 Magnus stabilizes the center brings this King up to G6 an absolutely beautiful position and this game was literally never in doubt as he gets the bishop end game completely winning and not your back resigns because the pawns are just marching down the board this man just beat a 28-30 rapid rated player and it was never close I mean literally it was never close it's like a sporting event where in the first minute or the there's a goal or there's a you know you score a three-point shot and that's it tennis straight sets it was never close he played a line that I've never seen in my life like I've never seen Queen A5 check I've never just never seen this move and then he goes here all he does is damage his opponent's structure and he literally won the game because of this how does he do that like the entire game was just about the pressure on the queen side Knight B6 it was just it's just Queen side pressure look at this he pressures the queen side he's just pressuring this this this right ace now he's pressuring B5 Magnus won this game on this side of the board how does he do that how does he just isolate a side of a board and make it look so simple now it's a best of four so they play first to two and a half if it's two to two you're gonna play a playoff so now they get a game in Magnus plays white and this game was incredibly impressive as well but in a completely different way so what you saw last game was was it was a snake it was nod your back asleep and Magnus slithering up to him and just wrapping himself there was nothing he could do this time we have a sicilian and we have Knight F6 and now not Knight C3 but a sideline Bishop D3 not a popular move by any stretch of the imagination once again Magnuson the first 10 moves of the game taking the game away from known territory making his opponent walk the obstacle course run the obstacle course swim the track on his own without any memory all right how do you adapt to your surroundings Pawn to D6 now Magnus plays C4 the position resembles known territory but it's not exactly known territory Bishop to E7 Knight C3 A6 pretty good Bishop E3 both sides Castle now this kind of resembles what's called a marakshi bind in uh m-a-r-o-c-z-y uh it's a Hungarian term I believe and uh the idea is just to put a bunch of Pawns on light squares and have a big space advantage in the center and life is quite good uh black tries to fight back with D5 with B5 with F5 and some lines and if black doesn't fight back then you know White's just gonna walk into the black position and then take everything and go home um B6 this is uh also known as a hedgehog structure because everything is along the sixth rank very spiky F4 Queen C7 Rook C1 and now Magnus plays in a way that is quite common if you would like to defeat a hedgehog structure so it's a hedgehog now um it it's not exactly a maroxy bind because the maroxy bind is kind of against the Dragon so we're getting a little bit technical here stick with me don't go anywhere you're gonna learn something real quick real quick don't go anywhere I I know could be a little bit boring so the maroxy bind looks like this okay and it again the setup looks similar but different because Black's Bishop is on a different angle right the setup in the game looks that way but it's not exactly that because the bishop is not so it looks like it but the difference is that white can be more aggressive and this is one of the most principled ways to play against What's called the Hedgehog structure is you create an attack with a move like G4 this is really aggressive stuff uh Magnus is just trying to absolutely blow his opponent off the board the Knight is going to go back opening up some opportunities for pieces or pawns to get in is Black's position fine totally Knight C5 but a little bit dangerous the bishop goes to B1 and we can see already Magnus has very nasty attacking possibilities on the king black plays Bishop to B7 Magnus plays Queen F3 walking directly into this pin because you need to defend E4 G6 stopping white from getting to what he wants and if you play G5 then he's gonna go Knight H5 so you don't really want that so we just saw Magnus play a perfect game of chess where he won an absolutely Flawless positional win by transitioning a middle game into an end game applying pressure from start to finish and winning with black normally if you do that as a chess player you don't have the other personality trait you do not also you know fire off a bunch of rounds with the pistols spin it around blow you know blow the smoke and put it in your pocket like you're not also a firefighter okay it's like an in mixed martial arts okay if you're a wrestler you're not gonna get into striking matches okay it's very rare you've got ever it's very rare you've got a Jon Jones okay I know he's got a bit of a he's got a bit of a history but he's an incredible wrestler and Striker right a vulcanovsky well-rounded at everything right Magnus can do it all before he's now got five out of seven pawns Advanced two squares that's an aggressive formation and here Magnus lands a disgusting infiltration G5 Knight H5 how does white get into the black position he can advance with H Pawn and pawns and all of this but if you go here black gets the Knight to E5 could be a little bit dicey Magnus plays Knight D5 losing a knight sacrificing a knight to infiltrate and the idea is disgusting if e takes D5 it's it's it's this to push the queen back but the real idea is to sacrifice another night to go Knight F5 and if this then you play Queen H5 and there's no way to stop the bishop because I'm gonna go here and here and if you take that just facilitates the attack right in fact I'm not even sure I have to take I can go here first and you just get absolutely butchered I have Rook C3 Rook H3 Magnus forces a double Knight sacrifice infiltration of the black position this man is a genius Knight to D5 and his opponent doesn't have to take but that's the point magnus's ideas are like onions to quote Shrek not that they smell and make your breaths uh terrible Queen d8 they've got layers his ideas have layers he sacrifices the night but guess what if you don't take I'm not playing Hope Chest I just grabbed the bishop now you don't have a dark squared bishop and how many pawns do you have on light squares most five out of seven that means your dark squares are weak but you don't have a dark squared Bishop exactly now you're catching on Queen H3 and I'm rotating over here to pressure not your back plays rookie eight rookie one the Rooks are on the same file e-f-e-f Queen back to d8 the Knight rotates and we're looking over here we're looking to get rid of the night blockade and attack on the H file it's a tough position plays E5 after some thought he's down to two minutes but E5 just allows the very natural F5 no it's your back however fights fire with fire you gotta respect it uh instead of E5 the computer was recommending A5 if any human being played A5 against you report them just they're cheating like I don't even know what to tell you the computer is such a scumbag it's just like oh so White's got a queen two Rooks three pawns Bishop Bishop Knight all trying to create an attack over here yeah A5 this is why we hate chess computers they don't make any sense they don't make any sense okay E5 F5 he tries to Fight Fire With Fire but Magnus slowly building it up pressure here pressure here pressure here pressure on the D file the position is on the verge of collapse nojebek is spending his time he's down to two minutes Magnus plays Bishop to D3 just defending the center rookie eight now he takes on F6 one Pawn is gone Bishop H6 infiltrates tries to fight back and lock the position Magnus takes the pawn and he picks up the Rook now you'll see that the engine still thinks it's a bit of a back and forth it doesn't think it's completely lost but Magnus plays Knight G3 and in this position with uh with just a minute on the clock he's trying to simplify najiber plays Knight F4 but I got news for you Agnes just gets rid of the Knight because not every attack has to end in Checkmate Pawn takes F4 Queen F4 he's just up two Pawns he's up two pawns one of them can be won back because of this pin F1 full common collected King F1 noji back down to 30 seconds Place Queen G7 now mag just plays F6 giving up the pawn sacrificing to push black backwards now White's King walks to the center and unfortunately we're gonna have a little bit of chaos here all right we're gonna have a little bit of chaos players get low on time things happen but up to this point a Flawless performance and even in the time scrambles simplifying beautifully bringing the pieces forward and backwards in the right amount of Harmony and knows you're back I believe here lost on time or resigned but in any case it's over because he's down two pawns this is a mate if you ever step off the diagonal there's nothing black can do you can play Queen E5 I can play Queen D4 I'm two pawns up this is an effortless end game for Magnus to win what a game punctuated by the infiltration like the absolutely beautiful monstrous Central setup G5 Knight to D5 with the intention to sacrifice both Knights Pawn takes and infiltrate like this I mean this is just Sensational stuff rendering Black's pieces completely immobile not a single one of Black's pieces can move forward as he sits around waiting for white to arrive and deliver a fatal blow two games my friends he was perfect in more ways than one now this game was not played with 100 perfect accuracy from start to finish but if you've made it this far in the video I'm going to serve you some dessert what Magnus did in this game was disgusting it was disgusting what he did um and I'm going to show it to you now and this is why he's the best player in the world so just like game number one Knight F6 but now E6 not G6 his opponent plays the Catalan noisy brick plays G3 same opening he played in game one but a different opening for black C5 keep in mind Magnus needs to draw this game so he's won the first two it's the best of four so he has two out of two a draw wins in the mini match he takes on D4 knows your back castles before recapturing and we have the following position neither side has DNC pawns No Ex pressures on this diagonal pressures on the D file Magnus plays Bishop here finishes up his development and has a relatively normal position with absolutely no problems but one of the hardest games to play in chess is when you have to not lose now that might sound silly to you because in all chess games you are trying not to lose it's not quite the same when you boot up a chess game your life is in equilibrium zero draw or win it doesn't really matter but when you are playing in a mini match and you've already won two games your brain is like well I just gotta not lose I gotta maybe draw the game and that messes with you a little bit so nausea back plays Rook C1 Magnus develops his pieces he plays Knight C5 and Magnus is actually happy to get rid of this bishop because that night with his Bishop because his position is very reasonable he can just bring out his Queen he can bring his Rooks to the center and life is good but he doesn't play perfectly he plays Knight to B6 and he allows his opponent to take this Knight because I'm assuming he thought that the light squares here would be weakened but not your back is a desperate man A desperate man's got desperate plans so he tries to create a little bit of imbalance Bishop to C3 and Magnus trades Queens because again he has to not lose he's not really playing like for maximum complications he just has to not lose the game he plays rookie eight what does his opponent do trades Rooks and Magnus is like I can't lose this position and he's right he probably can't lose this position Rook Bishop Knight let's not forget the Bishops are on opposite colors the drawing chances increase so much when that's the case if the Rooks get traded dead draw right so F3 clever move to play E4 you can't take because of background Magnus plays Knight D5 threatening the bishop another bricks I take the bishop wait a second but Bishops are better than Knights and end games right like you know that I know that so why on Earth is Magnus breaking the rules he's supposed to preserve the bishop when you get good enough at chess you can break the rules uh excuse me not Magnus knows your back why is nod your back I have it's a Freudian slip I'm so used to Magnus doing genius things and end games why is nojebek volunteering his Bishop for capture why is he breaking the rules because he doesn't agree with the principles right now the principles and rules were made to be broken right now he actually estimates this Knight on a dark Square will do more damage than this bishop on any side of the board the bishop doesn't have a lot of mobility and white can block it out and by doing this these are no longer weaknesses and white can focus on hammering away at A7 Magnus plays A5 you would think Bishop for Knight in an endgame outside pass Pawn this is magnus's game to win that's what you would think Rook D6 but it's actually not your back who is suddenly asking the questions and in this position Magnus could have played Bishop B3 or something he plays C5 which is a little bit of a trappy move but C5 is an inaccuracy the idea of C5 is kind of flexing that you can't take this because of a fork but Magnus should have just defended himself because after a move like 91 he could play Rook d8 and try to advance over here bring his King out but Magnus committed his C pawn and you can't take this now 91. now the pawn is hanging and suddenly if you play C4 I go here and you lose the pawn oops there's a massive difference in fact nojibek attacks the pawn and Magnus is actually forced to lose a pawn not only that he's forced to lose both he's gonna get this back but he is going to be in some serious trouble in fact after King E3 he doesn't win the pawn back at all what what happened well Magnus didn't like that in this position his Bishop was stuck he very briefly calculated this and decided I'm losing here's the problem Rook C2 Knight D3 now if you take this King D4 is very unpleasant so Magnus is just down two Pawns in a rook end game you've watched long enough in this video I think you know what's going to happen I told you Magnus plays perfect chess in different ways the first game magnesium boa constrictor-like from an equal position slight imbalance in the opening taking advantage of one small thing and winning last game gorgeous tactical flare transitioning it back into a winning end game but you can also Play Perfect chess defensively one of the most underappreciated elements of sport is defense one of the most underappreciated elements of Magnus Carlson's chess defense he just doesn't freaking lose he's down two Pawns in this end game he's got no business saving it he keeps his Rook on his opponent's back Rank and attacks his pawns his opponent plays E4 Magnus brings his King to the center if you try to attack my pawns I can defend them while threatening this his opponent plays Rook D2 and tries to make forward progress Magnus plays G5 trying to restrict that blob of Pawns Here Comes not your back that's it the game is over Magnus plays Rook F1 attacking one of noisierbeck's Pawns he plays King back to E3 respecting the threat but now we're going over here but now Rook D5 if you take this I take this that's completely lost so he plays F6 knows your back is making progress Rook to C3 check King to D2 passive he should have went King to D4 King to D2 is fine because if you take this the pawn is going to sneak through but Magnus is not gonna fall for that Rook C4 noji back plays H4 the best move attacking the Integrity of magnus's structure Magnus plays G4 to force the Rook down here and after FG HG he walks over and he could win this game potentially but Magnus is still going to create some practical problems no it's your back in the face of practical problems and time ticking takes this but now this but he's probably still winning because he's going to get the pawn but now Magnus uses that pawn and plays F2 and if you take the pawn I'm gonna take the pawn on e4 but it's still got to be winning he's two pawns up in a rook end game that doesn't make any sense nobody can draw rook and game down two pawns that's just not possible Magnus plays plays Rook F5 and now Magnus finds The Rook sacrifice so he's gotta play Rook F2 but he's he's still up two pawns this is easy you just bring the pawns forward and this you trade the pawns and you that's it it's got to be easy right Max plays the most active move ninja break plays Rook H2 now Magnus play uh King F7 anticipating the forward Avalanche let's go Bring It On One Last Stand by Magnus King F4 he gives a check the king slides over now we attack the pawn how do you defend the pawn you gotta bring the king over Rook goes to the side I can give side checks I can get here comes H5 Pawn is now three squares away from queening the King walks over Pawn to G4 King H6 Rook to D2 to try to play Rook D6 as well as rook d8 and give checks from over here if needed Rook F1 Rook F2 it's over it's gotta be over he's making progress Rook A5 down to 20 seconds for both sides can najibek find the way King G3 maybe Rook at five something like this he goes here Magnus immediately Zips back where's the wind Rook F1 check where's the wind Here Comes Magnus oh my goodness now the only way to win here is to try to sneak around he doesn't find it and now instead of playing Rook G4 and King F6 and advancing it's King G5 Magnus found a way to blockade all three pawns and he's gonna win the Pawns and he's going to save this end game this is ridiculous Rook F4 he's blocked both pawns it's a draw two pawns down this man the Monumental defensive hold and not your back please uh Magnus plays Rook F4 and they just agreed to withdraw there's nothing that can be done he's just gonna win this you can't play Rook H2 because I take were there moments in this game that with perfect chess white would have won yes but Magnus posed like 30 questions and his opponent was unable to answer was this more of a throw by white than a Hold by Magnus I don't think so I think norger back wins this end game against literally anybody else on the planet every human being on the planet except Magnus it's the magnesian effect it's the it's the ability to flip the switch and play the most perfect chess in a type of position even if he made mistakes prior a ridiculous day at the office I mean just like Perfection incredible game where he squeezed him in game one with the black pieces a tactical flare sacrificing his Knights and the ridiculous stockfish level defensive hold if not your back was playing against the bot he probably would have had the same result granted there was time travel this is just how he does it man it's unbelievable I will see you in the next video thank you all so much once again for the continued support uh and four million subscribers much love to you all thanks so much for playing chess or watching it or getting someone else to play it or watch it I'll see you in the next video get out of here
