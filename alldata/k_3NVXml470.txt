we've been chasing the cleanest possible desktop setup for more than eight years we've hidden e-gpus inside pre-made Furniture drilled holes through desktops and even built our own desk from scratch but every one of these Solutions compromised low performance Jank lies I mean it's not really Wireless if you need wires to charge it every few weeks is it so we've never quite nailed the concept until now introducing the clean setup to end all clean setups 1800 square inches of uninterrupted desktop surface and it's going to stay that way this desk can charge your mouse it can charge your keyboard it can charge your phone without ever soiling its surface with an unsightly cable I cannot wait to show you guys how we pulled this off look at look looked in no tricks guys look ah no fancy VFX oh I'm stuck stuck telling you about our sponsor we couldn't have done this without our friends at LG and they are featuring the 45 gr95 QE a 45 inch 800r curved OLED it's 3440 by 1440 runs at 240 hertz with g-sync and freesync premium and it is the centerpiece of our ultimate setup we could have taken the easy path here solar powered keyboards definitely exist and continuously charging a mouse is as simple as buying one of these and slapping it on your desk but this is Linus Tech tips darn it it not only has to be zero cables it needs to be zero compromises I mean what I'm gonna have a top of the line gaming Monitor and I'm gonna pair it with some b-tier Bluetooth keyboard I mean while I'm at it why don't I have a hump under my desk pad and a stupid wire running over the back you make these compromises and before you know it it's not the cleanest setup it's just a setup zero compromises means maximum performance and to achieve that we've gone with the killer combination of a Logitech G Pro X Wireless and an MX mechanical mini they use logitech's light speed and Bolt Wireless technology respectively which boasts same or better performance compared to wired peripherals but we've got a problem as it stands both of these require occasional charging which inevitably turns into a random cable hanging over your desk that you totally would have put away but like you're probably going to need it soon anyway right wrong regular viewers are going to know how we tackled the keyboard already this MX mechanical mini has been modified with an internal qi-compatible charging coil meaning that keeping it topped up is as simple as placing it down in exactly the right spot on the desk we're not what's this it still charges over here and over here since the last video we've taken things a step further and we've embedded a total of nine charging coils in the desk itself meaning that our keyboard is going to stay charged pretty much anywhere that would be ergonomic to use it for work or for gaming as for the mouse I'm even more proud of that one logitech's power play mat is an amazing solution for never charging your mouse again but it has some significant quality of life issues first up it's proprietary so you can't just install the puck in your mouse get some random G-spot and tape it to the bottom of your desk you have to use their mat the good news is that you can slap your own desk pad over top of the mat but the bad news is that you'll end up with this awful hump so we cracked it open to see can it be slimmed down but unfortunately the answer was no so then if power play is working right now how did we do it what if I told you guys that right side up is just a construct as it turns out the power play mat works perfectly fine upside down and like other wireless charging Solutions it doesn't need to be right up against the mouse that it's charging so just like with the chi spots for our wireless keyboard we were able to see and see out all but two millimeters of our desktop surface here then Mount the power play Upside down inside the desk and here it is I am so impressed that it works not only through the desk but also through our desk pad by the way we have three varieties of deskpad now Northern Lights stealth and when check them out on lttstore.com let's get some head shots shall we part of that gaming Clinic I just put on yeah I knew that was coming it was obviously the monitor did we mention that the 45 gr95qe produces true to life color a great HDR experience and deeper blacks than conventional LCDs with a four side virtually borderless design and anti-glare coating to deliver a new level of immersion for distraction-free gaming now getting this monitor to work at Peak efficiency with zero visible wires was a significant challenge while there have been major advancements in wireless HDMI 3440x1440 at 240 hertz is a lot of bandwidth and even if we could transmit it wirelessly somehow it wouldn't be latency free and we would still have to deal with power anyway so we took some inspiration from our peripherals and we put the cables inside the power and DisplayPort cables go inside the post of this basic clamp-on Mount that we let's say modified with some extra holes to keep the cables out of sight if you look at the bottom of the mount then you will see or I guess you won't see that the cables disappear down into the desktop never to re-emerge we did have to get a little sneaky we used a Mini DisplayPort cable then a full sized adapter so we didn't have to try to feed a full-sized connector through the relatively small hole in the base of the mount then the other end goes to this cable channel here that goes all the way to the back where the power splits out to this holder for the brick and the DisplayPort cable joins up with the rest of the cables in our umbilical cord okay there are some cables we need some cables no no I no this is very clean while we're on the subject of cables our umbilical cord contains not just DisplayPort and power but also USB for our fairly generous side mounted i o we've got USB type a USB type c and a headphone microphone combo Jack we thought about putting this on the front but from an aesthetic standpoint we felt that it would be better to have it out of the way also the front is full of wireless charging stuff well sort of that's a lie we had some space left over and we decided to use it to build a small drawer for holding pens or CDs or whatever other clutter you wouldn't dream of scattering around on a desktop so clean and so pure I was on the fence about even having the phone charging spot because like really do you need to have this here but the way that I and realistically just about everyone live Tethered to our cell phones it just makes sense to have a spot for it now there are high powered Qi Chargers that are designed to go through a desk surface but if you're wondering how we did this since we were hollowing out the inside of our desk anyway we just used a random off-the-shelf Q charger and once again we shaved our top surface down to about two millimeters ensuring adequate charging performance you might think and in fact I had some serious questions about this project when I heard about it that hollowing out and shaving down the entire inside of the desk means giving up sturdiness in the desktop itself but I'm happy to report that unless you were to dance a little jig over the mousing surface it's not even noticeable in day-to-day use like check this out David see I can get a little bit of flex here if I really push on it but like moving a mouse go ahead find the flex if anything it's been an improvement in the user experience since hollowing it out helped to reduce the weight of the desk so much yeah it's not even that bad anymore we started out with a 5x5 sheet of one inch Baltic birch plywood that we then cut in half and then stacked to give ourselves a two inch plywood sandwich it's not the skinniest desktop in the world but it's also no thicker than the Butcher Block desktop that I use at home so I think from the outside no one would realize that there is so much Tech hidden away in here I guess you probably want to know how maintenance would work if you ever needed to swap anything out right the trickiest or maybe let's say most finicky part of assembly and disassembly are the right leg and the post of the monitor stand in both cases it's because cables have to pass through with fairly narrow clearances and relatively tight angles as long as you're aware of the situation when you've got those two bits of metal only Loosely attached to the desk as a whole you can avoid accidentally moving things too far and causing damage to the desktop surfaces the other major pain point is only a problem after installation if you need to change what I O you're including on the side of the desk the tiny nuts and bolts that secure the i o ports have very small clearances so you either need tiny hands or some good needle nose pliers in order to get them installed other than that installing Chargers running cables through the various channels it's shockingly straightforward and even fitting in the monitor's power brick is pretty trivial the drawer is simply made out of some thinner plywood that we cut on our laser cutter and then we use this little drawer popping mechanism here to make it easier to open though with it being installed at this janky angle it is a little bit less smooth than we'd like I think I made it look pretty good earlier but I don't know it's all right really we don't expect anyone to try duplicating this build at home as you need a pretty large CNC router but hey maybe we could Inspire some of the companies that are Mass producing cheap gamer desks to put a little more effort into their designs because honestly speaking other than machine time materials cost on this is next to nothing and I think it is by far the best clean setup we or you know what I'm going for it fighting words or anyone else have ever done I love this thing just like I love telling you about our sponsor just kidding it was brought to you by LG we already told you everything you need to know it's an OLED 240Hz gaming monitor foreign
