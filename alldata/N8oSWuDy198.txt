ladies and gentlemen we all want to get better at the game of chess but it's not always easy to figure out exactly how to do that well in today's video I'm going to be showing you quite a fun example do let me know in the comments if you like it I will be digging through a couple of subscriber games around 1 1100 ELO and then I will be showing you games at 15 1600 level ELO we're going to be looking at the side by side difference of the opening stage the middle game decision making poor tactical spotting good tactical spotting defensive resourcefulness and the ability to make a comeback in a game and hopefully this will inspire you to improve your chess whether you're 300 800 20 300 if you're 2300 I don't really know why you're watching this but you know maybe you want to go back in time and and reminisce on the good old days okay so I I have four games so we're gonna look at two games where uh subscribers lost then we're gonna look at two games where subscribers didn't lose and we're gonna learn from all these games so it sounds good right it's a nice way to learn all right and by the way if you're watching this and you're like 600 you're like oh my God like I gotta I've really gotta step my game up yeah you do you do no disrespect but you do um okay so this very first game subscribers playing with the white pieces and is a is a thousand and seventy and our opening actually can take a pause on on move three it's very common at low ELO that people try to play very simple very straightforward type of stuff and that they got in like a beginner video but and this is all fine but they're not actually digging into the the intricacies of the position essentially what black is doing is trying to avoid the fried liver which you don't have to avoid you also don't have to play H6 you know you can play Bishop C5 you you can play Bishop C5 before you play Knight F6 the move H6 is seldom seen at intermediate level I'm sure you faced it um but frequently the opening at this level is just kind of this weird E4 E5 completely symmetrical type of thing which which is fine but in chess you should be striving to get some sort of Advantage at least early in the game uh and now of course black should be trying to develop and Castle but black immediately rushes with the move Bishop E6 which again is fine like people for the most part like to do stuff like this so far so good I I wouldn't say anything is is terrible but I will say that you know again you should try to minimize the amount of completely symmetrical King's Pawn positions that you are playing just me telling you this as a chess coach once you get to around a Thousand Eleven Hundred because you're good enough to learn ways to put pressure on opponents like play the ponziani or play the scotch or play the Vienna on the second move right uh or you have to know how to punish H6 and the best way to punish H6 is to play for D4 as fast as possible uh you know listen many Grand Masters would be playing this uh if you know if if it was actually good it's not good white really should Rush with this move but okay so far so good trying to play but see like you just played Pawn to C3 right you played C3 because you're trying to go D4 that's the whole idea of this entire thing and you spend 26 seconds right so the opening the understanding of the opening is just not quite there is it a bad move no for long-term development though that's not a good move D5 that's that's a pretty decent move by black uh and now black castles I mean I really can't hate this at all uh Bishop B3 is not an unreasonable move I don't even dislike Rook D1 although I will say an intermediate player at this point would go opposite side castling I should play B4 and then I should play A4 and this is the way you play opposite side castling positions 1500s just know a little bit more like alarm Bells go off in their head every position is not a mystery opposite side castling means center benefits you know if it's closed like white wants something like this look at White's Advantage now up to plus 1.6 in this position White's Advantage is only 0.8 0.7 if if you just trade it doubles which is crazy because what it means is the center is locked and now white can start firing away over here right so just very interesting one Pawn trade can double in evaluation um and and white just never you know white just plays on the wrong side of the board White you know plays Rook D1 and then and then plays D4 one second on the move d4 right so just not understanding like the demands of the position just sort of playing moves and and seeing what happens and a lot of this is exactly that for example in this position um you you can take only four because what happens if you don't what happens if you don't is that you blunder a fork and a lot of a thousand level chess is is getting hit with a move and going oh man I didn't see that Grand Masters don't play like that and 15 1600s also don't play like that you have to anticipate what's gonna happen you can't just think oh rats I missed that move black had to think where's the maximum danger in the position it's right here and now we have a queen trade and white is up a bishop white is just purely up a bishop now the way you win this game is you bring most of your pieces out you trade down and you win an endgame or you somehow deliver a Checkmate that's a terrible move so black spent three seconds on this move no 1500 on planet Earth with plain Knight takes Bishop not a single one because you're losing I mean if okay maybe there is one right I shouldn't say zero percent this is just terrible decision making um and uh and and and now white again just not understanding the demands of the position the demands of the position are to play something like Knight H4 trade the Rooks infiltrate win the end game you're up a full night you have everything the same except you're up a full night it gets a little bit crazier because black actually trades both Rooks no 1500 on planet Earth Place Knight takes Bishop no 50. this is just craziness this is just an easy win for white but you might remember that might not be the result if I'm playing with white here I'm going Knight f395 I'm not even thinking about it I'm gonna I'm gonna make sure I can trade the knights don't push your pawns forward in the end game like a crazy person oh my goodness what what how does that even happen what is this King F4 oh no take it two times take it two times very nice now you gotta be careful here you gotta use your knight you can't just get into a race you never know what's gonna happen you are completely winning here King E5 okay King E6 okay still good now you gotta bring the Knight back you can't stop the pawn with the King now white tries something completely ridiculous with five and a half minutes on the clock since thus far now white decides I'm gonna get into a race with five minutes and loses the race loses the race and now black has a queen and I mean now Black's chances to save this game have gone up dramatically Queen A2 check Queen takes G2 and white hangs the queen with five minutes on the clock white plays the move Queen A8 check in three seconds and hangs the queen that is inexcusable that is completely inexcusable but you've seen now throughout this game the bad decisions made by both the players right white resigned because they are going to lose this by the way don't resign at a thousand level why resign you're not proving you're special or anything like that make them Checkmate you you both set out to play a 10 minute game of chess you can resign of course I'm just saying they might stalemate you you really never know this is an excusable type of stuff now the opening little things like Pawn to H6 Pawn to D4 right you're going to see more sophisticated openings at the 1500 level but white just not even playing D4 right and then attacking on the wrong side of the board but still getting an okay position just not playing their best black total blunder and then insane decision making by black I'm down material SO trading all the way down to the Bare Bones this this is craziness and white for no reason at all getting into a pawn race you can calculate this out you can calculate this out there's no need just bring the Knight back just bring the Knight back 95 Knight C4 check and you'll just give up the night and that's it just E4 and the Pawn's going the Knight will sack itself very simple keep control of the position one thousands do not keep control of the position and it ends up with a massive blunder now how does a 50 100 level player lose a game of chess just lose a game of chess okay first Gotham cracks his neck and maybe you get an ad break I don't know D4 first of all we have a grunfeld a 1460 playing the grunfeld defense which is a very sophisticated opening with a Twist this isn't correct you're supposed to in the grunfeld wait for your opponent to play Knight C3 why because if your opponent plays Knight C3 after this exchange the Knight can take the Knight why is that important because if the Knight cannot take the Knight you're gonna get what happens in this game which is the pawns take the center this is not the way the grunfeld is played so at 1500 people are playing more sophisticated openings but it's a little bit of a false playing they they don't actually know what they're doing so they they're but they're doing their best the problem with the way that black has handled this is they have given white an absolutely perfect position now what should white do right here what is Black's next move white is on autopilot they just play castle but in this position you got to think black is gonna play Bishop G4 so I have to play H3 but okay I love this look at this look you see how white is keeping control of the position in the opening and has a slight advantage and now white kicks the Knight out of the way defends their Knight and pressures the B7 this is incredible white is building behind each move okay Knight C6 now white plays rookie one decent improving move now black has a lot of pressure on the center here and white plays Queen D3 which is a mistake it's a mistake black should play Bishop takes Knight and and take on D4 but black gets a little distracted okay white goes back black plays C6 but every move is still building on the other this is building a wall for the bishop and securing control over D5 so far every every move makes sense like no side is taking massive risk there is not a very clear obvious plan to an advantage black plays Knight D5 white doesn't even trade most 1000s here would take the Knight white does something called keeping the tension just keeping the tension not over committing black can't really do a whole lot black does do a whole lot here by playing F5 that is a massive over commitment now an interesting decision do you play on passon or do you come back white decides to come back sacrificing the damage to their structure but getting a very very big Center black immediately takes the center white immediately kicks the night out and after Queen B6 white tries to set a little trap but it doesn't quite work because White's idea here is to play C5 discover check but there's just Knight D5 so 1500 sometimes do do try to get creative like this but they forget you know that it's hard to visualize the pawn no longer covers that square but now but now both sides are having a massive blind spot both sides are having a total blind spot to this until now and that's all it takes white blunders the pawn on D4 as a result of hitting the Knight out of the center all white did in this game and about 25 moves was forget that upon push stop guarding a center Pawn and now black is a pawn up that's it white goes here black doesn't take the second Pawn black goes back and now white gets a big Center and now white is back in the game white is actually really really confidently fighting back white is down a pawn white blunder the pawn is White's not even worse so now we see how 1500 level players keep control they keep control of the game and what I would have liked to see I want white I want white to start a counter attack I want white to start firing away out here white is limiting the mobility of the black pieces these pieces in fact I would say these four pieces are just staring into nothing so why despite losing the pawn and making a mistake is rebounding immediately and by the way you can rebound on the clock but white is not doing that in this game look at white starting a counter attack black excellent excellent pressure on the position from multiple angles Queen C2 look at this the queen stepped away to hit the Knight but now this queen doesn't have to defend the Knight the queen could sneak in here a very sneaky move and the idea is that the Bishops are lambs for Slaughter black now breaks into the position and is uh White tries to strike back black is up two pawns but the game keeps going I mean queen takes a seven Bishop B5 in this position black uh White could trade the Bishops but instead is trying to create counter plays just counter-attacking like crazy Queen B7 this is hardly over Queen C8 passive Queen F7 no trade Rook D7 now white finds the very clutch the bishop is Trapper Bishop F6 on the board look at this Rook G7 self-pinning and now unfortunately white gets a little bit desperate black was playing a little bit more responsibly on time and white tries to bulldoze into the position but white is not the one calling the shots it's like in a in a Breaking Bad or one of those uh series or movies let's say where the person who tries to call the shots against the mafia boss isn't in the position to call the shots you're just not in the position to call the shots here because yes you're threatening made but what you have done is I don't have to play defense you know why I don't have to play defense because I can go for your king that's exactly what what black does Queen C6 Queen C1 bleed some time off the clock and uh unfortunately white walks into their death you simplify and now it's clean you see no drama save the drama for your llama and it's going to be Checkmate in a few moves Rook to F6 mate black won this game by playing a bit more of a sophisticated opening than the last one that we saw uh yes not playing it perfectly but throughout the game keeping full control of the position great control creating a blockade in the center like this and hammering away at White Center until white blundered upon went back into their position wasn't it wasn't a perfect game but took advantage literally of the two things that white made a blunder about and white did their mess alright white did their best in this game creating counter play like out of nowhere but Black's position was very resilient and there was just nothing to be done I mean you're down two pawns and you're running into a brick wall and this is coming straight down the other side so but white did a good job fighting back now let's take a look at a 1000 game and a 1500 game that did not end in defeat alright 1000 level game once again this time we have a Vienna all right and let's see what happens from the opening stage I would say that that white is pretty happy here I mean Knight C6 like you know what white is doing quite well uh but again the best move against Bishop to B4 and those of you that have my uh E4 course actually you should know that the best move here is D4 um which is again one of these things like as a as a 1000 it's hard to memorize every opening but as long as you're getting a position from the opening where you have a decent you know decent Fighting Chance than life is good this is excellent Bishop G4 white plays uh castles and now we have the move Queen F6 now what do 1000s do in the opening all the time first of all they play e45 symmetrical Queen F6 played white trades Queens now I don't blame white for trading Queens because if you don't trade the Queens black is gonna do this and that that's that that's very difficult because you're like wait a minute take take now I'm gonna lose this then I'm gonna lose it so I don't blame you I don't blame you for trading the Queens but it's not the best move why is it not the best move because if white does something if black does something like this you Target the weaknesses if he does something like this you have ideas even like Rook takes B7 with crazy sacrifices to the king Bishop A6 Queen B5 I mean it's like made I mean it's literally made on B7 on the next move so if if uh if something like this happens you can create an attack after Rook B1 B6 the light squares are super weak Bishop B5 C takes D4 it's very difficult though and I understand I I understand the decision to trade the queen but you have to understand that you're you're not doing yourself any favors like here and look at the next move by the way the next move is even worse it's just taking it's taking for no reason just note like is it a very simple like why did we do that now we have to move our Bishop now we have damage structure black has a very decent position Okay now what's the next phase of the game for black Castle consolidate bring the Rooks to the center and fight back but no black takes on e4 right away Knight takes E4 which is a losing mistake it's a losing mistake because you haven't castled yet the Knight is on e4 the night is on E5 the king is in the center so rookie one right can hit both that's exactly what happens you lose this F4 the night is pinned to the king you shouldn't be doing this much battle in the center of the board F4 it's on the board misses puts the bishop there instead in five seconds of thought and that's the thing you use you all probably watch this sometimes and and look at your games and and look at these games and you're like oh this never happens in my game it does of course it does you just don't see it now black plays F6 white goes here black gallops out of the position by the way even this position is good because you can play Bishop D2 and then play F4 again but okay rookie three again one mover just the one mover Knight goes out of the position we pin I don't hate this move at all and now I love this at no point in this position did Black go can white attack my pawn my knight can white in any way attack my knight if he goes Rook B1 or C4 you can play C4 you cannot take this because it's pinned to the king as a result of you taking the pawn way back here so even though white misses some chances black walks white by the hand and now Pawn to C4 instead you should have blocked the pin you should have blocked the pin you should have defended the Knight and blocked the pin you should have thought for a second what is my opponent going to do to me C4 credit to White it was found and now you are completely winning now it's an equal game how does a 1000 how is the 1000 supposed to play this game bring the king up and bring the Rooks It's The End Game you should not be so scared of bringing your king because white doesn't have any way to attack it alright why should you not play that move my opponent has pieces XYZ when I go there this bishop is going to live on that Square forever or Rook D1 Bishop D5 and what does now what does what black do walk directly into the D file doesn't anticipate this and now is down material C4 all right Bishop slides down Rook takes now rookie two defending the bishop what should black always be thinking about does my opponent have a check does my opponent have a check does my opponent have a check like misses it Bishop to F5 game over King F1 Wyatt was thinking if I move my Bishop I'm gonna lose my my Rook which is not true because by the way you can even go here and if your Bishop gets taken you take the Rook so first of all you have this but I mean you have a check I mean it's just it has to be the first thing you look for you see how these one mover no 1500 would overlay Bishop by five I just showed you a whole game of 1500s B3 now white plays this should be one should black trade Rooks honestly for this level probably not unless they see the follow-up which is probably pushing these Pawns but now white can escape C2 with Bishop F5 check and something like King to D3 Bishop F5 check and something like King to D3 so Rook D3 instead Rook C8 and there it is you block good defense B5 this should be an easy win should be an easy win why is it an easy win black has four pawns versus three that's the reason the way you win this you could actually Advance you could Advance this is still winning you don't have to trade the rugs you can advance The Rook a little bit forward like something like Rook C5 because if you get your pawns connected it's it's a completely winning position King just walks over here um in the game what happens is Rook C3 which doesn't make any sense why would you play Rook C3 in two seconds maybe it was a mouse slip but why would you bring the pawn closer to its death why would you do that instead of that you could have played something like Rook C2 King C2 and King C6 and you're winning because it's two past pawns it's just a win it's it's an easy win white will try to advance you will push these pawns and that's you're gonna win because at some point you will walk over for some reason black brings the pawn a step closer and now it's a draw it's draw with correct play King E5 what is the correct play get in front of the pawn yes excellent D4 you could play a three G3 you could wait a little bit you have to do it the right way you know you gotta you gotta make sure all right easy F3 check King D4 and now you wait with pawns instead white allows this for no reason at all thinks it's an endgame allows the king in and now now it's over because the king can just walk and take these Pawns or you can play H5 fine G4 the way I would win this position is I would play H4 and I would take the pawns I'll play H4 take take White's out of moves also you can stalemate Force this it's not stalemate and make a queen and it's mate instead of that black with four minutes on the clock takes and place King here completely abandons their Pawn takes here and now this is a draw King H3 King F3 G4 and the King just has to stay near the pawn and that's it and the game ends in a draw because if black takes on H2 white takes on G4 I mean there was no pieces left on the board there was two pawns each the way black wins this is going here again it's stalemate but you Queen and it's mate end game problems uh trading all the pieces in the opening a lot of small tactical blunders there was like four to five different tactical blunders in this game but that's what makes up a 1000 level game look at this 1500 level game this is a great one to end on um this time we have a Catalan not all 1500s play like this but I'm just saying the opening is very reasonable look how solid this is both sides playing black hasn't moved a single piece two times look at black every piece has gotten a turn beautiful development in the Queen's Pawn structure white trying to expand over here black chopping in the center white expands black goes here life I mean everything's fine Bishop C5 I don't I don't love this move but you know I don't love this because there's no reason to give up the bishop if I'm playing Black here I'll probably bring the bishop back I mean I gotta worry a little bit about A7 um but I do this in a way where if I'm gonna allow Knight C6 I'm not gonna immediately allow an avalanche but am I really criticizing I mean I'm like Nicola okay 1500s make mistakes because they trade too quickly they play the move Knight E5 and they just go it's a fair trade and I'm opening up my Bishops and it's not exactly a fair trade like the move Knight E5 is not necessary you have to think is my knight of a higher quality than that night at the 1500 level the two 1000 games I just looked at that never happened at all it was a lot of one movers a lot of tactical mistakes they trade everything but they they don't think at all in this case it's like okay this trade is really purely equal this night of course is of a higher quality that's like that night's super passive this Knight has attacking possibilities not right away could also go for mate what is this Knight doing it literally has no forward moves it's kind of clogging Black's position so the relief that black feels with this thing lifted like an artery blockage of course now Black Goes immediately backwards and pushes the bishop out and returns and um and I love what white is doing here Rook D1 now the person playing with black here the subscriber um has to maintain this brick wall they have to maintain it because and and and what they should do here is probably move the Queen off the center line but they go here which you know I don't blame them for but now they have to live with the consequences of a very weak Center I mean the D5 square is super super weak and white plays Bishop G5 and it looks like life is good but it's not really that good because actually here there's Bishop F2 and this tactic can arise when the king is the only thing defending and then the Knight can venture out and the queen takes the thing so three criteria have to be met only the king is guarding this Pawn a night check is possible and the Knight is safe and the queen can take the bishop for free those three things have to be met if one of those three is not met this thing can't happen but black misses that black is thinking a little bit too defensive I'm not even sure what like it likely is H6 and now spawns this but plays Hope chess what black calculated was eight this is the difference between a fifteen hundred and one thousand black actually saw that the pawn was hanging black calculated Bishop F6 Queen F6 Bishop D5 Queen F2 and then they would move the Rook and then they went H6 but what they made a mistake of is they proved themselves right at no point that they stop and ask what if that doesn't happen what if one of those moves doesn't happen an 1100 would have simply just blundered the D5 pawn and 1100 might even blunder uh uh might even blunder the The Rook you know oh by the bishop black saw this but didn't but never asked what about E3 and now black is in trouble because they don't have this they over committed this Pawn is gonna die it has two things staring at it and it can't move and now in trying to defend themselves black misses the other resource oops Yeah blundered it's not the first mistake that kills you it's the second mistake that oftentimes kills you in chess because you overreact and now you're gonna lose a bishop but black sacrifices the bishop for the pawn trying to open up whites King and plays E4 if I'm playing with white here what I do is I blockade the center and I try to trade the Queens with no Queen on the board black will never ever ever survive because the queen is the most powerful piece white goes here and black plays good defense that white plays rookie one this is very passive very passive I understand now I love Black's next move not sitting around rookie six you know what the idea is it's a rook lift what should white do here open up the position Shred the defenses of the center and get in instead white plays Rook A2 what is this suddenly Suddenly It's black calling the shots white plays another very reactive move but why are you attacking a rook to get it closer to your king Now The Rook has an entire open file and before you know it black is knocking on the door and before you know it black is arriving and black is winning in the span of five moves white did a lot of good in this game but they had no Killer Instinct they did not know when they had to act they completely misunderestimated Black's position and black goes from winning to literally mating White Queenie one Rook H6 and it's mate on the in the corner of the board how did that even happen how did white just go from upper Bishop to Downer rook and Checkmate in an embarrassing fashion in the corner of the board well I'll tell you it all started with black overreacting to White's attack on D5 losing the bishop but doing something really smart a couple of really good decisions in a row giving up the bishop to open up the position locking out that Bishop completely negating what the opponent wants just camping out a few pieces and realizing I can sit around and wait to lose or I can bring my Rooks and do this and another major reason that black won this game is because of this move you see black could have just played something like Rook F6 but then white would have played Rook a 2 Rook F2 it black realized right away they needed to bring everybody Rook here H5 beautiful knocking on the door and this shows you the difference the 1500s control the game with tiny nuances making the right exchange making the right Pawn break underestimating their opponent's resources and and offensive capabilities the 1000s it's chaos it's chaos constantly there are 10 missed opportunities collectively in every game if you can minimize that number down if you can start pausing hitting the pause button on quick exchanges if you can spot the Tactical opportunities when they present themselves you have to get good at that at one thousand because those chances go away as you go higher and higher up the rating ladder it's all there for you it's all there for the taking but you see the difference the 1500s play really really well and I haven't even done two thousand let me know if you want me to do 1500 versus 2000 and I'll see in the next video get out of here
