programming to your list first python python is the goat but hmm already coming in with python saying is the goat I mean there's a lot of good things about python okay where is he putting this I guess a knockback for being slow so a tier okay next here's the problem with the python as an eight here who here has a CSV and you need to get a quick graph you need to get a little quick graph of that CSV okay python the thing is is python is is is nothing but due to tear Until It's s tier I feel like you either had to put it at the Bippity bottom or the tippity top right there is like there's just no in between for python it's either the most useful thing in this moment or does the least useful language you've ever used and that always seems to be the case I don't know where people get this idea that it's somehow in the middle it's not a middle language it will never be a middle language it's the best or the worst simultaneously Until You observe it C plus plus I'm scared of C plus plus but it's going east here my man coding with Lewis my man what are you doing what are you doing here Lewis why why are you doing that why are you putting sleep okay rust minus minus was never meant to be asked here okay it is only C tier at best because it's everywhere okay bash makes you look really badass but hard to maintain so seat here I've never disagreed with the list so thoroughly in my lifetime I have never disagreed with the list so thoroughly I don't even know what to do with this I have a general simple rule which is if you are writing an array in bash you've gone too far it's as simple as that JavaScript was fine but typescript way better so object object here okay PHP I can get behind that I get behind that there we go saved saved this is safe this is way better this is way better I love this everyone wants to say f tier for PHP but PHP devs Drive Lambos so b-tier yeah all of a sudden I'd feel less saved you know I feel like PHP is not quite B tier uh I'm not even sure where to put PHP I'd probably put it under the same category as I'd put HTML as a programming language okay lift one word emojis as variables that means your code looks like this D tier okay rust I understand the height what am I doing in this video what am I doing in here okay hey hey that's pretty good okay if this if you better you coding with Lewis I'm gonna have a I'm gonna this isn't this is gonna be eight here you already know he's gonna put a date here just to hurt me just emotionally hurt me let's slow down a little bit okay A tier for now I hate this oh why did I do this to myself here Lac nail bantlap okay he did a good job on Matlab and JavaScript okay can we all agree that this was pretty good okay actually I really like this one except for the fact I'm still so okay I why is rust minus minus why is that an s-tier language why zero cost infraction safety performance you get to tell people you're writing it in Rust I use rust by the no you can't say those words okay you can't say any of those words with C plus plus okay I get to hear you talk about your project and I get to interrupt you mid-sentence and say did you use rust by the way and if you say no I can tell you about the project I'm writing in Rust and completely disregard everything you've ever said okay that is an s-tier language the fact that you can do that there's nothing more beautiful than that okay the conversation always wins all roads lead to rust and you need to accept that right now right now
