if you've ever downloaded well anything through your web browser you're probably familiar with the zip file a compressed folder that often contains lots of other files in it in Windows a zip file will appear very similarly to any other folder it'll just have a little zipper on the icon very cute but have you ever noticed that if you try to open up a program directly from that zip folder you'll get an error message which goes away only if you unzip the file first but only some times and then other times you can just open up a zipped file without any extra baloney is there a method to this madness to answer it helps to understand why exactly the zip format is so common in the first place not only is it just fewer clicks to download one zip file instead of a bunch of individual ones it also compresses the files so they take up less room on the server use less Network bandwidth and take less time to download although these ADV vages have made the zip format popular Windows can't directly interact with the data contained inside a zipped folder and at first this might seem confusing because you can just double click a zip folder to open it and there's the files just like any other folder but that functionality had to be added to Windows and the operating system didn't even natively support extracting zip files in Windows Explorer until Windows me came out in the year 2000 this is a major part of the reason that programs such as windzip and WinRAR were so popular during the 9s they were necessary unless the compressed files that you needed to open came in something called a self-extracting archive these had the decompression program built in so you would just download and run them and they would spit out the uncompressed files automatically but simply being able to open up and view a zip folder in file explorer isn't the same thing as working with the files within we're going to tell you about the nuance of how unzipping or not unzipping works right after we thank War Thunder for sponsoring this video War Thunder is an immersive and free-to-play vehicle combat game that now has over 2500 vehicles for you to Pilot including tanks planes and ships the realism goes beyond the graphics too right down to how the vehicles operate sound and break apart start playing for free today on console and PC with our link down below and get hooked up with some extra goodies whenever you double click a file like an exe that's inside a zip folder Windows actually unzips that file in the background without telling you the whole process is invisible Windows can't run the compressed version of the exe so the program is instead unzipped to a temporary folder and then it's run normally but there's a way that you can actually see this happen for yourself next time you try to run an exe directly from a zip folder first open up a run command using the Windows key and R then type in this command to bring up your personal temporary folder if you run the exe now you might be able to spot it in one of those subfolders now the program might work fine if there aren't other files inside the zip that the program depends upon but if there are such as dlls you'll get an error message because the program can't access those files that it needs while they're still compressed inside the zip folder that's why it's usually important to unzip or extract the entire ire contents of a folder before trying to do something like run an installer and it's also why Standalone files like images or text documents will typically work just fine without unzipping the entire folder first an exception would be something like a text document that had images embedded in it that were also zipped in the folder but not Everyone likes waiting around for their zip folders to fully unzip so if you're impatient like me thirdparty tools like 7zip or WinRAR do still exist and tend to be a little faster than windows's built-in solution third party Solutions also usually offer better features than windows's built-in compression support especially if you're looking to create a compressed folder they'll offer more efficient compression algorithms and stronger encryption for sensitive files and don't worry we won't tell on you if you never end up actually paying for WinRAR if you guys enjoyed this video you can like or dislike depending on how you feel if you really liked it you can check out our video on how data compression Works more generally and you can leave a comment if you have a suggestion for a Future video just don't forget to subscribe so that you catch it
