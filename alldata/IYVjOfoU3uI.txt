- I'm going to be giving
random people my credit card. Here you go, sir. - Okay. - The card actually has no limit and they could spend a million dollars. - We're in Target which has
a history of kicking us out. I'm determined not to this time. Let's go. (high energy music) Hey, this is a credit card. You can buy whatever you want on it. But it has a limit,
which we can't tell you, and if you go over the limit, then we put everything back. - Are you serious? - What do you think the limit is? - I don't know. Like, 200? - Oh no. - Give them some hints? - Do you need a TV? - No. (soft piano music) - That face didn't look like a no. We'll just put it right here. - That will put us up to $400. You should be fine. - What if we finish up like this? - No! - What? (laughing) They're being so conservative.
There isn't a limit. And I'm over here like
(sinister voice) spend my money. - Wait, um. - Just get 'em. I promise. - No, we're not getting two of them. - No, we cannot get two. Oh! - Oh darn, it's in the cart. iPads are pretty cheap. - We're at 4,800 right now. - It's fine because the card is unlimited. - That's it. - You're good? - We're good. If this card gets
approved, I'm gonna faint. - So, your total comes out to $5,915. - I will insert the card. It says remove card now. - Oh my God. (laughing) (men cheering) (men clapping) What just happened in our life? - It was unlimited. - Yeah. - Really?
- You're kidding. - He's like oh my God. (laughing) - But, yay all the stuff. - Yeah, but you still got a lotta stuff. Don't cry, don't cry. - This is insane. - That was the craziest thing
that's ever happened to me. - Ever happened to me. - And now it's time for the Lego store. Chris, it's time to test
your social anxiety. - It's horrible. - You guys like Legos? Well, I hope so because
here's a credit card. (upbeat music) Now, you can buy whatever
you want in the store, but there's a limit on the credit card, and if you go over the limit, you don't get to keep anything. - He's bad at explaining things. (customers laughing) - That was good. - That's only $350. - Exactly. We goin' big or we goin'
hone, and we're goin' big. - Get the Statue of Liberty. I think you could use a little bit more. I don't even know what
you're at, but there you go. - Oh, oh, okay. - Here's the Millennium Falcon. - Okay, we're getting that too. You know what? We're just
getting the whole thing. - Yoink! - [Cashier] $3,494.90. - Hm, that's a lotta money. Let's see if the card works. Put it in. Let's see, and processing. - It's gonna say declined. (chuckling) (party horn blaring) (customers laughing) - Yeah! - Ooh! - Yes, yes, yes! Oh my God, yes. We did it. We spent $3,000 on Legos. I literally expected it to be declined. That's just how my luck is always, but once I saw it approved, bingo. It was so exciting. Oh my God. (laughing) - Now we're at a designer store and some stuff here costs
thousands of dollars. This place will be crazy. What are you looking at? - All the shoes. (laughing) - Hey, we're filming a video where I give my credit
card to random people, and you can buy whatever you want, but if it goes over the
limit, then we put it back. - For you? - No, for you.
- For you. - For me? - Yeah. For me. (laughing) - Oh my gosh. - We know the owner of the store. Can you also shut down the store too? The store is all yours. - I'll go with whatever Chris says. - Oh, you like my style? All right, I was hoping you would ask. - He should have a second wallet. This is a $500 wallet. - Yeah, you need the Louis V wallet. - You want an $850 hoodie? - I mean, yeah. - Let's see. - Yeah. - Do you like it?
- Yeah, I like it. - What do you think the
limit on the card is? - 5,000? - It could be. - Maybe. - All right, I wanna get these. - So, how much are those shoes? - 330. - 330. - Yes, sir. - I mean, we can't tell
you what the limit is, but you know, another
wallet wouldn't hurt. My phone is also at 9,999%. - Really? - Okay, keep those then. (men laughing) - So, here is a $600
tee shirt and a 300 one. Just get both. Who cares? - I think it's 9,999, so
we're just gonna get 'em both. - He thinks it's almost 10 grand. - All right, so you're
about $3,000 right now. - Might as well keep spending. (hard organ chord) - Try the Scott's. $1,100 for those. - Those are $1,100, but Chris, I think we should give
him more of a warning. Like, 5,000, pennies are... (finger whooshing) yeah. - Where are we at right now? - Aw, these fit perfectly. - He's trying to stay under 5,000. This is like a low-key flex. That's a high-key flex. - Yeah, I'll get the Travis'. - Low-key flex. - I will get this too
just to complete the fit. - Total is 5,013, with 94 cents. - So, you're $13 over five grand. You wanna take the risk? - No, I'll get rid of this
shirt then 'cause I don't- - Aw, aw, I love that shirt. - All right, that's under
five grand, processing. - The advance is heart-pounding. - Slightest. It was approved. (Mom squealing) - Oh my God, dudes, like... - (laughing) Oh my God. - I love how his mom's
more excited than him. - I'm just speechless. I have no idea. - He's glowing inside. Wait
till he gets outta here. - We haven't even told him
what the real limit is. Do you wanna know? - Yeah. - There was no limit. - Oh wow. I got more than I wanted, yeah. It's crazy. I'm speechless. (dramatic music) (shoes tramping) - This is now our thing. - Chris, your turn. - No, why? - Hey, how's it going? You see this? You get to use that now. - What? What is it? - You can buy anything in the store. - Anything in the store. - There's a limit to the card. I can't tell you what it is, but if you go over the limit,
you don't get the stuff. - What do you think the
limit on the card is? - 100K? - Oof, you've seen a $100,000 credit card? You two are together, right? - For now, this is
actually our first date. - Oh really?
- Whoa. - Yes. - This could be the
opportunity of a lifetime. - That's why I'm nervous about this, guys. No pressure, right? No pressure. - No pressure, no. - How much is this New York one? - [Sales Clerk] 18,900. - Woo, okay. Might be over the limit. It might be under the limit. Who knows? - I wanna keep below 10,000. - Below 10 grand? All right. Oh, this is cool. - That one's really cool. - This one, I'd actually go for this one. - You'd go for that one. - How much is this one? 4,500? - What about this one behind
the gentleman over here? - [Sales Clerk] All right,
"Crash" is yes, $7,500 actually. - How much is this Joker one? - [Sales Clerk] It's 26. - 26,000, okay. It could be under the limit or it could be over the limit. - Mm, right, we don't know. - Aw, this one, the eye,
how much is this one? - That one's really pretty. - And that one is 10. - $10,000, what about the one behind him? - I mean, this is beautiful. (men chattering) - 30,200. - If we go for those two
over there for, what, 15,000. I'm, okay but-- - You could probably make that work. Maybe you couldn't. You probably could. - I would go with this
one. This one's seven. - 7,000. Let's go ring it up and see if it works. - The total is $15,786.87. - Mm hm. - How is this date going so far? - Unexpected, but I love it. (victorious organ music) - Do not remove. It was approved. - Yay! (hands clapping) - Congratulations. So, you guys get to go up to your pieces and put a red dot on the sticker because they are actually yours now. - [Crowd] Woo! Yay! - I was thinking, okay,
like a coffee date. It'll be over in an hour.
We connected really well. - [Jimmy] So the fans
are gonna wanna know. - Yeah. - [Jimmy] Do you think
it's gonna work out? - I don't know. (chuckling) - [Jimmy] Between us. - I like him for sure. - [Jimmy] What do you think
about that first date? - I'm still in shock.
Still cannot get over this. - [Jimmy] Think there's
gonna be a second date? - I hope so. At this point, I really do. Thank you. That's all I got to say. Thank you for this experience. - Now, we're gonna grab
a person on the street. - Hey. - Huh? - Can you step over here real quick? Here's a credit card. You can spend whatever you want, but if you go over the limit,
you don't get anything. - Let's do it. - You wanna go to that jewelry store? - That one looked really nice. - Let's go to it. (upbeat music) So, we gave this guy a credit card. - Right? - But, if we swipe the
card and it doesn't work, then we return it. - If he goes overboard, no sale. - Yes. - I got things up in here,
up to 2 million bucks. - Really? - I'll take the whole store. - Can we see? - A million bucks?
Yeah. - Right here, one diamond, 2 million. Like, I've been doing this since 1999. Never saw a credit card
that takes 2 million. - Saying the reason why I really came is 'cause my mom has Stage 4 cancer. She made it past New Year's, which wasn't supposed to happen. - So, you want to get her a necklace? - Yes. - I have all these.
See that black diamond? - Mm hm. - I have a white diamond embedded
inside the black diamond, and then two hearts. - I'm gonna go with this one. - Okay, so that's 6,900. We'll just round up and say
7 grand 'cause of taxes. - Pinky rings are on the
other side. Is that right? - Okay. Bling Bloaw. This is bling bloaw. - I didn't bring my sunglasses. This is gorgeous. I have a feeling that the number is 9. I'm just making sure it's a
dollar under that 9 number. - [Jeweler] 2,950. (man gasping) 2,950 plus 60, right? - That's right. That's
exactly where you wanna be. - I need to get two though.
That's the thing and I-- - Two? - And if we're on the-- - You know what? Pick out another one. If you wanna be at 10 grand, I'll do all these for 10 grand. - Ooh. - So, he's saying he can do this ring, this for his mother and this other pinky ring for 10 grand. - My brother passed
away from a brain tumor, so I feel for you, 9 grand, 8,999. $8,999.99, processing. Printing, printing.
- This is intense. I already know the answer. - We have a sale! (hands clapping) - Yeah! Woo hoo hoo hoo! Yo, man, and I didn't even
want to get out of bed today. - I knew the limit and I was nervous. Why? - So very blessed that
I could do something for my mother and I can
give something to her before she goes and that
matters to me the most. - Dude. - I don't know where you guys came from, but you just made her year. - I think I know who it is. - Not you guys. - No. - We're gonna walk over here. This gentleman right
here, Andre, here you go. - You're joking, right? - No.
- Guys, come on. You can't do this to me. - No, he's helped us
with videos occasionally. Were you expecting this? - No, man, come on. - What do you think the
limit of this credit card is? - 10, 11. - Chandler, what do you think it is? - Four. - Thousand? Four dollars? All right, just ignore Chandler. - A Toyota? Is that a Toyota? - Let's go look at it. It's a Toyota. We have a Toyota. We love Toyotas. - Much better than the others - It's a little bit more
modern than the others. It's a Toyota. - So, it's 15,500. Chris, does that make
you a little nervous? - That makes me nervous. - So, you think then the limit on the credit card is 20 grand? - I wouldn't go that high. I don't wanna-- - But, the car is 15,500. - Yeah, well, it's at least 16. (men laughing) - So, what are you doing right now? - I'm getting ready to FaceTime
my partner of 25 years. I have a certain situation that I'm gonna need help with. I'm getting ready to chance on a car. I'm getting ready to possibly-- - [Partner] Good. - What? - Cool! I'll meet you at 7, all right? - Yeah. (laughing)
(men laughing) Yo, let's go for it. - Okay, so how much is this right here? - It's gonna be 15, 9. - So, you guys don't take
credit cards here, right? - No, we don't. - Yeah, I forgot to tell you. Car dealerships don't take credit cards. So, there is no limit. - Wha wha what? - Yeah, so we'll just buy the car for you. - No way. Well done and thank you. Jimmy, thank you. Guys, thank you. - Let the camera know. How do you feel? - I'm, I've been spending
the whole day with you guys, and I'm just completely flabbergasted by what you guys do and this
has completely thrown me off. - We have to give people
cars to hang out with us. (men laughing) - All right, so this is your first time cranking your brand new car. (engine igniting) - La! I'm just really thrown. Keep doing what you're doing because you're making a
whole lotta people happy. - Aw, darn, you're making me cry. - Oh man, that's awesome, Jimmy. - Thanks, man. - I've got a bunch o'
little cry babies in here? - Leave me alone. (men laughing) Subscribe to Mr. Beast.
He changed my life. He'll change yours. - Hey, we're filming a video where we're giving random
people our credit card, and they can buy whatever they want. This credit card has a limit, and if you go over the
limit, you get nothing. - All right, let's do it. - Literally anything, as long as you don't over over the limit, you can have. - Okay wait, all right.
- You can get a really nice TV. - Yeah, I know. I like this. That's 800? Oh my gosh. Maybe I should go lower. I don't know. What if it's only a thousand dollars? - Get this one. You'll like it. It's 879. - No, it's heavy. So, so far, you've spent $880. It's right there. Right above your head. - Oh, okay. I do need
a computer, let's go. - So, you're thinking the MacBook. Are we going with this? - This one will put you over two grand. - I'm gonna just do it. I'm gonna do it. Boyfriend needs a laptop. - Let's get your boyfriend a laptop. So, she just threw another
MacBook Pro Slip in there, which brings your total up to 3,380. - How about a smaller TV? - Let's throw another TV on then. - A lotta Samsungs. (tuba music) So, our main cameraman
just got kicked out. So, we're switching to the smaller camera. We got kicked out. So now, we need to be a little discreet. Just act like you're normal shoppers. - Let's check the iPads. - So, one's 469, one's 899. - [Sales Clerk] Your total is 4,583. So, I'm gonna insert the card. - Ooh! I'm like, shaking. - Processing, approved. - Woo! Wow, I get to keep all this? - Congratulations. - Yahoo! I'm so excited,
I can't believe it. Hugs, you're amazing. - No, this card actually had no limit. - What? Oh my God. Hey, let's go back, no? - No no. - Okay. (laughing) - We got hungry, so we decided
to stop and get some food, and we're gonna play the
game with the waiter. Hey, we're actually
filming a YouTube video. Would you wanna participate in it? - Sure. - I'm gonna let you write
whatever the tip is. You can put whatever you want, but if it goes over the
limit of this credit card, I'll just have to pay for the
meal with a different card. So, you technically could
write $5,000 if you wanted to. - That's just absurd. - That's just absurd? Is that
what you said? (laughing) - I'm gonna go 1,575. - So the total will be 1,999. - Let's take a look. - So, do you think it'll work? - Um, yes? It sure did. - Congratulations. - Can I have a hug? - Yeah, of course. Thank you. - Thank you so much. You guys have a great night. - I'll see you around. It's your turn to pick someone. - I'm gonna go for the first person I see. Hey, how are you guys doing? - Good, how are you? - Do you want to use a credit card? If you go over it, you
don't get any of the stuff. You've got a whole Best Buy. Go for it. - Okay. - Here's a bag. - Now, anything in the store. - Let's go. - She's a Queen fan. - Very great taste. (hands clapping) - How much was that? - $18. - Okay, yeah, that's a nice speaker. You should buy it. - Just gonna, right in here. - How much was that, Chris? - Two speakers?
- That was $150. Yeah, who cares? You gotta get a pro. - [Jimmy] Chandler offered to carry it. - Yeah, I did, I did. - What do you think the
limit of the card is? - 4,000. - So, you wanna spend $3,999. So, you're probably around, like, 1,500. - We got a lot to go. - Nintendo Switch, best console ever made. - Two games. Three games.
- Three games. There we go. - There.
- There we go. - That's great. - Here you go. - Moving on. - I regret my decisions. - Do it.
- Do it. - Are we being bad influences? - No, shut up. - Can we get two of these iPhones? - I think we're ready. - Let's go check out. Here you go. - $300, Sloane. - Already? I think it's gonna be
like, 3,000 or lower. - That's gotta be more. - The total is 3,971. If he scans this, we'll go over 4 grand, - Let's not do it. I'm going with my gut. - Let's take this and
just put it over there. $3,971. - Wait, okay. - I can't look. - Oh, it worked. - Yeah, we did it! - And everything you bought is yours. - No way. I was really
nervous, really anxious. My heart was beating really fast. - And just so you know,
people don't normally give you their credit card in life. So, this is just a
one-off thing, you know. - Okay. - Since you failed in the Lego store and I had to step in and explain it, we're gonna have you
do another try, Chris. - No. Hey, what's up, man? Can
you hold that for me? All right, that is a credit card. - Correct! - All right, you can use it
to buy anything in the store, but there's a limit. I can't tell you what the limit is, but if you go over that limit, you don't get to keep anything. - Is this a joke? - Nope, it's not a joke. Let's do it, anything in the store. - Here we go.
- Whatever you want. So, what do you think
the limit on the card is? We can't tell you. - A hundred dollars, probably. (woman sighing) - Mm, no. - Maybe a little higher? - All right, well have fun. Maybe I'll go for the
light and sound one there. - Why don't we just get all of them? - I brought you a box. Fill it up. (man laughing) - Good job, Chris. Oh, that's my era, that's
fine. There you go. - Okay, "My Hero Academia?" - Yes, that's a good one. - Pretty good, pretty good, I like it. - The new season's great, by the way. Everyone watching... - [Deep Voice] Watch it. - I've got a Boba Fett tattoo, so I've gotta get a Boba Fett shirt. That's already a lotta
money, so (laughing) - So, you guys are being pushy. So, I feel like--
I feel like we're trying. - Yeah. (laughing) - You look a lot like him, so you... (man laughing) I mean, that's a no-brainer. - I don't know if that's
a compliment or... - He said he's gonna get this. It's got "Star Wars,"
"Empire Strikes Back," "Return of the Jedi," some
good classic games on it. Are you interested in any
of the $3,000 statues? - I think that if I do that,
I'm probably gonna go over. - It won't make you go over to just go over there
and look at 'em though. - Yeah, I mean, what if
it's a $10,000 credit card? - This Joker right here, 3 grand. - Yeah, I like the Captain America better. - Captain America? Add him to the card? - Yeah, let's go, let's go. - Awesome, all right, let's get it. So, this is the Captain
America you're gonna... - Hopefully, if it doesn't fit. - Oh yeah, that's true. - Darth Vader mini fridge? - Absolutely. (laughing) - I love how we're just shopping for him. Here you go, sir. - This is the entire
Mandalorian set of Pop. - Oh my. You look nervous. - I don't know how you can tell. - $6,595, would you like
to insert the card, sir? - Sure, will it work? - Your hands are shaking. - Yeah. - 'Cause what if this doesn't work? - Oh! - Approved! Yay! (hands clapping) - Oh my God. - Congratulations on all your new stuff. - Now that they know they own this, I have no clue how you're
gonna get him home. - Everybody out there, subscribe
