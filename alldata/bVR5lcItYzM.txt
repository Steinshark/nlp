ladies and gentlemen in this video I'm going to give you a new update on the recent chess cheating scandal here in November 2023 not between Magnus Carlson and Hans nean that apparently has all been laid to rest but the one between Vladimir kick 14th World chess champion and Grandmaster hikara Nakamura Fisher random World chess champion uh beloved among many of you uh streamer commentator top player uh and so on essentially a couple of days ago just a very brief summary Vladimir karnick put out on his chess.com profile that he saw Hikaru won 45 A5 out of 46 games and everybody would find this interesting because hikaro had a performance of 3600 now kramnick is taking a stand and he's basically saying he is not accusing hikaro of cheating and everybody that's saying he's accusing hikaro of cheating is manipulating the reality he is simply saying any top player should be investigated fairly across the board and any anomalies in the statistics should be investigated by chess.com in his own words now in this video I'm going to look at a new video karnick posted today in English and in Russian we're going to look at CR Nick's newest blog post we're going to Deep dive into actual data scientists real data scientists and mathematicians who have ran Monte Carlos simulations on Hikaru gameson chess.com and more uh and that's all I have for you uh this is going to be quite a big update also today is Cyber Monday if you watched this on November 27th so last day to get any of my courses 40% off I you know I would have promoted the is on a better video but you know this is the reality of the situation so karnick posted a video today uh the title is karnick demands to examine nakamura's games you can't see it cuz I'm there but I I promise that's that's the title this is the levit of Chess Channel great chess Channel they also did a video with him interviewing him in Russian so this video is called nakuru which is basically Kik uh and this one's a little longer this one's 38 minutes if you understand and just a couple of key moments here in this video This is the first one more than one that it's not if Hikaru or somebody else thinks that this is the accusation of cheating then it's not me who is accusing but mathematics because it is statistics it's a true statistics from the open source and uh it was not meant to be an accusation but something else and I'm going to talk about it later um but all those manipulations of public opinion that I'm trying to accuse somebody uh are not true and I've mentioned it already more than once and I would like so again I'm speeding it up because uh it's on one and a half speed KCK doesn't actually speak that fast he's saying it's a manipulation of the truth that he is accusing Hikaru um of cheating that really truly if I take uh the uh esteemed 14th World chess champion at his word um that is I can believe that I can believe that maybe deep down kramnick thinks that like what he's doing is not accusing the guy directly but the Optics of it the perception of him speaking about it this way uh it can also be understood the complete opposite right like it can be very very much understood as well that this is a very strong insinuation that hearo statistics are abnormal and need to be investigated but karnick goes on to talk about later uh right around the 1046 moment uh why he's even going public about this I didn't want really to go to make a scandal out of it uh actually uh the main point is that I've already informed chesc ear earlier about this um those performances which I I was I'm convinced must be checked deeper and uh or any performances of this sort and I'm going to continue opening up some other performances of some players which are clearly U well unusual and requires further investigation uh in my opinion but uh all the time when I I was sending uh some statistics and I never got any response from chess.com so essentially Vladimir is saying he has contacted chess.com about the statistical anomalies of hikaru's games and his streaks and they haven't done anything about them now I don't actually know if that's true or not I I I am of the opinion that cinar is by far the most active player on chess.com at the highest level they're probably scanning his games a lot that's just me that's just my theory um again the guy is one of the only players in the world that plays as many thousands of Blitz Games every single day to millions of fans watching around the world uh whether they've done a deep dive on those games and a statistical analysis on those games that's up to chess.com and I don't know if they're going to publish them the thing is kramnick makes a strong point but you have to look at the reverse as well you can't just have every top player in chess requesting that at the snap of a finger chess.com publishes statistics about any Grandmaster so you can kind of see both ways like chess.com should probably be publishing some sort of annual report of of scans of top players but it's sensitive information as well because not in the case of Karu but if there are top players that are found to be playing at a ridiculously high level is is that chess.com responsibility to publicize should they block all the names out I don't know but I understand Vladimir's point but I also understand the complete other side of it which is just CU a Grandmaster yells at chess.com to publish statistics doesn't necessarily mean that they have to do that because it's a slippery slope right but yes I I I agree and just like anything it's it's never you know completely black and white no pun intended there was also key moment at 720 one very small detail there are a lot of performances like this uh which haruk has which makes the probability you know really really lower and lower with each next performance again mathematically and U only in this month November which hasn't hadn't finished yet Hikaru had five similar performances only only in one month I frankly I did okay so now we are going to talk about the the the stats right so karnick is basically saying hikaro had multiple monster performances in the month of November he gets into that around 12:30 in this video he does the same in Russian the the Russian video is just a little bit longer it is an interview um so let's see video I will go a bit further I will explain you what exactly is my idea now but for now yeah I'll just give you another piece of Statistics so as I mentioned only November hikaro have had five performances similar performances for instance and uh I will just read it to you now uh so that one which I meant first yeah in my previous video uh my previous post on chess.com profile uh was performance 45 and half out of 46 2950 average chesc com rating of the opponent few guys so this is Is Where It gets weird for me because Vladimir said in the month of November Hikaru had five streaks that were that good this says in the last 60 days and when I tried to verify this for myself I could not find five streaks like this in the month of November um I I think I I I I found four or three which he did recently mostly to prove a point and then the others came later so so the other streaks came like in September for example um and uh anyway I'll let Vladimir finish and the performance is 3,627 uh let me remind you that I think the absolute record of chess.com was 3,300 possible played in five or 10 games 46 games it's a lot it's a lot so it means okay uh it's clearly well something to to check I'm convinced about it and then the okay let's go further the second one that one is the best my favorite I would say okay the average rating 27 37 not that high still it's well those players are not so to say they can play chess definitely uh and um the performance I mean Hikaru won all 55 I repeat 55 games in a row so yeah that this statistic of and you know karnick put this I don't actually know how you calculate this by the way this is the interesting thing about these points I don't know how you calculate that a person is you know playing at a 3600 level when he wins this many games against an average rating of this because of multiple factors right so so he excited these and just like in the Russian interview he basically said this was just in the last x amount of days you can imagine Hikaru goes on these winning streaks a lot right so Hikaru goes on these winning streaks more frequently than in the last 30 40 days or whatever um so let's Deep dive into that the first streak that I found was in September okay there was a there was a streak in late September I'm just going to verify this before I uh talk anymore September 28 29th um Hikaru won something like 55 games in a row uh if we scroll down it was around here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 okay 25 26 27 28 29 30 3 3 1 32 33 34 35 36 roughly 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 he won a game here in two moves 5 46 47 48 49 50 like yeah you go all the way up it's 55 games but if you actually Deep dive into this um he beat this jokovic guy he beat hold on he beat if we start here this kusen guy Ken kusen kusen like 10 times then he beat jokovic he beat jokovic until the next page jokovic is a guy who is rated 500 points lower than Hikaru right he he he's just he's just the the and and then he beat another guy he beat him like 10 times and then and then he beat sunalp a few games until he lost right so he beat sunp a few games played some sun one two three four five games so that is just one example of Hikaru beating a 2600 20 times in a row picaru beating another 2700 20 times in a row like the guy gets bored the guy's like the best fighter in a gym or the best tennis player in a club like he's got to get some you know he's got to get some sparring in he's got to get some games in with these folks and kramnick is essentially arguing like in some of these ridiculous streaks that hikaro pulls off that it's just improbable and it's worth investigating and I don't necessarily like disagree I mean okay sure they can go investigate it all they want um but there are other criteria here at Play number one it's the psychological effect of playing Karo playing somebody at 0 is not the same as playing them at 14-0 after you've lost 14 games in a row you're probably much higher to lose that 15th game than if it was game one in the match when you are focused motivated and not emotionally defeated number two it's 3 minute and zero increment hikaro is by far it is not close I think hikaro plays more online three plus zero games in Blitz than the next top 10 grand Masters in the world combined in an annual year it might even be more than that and he always has hikaro has been playing online Blitz since online Blitz was invented somebody some mathematician should go pull Magnus hikaro Aliva like what top 10 top 20 grand Masters in the world by the way include Daniel narit there because he is also a very active three player no bonus time increment hikaro has probably 20 to 30,000 more games played if not more if not 50 to 100,000 games per year per every two years per every three years than any other player combin all the those guys combin because it's his job and also he loves it and that's just what he does he's an online Speed Demon Blitz and bullet so those are all criteria that that you can't just say he won 55 games in a row I'm not a mathematician I'm not a data scientist but those are all very you know key elements of this argument it's not like it's not like he's winning title Tuesday with these records if you take his title Tuesday statistics right and there's more I mean there there are more streaks I I I will show you them you know uh here's a streak in November remember here you know he plays the same guy he plays arton all the way and then he plays uh arton arton then he starts playing Liam putam look how many times he played Liam putam young guy he's 15 I keep calling him 13 in my videos and then he played you know a little bit of title Tuesday here he started his title Tuesday but he played Liam putam until he got into title Tuesday and then in title Tuesday he played until he made a draw against andreen he beat you know some guys in titled Tuesday and then he lost to I don't know who this is it's some Russian inter master um and that was his streak so he beat two guys like 40 times is that worth investigating I don't know maybe and then this continues like this is basically the thing right this was the legendary streak that karnick started with this whole thing this was September to October hikaro had some crazy run late September he beat a bunch of people same arton guy by the way poor arton every single time arton asra getting farmed by hikaro uh and uh you know it's just hikaro playing the same people like 10 15 times cuz that's what he does and this is essentially Kick's point and then karnick posted on his blog today at 4:00 a.m. eastern time he said all of you Gentlemen by the way Vladimir Everybody Plays chess not just gentlemen all right let's let's use everybody let's let's use inclusive terminology all of you what what if there were women what if there were folks that are non-binary waiting for these statistics Vlad come on cancel Vlad for another reason no just kidding please um but this crack me up just all of you gentlemen Vlad come on what about the women's russan what about the Russian women's team what about Alexandra G are waiting for the next statistics appetizer statistics of the goat so um this is basically Hikaru versus Ali Resa and Magnus in games and streaks right so Ali Reza has played 900 Blitz games this year longest winning streak is 17 not a single streak at 20 Magnus 1400 games longest winning streak is 32 okay he has 10 streaks with 20 games unbeaten now Hikaru has played more games than both of them combined times one and a half right and the longest time he went without losing is 79 over the last I guess year um again probably against 27 and 2800s and you know whatever um and then he had 63 and so on and now he says gentlemen crazy to have doubts or not to examine answer is clear then he said the main course is coming in a couple of hours the main course it seems like is a petition uh which basically says we demand examination we the Chon players ask administration of the platform to perform a detailed examination of hikaro Nakamura due to his recent streaks um again he's hikaro look hikaro has literal speedruns on chess.com where he plays bad openings and gets to 3,000 right um I'm not saying Karu is above the law it's not what I'm saying I'm just saying that considering that everything Karo does is in the public guy literally playing thousands of games at all times on camera I am of the opinion that cheating has literally no benefit for Hikaru and would only do Monumental levels of damage to his chess career particularly why would he cheat in 3 games against 2900 it's like having said that that's that's not enough of an excuse to exonerate the guy but what's more of an excuse to exonerate the guy is people ran statistical reports like people mathematicians data scientists self-appointed who are not publicly revealing themselves because they don't want to be caught in this Crossfire have gone and said the chances of hikaro pulling off such a winning streak are significantly higher than Vladimir is estimating um and if a guy like Magnus Carlson played more games online like Karo if Magnus played 5,000 games online during the course of the year he would probably pull off as many of these results as well but again we are talking about 3 minute no bonus time 3 minute no bonus time no Al alcohol Magnus likes to drink and play on stream no alcohol all things being equal Magnus and Karo are probably the best three players in the world like by far right and then maybe it's like nitki 3 0 now statistical stuff all right let's let's let's time to talk about statistics like I agree with kramnick that every top player is not is not above the law and and should be analyzed deeper and should be uh checked thoroughly but I disagree with the notion that bringing this up publicly is somehow saying I'm not accusing the guy like kck's got to realize how it looks right I mean if we're all just trying to level with each other it don't look good cuz he keeps saying things like it it looks suspicious like people should look at it more and I'm going to bring in statistics that knock the guy out right so look before you before you leave before I lose your attention span um this guy responded to Vladimir kck's post and he said and this was a very funny interaction I have done a Monte Carlo analysis on the likelihood that a 3250 rated player would have multiple 40 plus winning streaks against 2900s 55,000 games there were 51 instances of winning streaks that were 40 games or longer the result indicates it's not only does it meet the criteria of having at least four such streaks but it far exceeds it this outcome suggests that in a Louge number of games a player with hikaru's estimated win probability can achieve multiple such streaks okay um and kramnick responded to him and said could you please introduce yourself Mr mathematician second explain the number 55,000 third I suppose since you're serious spent a lot of time doing research you must know the amount of streaks Yar had during a period um better stop writing nonsense like that R run it again for 20K games and come up you know um I I I and then and and then he said uh the expected winning rate is around 88% between 3250 and 2900 by the way if it's 88% around 2900 doesn't that mean it's like 95% at 27 2800 right it doesn't include factors like psychology of playing one of the best players in the world and being part of a streak knowing that you are probably going to lose right so cnick responded I would repeat my questions simp as please introduce yourself with some culture faking the numbers doesn't make you research convincing average 2950 instead of 2900 insulting is falsification and disining pointing it out it isn't so he introduces himself he says he's not going to publicly reveal his identity he drops all of this now again I am not a mathematician I'm not a data scientist I cannot confirm or deny these numbers they look convincing they could be total nonsense and in which case you are all watching me spread this information even more but again it just basically seems like a bunch of people are like running numerical analysis and gry just like now you're wrong again I I don't know maybe maybe Vladimir is 100% correct uh maybe these guys are 100% correct based on running a thousand of these simulations of a thousand games the anmated probability of encountering at least two winning streaks of 40 or more games within a maximum of two draws is 54% so it's quite likely hikaro will get some of these big streaks now let's remember kramnick said you know several of these streaks were 2900 and two of them were 2700 and we can throw those out because they they're completely different these guys are talking about the 2900 level so hikaro wins a ridiculous amount of games at 2900 now one piece of information that I am curious about is what is hikaru's average time up on the clock in all those games so here's the statistic I want anybody who can do math or data science or any of this stuff in those streaks that hikaro is pulling off in three minute0 second increment chess um how many in what is hikaru's average maximum time discrepancy in those games on average what is hikaru's maximum time advantage in those games how many seconds on the clock is Hikaru up at a maximum in those games or on average whatever and I would estimate it's probably over 30 over 30 seconds to 40 seconds in a thre minute game Hikaru is generally playing faster and a little bit more accurately and as players time gets lower they play worse and horse that's my hypothesis okay I'm not like I I don't really have a horse in this race other than it is really really really difficult for me to perceive that uh that that Hikaru is cheating but again I'm not just sitting no it's not possible like I'm you know I'm I'm saying kramnick keeps saying that he has statistics to provide right and and and and whatever that might be but it it's not really clear what's going on because he's providing you know this graph of stuff and then he's saying stuff like well Ali res played 900 games and Magnus played 1400 games Hikaru played 3,800 games and my Counterpoint my very limited Counterpoint is I think Hikaru just plays way more games and has way more experience has hundreds of thousands of experience more playing online in three Blitz like that's the point and he plays it a bit more obsessively because he's a streamer nobody else is doing that so that's the situation at the moment um I don't know if the main course has arrived according to Vladimir uh there was another gentleman who put together you know here is the gentleman who posted uh the Monte Carlo simulation um now it is it here it says by chat GPT so I don't know I don't know if we can be trusted but let's see uh Dorian Kell I guess quell Kell is a PhD student sorry for the there is no Dark theme on this website um this individual has posted multiple times on his blog on GitHub about cheating and title Tuesday and uh this was interesting for a couple of reasons it's it's quite it's quite an interesting read uh he basically downloads the chess.com API data he downloads fed data of all the title players in the world and all of the title Tuesday games on chess.com where they are in the world the rating discrepancy between fed and leeches ratings and chess.com rating so title players on ch.com apparently have uh like if your fed rating is 1, 1600 1,800 you know your rating is slightly higher I guess um Fay versus chlc uh and then as you get higher you know your your ratings kind of come back because if you're like 2700 your your your ch.com rating is probably like 3,000 but the separation gets smaller and then he did a report of the biggest upsets like Karo once lost to a 2,000 I'm on here I defeated Peter fidler that was like a 1 to 14% and uh you know mag magus's win rate en title Tuesday is 82% karus is 81% and um this is a very interesting one uh to go through but uh the the overall summary again if you if if you want to read uh in this article I analyzed whether there's indication cheating increased after the chess boom in 2020 I found no evidence of cheating in fact the error of the prediction actually dropped for the online games I'm convinced there is no evidence cheating increased after the CH boom in 2020 compared to the offline Baseline no evidence of pervasive and consistent computer assisted cheating and tile Tuesday tournaments um now again when you look at something like this uh I am still of the opinion and and again this could be totally wrong but again I I I'm I'm not a leading mathematical or quantitative Authority even though I got a degree in statistics I didn't go to class the last like two years of college kids go to class not all of you can be chess YouTubers and it's also not something you should aspire to be I am still of the very very very firm opinion that if a very strong grandmas tried to cheat intelligently like once in a game and wasn't even told the move but was told there is a evaluation swing that is very difficult if not impossible to catch ch.com probably Compares games played by Grand Masters against modern day engines and you know I previously brought up the point of previous day engines like 2010 like a 2010 bot can probably still beat any human 20 2008 bot can probably beat any human does ch.com have capability to scan games based on those engines yes probably um but I don't know cuz I haven't spoken to the team um but the bigger point is like Vladimir karnick brings up a a a a good point in the sense that no player should be above the law and any player should be investigated but I disagree with the notion that he didn't quite understand what he was doing in this case and saying I'm not accusing if you think I'm accusing the numbers are accusing but nobody thinks the numbers are accusing are like a very very very small percentage of people because I think most people attribute this to 30 chess online chess the element of tilt when you're losing 15 games in a row hikaro having literally hundreds of thousands of more games of experience than Magnus or any other top player in three Blitz and all of those things together combined make it very difficult to see that after all of this hikaro would have been cheating in meaningless 30 games like literally like to take a quote Hans deman recently said that you know he cheated in meaningless games um but okay you know we'll see is he is ch.com going to publish a big report maybe I don't know what they're going to publish um should they publish something I maybe like again I that's what I don't it's a slippery slope because what if the next Grandmaster accuses another Grandmaster what what if tomorrow a Grandmaster accuses any other top 10 GM and says publish all of their games you understand why this is tricky the whole thing is is is is a little bit absurd like watching you know esteemed World chess champion sitting there on camera saying well I'm not accusing him you know and the response is not what I int well Vlad you got to realize like how could you like how can we not be perceiving what you were saying is like no that's not possible I mean he can't just win that many games in a row it's worth investigating will he ever be satisfied I don't know will cheson publish a report I don't know stay tuned for another chess cheating scandal update uh and um I that's all I have for you today so Cyber Monday ends today get a course for 40% off woohoo don't get caught cheating don't win too many games in a row uh and uh until next time get out of here
