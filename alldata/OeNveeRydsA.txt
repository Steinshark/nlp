seven signs of a bad programmer how many do you think I'm Gonna Get Real Talk type right up here how many of those do you think I'm going to have one two seven okay well I'm happy that all of you guys think I'm an uh and then I'm stupid really what this shows is that I'm emotionally bruised all the time streaming the seven signs of a bad programmer uh the secret developer okay four minute read let's go let's go there are many ways to Be an Effective ineffective at a job here are a few that seem to be uh the running theme with some programmers I've worked with over the years number one you watch a lot of twitch specifically the primogen uh let's see I'm a software engineer not a programmer okay okay okay you know what they are like mechanical keyboard in the office can't make stand-up because they're thinking about a problem it's a five minutes to mention uh what you're thinking about how long did this oh my goodness oh my goodness this yes yes conflating the person with the mechanical keyboard the person that thinks that you know that gets lost in a problem this is so good oh no oh no first off stand-ups are never five minutes it's because it's because Bill won't shut up about his dog well actually this weekend me and the misses were on a hike and you'll never guess what little teddy did so Teddy ran off at the sight of a cow and then we were off in the pasture it's just like dude I don't care about your dog your hike or anything I just want to get the hell out of this meeting if we're having lunch tell me about it okay because lunch is where we talk about this stupid not at stand up what are you doing what did you do tell me you're effing roadblocks and get the hell out of the way why are stand-ups so bad by the way I haven't done a stand-up in about 10 years since joining Netflix it's been fantastic f stand-ups I'm not entirely certain how people uh can be become so arrogant with three years of experience but there you go whoa this article is a FL this article is barbecuing somebody yo if you have a mechanical keyboard at the office I don't think it necessarily means your arrogant but man that barbecue is set to 500. I like to impress with my job title who what do you mean nobody cares whiteboard in the background some people in the industry do have degrees I've worked with doctors not MediCal kind okay usually we call those phds uh those who with qualifications in the industry often choose not to mention them because with within many organizations there is a reverse establishness around education okay that's fair there's kind of I've seen some of this reverse novelishness um but it's it's exceptionally rare and it mostly exists on Twitter I don't think I've seen it anywhere else uh yet others wear glasses without medical reasons which really happens instead of in front of a whiteboard on those video calls is is he described is he describing LinkedIn or programmers this seems like a LinkedIn call out you know that one post that inevitably gets around on Twitter from time to time that's just like I watch porn I don't care who knows it's on LinkedIn you're like dude this guy's unhinged I'd be more impressed if your whiteboard had uh more than a bullet point list that is I know you don't understand the wider architecture of the application your whiteboard is like putting makeup on a pig damn zing zing all right here we go uh some have interesting information written on the Whiteboard though what the hell are you doing reading a whiteboard shut up why are you caring stop caring all right here we go delete the current project you've entered a new project and I've seen someone on Twitter recommend that you delete the whole thing and start again won't the current team members be somewhat put out of uh joint by the suggestion what do you mean teamwork might be damaged just delete it okay whatever uh I mean a full-on rewrite there are sometimes benefits to it but the problem is is it so so I mean the problem with this article right away is that it lacks depth in general it's very funny ad hominem we're all laughing hahaha but the reality is is that there's a lot of ad hominem in here with not a lot of depth um the thing is is that some technologies you choose make it virtually impossible to just do a runtime refactor if you will right uh it's really really hard right so like I mean real talk if you choose to write your front end in any framework svelte JavaScript wait not JavaScript spelled react solid.js you can't just swap them right you can't just do that it takes a lot you know what I mean like you can't you literally have to delete the whole effing thing and start again right uh but okay uh the Michael Jackson Black or White the programmer can only think in terms of right and wrong rather than Shades of Gray in almost every circumstance there's only Shades of Gray and no right or wrong decisions apart from a few things let's not get uh confused though when programmers declare that something should just be done in a certain way they frequently think about their way of doing things so what you're trying to say is that there is a way that things should be done but it's not the way that someone else is suggesting do you feel the loopback on this own piece of advice yo bro you can't make General statements so you doomed if you do doomed if you don't like what uh what uh it's a loop sometimes it doesn't need to be your way uh or the highway uh perhaps introduce the uh perhaps introduce that it depends a way of thinking uh to your software development practices this is good but also Real Talk who here press one in the chat who here has been on a team of a bunch of it depends CIS deal and absolutes ideal in absolutes press one when you bet on a bunch of it depends how fun is that team right how fun is the team that everybody wants to pedant like everybody builds their own bike shed constantly like it's there's it's almost equally as bad I preferred the informed Captain approach which is just have one person we all go hey hey Peter what do we do and Peter goes okay I think we should do this this and this and we go okay we'll do that Peter we call at Netflix we call it the informed Captain someone just needs to make a decision we need to just we just need to move on right just stop stop with all this this pedantic masturbation uh the Peter Principle oh man this sounds like pick's favorite thing uh faster path downwards some programmers are well worth a promotion after 12 or even six months yet it seems many programmers feel that they are entitled to a raise and a new job title after a few months on the job the the standard of a team leads in tech companies does seem pitifully low new developers quickly move up the chain without technical knowledge for a new uh for a new Advanced role and certainly lack the people knowledge in order to be a effective team lead programming is all about people they take time to develop why is it called the Peter Principle is this a reference to Peter the pillar of the church what what's I don't is this a Peter I'm supposed to know is it a Biblical reference Peter Griffin did he mean the word penis what is it I think it's Spider-Man because Spider-Man wasn't he got promoted too quick and he wasn't ready for his responsibility and his uncle got killed I think that's what it means okay if I can relate everything to Spider-Man I'm going to not biblical clearly that I just copy the code from stack Overflow it seems to work let's go later that week can you fix the crash you guessed it okay I mean this is such an old meme I don't know anybody that actually does this right Chad you don't do this right chat okay so this one actually sounds great lack of curiosity it's fine to be in uh in it for the money absolutely uh to some extent every job is about the income you derive from it absolutely if Netflix cut my income in 10th by a tenth like if they cut it into one tenth I'm not like well geez really love my job you know like I get it there is definitely an income barrier here however to really have a passion and love uh your work means that you get so much more out of it and become much more valued colleague absolutely uh your aim is to retire at 40. not so much perhaps that is why you are not so interested in uh to find out the origin of that bug after all what happen if you are curious and you just don't want to work at a corporation by the time you're 40. I'm not hey I'm boss if you're listening I'm not I'm not trying to say I'm going to quit Netflix within the next four years but I'm just saying that it would be really sweet if I didn't have to work for you at 40. I got them damn I'm about to be a farmer full-time but why if you don't enjoy your job and want to improve both yourself and your current project perhaps it's time to find a new career uh oh my goodness this little little of debts little intense I can you know what not everybody has to love love it I I finally come around on it not everybody has to love it you just have to realize what that means that is it if you don't love it and you're just cashing in cashing out you're gonna be a kind of a stagnant basic generalist with not a lot of depth and there's plenty of jobs that need that right there's plenty of jobs that like that plenty of jobs that need it that's okay not everybody has to be around not everyone has to be an Olympian right uh this article is a light-hearted look at the following destructive developer behaviors okay I'm a software engineer not a programmer whiteboard in the background to delete the current project Michael Jackson Black or White Peter Principle still don't know who this Peter is copy pasta lack of curiosity conclusion if you're displaying one of these signs it doesn't mean that you're a bad programmer just playing all seven you might not be a fantastic developer uh you might not be the Fantastic developer you think you are I let's see I don't know though because I don't know you see you want to know an effective programmer looks like look at the article below seven signs of a great programmer office space Peter ooh none of us even thought about that okay hold on uh oh thank you thank you uh uh twitch twitch Jeopardy uh the Peter Principle was laid out by Canadian educational scholar and sociologist Dr Lawrence J Peter in his 1968 book titled the Peter Principle kind of looks like a dick uh dang it this is a YouTube video uh the Peter Principle is the concept and management developed by Lawrence J Peter which observes that people in a hierarchy tend to to rise or tend to rise to a level of respect uh respective incompetence uh employees are promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level in which they are no longer competent as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another and that's actually a pretty good principle that's actually a pretty good principle I like that [Music] so you tell me I can't make a dick joke that's what you're trying to say well Karen then how do I measure my dick in bites if that's such a big deal to you huh do you know about the pickling algorithm oh you don't well guess what it's confusing the name Karen is the dictogen [Music]
