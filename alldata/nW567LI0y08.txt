I am not interested in your strong opinions is that a strong opinion well let's find out if as a developer you're active on social media and who isn't I guess you'll encounter a lot of strong opinions there well I guess that's not just the case as a developer but in general that's the thing about social media but the general like I I hear where he's going but my general problem with this whole like strong opinions thing is is nobody cares about the milk toast opinion right like nobody is going to talk to you give you an alternative stance or do anything if you just go like this yeah typescript could be good sometimes and sometimes I find typescript to be bad sometimes overall I'd use it some of the times nobody is going to care at all about what you're saying right it just doesn't it doesn't have there's nothing to it right you're just like oh okay cool I guess like you know it's an outrageous take I disagree right exactly like it doesn't there's there's nothing to it and that's one of the problems about this is that we fundamentally as humans prefer to like we we interact with the things we really like and we really disagree with not the things that we're just like yeah okay right okay but in this episode I want to take a look at the developer World on social media and the strong opinion what are the chances I'm going to get mentioned on this one I feel like I don't toss out that many strong opinions on the old Twitter okay I feel like like my primary mode of operation is just posting some just crazy nonsense copy pasta from the stream and or memes and rarely like the strong opinions okay I'm just not really into the whole strong opinions side of things okay hold your mustache and let the guy cook we're going to let the guy cook appearing in the top 10 most L takes Here Comes opinions you will encounter dear for example if you're in the web development JavaScript space as I most am you learn that let is better than con or the opposite of course that observ by the way that let versus cons debate was just crazy I I am shocked that people spent that much time on something that doesn't really matter it's like hey yo it's already broken it's been broken why why why why you got to care you know it's been broken for like literally 10 years what are you going to do complain about it it just is what it is you're attempting to to deliver meaning on your attempt here and that's thats and rxjs are the way to go when working with angular and your borderline stupid or at least a bad developer if you're not using it that much and and of course there are endless discussions about react versus angular why both are stupid and and so on now of course I'm exaggerating here I am on X and on social media in general because there also is lots of useful content to be found there and there definitely also are useful balanced conversations but you is there really I mean I I rarely find much for for strong useful stuff Ian the reason why I use x is to understand the general sentiment that can be found on X and that is it I don't actually go for it other than sentiment analysis and understanding what people are thinking today in the web world because I mean first off X isn't even a good representation of just general developers I would argue that most developers are not on X I think in five years it will be different I think in five years a a a majority of developers will be more active on the social media but as of right now I do not think that's the case I I I I I I don't think there's stuff on there it's good to get some attention right like I find that X is really cool if there's like an article that goes viral and you're like Ah that's actually pretty cool they put they put doom on you know on this delicious whatever and you're just like that's that's awesome but that's it I'm not on X yeah a lot of people are not on X I just troll Prime on X yeah that that that's that's a fine thing X take yeah uh in five years only Chad GPT will be [ __ ] posting on social media it's already seeming like that as it is doom on a part a poptart cool yeah exactly ah this is a series of Pop-Tarts produced with doom scenes by the way Pop-Tart that is an incredible thing to consider the doom doom on a Pop-Tart oh my oh my goodness just think about it just think about it for a second probably get my point and chances are high that you saw or encountered exactly what I was just referring to yeah and here's my honest opinion on that that is so extremely stupid strong opinion found let's go I agree with the strong opinion but nonetheless strong opinion found seriously don't you guys if you're joining such discussions don't you have anything better to do who are you helping with sharing strong opinions like that you prefer const over let or let over const because const doesn't make sense in JavaScript because objects and arrays that are stored as const are still mutable yeah who cares nobody cares please go ahead use let don't use const it's fine awesome you don't need to convince anyone at the Same by the way that is awesome I like that I'm liking this take I'm liking this take okay there you go it's just like d it's already built it's already baked into the cake what what are you going to be upset about why do you got an opinion about something that's baked into cake that's like being up like you see this every now and then be like yeah JavaScript sucks 0.1 plus point2 ha got him and you're just like yo dog that's I but dog that's not that's it's not that's baked into that's just baked into the the cake dog it just works that way because it works that way what do you want buddy what do you want with floating Point numbers it's just it just is is true for most of these other discussions you prefer react over angular you prefer remix over next you prefer vanilla JavaScript over react awesome you I don't get that last comparison but we'll keep going it feel free to share why that's the case but why do you need to convince a can't you use it without doing that so I don't like this take um I think you should try to express why you think things are good or bad I think there's a lot of benefit in doing that uh it makes you really good at because the thing is is that when you're at your job you're going to inevitably have these exact same discussions and this is a it's a great place to be able to think through and reason about being able to say why you think one thing is better than the other and you're going to hear a lot of arguments for why you are wrong and you can internalize those arguments you can take them and you can kind of chew over them and actually think about why that is or is not the case and if it is not the case well guess what good news you can go okay this is not a good argument I know that I'm good I'm very very happy about it we can move on uh or you can go oh I need to reformulate or rethink about why I think this is true or false and you can become a better arguer for the things you actually want he did uh he did say to explain why I know but but he also said you just don't have to but why do you need to convince people why do you need to convince others that's that's the part of persuasion like that's that's your job you're going to literally have a job unless if you're working by yourself where you're going to be in a continuous like thing of trying to convince people of why we should go in this Direction that's like that's software in a nutshell and being able to have some reasonable take why some priority is better than the other like that's very it's it's a very important skill to have can't you use it without doing that that's really the part I don't get and yeah I'm rant here I could ignore it as well I'm aware of that and for most part I but I thought hey why don't I create a video and podcast episode about it because also frankly I'm interested in understanding what you think about that am I alone am I the only one who's annoyed by this I I am personally annoyed by really trivial ones I I mean I think it's fun saying like Vim is the best because you just watch people explode they just they just like die over it it's like a peren funny funny thing to say oh my goodness I just love I just I just love it I like watching people just get completely torn up about something that's that's insignificant but like const versus let and actually having a real discussion why one is better than the other it's just like yo dog like this like unless if this has been one giant ploy to see people get triggered which it could be and then hey you know what you're a master master of of Twitter Warfare and then I am on your team for that one that's hilarious but the reality is is they're they're not they're just actually like strong opinion discussions on why one is better than the other Max is just playing 40 chest yeah if he's just playing 40 chest then I'm in for it that's hilarious I I disagree I don't think you need to convince anyone make a well-reasoned argument uh then let them decide that's literally what convincing is goat mail that is that is that is the art of persuasion precisely if you don't need to convince anybody then you will not make a well-reasoned argument or an unreasonable argument you will make no AR argument you will not tweet about it at all okay fair enough yeah that's the whole point is that you're always trying to convince like people are always trying to convince you of something everyone is trying to sell you something that's why I love that Princess and the bride or The Princess Bride um the prince oh my goodness why am I saying that wrong The Princess Bride I don't know why I got so confused there like princess and the bride uh the princess bride's uh statement which is uh if someone's telling you there's no pain then they're either lying to you or trying to sell you something I just I love that that is like one of the greatest lines ever when people are trying to tell you why this thing exists and why this new version is going to be the greatest thing ever and the previous version was filled with pain it's because they're selling you something this is this is the whole point this is what all the selling is for let's see you're missing the point if you have a to discuss something you will do inside your team and not on social media with click plate titles like friend like your friend Theo does talking with people uh IRL is not the same as posting that yeah but I I don't think that's fair at all I do not think that's fair at all first off um let's no need to drag Theo around I don't think that that's very nice thing to do KNX okay Buddy Guy Theo has plenty of not click baity threads um second off discussing things on X there's plenty of people that do try to discuss things it is an art that you should try to get good at you should understand what makes things go right like you really should like this is a very important skill to have because if you use one phrase and nobody listens to you and you use a different phrase and people listen to you you don't think that will be equally useful in your job to understand why people engage or don't engage with an argument like there there's like a whole there's a whole skill there like you should know how to do that it's important to speak with people who don't work for you it helps calibrate yourself exactly like there's an entire there's like an entire thing there that's really really important Twitter is a free place you can practice your convincing skills in your job the Judgment has consequences exactly and you can also say things and see how people don't like here's the deal is like you could say some things and find out that you're just you're you're massively like you're missing huge gaps like I do this all the time I I'll say something about get especially like rebase and people be like oh rebase is the worst it makes you resolve conflicts over and over again and then you respond yeah if only there was a way that we could uh automatically re reuse resolved resolutions I think wait am I correct on that reuse whatever I forget what re stands for and I'll just use the exact phrase because it's hilarious you get to watch people get triggered and their own know know doesn't show through and you can see that people argue without even having all the information and then you you get to understand more of why when you say something you have to say it with more convincing skills right because now when I say use rebase I'll say I will explain it differently I just won't say oh yeah use use use rebase it's better because they'll be like oh I don't but it's terrible makes you have all these conflicts like I know the question people will have so instead I can be like you know rebase can be really really good and if you ever find yourself falling into these situations don't forget that you need to use ReRe because re could be very very useful right like you can already start off arguing against things that people are going to have it's really nice opinion based discussions cannot be one with facts that is not true opinions can be can be changed I I do not believe in strong uh strong opinions weakly held I do not believe in that I think you should have strong opinions strongly held but you should be willing to reconsider and think through everything I hold on to my opinions strongly I do okay I do cuz I think they're right but if someone can actually give me a compelling argument I will think through it and I will try to like reason through it but it requires window yeah of course but that's what you do that's what you got to do well I might be and of course I am fully aware that that's simply how social media works so ultimately that's probably the goal of those people who are sharing those strong opinions on social media and I'm falling into their trap I'm aware of this but still it is supera if you're falling into it then it's working right like that's the point is for you to to argue your point of view I I I I simply do not get owned by the lead versus const one that that was just too ridiculous sometimes I feel like people are arguing the most trivial things and I just walk away traps can be good traps can be good it it also teaches you a lot about yourself it teaches you how you react to things I actually really like knowing when I get Tri cuz when I get triggered it helps me like laugh at myself and go wait a second okay I know like a new point that gets me tricked now I have that in my Arsenal not to get bamboozled right annoying I get it you need attention you get attention you don't get that much attention if you have like balanced views and fear discussion I love it when you get triggered by communism don't do it my friend um uh very very fair very very fair um hold I want to resay cuz let see so this you you need attention you get attention it's kind of a weird thing is that attention you don't get that much attention if you have like but everyone that's replying is also fighting for quote unquote attention so I'm not sure if it's really attention people just like stating their opinions like that's just a fact of life I've never met someone that doesn't State their opinions you know like balanced views and fair discussions nobody's interested in that I get that point but still please reflect on your behavior is there no other way you can sell your stuff or get other people to engage with you is that the only way you can do it it's not that great in my opinion I will say this one if you only do strong opinions and you only do these kind of like really one-dimensional arguments it does work it most certainly works for people to want to engage with you but I'll tell you a real a bigger secret here the more you do it the more people quit looking at you like think about all of those tweets uh two years ago as a developer fill in the blank right like all of those quote unquote uh Tech influencers have all they're they're all these people with like a 100,000 followers and they get like 10 likes now because they've just all destroyed their account and their credibility cuz you can't do that right like that kind of stuff it just it just doesn't work you destroy yourself right and so these these kind of like these really engagement baithing type tweeting it does not work longterm it's not a long-term strategy the thing is is that the the the truest form of long-term strategy if you want the the best one the best possible way to engage with people it is simple memes just make dumb memes like that's it just say stupid stuff on the internet and it's funny and then every now and then you can have a strong opinion and it works because then when you have a strong opinion it's worth engaging with because the 10 before that were just dumb memes about Dax destroying versell and it's funny cuz it's funny to watch Dax destroy versel because here's the thing all these strong opinions can be super intimidating for Less experienced developers developers who don't have that much knowledge and experience because of course if you basically get the feeling that everything's wrong that you can't get anything right that's not that good that can get you to leave that world of development because well in a world where everything's wrong nothing's right of course and you can get by the way that is programming I I hope you know programming is the art of of failing like that that's it that's it programming is the art of failing it's like playing Tetris you don't play Tetris to win the game of Tetris okay yeah I know there's that one guy that beat the Nintendo thing that's rare but the rest of us program and it's just a slowly about to turn into something that's unmaintainable to the point after a few years you're going to have to re redo it you lose the game you lose the game eventually and that's that and so like this this idea that think there's a right choice there's not a right choice this is why some just this is why person could write a roller coaster and Excel it's because you can that's it you simply can y'all are mid that's it y'all are mid I just lost the game now okay now I'm re think I'm trying not to think about the game I refuse to think about it I'm just not allowing myself to play that game anymore that feeling by the way Twitch Plays aski Tetris that might be my next one it's either that or Tower Defense I'm not sure which one we're almost done with this Doom one I'm going to tr I'm going to transfer it down to the web and we're going to play it and I'm going to make it slightly nicer uh colors I'm going to go to 16 bit color do a couple things Bada Bing a boom and just make it done you know what I mean if you encounter too many of those conversations and opinions that I do want to be real for one second as we all remember our Junior developer days do you remember that uh do you remember the developer that was the very big senior or staff level engineer that person came in and could twig argue like Twitter right came in with these really strong statements of why you're exactly wrong and why they are exactly right and you just simply got cowed into falling into line cuz you had no ability to argue you had no ability to be able to think for yourself you had no ability to actually even take your opinions because you heard this opinion you knew something was wrong you just didn't know how to express it because you simply didn't have the same amount of time they do thinking about this specific problem and so you just simply get cowed like I have seen this happen over and over and over again it's not like this is somehow a Twitter only problem this happens everywhere it's just that when you're in person they just have more words they can say to you and when someone has more words it's only harder to refute it like that's it it's only harder it doesn't become easier it's easy on Twitter because it's super one-dimensional because they got like they got like 200 characters to like try to deliver the same thing whereas like when you go to work i' I've I mean I cannot tell you how many times I had four 4our arguments over whether or not we should have very adct parameters or just take in an array think about that crazy right like that's so much time so who won I lost we did VAR adct parameters okay that are being shared here and of course there also are good discussions that's not the point there also are best practices or patterns that are worth knowing about and that are best practices what's the problem with that statement the best practices are almost largely and completely going to be opinion-based ones should you have a function that's four lines long six lines long 10 lines long 12 lines long is it okay to have more than one thing a function does if it's at a certain spot in that program maybe maybe not depends you know you got to kind of see things should you always write all your codes so it can be highly testable or sometimes do you just simply take experiences or uh exceptions to the rules how often do you need to do inversion of control how often should you be prepared for dependency injection should you start off writing integration tests or should you not like where do you draw this line how do you do this should you write your test first or should you write your code first right all of these best practices they're they're [ __ ] opinions that that's what makes it so hard is that everything we do is an opinion and it's an act of attempting not to Simply fail as fast are worth exploring and of course except of course the strategy pattern strategy pattern being the only pattern that's actually truly worth it in the end of the days there also are some bad or annoying Parts about react or angular or any other technology or concept that you might want to share with others also to learn how they think about it or also to maybe warn others of doing something in a wrong way or repeating a mistake you made that might all be reasons for sharing your thoughts on a certain technology or uh on on a certain concept and so on but of course there simply also are different ways of sharing an opinion or by the way I don't disagree with any of the previous things he just said I think those are all good ways to to share stuff right I think that's those are all good ideas on ways to share things but a lot of the stuff that he just said are also opinions and they can be very strong like ways you think react does things poor some people look at that and think no you're just doing it wrong it's actually really good right there's plenty of people that think use effect is great there's plenty of people that think use effect is terrible there's plenty of people that think react rendering twice is good they just think that's good they're like oh this is a good thing it helps me write my code this way or of sharing your thoughts on something you can always share stuff in a way that's not necessarily offensive for other people but you can also frame your statements such and word them such that it's pretty clear that if you have a different opinion than you who shared it you're wrong and that is the toxic part the annoying part which I'm honestly not a fan of and and generally I agree with that I I generally agree with that but here's the inverse of it if you truly think writing software is different and in your vast experience you truly believe that the difference in this is in fact actually really really bad then wouldn't you be intense about it it's so difficult right like if I think clean code is genuinely the worst way to write software and I say this is the worst way to write software I am in facts saying that if you write software this way it is wrong right so it's like hard like when when is it wrong to have a strong opinion in that kind of way as I mentioned I am aware that's how the internet and social media works these days that is how you get attention and how you can sell your stuff I really only hope that we'll get past that point at some point in the future hopefully soon because it is annoying and you're honestly not helping anyone but okay so you say articulate the reason why all this this is but but Twitter and social media is not the right form for that type of communication you just got to understand like here's a good here's a good example have you ever had a problem that needs a lot of describing and so what do you do you go on slack and you write out this very long exact statement for everything that's going wrong and boom you hit send and the entire screen gets filled up from top to bottom with your words and then you have a meeting about it and then you find out that every last person who has looked at your slack message did not read it they saw all the words glazed over and just said we'll figure it out in the meeting why because you Ed the wrong form of communication for that Medium that's just not how it works what you should have done is simply have a nice little Google doc write up the exact same set of things and then just put a link in here saying hey this is what happens you should check out the exact write up right here and guess what it works because the people that will engage with it are prepared to engage with that form of writing with that form of communication and so you just got to understand like the thing that you're trying to communicate through I think it's I think it's very very important to just know that and so you like if you're going to have a really thoughtful and long discussion you have to save it for a different medium it has to be the medium in which people are engaged for that so it's like tw Twitter you got to realize you got 10 words you truly have about 10 to 15 words to capture someone's attention right you just got to read the room and so I know that I got seven to 10 words so I'm going to say something like I do not like using JavaScript on the server do I need to give all the reasons why that that could be incorrect do I need to go and give you a exact breakdown and preface every last statement No I don't I don't have to do all that I can give you the exact opinion of mine to the te that's it because I'm using the ER communication and then you know what I can do is I can have a video or I can have a blog post or I can talk about it like I talk about right here and give you a more long reason why I think they're good or bad so for me so you're say it's just an opinion the shorter uh it is the less I'm I inclined to listen to it not me I'll listen to any opinion I like to hear opinions I don't care how big or small they are because here's the deal like one of my favorite tweeters dhh he goes out and says he's really strong opinions but you know what I do I form a basic cloud of what he is and then I'll go and read a few of his book blog post and then I go oh I like those blog posts or I'll go oh I did not like that one why cuz I'm able to like I I just I just I simply start drawing a box around what a person thinks and it makes me always ask why when someone says I do not like using typescript I think it is ugly that's a very one-dimensional small thing but it makes me think why would they think it's ugly can I walk through that thought process how do they adopt it right because that seems like really really crazy and then you learn different ways in which people think like I'm okay with I'm okay with short ones just consider communism did and no thank you very much but like you get the idea just take you know I actually I enjoy the shorter bites because it can make me think about something for a little bit before I respond the problem that I'm seeing here is just when something is tur people also absorb it and look at it as if it were um uh a mean thank you pck I do I do love your I do love your uh uh video I did watch it but I mean I think that's what it is when someone reads something that's super tur they read it with like ill intent behind it and I don't necessarily agree that things just because it's tur does it mean it's it's ill willed I think it's just to the point now there are of course if you say hey you're an idiot if you don't use typescript well the nice part is you get to know more about the person and if someone says that you can go oh I can discount their opinion now boom right like that's it that's all you got to do nice Capital H night shade dude also very funny that the Twitter reading does not allow Capital H is that true I thought it was all capitals technically anyways I'm just saying it's funny I I don't know I like it I like seeing those things because it helps me draw opinions about people you can be Kurt with me Prime thank you I will I I like those things I I personally like them with behaviors like that so yeah sorry about that rant I'm super interested in learning if it's just me I'm interested in learning what you think about opinions or discussions like that you can give me your opinion now on why I'm wrong and why I shouldn't freak out about stuff like that please do please let me know what you think about that what I forgot or what I'm not seeing here and um yeah with that I hopefully see you back in future episodes I like that that was great thumbs up I'll give you subscribe that was a great video dude I'm giving him all I giving him all of the algorithmic signals knowing that it helps the algorithm tremendously all those things that was a great video and I think people should see it and think about it I love differing opinions but some people can't take it I know it's crazy some people just get EAD watch P's presentation now I refuse to I agree with others you really should contest your opinion about communism this is a very insightful video I refuse to look at it because it has music I've already seen it it's all the different it's all the different countries that have successfully done communism and then the presentation ends okay I've already seen it I laughed I led I rolled on the ground rolling on the floor laughing okay I rfle coped okay it was crazy is rafle copter where you like swing your dick in circles is that what that is I could never tell flip keep it in the the name is the primin oh no
