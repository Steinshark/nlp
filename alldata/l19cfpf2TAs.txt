going to the gym is hard but being ugly is also hard yes oh my goodness I love this this is one of those things that there's like nothing more I love in life than that right there honestly which is like I know this is like you guys think this is a joke but it's so true choose your heart which hard do you wish to have right choosing your heart is like such an important part of life do you just want to sit there and forever know one Tech technology know one single stack and do the same pixel Minds front end work for the rest of your life or you can take a chance and take your time outside of your life and actually learn something that's harder that's different that makes you feel uncomfortable maybe it's O camel we don't even know you get a little o camel curious and then you have to go you have to spend weeks doing stuff in which you can do in minutes in a different language and so you have to choose the hard you want you have to do something a little bit different absolutely love this take go to the gym or stay ugly just just choose your heart working is hard running a business is hard but being broke is also hard dude just these facts are so F you know the hardest part about doing a startup though is not only do you have to run your own business you also have to be broke you have to you have to do the same hard at the same time not only are you eating rice and beans you're also trying to run a business I Tred to choose my own hard right now I I've chosen my version of hard right now fine I'm giving it to you today I woke up at 6:00 uh my wife had she's had really intense stomach pains so last night I had to give her a back rub and then we have this like it's like this super cool like heat pack that it becomes hard when you click something inside of it and it becomes hot and then you actually put it back into boiling water and boil it for 30 minutes and it becomes like liquid again it's like the strangest thing it's a two-way chemical reaction heat pad but it takes 30 minutes to actually get uh to get back to its original state and so I had to get that ready for us that means I'm going to bed at like 11:00 last night I had to wake up at 6:00 I went to work at 6:00 communicated understood did all the things that needed to be done and then at 7:00 kids are having problems over dealing with kids back to work uh at 7:15 back here at 8:00 8:15 do this for 2 hours go after that straight to work my wife usually brings me food just so I can save time every single time I use the bathroom I do a set of 50 of a specific workout so I can keep my blood moving throughout the entire day twice a day I do two 20 to 30 minute workouts as hard as I possibly can I work until 4:00 spend my time with my kids until 6 o'clock or when they go to uh soccer or sometimes 8:00 when I'm done reading with them after that I usually work until 10:00 because right now I'm doing a course I'm doing several courses so I have to work just non-stop sometimes I work from like 6:00 till 10: which is really emotionally bruising but I've chosen this hard I've chosen the heart of just continuously doing this one thing cuz I really want to get this dang uh course off the ground I really want to do a good job on it I really want to pick just the right Technologies to make it super super obvious I want to stay in shape I want to be there with my kids so that means every single moment they're home I'm going to try to be there with them I'm going to try to eat dinner with them I'm going to try to play with them did I jump on the trampoline a whole bunch yesterday absolutely was it really really hard and did I feel like I needed the work absolutely but absolutely no way I'm going to let the stuff in my mind affected and so I'm just choosing my heart in this season it will be done in November and then I'll have another chance to choose a new season of hard and no matter what I always wish to be able to be with my wife be able to be with my kids be good at my job and to be good on stream and that's a lot of activity and very very hard and so that's my heart that's the that's the heart I've chosen today what does that look like later on what does that look like in a year I don't know but I'm enjoying this who's going to carry the boats who's going to carry the boats stay in shape it's good for you it makes makes you it makes you it makes you fast upstairs being in shape okay your body we're hylomorphic okay people that think you're actually a separated brain and a separated body are silly you're hylomorphic you are literally if you don't take care of your body you affect your mind if you don't take care of your mind you affect your body just stay together work together goodness gracious what type of heart do you want to have sexy and Rich and fit type of heart or broke Dusty and ugly type of heart because yes yes do you do you want to be broke Dusty and ugly is that what you want uh the pro I'm not sure about that Dusty part but I'm not going to lie to you when I was starting a company I was I was broke I was broke as this whole idea of the whole get rich and all that it's life is worth way more than money F you know honestly you know what's you know what's 10 times better than working hard at a job and that's all you ever do finding and marrying a person you love and then working hard in that relationship and it took me a long ass time to figure that out like a long ass time to figure out how much it's valuable to like value a marriage and I know right now like there's this whole red pill wave with marriage is terrible it's totally screws guys blah blah blah blah I forget that girl that's talking about it a whole bunch whatever her name was I saw a couple Clips um yeah I would say that there's a there's also a the the world's largest benefit on the other side you know what I mean and so choose your heart I'm choosing the hard of of loving my wife you know what I mean I'm choosing the hard of doing good at my
