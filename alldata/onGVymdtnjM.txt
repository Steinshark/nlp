I did it again I did it again I peed right in front of him again for those that don't know I don't have my well is broken people are working on my well right now and so I pee outside uh and I I don't look at the driveway for whatever reason I just walk out and pee and as I'm turning around fangling and jangling on my jeans the UPS guy's like hey good luck hey [Music] um anyways uh coding in the power point hey Carl how you doing nowadays everyone always wants whoa calm down this is coding in Powerpoint nowadays everyone always wants to fight over what the best code ID is Visual Studio visual code Adam Sublime Notepad the man's drinking a Monster energy drink okay you already know for a fact that you're in a bad spot okay when you're drinking a Monster energy drink you're in a bad spot you're just it's just not good okay it's just not good by the way they don't have Vim or neovim on this and I'm I'm exceptionally disappointed but they have an editor he put an editor on here that has been deprecated for like what four years now plus plus Picto chat Etch A Sketch the voices in my head we all act like we're better than each other because we use a different thing that lets us write on no um I am better than you because I use Vim an optimized garbage meanwhile you're Reinventing the wheel for the millionth time second message you'll never code anything meaningful in your life we should all be arguing over which rope is the best to hang ourselves with we're all just nerds arguing over a stupid program that highlights text that gives us cryptic error messages seriously what the hell is error c3640 I thought there was the Droid from Star Wars you want a good ide you want this guy's coming hot hot out of the gates right now okay I I was not I was not ready for this I didn't know what I was I didn't know what I was getting myself into okay I thought it was gonna be fun I feel bad about myself all of a sudden and now I kind of feel like I need to go buy nylon rope this is ridiculous the best IDE ever I'll [ __ ] give you the best diet I think it's so good that no one can ever argue again [Music] hey mix Morris this guy is pretty legendary [Music] this this is the highest low quality production I have ever seen in my lifetime this guy deserves a sub okay everybody go to a site give him a sub okay give them a sub give them a little thumbs up this is fantastic okay get give it to him right now I'm even gonna link you guys give it to him this is this is out of control okay thank you for putting the Monster Energy drink on here your life is clearly going downhill when you're drinking it but I will try to get this guy mix Morris okay hey mix Morris if you somehow are seeing this I want you to get on Twitch okay let's chat let's have a little let's have a little little little chat okay foreign [Music] what do you see here memories a business meeting a slideshow you did in public school quirky transitions no no this is a canvas look at this interface it's beautiful you can change the color of text you've got multiple slides formatting options with the added Trust of Microsoft you know that billion dollar Corporation owned by that guy who was good pals with Jeffrey Epstein let's get some responsibilities where do I even start you we all know Bill Gates was the one that put that we all know Bill Gates was the guy okay we all do all right the documentation [Music] by the way uh mix Morris uh can you upgrade your keyboard a little bit okay you look like you're playing on a 13 year old gamer keyboard okay A little Razer or something like that I don't know what you got but okay uh try to try you gotta spend a little bit more than thirteen dollars okay [Music] [Music] oh it's XML [Music] PP compiler beautiful ain't she uh there's only one problem you have to program in JavaScript because my dumb ass clicked the wrong one out of only two options [Music] ah C sharp that's more like it get your [ __ ] weekly typed languages out of here okay here's what I'm thinking we save every slide to its own different form the title of this slide can just be like the file name or something I don't I don't know I'm making this [ __ ] up as I go there's your code organization that's nice yeah it's clean it's clean and it's efficient and now we can Loop through all the slides Loop through all the text save it to a C plus plus file and try not to fall asleep as I monotonously explain this to you because software content is terrible and boring and mind-numbing now we don't actually need to you know I have found that if you release a video on YouTube that involves coding it's categorically worse than every other video okay people are always like dude why aren't you coding bar okay what you got what you do what do you want to put some more coding videos on okay I love when you do calling videos then you put it up and they're like I got something else to do I can't look at coding videos right now I can't look at this I got I I can't right hold our own compiler we just need to send the code to a compiler that already exists do you think Steve Jobs actually made the iPhone no we exploded Chinese people which in this case PowerPoint is our Steve Jobs and GCC is the underpaid Chinese workers yeah I know damn this guy he got him oh that's too good oh my goodness got him huh I hate that he works on Windows right now I'm just I just hate it [Music] yeah look at all that beautiful code hey that's not even using command or something like that oh there we go he's using command now yeah yeah stray three four two yep there's gonna be some magic variables in there unicode [Music] [Laughter] you know you always feel like you're gonna get this so easy and you're like oh yeah it's gonna be easy and then you're just like damn this is just worse and worse okay why the [ __ ] are the quotation marks question marks now Microsoft smart quote Microsoft some other adjustments you're going to want to make to get rid of Microsoft's terrible auto correcting you just turn all this [ __ ] off oh this [ __ ] this [ __ ] to turn off all this [ __ ] especially this [ __ ] it's not going to try and spell check your code or capitalize the first letter of every word it's going to leave you alone sad and alone all by yourself like everyone else in your life [Music] I like What's Happening Here uh I'm hoping that we get to see a really good program I I expect him to build a nice GUI in this PowerPoint program prove me wrong that is despair that is the look of despair oh gosh I hate your keyword oh gosh [Music] no you son of a blinking libraries yep okay so you know why would you ever I mean this is why we made cargo okay this is why we invented cargo and rust so you just execute cargo ad okay I don't want to have to think about all this crap oh you want P threads well guess look you better link bait threats oh you want math this programming language doesn't just do math okay you got a link apparently you just add the dash I and L Flags to g plus plus oh I love that the person who wrote this is lying I'm gonna find out where you live find your family rent a warehouse and [ __ ] that's [Music] nice I like the settings [Music] gosh okay it was literally just three flags and here I thought some programmer would have tried to over complicate the [ __ ] out of it [Music] oh we got we gotta work we gotta work on our volume been a lazy piece of [ __ ] and left it in this state because I have no motivation to do or accomplish anything in life but I thought how bad could it be to color text I mean it's an ID yeah it's the least I can do all right so there's three potential ideas idea number one we check each text box every frame to see if the character counts change and then if it has we can Loop through it and see if there's any keywords and then I like that or we can color those uh we check for some sort of callback or something and uh hopefully it'll give us the text box that has been typed into and then we can just Loop through it and check if there's any keywords and color it that way or okay option number three which I'm also very keen on uh give up like I always do you said I but I think I'm looking for some sort of callback if that fails we can just go to my bare bones implementation and if that fails option three's never let me down [Music] imagine somewhere slides imagine knowing this much about PowerPoint just imagine knowing this much about PowerPoint like you've had to read so much documentations at this point and like this is now you now know this much this is now your life you have this in your head and whatever was there before clearly got written over in your web memory okay maybe it was a memory from you when you're four years old you know maybe it was uh that feeling you get when you see your mom but instead now you have C sharp and PowerPoint API Get Wrecked election change this is exactly what we need okay so this is called when I change the slide this is called when I change the size of the text box but not the actual text itself I just don't think there's a callback for typing all right on to idea number two then okay before I do this how do I actually did you like that do you like do you love Microsoft style function naming application underscore slide slacks are changed button one underscore click nothing nothing like it generated names to you know give you that nice callback it's so beautiful um it's just so beautiful idea number two then okay before I do this how do I actually change the color oh great there's a question with no [ __ ] answer [Music] oh [ __ ] all right uh here's all the C plus plus keywords I'm familiar with I've organized I don't see the word mutable in there oh that's actually very responsive I thought it would like lag every time I type it's not I guess computers are just fast now God damn that's so cool I'm being and pissing and coming my pain okay it wasn't that bad I guess I could maybe try adding some more quality of life improvements like debugging why would I need a debugger if I don't make mistakes Version Control it's called control C control V and then you rename it something like 2.0 or backup or older as Dev J Cole ziskov oh what's that Intel I've actually have named all those files every last one of those has been a part of my personal Version Control as I was younger okay but sure I was programming Java applets uh learning my physics homework at the exact same time as I is learning Java so of course I made a little video game where I applied my kinematic physics year one to programming duh who didn't have backup.oldisense do you also want a Soother and a diaper and a milk bottle you [ __ ] baby the snake test okay yeah give it to give it to me girl [Music] all right all right yeah [Music] [Music] is this gonna end up as anything or is this just gonna be the greatest Montage of our lifetime just to end with nothing or is it actually gonna be snake are we gonna are we gonna see snake or are we not [Music] the editing is good [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] nice air box this air box is beautiful [Applause] [Music] for such a long Montage this is the longest Montage of my lifetime I need to know what's gonna should we just be done I'm fine being done with this if you guys are getting bored type one in the chat if you're bored we should we just go on should we just move on we don't need to see what actually happens right two two there's a lot of ones [Music] I'm I'm I love eating baguettes okay eating baguettes like that is so good okay there's nothing there is something about that that ripping the bread and dipping it in the butter is like the best okay not cutting the bread ripping the bread it's very important you rip you do not cut are those bullet points it was the man bullet point typing oh damn he is bullet point typing [Music] I just gotta see the game I just want to see the game [Music] look at that okay that is a piece of art right there okay this is [ __ ] art oh look at that huh I still want to argue but with the best dieting he is huh you think you're better than me you think you're [ __ ] better than me foreign sorry I uh get a little passionate sometimes at least we can all agree that Vim is a piece of [ __ ] what what no no Morris no Boris you can't can't do me like that oh my goodness the ending I watched a six minute Montage for you to end like that six minutes on the source code it's on my patreon please support the channel or it will die a painful and miserable death all right that's all I have to say uh it's 8 A.M I'm gonna go make a sandwich and go to bed patreon we'll link it okay if I remember if I didn't remember make a comment down below and say hey you need to remember to do that we'll link all of this stuff good video good job very very good he's off this guy this guy is this guy is quite talented
