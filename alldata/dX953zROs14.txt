hey guys so in this episode we're gonna be looking at the resume that got me into microsoft as a software engineer so this is actually the second part of another video where i discuss my very first software engineering resume the one that got me my very first software engineering job and if you go back and watch that one you'll find so many mistakes i talk about things that you're gonna see remedied in this version of it so you could do this by yourself you could apply to all the jobs you could do it six times like i did and you could determine what works and what doesn't work or you could just watch these videos and you can learn from my mistakes and i really hope that you do now my name is jason i'm a software engineer at microsoft like i said six-time intern across three countries so i've done this quite a lot and i've made a lot of mistakes along the way now if you get any value from this video i really hope you do i really want to hear about it so please subscribe hit that little bell icon hit the like button and leave a comment because i love hearing from you guys i want to learn about your resumes we're also going to be doing resume critique giveaways uh i think there's one open right now actually so i highly recommend you subscribe to learn about the next one or look at the channel and find the current one so um let's just jump right into it and let's find all the mistakes in my microsoft resume so i should put it up right here so you guys can see it now in this resume at least i have my personal information last time i i didn't put that on for some reason i split up my languages versus my technologies because um sometimes i see people put stuff like redux in the language section but it kind of makes you know it kind of makes you look like you don't know the difference between a framework and a language so split those two up it makes it easy for people to determine exactly if you have the skills they're looking for they can quickly say yeah he's got javascript and yeah he's got unix i want him i don't know why that they would want that combination but if they wanted to they could easily determine that right um i i should note that one person actually told me in my interview at microsoft that they loved the structure of this resume and what you'll find is having done so many internships white space becomes a scarcity like a very scarce resource you want to be able to pack as much as possible into this resume and one thing that you'll notice i've done here is i've bumped the font down and i think i've bumped it down too much because i have to zoom in to read any signif any actual part of this resume so i'll zoom in for you guys you can see it too but uh that was my very first mistake i would say um university of waterloo candidate for bachelor computer science currently completing last term scheduled to graduate in april 2019. that should be just one point there's no reason i need to listed this too received outstanding and excellent and all all five of my completed internships sure that's fine favorite course is okay favorite courses slash relevant courses try to keep it limited to three when you try to put a bunch of all the courses you've taken in the relevant courses it drowns out the important ones so i've seen people put software engineering 1 software engineering 2 object-oriented programming 1 object-oriented programming 2. those are not going to set you apart from anyone and then maybe they have machine learning at the very end well guess what machining learning on its own is more significant than all of the generic courses so it's going to drown out the important stuff just put the ones that you particularly like the ones you're particularly proud of for me that that was those three courses all right let's let's jump there's too many points here by the way uh under the university of waterloo section that's too many points um i should really cut that down to one one or two points also something i'm noticing now is that the education experience and project sections um you know they could be they could be separated a bit better you'll see in the last resume that i kind of had this this different color for the different sections which makes them pop a little bit more um so that would be a little bit nice here but this does the trick so very first one back in developer toast dublin that's the internship i was currently on when i applied to microsoft so first thing i noticed here is it looks kind of ugly because there's bullet points but then some of the bullet points have to wrap around and they're on the very same indentation of as the other bullet points that's ugly it's difficult to read i don't know why i did that finished last work item returning to toast working with gift cards and loyalty team in the dublin office worked closely with a small team using java play and sql developed a rest api that provides rewards information about customers and allows them to redeem reverse these transactions all right so what i said here was where i worked what i worked with what i did that is is not great because if you look at one of my other videos where i discuss what you want to put on your resume what you did and you know the languages that you used and what was the impact of it now you'll see in my my last resume my current one that i'll show you later that i actually do slap a number on how many people use that right now so keep that in mind okay front end developer yahoo mail sunnyvale california wrote and maintained front end code using rack react and redux on yahoo mail developed suggested searches recent searches and more when user clicks or types in the search box provided at the top of the screen touching around 15 percent of yahoo mail users wow that is a mouthful the only like really important part of that is at the end touching around 15 percent of yahoo mail users and anyone reading this point will have got exhausted by the time they get to that that should be its own bullet point that should really pop out 15 yahoo mail users is actually a lot of users you'd be surprised so i could make that way more concise i don't have to say exactly when this feature is engaged when user clicks or types in the search box provided at the top of the screen wow that is a mouthful um there's no reason it needs to be that long i really should make it more concise collaborated with ux designers and product leads to refine designs before implementing them all right that's fine i talked a little bit about you know i can talk about that in the res in the interview which is something that i like um some of those collaborations designed ui and unit tests for new features sure everyone needs to talk about their unit tests uh i probably should have discussed the framework i used for the test also and i should have maybe could even use the buzzword there talk about test driven development and how i wrote the test first that probably would have made it look a bit better implemented persistent notification that informs users if they have email forwarding enabled and settings page that allows them to disable it uh so much so wordy so many words that's probably something you'll notice throughout this entire resume is it's just so wordy try to cut it down and get to the point already because the average person the average recruiter will only look at your resume for six seconds so they're not gonna absorb what you want them to absorb if you talk too much and that's what i'm doing here so this thing for example implemented persistent notification that informs users blah blah blah blah this could be knocked down to you know what i actually think that i show you exactly what i knock this down to in my next resume so i won't spoil it full stack software developer toast inc boston i should pause and say one thing that i do like about this is that all of my job titles at all of these companies were software engineer intern and i kind of bent the truth a little bit to describe a little bit better what i actually did there front end developer full stack software developer it wasn't technically my job title but if i am trying to hire a full stack software developer i can easily tell that this is the the job i should be most interested in worked individually and as part of a team to develop large features that defec that directly affected real customers all right there's no substance to that though like what features how many customers developed in angularjs on the front end and java play on the back end all right i'm telling you what i used that's fine developed ability to learn quickly by familiarizing myself with both frameworks and having code in production shortly after arriving again very very wordy way of saying that i'm a quick learner regularly contributed and collaborated ideas with developers qas ux designers you'll see something here i'm trying to show is that i'm a team player and i can be involved in conversations and i'm not the person that you just put off in the corner like the you know the other interns you just put in the corner and say here shut up do your project i'm very involved with the rest of the team i collaborate that's something i'm trying to get across debugged highest priority blocking bugs and released fixes in a timely manner yeah i could talk about you know working under stress and stuff or or maybe being on call but um that does the trick that's fine i use the same words quite a bit you know developed developed collaborated debugged uh implemented there are probably better if you can come up with different words action words to start things off with to start the bullet points off with um i recommend doing it i'm just not very creative bluetooth software developer blackberry okay so i learned bluetooth protocol and profiles with emphasis on message access profile nobody knows what that means just so you know like why would anyone that's not familiar with bluetooth understand anything about that i should have grounded that a bit more and said this is the port the part of bluetooth i worked on it was actually the part that sends um notifications from your phone to your car if you plug your car in and it the message shows up on your car i should have just said that or i should have talked a little bit about something everyone can relate to integrated a new bluetooth sdk into the map profile and remove dependency on a deprecated one again that doesn't help me know anything maybe i should have talked about how i had to read documentation because that's something that software engineers do all the time developed an android app on my own initiative for internal use that would add a picture to all contact profiles used for testing purposes yeah i like talking about developing stuff on your own initiative but you know it gets a bit wordy right like i i could have just talked about how i developed an android app but i went on a little bit but let's just say for for you know all intents and purposes that was fine and last but not least i've got one project at the end here and it's a smart mirror so you'll notice that there's a little inconsistency here because every single job i have has bullet points under it and my project does not now the reason for that is because i ran out of space but having read through it there's a bunch of stuff i could have cut out of this smart mirror smart mirror is a python project i built individually intended to be run on a raspberry pi mirror contains a persistent visual ui blah blah blah blah blah blah very wordy no link that's no good so you know next time try to put a link in make sure people can click right on it and get right here uh right to your project okay so that was my the the resume that got me into microsoft now as you'll see it's just riddled with problems right there's a lot of things i could have fixed about it and i will make sure to show you all of those things exactly in the next video because this one's getting long too so visit that next video and watch what my resume looks like right now with all of those learnings
