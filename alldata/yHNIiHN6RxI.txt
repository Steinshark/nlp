i thought for starting the lightning talks and celebrating the two years i say a bit about what what we did in the last two years and have a little look out into the future so today meaning c plus plus online is you know as you know it and two years ago we started this to explore things in the online world um and i'm kind of happy that today we do have almost 2 300 members so when this group started um it was important uh as a playground to meeting seatbelts plus to see what works and from the beginning i wanted to see if we could do more than talks where just somebody gives a talk and we ask them some questions and then that's it um so that is like how the affairs got born and um the event in may which was speaking about cpas plus uh which i organized which actually featured lightning talks but was like a closed event so you couldn't like submit linux talks to it um made kind of for me the knowledge available that we could do lightning talks that we have the technical setup to do it and so hence we do it um now in the group and i don't know how often we do it um but we'll do it often enough to to have a few runs so probably like twice twice a year that would be good um and yeah we started on ramo and raymo had this particular feature that it has two states where a meetup runs them and the first state is what you see is basically break state where people sit on tables and talk and then the software will you know give you a countdown for 30 seconds and then you will transition to the second mode where you see the talk and i started wondering um if we could utilize remo for something else which would not feature a talk if we could utilize these tables for events and that's how the fares basically got born today is a job fair and also uh book and tool fair which i'm gonna talk about in a second and last year when i looked for valid replacement for remo i got to see ubilo and in the end uh we're hosting on hobito and i can tell you already the next year the third year which we're now having will also be on hobido and today and tomorrow are actually the last two events which are on the wood contract um and our track record for the two years is pretty good we have over 50 online events but you know some some other things count as two events on meetup um like the job fairs and there's also the conferences from last time this year and 2020 and i mean meeting embedded etc so less some some things more but that's that's a good run and there's like in uh september we have seven events and i might even like be uh looking into having having currently we don't have an event on the last week and maybe i have an event which is either in the in the last week in september or the first week of october i have to see if that works out um and the fairs are a great success but they are also a lot of work so i'm always looking for people to wanting to join and you know be a company that employs people and is at the fair has a conversation with the folks coming to the fair and also you know receives for that effort a lot of cvs and resumes and same as when you have like a tool or when you have a book uh which or an open source project which is related to c plus bus then um you can have a table in the lounge for yourself on the book and tool fair and basically have this folks come to your table and you can have a conversation about your tool or just anything else um and a quick overview on what i plan for the future um we do not have cppcast anymore so i would like to offer an alternative not like cp because i cannot replace cpu because but i would like to make armas and armor stands for usb anything in a recorded version available that we meet with somebody in ubilo and record the session in the rooms and um simply have them you know answer our questions and have the conversation then later on youtube for everyone else to see um tomorrow is something new community planning session is something where i got into when i was looking like hey how did we get started what did i do 10 years ago because 10 years is now also for reading cps plus and i kind of found a news entry about a community planning session which we did at the beginning and i was like it's actually kind of good idea and so i thought well if that worked you know 10 years ago we have no means to do that again uh just back then it was an irc now maybe not not use rc anymore um so it will be in hobilo uh kind of using today's event uh again and of course also something i found this year houses um as you know means the bus bus is my main job that i want to use the tooling which i use for the user group and the user group itself and some of the other things i've built was really super plus a bit more for promotion to actually uh have uh also like the styling and supersports event be more targeted towards people that actually want to hire folks and our recruiters or job leads or team leads in their companies so that i can win them to have a starting corporation on the job fair with me suppose plus and then i want to mention sponsorships which is something i would not have mentioned if i wouldn't have a sponsor for the first time in two years for the events next week next week is our regular uh meet up for september with a talk from johann von stembroke and which by the way he's here so if he hangs around maybe you know can ask him about that if you're interested in co routines but that also is sponsored by undo and i'm very happy to you know be able to get a little bit of funding through them uh for the things i do here um and so the next events next week we have the uh regular meeting which i just mentioned but we have also the book on tool fair which is also again as you can see um attended by undo but also by the author of beautiful secrets which this guy for sure and um not sure if um kate has time maybe kate comes around maybe we'll see um then yeah the hiring and z plus plus i i do that this time in linkedin and that's also kind of a new experiment to see how that works and continue to be used and utilized as a platform um and the online cpus bus job fair um will be in september as already mentioned all right tomorrow we have a community planning session which is actually targeted at folks who want to organize or reorganize things in the community and for example use the groups and i i currently think about starting a learning group where you can uh have a membership in and um have weekly meetings where we then discuss things for c plus and i've just uh you know dug through my old teaching materials which are all in german and i have to kind of translate them to english and update them because they are quite old and then i probably will provide some learning materials and provide the space for the debates and um also kind of make this a group which focuses on the needs of the ones which then are members and will openly debate like where do we want to go with that um and that might be based on patreon i probably also will offer the billing through my website because it's always the way like you know companies should pay that for their employers uh for employees um but we'll see that's that's something which is gonna be something new and that is all the thoughts i have on those two years and um yes i plan to carry the online events forward as long as it makes sense as long as people are showing up and i think that we will have a fabulous uh time in winter and we probably always will have a fabulous time in winter and the summers will be free which is nice also for me um but now you see that september october and november we will have a lot of events and i hope to see you at one of those many of those thank you for listening
