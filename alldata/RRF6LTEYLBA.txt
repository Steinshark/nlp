[Music] super punch out has garnered a reputation as one of the most random speed runs out there of course there's still a broad skill set needed precise timing quick reactions and an ability to adapt on the fly but even when you do everything right a fighter can throw the run in the garbage whenever he pleases how do you deal with that much randomness in the speedrun well the world record holders in super punch out have figured out a way and over the past decade they've been able to beat it and drive the record down lower and lower this is the history of super punch-out world records [Music] here's a timeline of the super punch out single segment record it's not filled in yet but we'll get it there a single segment run is essentially playing through the whole game and adding up the in-game time of all fights there are 16 boxers in super punch-out divided into four circuits so a single segment run consists of the total time of all 16 fights now super punch out is a bit different than runs i've covered before it is quite literally a gauntlet of rng you have to make it through all 16 fights relatively unscathed from bad luck to complete a good run the fights range from non-random to can kill your run with one foul swoop and of course you have to execute on top of that if you get good luck but make an execution mistake your run may be over interestingly the strategies themselves haven't changed that much over the years instead the progression has come from improving execution and getting the rng gauntlet to better align and believe me it is made for some unbelievable stories over the years but for now let's go back to december 2012 when a runner completed one of the earliest single segment runs of super punch out he's arguably the most well-known punch-out runner in the world today but back then he was relatively unknown his name is zallard1 zallard performed his run on christmas eve 2012 his first completed single segment run which also happened to be the world record right off the bat you've got two types of fights in super punch-out the random ones and the non-random ones the non-random fights tend to be toward the start of the game like the first fight gabby j zord started by repeatedly punching him in the face these punches were all buffered meaning as soon as one was thrown he held the buttons for the next so it would come out on the first frame possible these face punches served two purposes first they helped fill the super meter seen here at the bottom of the screen once filled you can throw super punches that do more damage and second they helped fill the dizzy meter a mechanic abused across all 16 fights in the game if you punch an opponent a lot in a short period of time an invisible dizzy meter starts to get filled do this enough and they'll become dizzy and back away by precisely timing a punch when they come back they'll get knocked down instantly this is used across the run to score quick knockdowns and leads to most opponents being beaten in just seconds finally there was one last step to this fight a dizzy opponent has that window where they can instantly be knocked down however this window can be quite small and it's easy for even a world-class player to miss fortunately zallard invented a way around that buffer strategies by chaining a series of inputs together it's possible to waste the exact number of frames you want so an attack will land on the same frame every time for example let's say gabby j's knockdown window is between 120 and 129 frames after the dizzy begins well it just so happens that a full duck a right body punch and a high super waste exactly 120 frames so if you just buffer those inputs together making each come out on the first frame possible the super comes out at the perfect time to knock them down buffers like this exist on every fight in the game and help make the disney knockdowns much more consistent non-random fights like gabby j are usually pretty simple but the difficulty level ramps up as the game goes on take aaron ryan the ninth fight the first knockdown is from a dizzy but when he gets up you have to precisely time a super to counter his attack and send him down again zahler didn't have a buffer to time it but he nailed it to send him down for the ko [Music] those fights are non-random or close to it others include piston hurricane mr sandman and jk kagero you get them dizzy and use a buffer to knock them down some have tough punches that have to be timed while others are even simpler that's the gist of the non-random fights but then there are the random fights these are the fights that more or less define super punch out as a speed game not only do you need to execute properly that's a given but you also need to deal with luck luck that can range from a golden opportunity to potentially killing a run take dragon chan the sixth fight in the game the first phase of the fight up until the first knockdown is simple you throw a sequence of gut punches most with a slight delay before them then use a buffer sequence to send him down phase two once he's up from the first knockdown is where the randomness begins there are three things dragon shan can do here fifty percent of the time he does kicks where you have to just dodge out of the way then use rapid punches to send him down at around 12 seconds 25 percent of the time he does a slow heal where he stands still and tries to heal his health two supers send him down and you get a time in the high nine second range and 25 percent of the time he does a fast heal where using just one super gives a time in the high sevens that's a range of more than four seconds for one fight given that boxers are beaten in 15 seconds or less that's a massive time swing and dragon chan is just one example zallard had to deal with luck like this on more than half the fights in the game but we'll get to that later for now the sum of his 16 fights came out to 3 minutes and 10 seconds it was a well executed run and had a range of good and bad luck over the following few weeks in 2013 zallard would keep doing attempts and chipping away at the record he took it lower into the threes approaching the sub 3 barrier but falling just short however on march 19th thanks to a couple fights in particular zallard had a very promising run this is bob charlie he's a gauntlet of rng and being the fifth fight in the game he's the earliest boxer who can kill a run from randomness alone zalard went for the riskiest strategy on bob which involves hitting him seven times in the face to get him dizzy however he can randomly dodge any of these seven punches meaning you have to do an additional punch later on to make up for it he can also dodge that punch so to get the fastest time on bob with this strategy all seven of your punches need to go through and the super in phase 2 needs to as well it can lead to a time in the 5 second range however every dodged punch loses a second and a half one dodge isn't too bad but 2 or three or four dodges your time can spiral in a hurry luckily for zallard on this particular run bob only dodged once so he moved on with a very solid 6.99 unfortunately dragon chan gave kicks so he failed to gain much time there but thanks to some very solid execution down the stretch xallard was able to keep it close going into the special circuit and it was there he had to face off against hoy carlo hoy is absolutely brutal he's extremely random and he's the third to last fight in the game not an opportune time for a bunch of rng a lot of the first phase of the fight is playing it by ear you want to throw punches and hit him with supers to get him dizzy of course he can randomly block you duck under punches and potentially shove you to the side if he shoves it destroys your dizzy meter and can kill your run instantly in phases two and three you need to throw supers to knock him down twice more he can randomly duck under these each duck loses about a second and a half or potentially more depending on his next moves now in theory if you play it risky and get no blocks shoves or ducks you can beat hoy in eight seconds but good luck with that the odds in getting it were less than two percent a 10 to 12 second hoy is very solid but it can get ugly quickly if he shoves in phase 1 it can be impossible to beat him in under 20 seconds as you can imagine it's awful to have to deal with this at the end of the run but this time zallard got some luck an 11 second hoy with no ducks it put him ahead and he never looked back a 254 single segment run fantastic execution great luck and sub 3 by a mile in the description zallard could only manage one word of analysis what with the record being well below three minutes zallard would take a break from super punch-out runs he was the only runner in sight of the record months passed and his 254 was just solidified at the top but as good as that 254 was zallard knew he could still squeeze a bit more time out of it and with all the randomness across the game in theory the record could come under 250. so in early 2014 he hopped back on and started doing attempts on january 23rd he had a run with an okay start two dodges from bob charlie and some mistakes that put him slightly further behind on hoy he got a solid 12 second fight with no ducks but some bad luck at the end brought the run back to nearly even in the end zallard technically did have himself a new record just weeks later he chipped away a bit more he had a reasonable pace into the special circuit with time to save however he still had to get through ahoy one two dick three dodges not exactly ideal even so with time to save at the end zallard was able to do it again [ __ ] yeah another third of a second now these records were nice and all but they weren't exactly setting the world on fire in all zallard had lowered the record by .75 seconds he knew he could do more he continued with attempts and weeks passed but the game's killer randomness prevented any other records it was starting to get very frustrating and then came february 27th 2014. [Music] this was an incredible chance for zallard luck had finally gone his way his execution had been on point from start to finish more than four seconds ahead of the record this was a rare opportunity to jump straight to the 240s but in his way was one more fight the last fight in the game and this one was gonna be tough nick bruiser nick bruiser is the most difficult fight in the run by a long shot just as with other fights your goal is to get nick dizzy and time a super to knock him down the best way to get him dizzy is to counter him then jab him out until the meter is filled and he backs away seems simple right well there's one extra consideration to make nick can throw his punch either high or low there's a 50 chance of each so you start the fight with two face punches and then you have to react to which punch he sets up to throw if nick drops his gloves down he's throwing low and you counter with a body punch if instead he brings them up high you counter with a face punch the window to react to this is just barely within the limits of a human reaction time you have to see if his gloves are high or low then send the signal to your hands to throw higher low in time before nick punches you if you're playing with any input delay this is practically impossible the only way to have a real chance is to play on console with a crt tv now imagine having to do that at the very end of a record paced run after all the insane rng from the first 15 fights the pressure you're under in a situation like this is enormous nick can also switch his guard part way through starting with his gloves high and bringing them low or vice versa you have to react if he does that and finally if you do everything properly in phase one well congratulations you have to do the exact same thing in phase two unless he randomly blocks you in which case you have to get lucky and hope he lets you land two supers in a row so zallard entered nick bruiser four seconds ahead of the record if he was gonna pull this off he had to execute the most difficult strategy in the game on one of the best paces he had ever been on just don't mess up you gotta be [ __ ] kidding me not only did he hit the counter but he did so on the first frame possible a frame perfect counter speeds up phase 1 by a fraction of a second and allows for some wiggle room later on one more phase and the sub 250 would be his oh please stay down stay down you [ __ ] yes yes [ __ ] yes dude get [ __ ] super punch out super punch out had just been taken to a new level a sub 250 was zallard's ultimate goal and in dramatic fashion he had done it with nobody close to him on the leaderboards he felt safe to stop running the game mission accomplished [Music] heartbreaking nick threw his punch up but zallard missed the counter it was on pace for a mind-boggling 240 with two fights to go and a 243 into nick this wouldn't have beaten the record it would have obliterated it unfortunately landing counters on nick under pressure is one of the hardest things you can do and this time it was just too much for him but what this run did do was prove how much time was still left to save he saved almost 7 seconds combined on bob charlie and dragon chan with just one dodge and the fast heel respectively there was also some time to save on hoy getting a time around 10 seconds was reasonable the real problem was getting all that to line up then landing counters on nick knowing what you're about to possibly do but the potential was there if not for a 240 then maybe for something more reasonable on june 3rd 2015 zallard had a run that saved the seven seconds early but unfortunately he lost most of that time on mad clown clown is yet another point of severe rng in the run there's a lot that goes into it but a lot of what to look for is what happens right at the start you begin by throwing two face punches and hoping they both land if they do you're in good shape for later if he dodges you're losing about a second but if he blocks you lose time there and in phase two since he gets a bigger health refill if both punches land to start the fight you can beat clown in as low as 9 seconds that's the best case scenario an average standard mad clown fight is in the 12 second range however if he really wants to screw around it can get much worse and on this particular run clown wasn't playing nice and zallard missed the counter to waste a few seconds a 16 on clown is pretty rough and most of his lead was eliminated but an 11 on hoy in a good nick fight was enough for a solid record wow dude for real for real dude just a few days later zallard would follow this up with another record a 244. it was a nice time but a frustrating run of give and take he got a five on bob but it was immediately followed up with kicks on dragon chan he gained several seconds on clown but lost a few on hoy but really he was fortunate to get what he did in super punch out every fight from mad clown onwards can kill your run just from luck alone that's six luck gauntlets in a row you have to get through if one fails you might have to reset the game can take an incredible pace and make it look like dirt before you realize what happened take this run june 10th 2015. everything was going right zallard had managed a 5 on bob charlie a 7 on dragon chan from the low heel and a reasonable 13 on mad clown he was three and a half seconds ahead with more time to save later he just had to make it through the next few fights this is super macho man the last fight in the world circuit zallard's phase one strategy at the time was simple start with a gut punch then counter him a couple times throw a couple supers and knock him down in the upper six second range macho can mess things up if he dances around but more often than not you should be good for a knockdown in the upper 6's however this fight takes a turn in phase 2. you can get macho to stay down for the second knockdown but only if this knockdown comes within the following 3 seconds after the first knockdown so in this scenario if your second knockdown comes at 7 8 or 9 seconds macho will stay down for a ko if it comes at 10 seconds or later he'll get up and you'll have to knock him down a third time this mechanic is carried across many fights in the game so zallard had to go for a very quick knockdown in phase two he had to throw a low super counter in the gut then knock him down with another low super if macho moves around at the start this strategy doesn't work if macho does any of his 3 exercise programs this strategy doesn't work the only way it works is if macho stands perfectly still for the whole phase it's possible but not very likely so what did macho do this time it's what i thought he lost more than seven seconds a brutal blow but the run was still technically alive next up however was narcissus prince the most random fight in the entire game honestly there's too many different things this guy can do to explain here he can randomly block you dodge you give many different patterns and much more but he has the same ko mechanic as macho or if your second knockdown is within three seconds of your first he typically stays down for good with maximum cooperation it's possible to beat narcissus in the 10 to 11 second range but there's so much that can go wrong anything under 15 seconds was considered a pretty good fight but if narcissus wants to waste time he can make the ko impossible and essentially kill the run and what sort of fight do you think he gave zallard on this run nice good [ __ ] nurses you're so good let's see here what is that 2173 12 seconds nope run over a small mistake plus a lot of bad luck in just two fights one of zallard's best paces ever was completely destroyed he had just lost 16 seconds largely due to no fault of his own because you see super punch out does not care about the runner it doesn't care what pace you're on it doesn't care how badly you want the record it doesn't care how well you're playing it can take away your run whenever it feels you can be on the run of your life execute everything perfectly but if you get bad luck it's game over and there's not a damn thing you can do about it [Music] so 244 was where the record stayed more months went by with no improvements in sight interestingly in august 2015 a second person managed a sub 3 when hootie pulled off a 253 but he was far from the record still zalard at least had a little bit of competition now in september zahler did shave off another couple tenths of a second but this wasn't the multiple second improvement he knew was possible but on september 30th he was gonna have a chance a second behind the record with six fights to go zallard entered mad clown needing a good fight he ended up with an 11 easily good enough on macho he got the good luck for a 10 second fight narcissus didn't mess around too much and he was able to get the ko at 11 seconds suddenly zallard was back in the lead well then next up was hoy who we know can be just awful but he got no ducks in phases two or three yet another 11 second fight and zallard was two seconds ahead with two fights to go this run was on pace for a 241 the type of run zallard had been looking for for years but there's one fight i haven't told you about yet because nick bruiser has a twin brother that comes right before him this is rick bruiser rick is a really straightforward fight there's no luck involved for the first two phases and the execution isn't too hard either you get him dizzy in phase one then use counters and supers in phase two that stuff's fine but then there's phase three the entire fight is made or broken on the first punch of this phase if this high super lands you'll finish the fight at 11 seconds if it doesn't you're getting a 16 or in rare cases of 14 but more often than not it's a 16. that's a 5 second difference enormous for a game like this [Music] 5 8 of the time the super lands 3 8 of the time it does not that's all there is to it a little over half the time rick bruiser will let you through but three times out of eight he will destroy your run so zallard entered the fight two seconds ahead a huge opportunity but he had the threat of a massive time loss hanging over his head and what did rick bruiser do well it's super punch out late on record pace what do you think rick did [Music] no mercy 244 is where the record would have to stay zallard took a break for a few months but still there was no real threat to his record hoodie was still the second place runner nearly 10 seconds behind so in early 2016 zallard came back for more praying he could get the last few seconds within his grasp on april 14th he had a run slightly behind with four fights to go he had time to save against the 14th narcissus split and managed a 13. hoy was another fight with time to save and once again he squeezed out a second so zallard was ahead going into rick bruiser if he would just stand still and take the uppercut he was gonna have a shot at the record he needed the 5 8 luck we got it and he got it zallard was now two nick counters away from a world record yes yes yes yes finally zallard had lowered the record this wasn't the god run he was looking for dragon chan gave kicks clown gave a 12 and the special circuit could have been better but it was still a 243 after this run zallard took a step back not only from super punch out but from speed running as a whole for a year and a half he didn't do any runs giving other runners a serious opportunity to step in and take the record but nobody did zallard remained at the top unchallenged with the closest player still being hoodie it's quite rare to have records undisputed for this long but zallard's mastery of the game was far ahead of anyone else's finally 18 months after his 243 he went back to attempts it was hard to expect a record right away since it had been so long since his last attempts it took some time to get back into it but he eventually started getting runs deep still nothing good enough for a record but all of a sudden on november 29th 2017 zallard found himself on this run [Music] this is kind of stupid dude if i get the kick there there's no way i'm getting like oh dude [Music] no [ __ ] way dude no [ __ ] way what is this what is this [ __ ] [Music] all right rick could totally [ __ ] dodge me and it could still be okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [ __ ] dude [Music] one of the toughest things to do in speedrunning is executing under pressure super punch out may be known for its randomness but even when the luck aligns you still have to execute and if you don't you're gonna get punished fortunately after years of running the game zallard had become quite resilient and a few months later he had another run ahead into the special circuit albeit not quite as far ahead but suddenly after managing a 10 on hoy the pace became much more serious a six second lead late in the run just two fights to go a huge chance for redemption wanna guess what rick did in phase three of course still he led by about a second and hit the counters on nick for a small record [Music] that's it it wasn't what it could have been but a 242 was still progress made and on april 26th he'd make even more progress a 240.36 cutting off nearly two seconds this was the biggest improvement he had made to the record in nearly three years but at the end of the run zahler didn't sound too happy about it give me the unwinnable luck here please please god [ __ ] damn it dude dude are you kidding why was that well despite the improvement this run could have been a lot better on mr sandman he mistimed a high super to lose two seconds and on hoy he lost over a second and a half from a mistimed low super had he not made those errors this run would have finished at an incredible 236 but mistakes were made and the result was a frustrating world record take a look at this timeline this was all zallard he had set 16 records over the course of five and a half years this sort of thing is very rarely seen in speedrunning a runner can sometimes dominate for a few years but for it to continue for this long was pretty special zallard had eyes for a run in the 230s but 240 was a seriously good time and it was gonna have to be good enough as zallard slowly stopped playing and didn't run the game for months his 240 remained at the top unchallenged but suddenly in 2019 the unthinkable happened a new contender began rising up the leaderboards he became the second player to get a time under 250 and suddenly he was just five seconds from the record and he was gonna try to do something nobody else had done before become the first super punch-out single segment record holder not named zalard1 his name was mystery man 95 mystery man was a seasoned veteran in the punch out series running mike tyson's punch out and holding the record in punch out wii these games all require precise timing and rhythm so it's no wonder he was able to adapt so easily but there's one other thing to keep in mind about mystery man he played on wii u virtual console meaning he had a few frames of input delay remember how you have to react to nick bruiser's guard that's effectively impossible with input delay so mystery man had to just guess where nick's guard would be and not react this added a huge luck barrier to the end of the game he'd usually have to correctly guess a 50-50 guard position twice in a row once in phase one and once in phase two he'd need to do that to have any shot at beating zalar's record fortunately mystery man had some strategies to help on other fights one was on bob charlie the old strategy involved seven punches in phase one where bob could dodge any of them instead he countered bob on the fifth one and did the rest while stunning him this cost about a second but made it so that bob could now only dodge the first four punches rather than all seven he also did something different on macho by delaying phase 1 slightly to get the knockdown at a 7 instead of a 6 the ko window shifted up to 10 seconds instead of 9. you could then delay the first punch of phase 2 so that it intercepts if macho hops to the side making a ko possible in more situations these strategies were both developed by chambers and zallard did use them for his last few records but not the majority of them and houdi had figured out something additional on macho ducking into a left jab right jab to start phase one to counter macho if he dances at the start so mystery man had a chance to really put these strats to use and see what he could do and in august 2019 with his personal best at 2 45 he was going to try to close the gap on one attempt [Music] fight [Music] [Music] fight [Music] there was a new king of super punch out and he had done it by a mile mystery man himself didn't see this coming a 236 demolished the record the most incredible part of this run was the special circuit it set a new standard a 12 on narcissus was a solid start but a 9 on hoy was incredible he had a perfect phase one and just one duck in phase two rick took the uppercut in phase three and he landed both counters on nick these were the types of special circuits you needed for a world record you need great luck and no mistakes and despite the input delay despite the massive odds against him mystery man had pulled it off at the end of a run for the first time ever the record didn't belong to zalard1 mystery man had ushered in a new era of super punch-out speedrunning as slowly the leaderboard began to expand with more people attaining sub threes this was the type of competition super punch out had been missing for the last several years by mid 2020 there were seven runners with a time below three minutes one of those people was known as stock stock had a similar path to mystery man slowly lowering his personal best before settling on a 245. this meant he was stolen nine seconds from the record but in august 2020 he would find himself on a remarkable pace 10 seconds ahead of his personal best and a second ahead of the record going into rick bruiser this was a 235 pace and he was in position to take the record he just needed rick to stand still in phase 3. he did not but thanks to his huge lead stock still finished with a 239 the second sub 240 ever achieved entering 2021 mystery man's world record was still on top but the community was ever expanding by february two more players had achieved times in the low 240s cranklinson and mr mega and the top of the leaderboard was getting quite crowded it seemed inevitable that someone was gonna break through and on february 26th cranklinson was gonna have a shot at it he fell behind early thanks to a dodge from bob and the slow heal on dragon chan but from there everything got better a 9 on clown a 10 on macho and a 9 on narcissus 3 essentially perfect splits in a row a 10 on hoy was easily good enough and rick took the uppercut he was about a second ahead of the record going into nick bruiser but here's the thing just like mystery man cranklinson played on wii u virtual console so he too had to guess on both of nick's counters the odds were stacked against him but all he could do was try new world record 235.68 franklin said had about as close to a perfect second half as possible specifically these three fights were impossible to gain time on at least with the strategies he was using the major circuit lost him some time but when combined with the incredible second half it was easily good enough for a record as 2021 continued the leaderboards became more and more active by may six people had a time in the 230s as incredible as zallard's dominance was he was now in seventh place the level of luck you needed for a world record run was rapidly increasing if you got a 12 on narcissus that suddenly didn't look so good compared to the 9 that was in the record a few new strategies were worked out particularly on narcissus but the biggest one was on hoy cranklands had figured out a new phase 1 that would ultimately give a higher chance for the 8 second tko those fights would be crucial as the record was approaching the low 230s in mid-2021 players murakuma mr mega universe and fat potato seal would all have runs make it to the final two fights on record pace sadly in murakuma's case he made a mistake on rick and for the rest they lost the run to nick bruiser especially at the end of a run it was really hard to get everything to align but players knew there was a little more they could get out of this run with several people at the top trying they knew that the god run could happen a run where everything lines up but the odds in a run like this were getting very low at this point likely one in several hundred was anybody gonna take it below 235 on september 3rd 2021 mr mega was doing some record attempts and he suddenly found himself on an incredible pace a 6 on bob followed by a 7 on dragon chan and a 7 on masked muscle 3 fights in a row with perfect rng so far this was essentially a perfect run he lost a bit over a second thanks to a 10 on clown and got a 12 on narcissus but he could easily afford it on this pace a little over a second ahead going into hoy now more than ever he needed a good fight [Music] and eight is a perfect time for hoy rick bruiser led his super through and mr mega was three and a half seconds ahead into nick bruiser this wasn't just world record pace this was destroy the world record pace if there was ever a time to execute on nick bruiser this was it no pressure [Music] first counter [Music] world record record dude are you [ __ ] serious a huge world record from mr mega he had just shot himself from fifth to first place this was the time the community had been looking for for all these years a run in the low 230s good luck nearly everywhere and nailing it down on nick bruiser it wasn't perfect but the opportunities for time saves were extremely limited super punch out had finally gotten the run it deserved and that's where this video would end that's where the story would end but it doesn't look i don't switch to first person narration often but i don't really have words to adequately describe what happened next because eight days after mr mega set this record fat potato seal did one of the craziest things i've ever seen on screen is the running total of the odds of the run fat potato seal was on he answered the first major luck barrier in the game bob charlie and ended up getting a six a perfect fight with no dodges or blocks he then fought dragon shan and once again got perfect luck with the low heel masked muscle also gave the best luck possible he had gotten perfect luck through the first half of the game he moved to the second half on mad clown he got a nine second fight the best possible luck on macho he got the ko at 10 seconds the best possible luck on narcissus he got a 9 second ko technically a high 8 is possible but a low 9 is essentially the best possible luck on hoy he got an 8 second tko the best possible luck then it was time for rick and his random uppercut in phase three and yes he got the best possible luck i've been making these videos for five years and this run i genuinely don't remember seeing anything like this in any other game other than half a second from narcissus on every single fight with significant rng swing he had just gotten perfect luck with his strategies not good luck not great luck perfect luck fat potato seal was on a 227 pace into nick bruiser just imagine the pressure in a situation like this knowing this is a once in a lifetime opportunity your hands start to go numb you feel your heart beating in your throat basic tasks become nearly impossible and landing counters on nick bruiser is anything but a basic task but he might never see this piece again in his life fight [Music] [Applause] [Music] pizza cake right on [Music] it's hard to expect anyone to have actually pulled it off at the end of this run even fat potato seal one of the best players in the world this situation he was in was unprecedented and might not be seen again for months years or even longer but still it's a heartbreaking feeling it just goes to show even when super punch out does give you the luck it can still punch you right in the face over the years we've seen all sorts of world records ones that seemed like they had no chance ones that were on monster paces and everything in between this runs history isn't over yet and this timeline isn't yet complete we're just living in a moment of super punch-out's history and there's still plenty of history left to go thanks for watching [Music] if you
