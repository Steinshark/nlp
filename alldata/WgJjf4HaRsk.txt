ever since my video about tether and june which is a cryptocurrency company worth 60 billion dollars and growing i've been trying to do one of two things to expose them as frauds or prove that they've turned legit i feel i have to after all if you believe something this big might be a fraud you owe it to people to try to find out for sure so i've been racking my brain how do you find out something like this for sure and then i had an idea ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million studio i'm your host coffee zilla the internet detective so tether was investigated by the new york attorney general office already right we know this they settled and as part of this investigation they had to hand over thousands of documents but we ultimately only got to see a small report out of all those thousands of pages that they looked at and i started to wonder could it be that some of the answers we've been looking for are maybe somewhere in the middle between investigation and the ultimate settlement report that they put out maybe those documents hold the key but of course you might be saying well that sounds great but that's locked up by the government right stephen wrong see i remembered something called the freedom of information act which lets you request public government documents and with some exceptions usually they have to hand them over if you ask i actually have used the freedom of information act in the past to investigate a criminology department case at florida state university but that's a story for another day the point is you can get insane amounts of information if you just ask so i started to suspect given my history with that that i could maybe do the same thing with tether the investigation by the new york attorney general was over after all which should mean that it's in the public record now so i decided to send a formal request to new york state the office of the attorney general now it turns out their version of this is a bit different they call it the freedom of information law request but it's very similar to foia which i've done before i shoot off my request i shot my shot told them what i wanted which was basically everything and then just waited [Music] they told me in a few days that the office of the attorney general acknowledges receipt of the above referenced foil request we are performing a diligent search for the records you request we will notify you of the status of your request on or before july 29th 2021 this was on june 30th so i just waited a few weeks and that's when something i didn't expect happened in summary they said nah not a chance we're going to give that stuff to you but of course it's in that very professional jargon that they use please be advised that records or portions of records that respond to your above reference foil request may be exempt from disclosure pursuant to provides that an agency may deny access to records or portions thereof that are trade secrets or are submitted to an agency by a commercial enterprise or derived from information obtained from commercial enterprise and which disclosed would cause substantial injury to the competitive position of the subject enterprise what the hell does that mean well basically they're saying we've got we're coca-cola and the formula is in these documents but i want to tell you how full of crap this response is see ladies and gentlemen i was expecting some things to be retracted after all when i did this in the past i got a lot of documents that had retractions it's not uncommon for there to be sensitive information in documents and what you do is this this is actually one of the emails that i foia the black redaction is basically preventing private info sensitive info from leaking uh which is you know fair play so imagine my shock when they just say like yeah we're not gonna send anything well actually in technical jargon speak this is what they actually told me these particular documents will be exempt from disclosure and kept apart from all other records until 15 days after the entitlement to such an exception has been finally determined we will notify you in such an exception has been finally determined yeah they're gonna notify me right uh that was a month and a half ago to be clear that i've been patiently waiting but something finally broke my perfect patience that i was practicing and that was when i read this article exhibit a your honor tether asks court to block new york attorney general from releasing documents to not even coffeezilla to coindesk ladies and gentlemen our freedom of information law request asked for the release of any documents attesting to tether's reserve composition again some very pertinent information and in this we find out that they did the same thing with coindesk that they did with me not only that it turns out it wasn't the attorney general that was being difficult it was tether apparently tether has been submitting court orders in order to block this information from leaky quote tether and crypto exchange bitfinex has petitioned the new york supreme court to block coindesk and other organizations from receiving documents detailing the composition of tethers reserves over the past few years and yes that's one of the things that i did ask for now what they basically try to argue here is that releasing these documents would harm tether's competitive position in the marketplace ladies and gentlemen and ostensibly that's because they have this like secret sauce in these documents but uh this is total crap right the truth is is that this was a public investigation by the new york attorney general it's finished now that information should be released i mean that is the whole point of foil or foia or whatever you want to call it it's to find out what the government knows same principle so that we can hold them accountable and people like tether who they investigate accountable right now we aren't able to do that journalists at coindesk aren't able to do that and the question is why i mean what could be so important that you couldn't redact you have to completely ban any of these documents from getting out there i'll give you guys my thoughts real quick here i don't know what they're hiding specifically but my guess is that they're right that it would hurt them if it's leaked but it's not because competitors would find out what they've been doing i think it's because the rest of us would find out what they've been doing the story's not over and seeing this report from coindesk just made me realize that it wasn't just me um that couldn't get access to these documents tether seems to be actively blocking these things from getting to journalists such as the ones at coindesk so yeah it's just completely crazy i have a feeling that they're going to be some huge revelations soon because you cannot hide these things forever so anyways thank you guys so much for watching supporting don't forget to pump the stock by subscribing and liking it's absolutely free and i will see you guys in the next you'd one but what a shame what a shame you're a fraud are you the same as
