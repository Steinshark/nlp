NE is driving me crazy but I can't stop can't stop won't stop never stop stopping I never thought anyone could become addicted to configuring a terminal based text editor but here we are if you have an addictive personality I suggest you read this post with caution and let it serve as a warning sign not as an encouragement this is about my first few weeks of trying to configure neovim and the emotional damage it caused me oh boy this is going to be a good one I can feel it I can feel it in bones people you know the best part about these articles is that they start off good and they end good right it's not just you don't just like start off on a banger and then slowly fall apart it's going to be good all the way through and I'm excited I've been using vs code for many years and I have been very very happy with it okay this is the start of tragedy here it comes it's a lot faster and lighter than IDE like Visual Studio or pie charm and it has extensions for every single little thing you can think of and it just lets me do work fast and well this is true but as you every time you add an extension it gets a little slower I started recently watching the prime mention I got a mention and found them extremely entertainting Prime is like a less cheesy version of doctor disrespect damn that might have been the greatest compliment I have ever received ever I'm gonna I'm going to email my wife oh my goodness instead of playing fortnite with kids Bri makes videos related to coding and serious stuff but with an equally High entertainment value and great memes only Geeks under understand get him get him definitely didn't pre-ad definitely didn't pre-ad first off also I love the doc okay so I love the doc just letting you know neovim is a reoccurring subject in his videos and Prime Praises it to the moon he even has a tutorial series about it I've heard him uh I've heard about neovin before and understood that it's a terminal-based text editor that you can configure with different plugins and keyboard shortcuts but I've always put it off as something that Geeks use to help cure their inferiority complex by trying to deliberately make their colleagues uncomfortable when they share their screen at work yes yes that run-on sentence was the greatest sentence I've ever read oh my goodness it just kept going it kept going it kept going but it was so good when you whip out that terminal based editor like even if you get like an emac Wizard or you get a a Vim Wizard and they whip it out and they're hopping around you can look in the audience and like in the video call there'll be three people like you know you can watch their seal of approval and then you watch other people going like they're freaking out like they can't handle what is going on on the screen like they just just just too fast the Seal of confusion seal of approval seal of confusion it's so good at first I thought that the reason that Prime uses neovim is just some gimmick to get more viewers I mean real talk uh because watching someone code in Neo certainly looks cool but I doubted that one can actually be more productive in Neo than vs code when it comes to tools and technology in general I've always had quite a pragmatic mindset and I have always been fine with using whatever gets the job done the quickest because getting the job done is why we're using the editor in the first place I love this take because that I it's the pragmatic take just get the job done the pragmatic take actually is the non is the is the polar opposite of pragmatic the pragmatic take that people always say they have is literally the opposite because what it means is I will look into nothing I will try nothing else out I will only use what was the first thing that I ever Ed that I'm Baseline comfortable with I'll never actually learn it to any extent I'll put a bunch of extensions in it use onethird of the extensions use the extensions that I do use at oneir the power I will just barely scrape on by because that's what I already understand pragmatism pragmatism it's not pragmatism boys okay however after watching and reading more about Neo and becoming more and more brainwashed by The neovim Good vs code bad memes I've decided to try tinkering a little with neovim and after all what harm can it do oh my goodness dude he's getting he's getting Vim pilled it's happening it's it's happening live in front of us I also somehow got convinced that neovim will help you do the job faster if you learn it well this was enough for me to give it a try if I don't like it I'll just go back to vs code oh here it comes oh no here it comes oh no there are two non-user audience for Vim Chads those with dropped jaws and uh and those shaking their head and rolling their eyes that's right pragmatism is when I don't try easy often I find that to be true um my first step was to Google how to get started with neovim and I found a post on r/ neovim where someone complained about not being able to configure Envy Chad properly a few a fellow redditors suggested that Envy Chad can be too difficult for a beginner and suggested they should use astrov instead Envy Chad and ASTM are neovim dros that come preconfigured by the way if you're G to start please everybody Kickstart if you're going to start using neovim this is the greatest project to start from Kickstart neovim it is just a singular file a singular Lua file that has an enormous amount of comments about every last part of it about getting a plug-in manager going about configuring an LSP about using Mouse to do this about setting the terminals about setting this to get telescope set up to get these things set up it is very very very very good good I would highly recommend it a fellow reditor s okay I already did that Envy Chad and Asim are distros that come preconfigured using a disto sounds great so based on that information from a random stranger I I figured that Aston neovim is a good place to get started uh get a function config up and uh and ready without having to spend too much time on configuration okay this is where it falls apart it does not come with Harpoon uh which is I honestly think Kickstart should come with Harpoon okay I love Harpoon after tinkering with Astro Neo a little and doing things like switching color themes trying to figure out which colors will make me write the best code and trying to understand how the hell you even save a file I started getting a little bit more comfortable with it and even started to realize the idea why mouseless development is something to strive for this is actually a great takeaway right here this is actually a really good takeaway even if even if you never use vime again and use it for a little bit why mouseless development is something to strive for is actually really really really really really good uh we'll talk about Harpoon later uh let's see I however producing some actual code was out of the question ridiculous uh as there was always some functionality that I missed or a hotkey that I didn't know if I could just find out what the hotkey is I I guess I'm calling them hot Keys is wrong but that's what they are uh was I asked Google how to set the hotkey but there seemed to be different ways in just understanding in which file to put the uh key binding snippet was hard yes uh the general first impression was that neovim is clunky and difficult even though I used preconfigured drro but I put it down to a skill issue good call good call and I was not ready to give up and go back to VSS code yet love the determination I love the determination absolutely I do think starting with a a Dro is actually really hard because not only do you have to learn how to configure neovim you have to learn how to configure neovim in someone else's already configured way like I mean astrov Vim is great but still you have to figure it out l Vim is great uh it is FAL FAL is great what D he isuse but you still have to figure out how faly does it and faly is a genius okay uh number three frustration of masses after spending some hours trying and failing to install things I was missing like linters Etc I blamed it on Asim not being well documented decided to give Envy Chad a try maybe taking advice from random strangers on the internet does not always pay off en Envy Jad seemed to have better documentation with the cheat sheet for hotkeys and all and so it seemed great and I also found a video on YouTube setting up an nvy Chad for python which was a great bonus since I'm primarily doing python coding however the person in the YouTube video was using null LS which is now archived this is true and didn't have a clue uh what to replace it with I think there's actually a now a community version of n RS if I'm not mistaken mistaken uh n null LS is the world's worst problem to solve it is why vs C vs code can do it because they have 30 people working on VSS code full-time and so by having full-time people they can there's literally a group of people that just resolve the differences between formatters prets and uh your editor and it's it's actually extremely difficult problem I don't have that's why I love formatting through the LSP I think the LSP should be the one that drives that and that is the problem with JavaScript predominantly is because JavaScript doesn't own the tools so your LSP TS server does not own the prettier or the linter and so that thing just totally gets effed up right the whole thing gets messed up because now when you use JavaScript you have to go and you have to like have all this extra configuration whereas when you use go you use rust they come with all of this stuff already pre-built in and that way formatting and linting and everything is done through the LST it is so dang good okay uh why rust anal is awesome wait what why did I read that out loud however the person in the YouTube video was using oh we already did that I found some random Solutions like prettier and others but there's like seven different ways to install them and I could not get any of them to work so I failed miserably at that too I felt helpless and I had so many questions that Google did not seem to be able to answer I did not have a clue how neovim really works what what is lazy what is Mason uh what's the difference between the two and what the hell is an LSP anyway see these are great questions and this is one of the problems about only working in uh vs code you don't even know what an LSP is right you should know what an LSP is chapter 4 accepting defeat after being in a dark place for a while I went back to VSS code where I installed the vinm plug-in oh this is actually a great way to get started great way by the way never go full Vim you never go full Vim right you first go Vim motions learn Vim motions get good at Vim motions and when you're feeling froggy then you jump into Vim where now you're not learning two things at once you're learning one thing at once and that's a big difference it's a huge huge difference and configured the Motions I wanted I felt like uh I felt uh let's see I felt like by using the Vim plugin I had at least taken a tiny steps away from the soy boys and toward the Neil Vim chat let's go I set up my custom key bindings for vs code and tried to force myself to skip the mouse as much as possible I found that I could actually get some coding done and became a better at uh using the Vim motions as well my body and my brain who have been so used to using the mouse for such a long time we're slowly getting accustomed to using primarily the keyboard to navigate vs code I felt relief I was finally physically and mentally able to produce code and I had the shiny new Vim plugin in vs code that was at least a little bit cool and it would give me the same alleged productivity benefits over over time this is good I mean it's honestly this is a great place to be this is a great first step however there was still a bitter taste in my mouth after having tasted the mythical neovim world and being close to achieving a coding Nirvana all I could see and feel when I closed my eyes at night was the sweet uh cat uh cat pin Theme by the way it's not called cat puss okay though I think it should be called cat puss it's cat put chin should be cat puss uh theme and I was navigating my dream with Vim motions it's cat person uh I dreamed about the feeling of invincibility I would get the ID cue the classic ID CD I would get from doing all my coding in the terminal without having to use a clunky electron app that doesn't even use tree sitter great point right there I felt like someone uh I felt like something was missing a part of me had awakened that I could not become silenced by a simply VSS code extension I needed more okay well I didn't see I okay I didn't see chapter FES heading again this is not pre-ad you never go full going full Vim we'll call going full Vim uh Mona to going on right now did not see this happening I plan to do some coding this weekend as I have been trying to learn some new web development concepts for now for a while now oh I read that wrong whatever you get the idea you get the you get the idea I had nothing extra planned and a lot of hours to spend on improving skills that would perhaps Advance my career now I don't do much real coding in my day job so I enjoy working on fun project in my spare time and learning new things on Friday evening I opened my terminal and created the folder structure for my new web development project when I was about to press enter after typing code dot to open my true friend vs code something snapped in my head I stared at the command for about 10 seconds deleted it and typed neovim Dot and pressed enter in what seemed like less than a millisecond that beautiful cat puss and theme popped up that I had configured some weeks ago and I knew there was no turning back vs code can suck it such a plot twist I did not see this coming this is like M night shamalan this is M Night shamalan level signs material here we got Mel Gibson helping writing scripts right now next I went uh to Google to find out how to configure neovim for typescripts since I'd be learning this as part of my web development project okay went hard mode went hard mode uh I could not find any meaningful answers that were applicable to my config so I stumbled in the dark for some time trying different things with Mason Mason's a pretty cool little program I read somewhere that types script language server is what you need so I tried installing that and Mason uh said it got installed but when I tried applying LSP formatting while my ts file was open it only said something uh in the style of no LSP found okay yep yep the frustration was Rising again and after some failed attempts at debugging this and trying to understand what the different config files were even doing I decided to I need to learn this from scratch I had no idea what the code I had gotten from YouTube video was doing and I was obviously lacking some foundational knowledge about Vim to be able to fix my problems this is good okay good you should start should try to start from the beginning don't get overwhelmed I found some good tutorials on LSP zero repository that actually explain some key Concepts and I managed to quite quickly get working uh config that looked good however all my code was in an init.lua file so that felt a little bit off-putting and homemade this is good this is really good this is really really good I like where we're at right now I found another tutorial on configuring Neil from scratch and now I have spent 6 hours going through the first 18 minutes of the video I've deleted my config neovim twice and started over my brain was trying to tell me that it's stupid to waste This Much Time on getting an editor configured and although I feel sick I physically I can't physically quit I've come too far now to turn back all right yes conclusion chapter six I'm unsure if it falls under stupidity or Insanity my goal right now is to get working config that I'm satisfied with during this weekend and if I get some real coding done as well then it's a big plus right now I regret I did not stay in vs code dude this guy has regts the man's reging right now live reging happening not he's so he reged so hard he wrote a sixth chapter book dropped it on the internet threw it on my uh my Reddit and then called it a day love the cander the cander is great but I have spent too many hours now to go back let's see if there are any others that uh are failing at neim at this very moment hit me up on this by the way please please use Kickstarter if you're listening to the giden G gon giden gon uh please do it call him help him uh and share your story and possibly resources used to stop failing at neovim if I ever get this configured I might make a post about how to do it properly I think TJ would be fantastic at getting him on there regert driven development is a real thing NE neovim does not fail watch TJ's aash to basic Series yeah g gayen chling hard there's a lot of chling going on right now lot of chling One does not chle simply uh this is a great article and honestly this expresses also my frustrations in 2016 trying to learn what a Vim script was and trying to like do this Vim thing and doing it as like minimally as possible and just learning small parts I really recommend see the problem is is that again I also got to grow up in the era of non- LSPs LSPs were just getting started back then so almost nothing had an LSP and so you know you didn't really expect strong autocomplete in JavaScript uh even using intellig it still wasn't that great there's like all these things that I kind of got to get started with that I think made learning Vim easier cuz I didn't have to I didn't have to set up everything you know I only had to set up some things and it just got it it was just really really nice to slowly kind of get introduced to this and yeah I did a video Zero to LSP I thought that was good it really is highspeed it's fantastic um and HTM X is great the name is I just mentioned HDMX aent so therefore War buffering has to take a shot
