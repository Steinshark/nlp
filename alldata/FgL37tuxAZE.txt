hey everyone welcome to a very different video i don't think i've ever filmed a video for this channel sat on a sofa before but here we are as you probably know if you watch this channel a lot my main topic of content is visual effects however my most popular video that's currently sat on about 325 000 views is the basics of filmmaking in general i made that about four years ago just after i left college and it's since done ridiculously well it's the first video that comes up on youtube if you search for basics of filmmaking and amongst the thousands and thousands of comments on that video there's lots of questions about other areas of filmmaking outside of visual effects things like script writing directing or today's video sound effects and music recently i actually got made a brand ambassador for epidemic sounds but just so you know i'm not a huge sellout i used to use them long before i was a brand ambassador back when i was in college and doing freelance work i used to use them all the time and just pay for it out of my own money let's get the shameless self plug out the way at the beginning of the video if you would like to have a 30 day free trial of epidemic sounds there's a link below in the description you can make a free account sign up and you'll have access to everything on the site for 30 days you can use it in your videos and everything and it will also help support my channel so thank you very much in advance on with the video after i finished editing one of the things that takes me quite a lot of time is sitting down and actually trying to find the right track for the video occasionally i'll have one in mind up front and it helps because you can actually edit the video to kind of work with the music but a lot of the time what i do is kind of find a track that suits the video afterwards i'm always looking for a track that's going to make the video better and elevate it to some degree and i always find whenever i'm looking through the royalty-free music websites it's more often than not quite underwhelming you've probably noticed that pretty much all of them are just instrumental so none of them have vocals that's usually because if a band has taken the time to record a proper song and do vocals for it they're not really going to want to release it for free there are some exceptions to that but a lot of the time is all instrumental stuff but personally for me i like to use a lot of rock music in my videos that's my favorite genre that i listen to in my day-to-day life and i also find that it fits quite well with a lot of the content that i make and i always just find that there's a lot more impact and punch from tracks from places like epidemic sound that have vocals in them and it really adds a level of dynamic to the sound of the video so why use epidemic sounds the main reason i started using them when i was back in college was because everyone that i knew that was working in the industry had a subscription to the site and that was freelance videographers people that were making youtube videos or content for social media that was people that are doing professional commercial work so right out the gate i had a lot of people whose opinions i trusted that had really good first-hand experience with it and could vouch for it so that's why when i started doing my own freelance video work i started using them as well they have two main plans the first one is the personal plan this gives you access to over 32 000 professionally produced tracks and over 60 000 sound effects the licensing for the use of the music covers youtube facebook instagram twitch and podcasts and this can be applied to one channel per platform so for example if you have the personal plan you can use it for one youtube channel and then one facebook page one instagram account etc and this is including use on monetized videos and then there's the commercial plan which is the one i would recommend for freelancers and this is the one that i used to use personally when i used to work for clients it has all of the above stuff in the commercial plan but on top of that you have unlimited usage on all platforms so for example you can use it on as many youtube channels or facebook pages as you want and the reason that's quite important is it covers all of the usage of whatever your clients intend to do with it so if they want to share it on their facebook page it also covers their usage of it as well in the license and the commercial plan also covers usage outside of social media so you can use it on other online platforms and websites so to finish the video off i thought i would show an example of how the sound effects and tracks from epidemic sounds helped to elevate one of my recent videos the iron man suit up video firstly i'm going to play a small section of the video just using a royalty-free music track that's an instrumental and then secondly i'm going to play it using the sound effects and track that i licensed from epidemic sounds here is the comparison so so [Music] [Music] so hopefully as you can see sound makes a massive difference to the video as well i've personally been using epidemic sounds on and off for about five years and i have nothing bad to say about them highly recommend them and that's why i'm making this video once again if you would like to try out epidemic sounds for 30 days for free there is a link below in the description all you have to do is make an account and sign up for free and it will give you access to everything on the site for the next month you can use the tracks the sound effects and everything in your videos and it will also give me some commission which will help to support the channel and with that said thank you very much for watching and i'll see you in the next video
