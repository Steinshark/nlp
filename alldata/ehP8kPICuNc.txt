what I'm about to show you is going to blow your mind check this out present day electronic brains are complete morons but this will not be true in another generation they will start to think and eventually they will completely out think their makers how was Arthur's seek 1664 predicting nature which actually came true it's pretty crazy to think just how far we have come with technology in such a short amount of time and it's continuing to speed up that's why in today's video we are going to be covering skills that you need in order to stay ahead when it comes to your career being in demand and what are these skills what are these areas of focus that will continue to grow in the future there is so much out there to learn that you want to ensure what you are learning are things that will actually be valuable in the future thank you the first one is cloud computing hmm what a lovely day look at those clouds no not that kind of cloud computing cloud computing is rapidly growing in I.T actually Gardner reported back in April of 2022 that estimating a global end user spending on public cloud services by 2023 now will reach 600 billion there's no shortage as you think of all the places that you use the cloud when it comes to storage and I mean we are continuing to buy more and more storage on the cloud as we continue to use more digital products I often think about this when will it end like when I am 80 years old how much will I be spending on storage in the cloud for my photos from when I was 20. well they still care I feel like there's an attachment and I will and it'll actually pull up on screen here the average cloud computing career salaries and there are so many different careers within Cloud which is pretty exciting if you think about it so the highest paying is cloud architect coming in at 138 000 us then cloud data science Cloud consultant Cloud engineer Etc but what exactly is cloud computing in simple terms I mean if you are considering getting into cloud computing from a technical or even non-technical standpoint let's break it down in a very simple way so you actually understand what it is because we talk a lot about these terms whether it be cloud computing data science security but what exactly are we talking about when you think cloud computing think of it as the on-demand availability of your computer system resources when you go to access your Google Cloud Storage when you go to access Dropbox they are all stored on the cloud and there are four main types of clouds whether it be private clouds public clouds hybrid clouds or multi-clouds also too I want to share with you some courses if you are looking to get into cloud computing starting with the basics let's put them up on screen here okay here's a fact that might just blow your mind back in 2021 organizations around the world spent around 150 billion on cyber security not million billion that's kind of that for me that's almost too much to fully comprehend that's a lot of money and actually a survey of 4 000 mid-sized companies suggests that threat volumes will almost double from 2021 to 2022 and then 2023 where we are now so cyber security is continuing to be an area that is so in demand and it's only going to continue to grow in that direction but what exactly is security what is cyber security okay it sounds kind of obvious of course the point of cyber security is to protect the business or application or software from potential hackers or even other failures or bugs going on in the system within that there are so many different roles one of my friends actually started out as a developer and then got interested in cyber security and started reverse engineering applications so what you are doing this is one of the coolest roles out there in my opinion is you're actually hacking into the businesses system to find vulnerabilities so it's called reverse engineering and it essentially is you are thinking or putting on this hat like you are a hacker and finding potential vulnerabilities in the businesses system so it's a super interesting job and there's so much to do with cyber security from a technical standpoint or non-technical standpoint here are some courses though that if you're interested in exploring more about it that you should check out next up is data scientist and data analyst and these are two very separate roles but I included them both in number three for the reason of data as a whole is the oil of now is that what the saying is data is the oil I feel like that saying's been said too much but you get what I'm saying as more and more companies continue to go online and expand their digital presence being able to really understand data read data gather data is becoming more and more important not just for data scientists or analysts but at the end of the day for really anyone who is customer facing whether you're a business analyst whether you are customer support being able to easily gather or gain access to this data has become increasingly important I know for myself in past jobs I've worked at I the customer success teams or individuals who are working client facing they were required to actually have the ability to know SQL and this is because oftentimes they'd be pulling in data that they were querying based on what was coming in from the customers now this might vary based on size of company or specific role but at the end of the day even if you are a non-technical person or in a non-technical role having the ability to really understand data and have access to it through using things such as SQL is becoming increasing important also too SQL is really fun to learn and I highly suggest it but what exactly is the difference between a data scientist and a data analyst it's as I mentioned earlier there's a big difference in these roles let's start with data scientists a data scientist is essentially a concept that's used to tackle Big Data it includes data cleansing preparation and also to some analysis I'm going to put up on screen here kind of the main areas around data science here are some skills though that are required to become a data scientist strong knowledge of python of course you need to be well-versed in SQL or SQL and also to understanding of multiple analytical functions and knowledge and machine learning I have met so many data scientists throughout my time in Tech that are self-taught so this is definitely an area if you're interested in that you don't need to go back to formal school in order to become one I'll list some courses here for you now what exactly would be a data analyst then well a data analyst should be able to take specific questions or topics discuss what the data looks like essentially you're analyzing the data and represent that data to a relevant stakeholders so a lot of time data analysts actually interact a lot with stakeholders or in some cases even with clients whether they are explaining what the data means why it looks like this and what they can do with this data I feel like I said data a lot in that sentence so what skills are required to become a data analyst well for one you need to be pretty well versed in math especially in statistic other areas you need to be well versed in include an understanding of r or python data wrangling and many other skills also too here are some courses for data analytics all right I hope you enjoyed this video going through some of the top areas top skill sets that will be required and in demand really across so many jobs in the tech industry and when I say tech industry I always feel funny saying that because Tech touches every industry and so do these roles if you enjoyed this video make sure to subscribe to my channel for more content around coding career future Tech you know all of that fun stuff and leave in the comments other video topics you want me to cover alright see you soon thank you [Music]
