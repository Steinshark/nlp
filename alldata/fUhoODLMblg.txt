safe moon is getting sued along with jake paul soja boy and more for an alleged pump and dump apparently the moon wasn't safe the result of this could have shocking implications for everyone who thought they could just get out of jail free by saying not financial advice hold on i can't promote scams on the internet even if i say do your own research [ __ ] funny isn't it how the tables have turned let's investigate okay so this is the lawsuit we're looking at today filed as a class action lawsuit by these guys they're suing the safe moon team and several influencers who promoted safe mode including jake paul soulja boy little yachty and a bunch of kind of smaller tier influencers now what are the allegations well this quote the misleading promotions and celebrity endorsements were able to artificially increase the interest and price of the safe moon tokens during the class period causing investors to purchase these losing investments at inflated prices okay so basically they're saying safe moon succeeded because of all these celebrity endorsements and investors jumped in at all-time highs meanwhile safe moon and the gang were allegedly selling quote the company's executives caroni and haines davies conspired with the promoter defendants to sell their safe moon tokens to investors for a profit now as a reminder safe moon was a huge deal back in 2021 for a simple core reason basically safe moon was safe that's what we were all told how well because of the liquidity pool which is a pool of funds supporting the price of the project it was supposed to be locked up untouchable for four years on pancake swap hence we're gonna go safely to the moon the team wasn't supposed to be able to touch those funds they weren't supposed to be able to rug us but like jeffrey epstein the safe moon team touched things a little too early and got insanely rich by doing it and got away with it for far too long see the truth is contrary to what had been pitched to us the project owners had access to these tokens the liquidity pool this entire time and could sell them at any time and did sell them or at least that's what the lawsuit alleges now of course who benefited from this not the investors but instead safe moon and the influencers who promoted it now one thing that might be challenging for this lawsuit is the fact that i'm sure a lot of these influencers have no idea what a liquidity pool even is i don't think they knew what they were promoting i don't think they cared as long as they were getting paid now the lawsuit anticipates this saying this quote they knew or should have known that the liquidity pools were designed in a way that allowed for the possibility of the liquidity pool being drained by defendants in other words even if little yachty thought a liquidity pool was something you placed a little yachty in it doesn't matter he's still responsible for what he promoted or at least that's the argument they're making now whether a judge believes it well that's another thing entirely but this is where things actually get really interesting see this class action lawsuit involving influencers might have better odds than you might think because of a recent decision on another case that impacts it remember bitconnect this guy there's a very similar story going on there huge crypto project there were a lot of influencers who promoted it everything fell apart and then afterwards there's a class action lawsuit but in that case it got thrown out because it was argued that influencers could not be held responsible for what they said why because they didn't actively solicit investments the argument is basically that they put it out on social media generally but didn't directly solicit from their followers according to the case quote the securities act covers sales pitches to particular people not communications directed to the public so it seemed like investors might be immune from cases like this but recently that dismissal got reversed and the new ruling came out that said this quote solicitation has long occurred through mass communications and online videos are merely a new way of doing an old thing in other words these big connects promoters can absolutely be sued and so can other influencers with this precedent it's not a defense to say oh i didn't dm people i just posted it to my millions of fans that can still be considered solicitation and this is why this lawsuit could be huge especially if they get the damages they're asking for notably the difference between what investors bought and sold safe moon for this could be tens of millions of dollars in damages that the team tin house has to pay for now of course i wanted to say you know i also thought this lawsuit missed a few things as well specifically that two of the founders thomas smith and kyle negley aren't mentioned which is a strange omission and i think we're going to have to help these guys out in our next episode by talking about the influencers payments which is never mentioned in this lawsuit maybe they don't realize it but all this stuff is publicly available on the blockchain and one of these guys wasn't that careful in covering his trail we're revealing this influencer and their wallets in the next episode so pump the stock if you want to see that thanks for watching you just want me to look bad on camera
