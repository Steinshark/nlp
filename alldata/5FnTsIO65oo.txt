twitch's biggest con artist was exposed and I'm here for the forensic analysis look the crime has already been committed it's already been confessed to so we're not here for any of that instead we're here to figure out how and why I'm talking of course about Slicker he's a famous live streamer who used his connections with fans and other live streamers to beg and borrow over 300 000 and never returned it and so I was up all night talking to the victims of all of this and their stories are wild and I should start by saying I don't mean Slicker is the biggest con artist in terms of money like he didn't Rob Fort Knox he didn't steal a famous painting I mean the he's the biggest in terms of the sheer number of victims who have come forward I mean this guy was working hard basically if you had a Twitch account this guy came to you for money but there are several extra details you need to know as well as I said Slicker already confessed I'm not Prosecuting anything here I'm not alleging anything here he admitted to everything last night on a live stream after being exposed by several fans and streamers forgiveness but every single day I felt guilty every single day I don't know what to say to the people I borrowed from every single day I was guilty guilty in asking honestly I kind of respect that he doesn't try to dispute the facts here he just kind of owns up to him and said yeah I did it yeah it was bad but then after that it I kind of get a problem with what he says when we talk about why he did it because Slicker says that he did all this because of a gambling addiction he suffers from I started to gamble with money and um this was even when I started having my first job and I used to gamble a lot of my money uh basically all my twitch money I and then even them times I wouldn't even have them I'd come across streamers and ask them if I could borrow money I I don't know what to say but this is the epitome of uh gambling uh I will just I want to say that um don't touch it man now look I do honestly believe Slicker has a gambling addiction I just don't think it explains away everything in the way that he thinks it does for example a gambling addiction explains how Slicker lost his money but it doesn't explain how he lost everyone else's money or got it in the first place I mean I feel like he's trying to explain everything with the story of like I have a gambling problem but when you dig into the story you find that Slicker isn't just a gambling addict he's also a professional con artist which we're gonna see in a second so while he does need help he also needs to face consequences because he played an active role in all this it's like meeting an alcoholic who you find out broke into your house and cracked your safe and they get caught at the police station you go up to them and you say how did you open my safe and they go oh sorry I'm an alcoholic you'd be like yeah but how'd you crack open my safe and then imagine they go oh well you know I just can't stop drinking you'd be like okay I don't think Jack Daniels taught you these skills right so my point is yes Slicker clearly has an addiction but he also appears to be a professional con man and we're going to talk about that right now because I interviewed multiple victims and created a master list of the people who Slicker scammed because I needed to get like a bird's eye view of this thing there are over 55 people on this list owed money right now and the total scammed is over 384 thousand dollars and what did I learn from these 55 people well there were a lot of different ways Slicker like to approach people but he really liked this Bank scam method my buying account got locked temporary locked don't have access to my money sadly because did UK Banks but whatever I was wondering if I asked if I could borrow money and I'd pay you back now I'd even give you extra that's right the old Frozen Bank trick basically go to people and say hey look I can't access my funds you you have to give me money I'll pay you back I'll pay you back even more and it's sort of incredible to watch because not only is all of this a lie but it's just so good at acting ashamed like if I saw this I'd believe you know oh man he's petrified to ask me but come to find out he's been telling everyone the same sob story over and over again hey um I just recently uh got into something with my bank basically um my bank account got locked this has happened for like three four days yo Mo I'm not hacked my bro I'm not so yeah turns out he wasn't ashamed at all in fact if you didn't believe him he would even say other things like you know on my mama when they didn't believe him or he would swear on his religion that he wasn't lying while lying listen to me Nepali I swear I'm I'm a Muslim I swear on the Quran I ain't lying I won't scam you I'm gonna tell you on my mom's life on my on my mom's life I'm not lying please on my mom's life I know I know I I know I understand I'm not lying I am not lying I'm confident I'm not I promise to God I'll have you month by month you asked me 15th of next month here you go 15th of a month here you go here you go my mom's like do you think I'm joking bro I'm on mom's life I'm not bro I'm on mom's life I'm not I absolutely cannot stress enough just how many people he used these tactics on to try to convince them and it's interesting how he like refined it over time right this is my point about like professional con man he's like a stand-up comedian who tries his act in every city and like hones it until he figures out exactly what to say to make the audience laugh but he does it for like scams like he knew the exact script to use for example this is the YouTuber umpaville who gave him a thousand dollars but when he was asked for another thousand uh he refused so he said I got you on my mama he refused again so Slicker sent him a document from Bluestone Credit Management in order to show how much he was in trouble or whatever like he's basically saying like I'm in trouble with taxes like you got to help me out man I mean it's genius because I'm pretty sure this document is real he says bro legit tax killed the F out of me which might be true but come to find out this was a document that he sent to several people he recycled it over time which I found out talking to another victim who hadn't realized this yet and found it out in a pretty amusing way every single time I sent money it was for some reason that made sense I sent it that much amount of money because he got me in a call right I just got home from my gym session gets me to call and he's like yo he okay what else he's breaking down he's almost on the verge of tears he's breaking down and he's like okay bro you're not gonna believe this I didn't pay tax last year and they and I'm owed 15.5 k and listen she had the proof though so this is the thing that doesn't make sense though because I don't know if he was lying to me he sent me a a document he sent me the document nothing blurred out nothing is on his lap I've seen his room I just watched his stream so many times so I can tell you this is 100 legit it's got his hairy ass arms in the picture it says his name all the info and the amount owed and it says that I have the proof I think it's 15.3k to be exact sorry 15.3k you know I've already seen this screenshot but not from you from someone else who got this oh no letter I swear oh no I swear to you he was sending it to every everybody he was sitting into everybody well this is news to me bro I did not know this what I think is so crazy is that Slicker scheme worked in part because of how many people he was like simultaneously lying to behind the scenes and even though his tactics were the same the exact story would sometimes change based on the person so that it took so long for people to figure out which was explained to me by yet another victim uh who found out because her roommate was hearing a different story than her and it made her curious why was he getting asked for less money and with a different story than her he'd asked me for 5K in the video crying swimming on the Quran on his parents where he pay me back but then he's asked many Titan who doesn't have as much money for 300 pounds tailored it specifically to many knowing he has less liquid income than me like and for mini it wasn't like the story of like how he's in debt with bad men it was what he had an electric bill he needed to pay and he was going to get cut off he made different stories for different people depending on how much he thinks he could get out of them crazy to hear slicker's scam exposed so well by someone who never intended to expose him at all she thought she was his friend her name is lupeli and she was going through chemo when she was scammed by this guy he did this to you while you were going through chemo well I was calling kuki Momo he knew that he knew that while asking you for money yes so this is why I had no idea that I was being scammed because first stuff I met this person multiple times in person um he knew I have a severe autoimmune diseases while going through chemo he calls me up and he is so I am shaking thinking about it I thought this guy was my friend and he calls me up saying that he's gonna get shout he owes people money and they're outside like if he doesn't pay them then like they're gonna break his legs and I'm thinking like I gotta help this guy you know I was going through chemo I didn't think I'm getting scammed by like my friend like he's in a hard time I'm in a hard time but I can help him so I help him promises to pay me back and he just doesn't guys if you don't get it by now this guy will do and say anything for money okay no bar is too low if you're going after people in chemo which is the reason why this community needs to be very careful in trusting Slicker ever again because right now he's out there making the apology to her saying how he plans to pay everyone back but how can you trust him it's a question that even he's aware of I have to find a way to pay them back but the funny thing is how can you trust me how can you trust someone [Music] how could you trust someone like me what I do find interesting about all of this is it's just that listening to him um you can kind of see why his victims gave him money like he is compelling he does sound so sincere but for many of these victims it's interesting that they've heard all this before this isn't new like he kept saying no you don't get it I you know I I I'm not lying to you lupeli I'm not lying to you you know now I know he was this is what subset me the most like he knew he wasn't going to pay back if I gave him the 10K he knew he was lying about having a loan from the bank which will you know pay back what they give him he was just giving me food there it is that's my question to anyone who thinks Slicker is suddenly gonna pay everyone back that was true why wouldn't he do that in the years that he was borrowing from these people promising then to pay them back but knowing he was lying and yes I should say he did pay a few people back okay but most of those people I have to say he then asked for more money and some of them he even like fake paid back he's sending money back sending money back I was like hello hello uh he would be like yeah I can send it I can send it and then he sent me 1.7 K on PayPal but he sent it as a transaction and then three days later it was canceled so I never actually got any of that money back truthfully the most surprising thing about this whole Scandal is just how well this is reflected on the rest of the twitch Community while also reflecting so bad on Slicker and for this part I I just wanted you to hear from one of slicker's victims again he also showed me DMS between him and Ludwig him and train Rex Heyman such as a streamer of of him dming them and then like asking for money and then them not sending money back but the worst part of it of all of that is like he's so Shameless he would talk them to me he'd be like bro you don't understand streamers don't like they're so money hungry they don't wanna so ironic now looking at it but you're like the stream is so money hungry they don't want to help anyone out blah blah blah blah and now after everything's come out all these streamers sent him so much money I cannot believe he said that I cannot believe he came to my DMs and told me yeah all these streamers are just only care about his money you're the ones who paid him all the money I don't care I don't understand yeah you know what it would have been better if they were great honest honestly like the biggest lesson from this is that like slicker's terrible but then a lot of streamers are actually good people like they really want to help people out it's like it's like the takeaway is not that streamers aren't art uh are are really not generous it's like if anything is the opposite it's like they're two chairs that's right if anything twitch streamers just come off looking like almost naively generous and while I say that I actually have good news because after this call that you just heard I got a great update that I want to share with you two of the biggest streamers xqc and Ludwig both just pledged to actually clean up slicker's mess and refund all the people affected by the scam which is amazing and proves my point once again and while they're still working on it I can confirm that lupeli the woman we just heard from earlier has actually already gotten her money back so absolute credit where credit is due guys that's an amazing thing another interesting development from this is that many people have used this as an opportunity to call for the Banning of twitch gambling streams which I absolutely agree with especially sponsored gambling streams I mean do I think twitch will actually do something from like mounting support and most people being against it uh no no because they make too many views and money but do I think they should do it absolutely it's a plague on the platform for everyone who isn't the streamers who are sponsored and making millions of dollars right so yeah that's basically where this story stands make sure to give some love to all the people who share their story pump the stock send some money to my frozen bank and I'll see you in the next one
