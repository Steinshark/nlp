this is what a successful politician in 2021 looks like yes i am uh running for uh the mayor of london my name is count pinkface and to introduce myself uh you may have known me from my uh previous moniker i i i didn't used to be called monica no i used to be called uh lord buckethead what's your policy on free speech well i wouldn't charge for it for a start i'm for the bucket i think it holds more water and he's brian's biggest competitor right now it's a narcissist versus a literal bucket so you want you want me to beat brian rose that's what you want oh yeah oh yeah that's like the first priority yeah i mean i mean i'd love to beat brian um electrically not physically i've seen it he loves a bit of a shadow boxing and i'm not looking for any uh fisty cups because i'll just shoot him with a laser if it came to that but uh look i i like standing for election partly because it's a celebration of democracy i think that democracy is the single greatest political invention in the entire galaxy ladies and gentlemen welcome to a much expected awaited interview of my official endorsement for mayor of london ladies and gentlemen without further ado count been faced he's joining us from mars right now thank you bob thank you very much coffeezilla answer all your uh wonderful fans viewers listeners however they choose to imbibe me sensually uh lovely to be here now uh ca should i call you count um how do i address you here yeah it counts by your excellency whatever your excellency i i prefer i much prefer your excellency okay now tell the people who don't know you know most people they see you and they think man either this guy's the greatest political candidate of all time or i think there may be some game going on here i don't treat you as a a game or a joke at all tell people just how serious you are about running for mayor and uh also tell them why they you're such a better candidate well i mean for a start i mean you can't look more serious than this i mean if you think i'm not serious then i would quote the great john mcenroe and say you can't be serious that's i mean this is what a successful politician in 2021 looks like i mean yes i am uh running for uh the mayor of london my name is count pinkface and to introduce myself uh you may know of me from my uh previous moniker i i i didn't used to be called monica no i used to be called uh lord buckethead and i i ran against uh theresa may the then prime minister of the united kingdom in uh earth year and it was a lot of fun and uh i went viral in a non-covered kind of way you know the good way around your life just to be cool to be viral yeah yeah exactly i went on john oliver's show spoke at the glastonbury festival all sorts of lovely stuff and then some american film producer americans you americans an american film producer uh took control of my twitter account after i got famous no i wanted to have that title for himself so i've upgraded after my unfortunate battle on the planet copyright and i'm back i'm pin face and i'm ready to be may you know it's a tough time when they take you from buckethead to bendface but i'm glad to see you've rolled with the punches um so now i mean obviously that's a very serious issue but i i want to talk to you about like you know where you're from because obviously this is an important issue for any london candidate you know we have people like brian rose he's an american running for mayor of london i always thought that was a bit strange but you you're from mars going for uh for london yeah do i have my facts right here uh well i mean your facts about brian rosa right i believe he is an american trying to be the mayor of london and to me that's just crazy right i mean that's just madness yeah with me no no no no i'm from i'm i'm compared to him i'm pretty much uh you know a local boy but uh i'm not from mars no uh i am from the uh sigma quadrant but uh the uh the fact is that uh i've come to your planet to run from air and yet the intergalactic advice is to remain at all times at least one planet away from earth while the pandemic's going on so i'm you know i'm just taking precautions i see you're you're s planetary distancing from us just to make sure these guys figure it out uh but you do want to help us out i appreciate it i mean i really do let me ask you um you know it's not just brian rose you're also up against sadiq khan you're up against sean bailey and i know you guys are shocked that i know all these names but i'm interested in uk politics this year this is the year that coffeezilla becomes a uk politician fan uh and i've chosen very carefully but you're also up against a youtuber named nico have you heard of this guy he's like hey hang on can i just stop you there you mentioned we just roll back a second you mentioned some of these candidates you yeah you mentioned someone called um sean bailey i think so that's is that right i thought he's the conservative whatever is he no literally nobody knows honestly no one knows who that candidate is it could be him but he's whoever it is he's running such a terrible campaign no nobody can remember his name at all which is why i asked you i am the only one that's shocking and an american barely covering the election i'm the only one that remembers yeah what's it again it's sean bailey i think that's it now you're making me forget this it goes in one side of the bin and straight out the other i mean it's crazy but anyway well thanks for that that was handy i mean yeah i know there's a couple of youtube guys uh running i think that their idea is to use the election to uh you know generate hits for their own right they're not youtube platforms i mean uh that's fine that's part of democracy i suppose but uh you know my concern is that that's that's what's gonna happen more and more in all your countries that are you know the entirety of politics could be uh run by 20 somethings claiming that they're trying to prank the news when they're possibly doing no such thing i think it's such a shame when people treat the election like a joke um and that's what exactly i mean who would do a thing like that yeah yeah it's it's true that's very true um so sorry is your bin getting a little a little full a little stuffy over there it's full of politics it's absolutely brimming full of ideas okay so speaking of ideas i want to tell tell the people you're not a guy with no ideas like brian rose he's like hey what are you for science and that's all he can tell you he doesn't know anything no no you have some real specific ideas now i was really drawn to your croissant idea i said this is a big idea can you tell the people what you want the croissant law to be just so they know what they're getting with you of course well just to start just to go back to brian uh you it to be fair to the guy i mean there's a there's a lot of things which are quirky about your mate brian rose yeah but uh one thing i will say if in the united kingdom for an american to say he is pro-science is not taken for granted so actually you know given your former president for brian to say that is is a is a pretty big deal because some americans uh you know don't believe in science uh and that's that's up to them you know if they want to believe what they want to believe but uh i'm pleased that brian at least accepts things like the law of gravity and things like that because i don't think the impression that some of the candidates like piers corbin he's probably not too sure about that kind of thing you know 5g conspiracies anti-vaxx conspiracy oh no brian brian did all that brian did the the had david ike on he was fracturing with all those ideas of course there you go that's strange that brian would say he's pro science and yet uh uh talk to her to davis politicians use every good idea like a little a cudgel to beat their little uh constituents over the head with they is science fam the word of the day i'll be pro science yeah and in reality they're not um so no but no but get me back to you've derailed my whole croissant plan here or yeah if you want me to elaborate i will now i mean let's go back to basics a croissant is a small excuse me pastry base butter filled ready snack okay everyone's happy with that it emanated from the great country of france but like a pandemic it has swept across the globe and uh thanks to me uh hopefully uh my quadrant will soon be uh picking up some uh exports but and this is the big but in recent times in good old london town the price of a single croissant has skyrocketed faster than the property prices you've gone from 50p to a single item to like you took one pound fifty two pound two pound fifty in some places it's a tragedy it's madness and i'm telling you coffeezilla i mean your name is coffee you must know about snacks at breakfast this has got to stop and i am an egalitarian bin and i say on day one i would lobby for all hey outlets and shops and anything anywhere that wants to sell a croissant come on guys make it a quick that's it no more than a quid guys that's the new thing so no shop maybe is allowed to sell a croissant for more than one quid i like there's something bold to that i really enjoy that uh because it is true these shopkeepers they're getting cocky they are and the thing is what do you call it that's still a pretty bloody decent markup isn't it i quit you can't tell me that they've got to make i'm not buying that at all i literally would not buy that so uh you know all i'm saying is give the customers they're on their way to work you know london transport is a bit of a nightmare anyway and that's without crossrail being built and we can come on to that you know i i all i'm saying is give something back to the great british londoner okay i like that bold idea and that's exactly the kind of bullet idea that i support which is why i'm endorsing you for mayor of london so i expect all the coffeezilla army to go out vote for not me don't vote because i told you to vote for ben face for yourself do yourself a favor do yourself and your croissant little stomach a favor and go vote for count been face because he's the only you're the only politician i've ever seen address these critical issues now um other critical issues that i want to talk to you about is your radical approach to punishment related to some of these ideas now you want to ban speaker phones on public transport now most people would say okay i'm gonna you know if you break this law i by the way i agree speaker phones on public transport get some airpods guys um but if you do break that tell them what happens it's not what they think uh well i mean it's up to your uh your fans and your good self to say what you think uh the punishment should be for somebody being anti-social and using speakerphone on public transport but my my philosophy is a simple one that you need to have the carrot on the one hand and the stick on the other now that means yes i'm prepared to offer commuters the one pound croissants that's on the table i'm offering that that is there i you know that's a promise yes but you know i'd be lying if i said there weren't strings attached yeah and my number one string is please don't be a dick on public transport and if you do i've got a simple philosophy i'm not into tasers i'm more of a lasers kind of guy and i'm not into what americans do which is uh shooting innocent people i try not to do watch out there's a lot of americans watching this right now yeah go ahead yeah yeah you know i i i think that's a bit much so instead i have a third way yes and it's simple i say any offender caught using speakerphone must be forced to watch the movie version of cats every day or a year and that will stop them i guarantee it i think some people would rather be shot i mean quite frankly but i do like i i admire the radicalness of this plan i don't think any politician has been willing to approach such radical um punishment ideas now do you feel like that's it is a pretty steep punishment but maybe the punishment fits the crime i don't know well i mean this is the thing uh uh my policy rather like everything in your universe is uh as einstein put it relative so you know if you say oh being made to watch the movie of cats every day for a year sounds pretty steep well yeah that is steep compared to not having to watch it every day for a year correct but it's pretty lenient compared to making them watch it every day for a hundred years which i could have said so you know what a politician's got to do is everything is about moderation it's about finding the mainstream it's about finding and charting a middle course and all i'm doing here is sitting here chatting to you having a very sober discussion about politics and about the sensible way forwards to ensure a reduction in anti-social behavior this this couldn't be more sane i agree but is this a typical galactic style punishment i mean i i feel like when we think about earthly punishments we think about you know very straightforward things are we a little primitive have we not gone far enough to get creative with the way that we incentivize behaviors well i mean yeah yes you are primitive yeah and you say you haven't gone far enough you guys are stuck on your bloody planet so i mean you don't get much more primitive than that yeah you know yeah you said a couple of guys up to the moon and you've sent a bloody drone up here to miles which is really pissing me off i honestly you got to get a license for these things i mean you you guys you really take liberties but yeah are you are primitive and that's why you deserve uh primitive punishment so i'd be lying if i said that i had forced anyone else in the universe to watch the movie version of cats as a punishment or otherwise uh i that that would be not true no i can guarantee you no other being in the entire multiverse has seen the movie cat it's just you guys it's your problem you created it and therefore all i'm doing is serving it back up to you it's true um i can't argue with that listen so i gotta we i mean we have so much to talk about so i gotta we're gonna move on from each of these things because you've got other big policies and my point in doing this is that when i first announced that i would be endorsing you as the mayoral candidate of london you know i couldn't believe it but people actually did think i was joking and i said no are you are you joking this guy's a serious candidate they said come on stephen count binface and i said no it's it's real man he used to be lord buckethead now he's count ben face you got to take a second look so one of my things here is i really want to present your fresh ideas to people now another of your fresh ideas is that loud snacks to be banned from theaters hey i for one can endorse this but my question is what counts as a loud snack well firstly thank you for endorsing my policy i mean this one's just a no-brainer absolutely no-brainer what does the b stand for the b on your coffee cup what does that stand for oh it's supposed to be a coffee break cb oh i see a club channel because you see cb is what we're doing here wow yeah in a way it's kind of it's kind of an endorsement here accountability it's kind of an endorsement i mean there were certain americans who'd see that and they'd try and uh do you for copyright just using the old initials there but no i'm not going to do that you i love it free advertising you you you go ahead have you been face mark lovely so look let's get back to theaters the thing is right it it's got to stop i when you say what counts as a loud snack the question is can you hear them eating if the answer is yes it's too bloody loud that's that's what i'm talking about here now some people might say this is uh you know a little bit over the top i mean what i should say is and it's a semantic issue here between uh the uk and america because uh you guys uh use the word uh theater to represent both uh you know going to take in a show and cinemas where you go a movie theater that's true now i'm not saying i'm not doing the cinemas here i'm starting this slow again i'm moderate i'm reasonable yes i have a bin for the head but i'm not stupid well i'm not completely stupid so i'm talking about the theatrical places the what you would call it a playhouse maybe so it's where people have spent loads of money to go and see people performing live and you go in and there's someone to your left to your right or behind you scoffing their faces with crisps and a boiled sweets and and they're like and it makes me think firstly what's your problem and secondly why can't you find a quiet snack like a little uh a soft map something like that and thirdly why can't you eat before the show i mean you knew you're gonna go and see the show and you know that the show is about watching something why don't you eat before you go in i don't under look you're the human here what's going on i'll tell you what's going on listen i'll be honest at theaters i love a good snack but i'm talking about the movie theaters but i've gone to plays before and i find it absolutely deplorable to people who eat at theaters because uh the like the like plays stuff like that it is hard to hear they don't have these crazy sound systems if you go to like star wars the latest star wars cinema as you uh you guys call it which is i think's weird but if you if you go to that you're going to be blown out no matter what you're eating i mean you're not going to hear anybody eating because it's so loud speakers but i at plays and stuff you can barely hear um somebody's crunching you know some chips next to you it's a disaster so i agree with you but um i i agree with you there we go but on the other hand you don't have a punishment for this one and part of me thinks did did you know your excellency forget to include a punishment and could we right now spin up a punishment for the violators of this crime uh well i mean i i didn't come up with a punishment because i i i was i was trying to be reasonable you know i again this is me i'm i can't i honestly can't believe i'm saying this but compared to the other 19 candidates you're talking to the same one and and you know i've come over here from the sigma quadrant and i if i say to you guys come on let's not have the snacks when you're going to see a play that should be it right that you shouldn't need an intergalactic to threaten you with you know a battle army armed with lasers or you know a james corden movie featuring horrendously animated cats you shouldn't need me to do that yeah but it should be simple it's like you know if i say don't slap the next person you see across the street in the face you shouldn't need me to say because if you do i'll arrest you just not you're just not gonna do it but that's the human condition you tell us don't slap the next person i guarantee you about five people that are watching this right now are gonna go do that not because they were going to do it because you told him not to do it whose problem is that well it's the person getting slapped that's whose problem it is um so may well we'll put a pin in that we'll put a pin in the punishment i'll you know we'll have to update that because i'm telling you you can't just tell people anything you gotta you've always gotta consider hang on if you i'm quite happy coffee zilla i am quite happy on your program your youtube program uh whatever this is what i don't know what you watch you want to call it a transmission whatever it is yes i'll give you an exclusive go ahead okay right here right now if someone if i was to catch anyone in a bin face meryl t eating a loud snack during a play i'd make them watch the movie version of cats for two years how about that wow you know you're a fair but firm leader uh count bitface i i do have to say that now okay my my slogan used to be uh strong but not entirely stable that's what i'm giving you right thank you thank you uh this is that's a good coffee still exclusive now we have people like brian rose saying they're fans of free speech but then copywriting all my videos um that are talking about anything related to him or you know really any anytime i talk about a mayoral candidate he always copyrights it how do you feel about free speech are you better than that and and after this we got to talk about sadiq khan but i imagine sadiq doesn't strike me as the free speech guy either well they're two very different people yeah brian and siddique so let's uh let's deal with them intent brian was now let's just let's just uh you know drill down into this one let's say rummage through the bin that is brian's uh meryl campaign now look you mentioned copyright now i have a little teeny weeny experience of copyright on your planet yes you can't tell me that you talking about brian is a breach of copyright it isn't right so how on earth is he able to strike a claim against you he just tells youtube that it's his content well then they listen to him yeah yeah that actually it's real i get yeah yeah absolutely so so he could do that with this broadcast now yeah we're not gonna show any images of brian or anything like that but uh i'll give you an example so i played somebody else's reporting of brian rose with this guy uh this great interviewer on mail mailplus and i played that broadcast so brian didn't own it he said he owned it and copyright claimed it anyways so these are things that he doesn't even own he'll just copyright it but can't you just say to youtube that's wrong yeah but then it takes like 15 14 days to come back up and at which point the video is already dead which means it's already dead you mean it's it's lost it's been blocked for 14 days yeah it kind of lost its uh yeah it's 14 days news old like it's a lot of news is topical ah right well uh let's get into it let's have a little chat about this is one of my problems with the with your news cycle that uh everything is so bloody instantaneous and correct everything has to be you know up now and down and now and videos keep going i mean i saw a thing you you managed to do 100 videos in a hundred days which is amazing but but it's that sense that there's so much content going up i would reassure you that if if if your video goes back up eventually and remember this election is going to be gone in like a week or so time from the time we're chatting to each other so you know the history of brian rose will outlive the uh the actual election itself by many many millennia well until the asteroid comes and gets you uh sorry about that but uh nothing i can well i could do something about it but i'm not going to that's your problem but uh yeah until that day you know brian will have to live with you and other journalists you know trenchantly examining uh what he says and whether they are true or whether they are uh porcupines but uh it's so i i would be relaxed about it i really would you know if he wants to go along and say to youtube you can't use that that's mine well he'll get found out in the end i think he will i think he will too um but my question to you is what's your policy on free speech are you about it are you like what's the galactic policy on free speech well i wouldn't charge for it for a start i think free speech should should be free and uh you know i this that's one of the reasons why i stand for election uh coffee zilla yeah or cough should i call you cough i don't i don't really know what the shot shortens versus so this is the way i see it did it i i like standing for election partly because it's a celebration of democracy i think that democracy is the single greatest political invention in the entire galaxy wow uh yeah i can guarantee you were we the first ones to invest you know what were we the first ones to invent the democracy oh no no i did but uh don't worry about that the ancient greeks caught up with me eventually but i got it you know but the point is it it's an incredible invention and you guys in certain countries are still using it and it's under attack i think that's terrible it needs defending it needs celebrating and one of the things that's wonderful about british democracy is that in the year 2021 you can stand for an election to be the mayor of the earth capital even if you wear a bin on your head and i think that's fantastic of course you have to pay 10 000 pounds for the entry fee which uh you could argue that's not exactly helping free speech but uh you know thanks to a bunch of lovely earthlings i managed to cobble the the cash together and uh here i am so free speech is very much my thing and i say i'm all for it that's a wonderful answer you're going to get a lot of votes for that one a lot of votes are coming to you from that one i figure now how much are we behind and i say we because i'm just injecting myself into your campaign um how much leech into the army injecting meter i'm joining the army how much do we need to bring forward number one to beat brian rose that's my number one goal but two to beat the whole win the whole thing outright and get one dollar croissants one quid croissants excuse me so you want you want me to beat brian rose that's what you want oh yeah oh yeah that's like the first priority yeah i mean i mean i'd love to beat brian um electorally not physically i've seen it he loves a bit of a shadow boxing there's brian i'm not looking for any uh fisty cups because i'll just shoot him with a laser if it came to that but look i i i wish brian the very best for his campaign i'll be honest with you uh he's not gonna win and uh he says he's gonna win he's not gonna win and he spent an awful lot of money and it would be much nicer if uh he'd maybe um made a lovely large donation to charity and said you know what i might as well stay at home but that's my personal view as for uh me uh winning the uh mayoral race um well that's not gonna happen either because uh you know i'm coming in from a standing start and uh the truth is i've been isolating up here on mars i haven't been doing uh much uh pressing the flash uh walking the walk because uh there's a there's a pandemic going on if you if you haven't heard and i think it's important to respect that there are bigger things going on but uh but you know uh if if i if i'd had my old name and uh the whole world still knew me as my old name yeah who knows but uh i i think that uh uh you never know account bin face score uh in somewhere of the region of two percent would be a huge landmark victory for uh waste receptacle-shaped politics in the uk if i could get five percent i would retain my ten thousand pound deposit and donate it to shelter to help combat homelessness so uh you know come on londoners you know what to do uh uh help out bin face try and beat some of the loonies and uh maybe we can uh help a good cause as well lovely jumbly lovely jubbly okay that's a great into our interview here actually i really thank you for great answers your last two answers have been wonderful um all the rest of them have been good as well thank you for coming on and sharing your big ideas sometimes i think we always say you need to think outside the box and in this case we're really going outside the galaxy and i think that's the right maybe the right place to start so uh ladies and gentlemen this has been my official endorsement for mayor of london the man himself he's full of it count been face thank you appreciate you lovely to be here all the best everyone look after yourselves stay safe and uh see you [Music] trying to sell soon on a dream but that was where you lost me wake up and smell the coffee
