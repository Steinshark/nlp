hey what's going on everybody my channel got deleted this morning this channel if you're watching right now obviously there's good news up front we're back means that i won't be exclusively uploading to the digital freedom platform like i thought i would but i still wanted to talk about sort of what happened and explain to you guys uh what's going on because many of you guys asked me what happened either you saw my channel was deleted or you missed it entirely go give me tell me what happened did brian take it down did dan lok take it down sadly it's even dumber than you can ever imagine but before we get into the story though let me just say this if this has taught me anything having my channel just deleted overnight literally it's that i have to diversify platforms so i never ask you guys but if you wouldn't mind following me on twitter and or instagram i use them occasionally but more than anything it would just help me if i had access to you guys on multiple platforms because as stupid as as it is for me to have to do like a call to action like this this has taught me that i can't just rely on youtube it's in fact it's stupid to rely on youtube and it makes it you know hugely risky just to give me a better way to contact you guys if this happens again because it very well could it's just a matter of youtube literally just snapping their fingers one day and i'm gone some bot somewhere so pitch over okay um now i can tell you guys the story starts at 5 45 a.m straight up i'm asleep i get two emails from youtube that i wake up to now bear in mind i never get emails from youtube so i'm excited i'm thinking maybe they're gonna give me some award what am i gonna get well the first one's a community guideline strike my first ever okay and if you guys don't know community guidelines strikes it's what we all agree to or the guidelines are what we agreed to when we join the website strike is what you get when you violate those guidelines right and if you get too many strikes three strikes specifically and then a warning your your whole channel is deleted okay so you start with a warning before they start accumulating the strikes and then you get three strikes and your channel gets deleted i've never even had a warning before this is my first ever thing so i wake up to this and i'm thinking that sucks i wonder what it is but no big deal right like i'm fine just one guideline strike i've got three more to go but then i get i check out the next email i'm thinking you know what is this now now maybe i'm getting my award for free speech from youtube no uh it's another email saying that my whole channel has been deleted they say quote we have reviewed your content and found severe or repeated violations of our community guidelines it's gone your channel's gone because of this we've removed your channel from youtube out of nowhere poof gone thanos snapped out of existence i mean what video could have possibly been responsible for this youtube must have carefully considered my content for just snapping me out of existence right they must have had a good reason let's check it out oh boy it's the dogecoin video that's right guys the channel that is threatening youtube is the truth about dogecoin where i made some shocking claims in their role it and if you are someone who's still a fan of dogecoin i think that's fine if you look at it for what it is which is gambling right a lot of these coins they're just like big plays that probably will die off very soon and if you know you're investing in something that's gonna fall apart i guess do what you want with your money right telling people to be responsible with their money and not to go into the hype and to be careful that'll get you deleted from the platform i can't believe it dude dogecoin did me in i thought it would be something more exciting i thought it would be brian rose coming after me some other big guru some no it's just talking about a meme coin worth like 10 cents that'll take you out that's you're done you're a danger you're a threat to society telling people not to invest in it it's the least controversial video i think i've ever done dude that's always the way it works with me it's like the less controversial i go the more i get in trouble for some reason so i wake up to this i'm like not even brushed to my teeth i haven't had my coffee yet and it's like yeah your whole livelihood is gone so i complain on twitter i appeal it and within like a few hours oh they go they tell me no we made a mistake have your channel back we're going to give it to you and we're going to reverse this strike and so even the dogecoin video you can watch it right now on my channel to see what could have possibly caused such a ruckus for youtube so now i'm back but i'm confused because i thought you had to have three strikes to get your channel deleted i only had one channel's gone and like i guess i'm grateful that they let me back on the platform that they realized this what this was but i'm only grateful in the way you can be grateful to for somebody stopping doing something that they shouldn't have been doing in the first place it's like a real toxic relationship kind of thing it's like yeah thanks for not being a jerk anymore i don't know here's a crazy idea maybe it shouldn't be possible for you to have never gotten a warning in your life from youtube and then one day wake up and your whole channel is deleted it's just impossible to feel valued by a platform that just overnight deletes your channel and then goes oh actually we're kind of fine with you can come back it's so frustrating man i don't know how this could happen and what's crazy about it is i'm almost positive it was a bot that did it because look look at the facts they email me at 5 45 two emails right in a row it's the same minute that those emails went out it's like automated so it's like hey we removed one video and then hey oh by by the way we decided the video was so bad that we deleted your whole channel so it wasn't a human doing this this is literally a bot looking at my thing and going yeah this can't be on our platform i don't know how you can allow imperfect algorithms to do this to literally take away someone's livelihood it's insane uh and i know no human could have reasonably watched that video because nothing in that video even gets close is even in the same stratosphere as what they accused me of which is to be clear violating their harmful and dangerous policies so that's basically the story in a nutshell and i'm not trying to complain too much because youtube is great for a lot of things and being a youtuber is pretty awesome so i'm not asking i'm not you know wiping my tears with dollar bills over here just like oh you know like feel bad for me no i have it pretty sweet everyone who's on youtube has it pretty sweet but the bad part of this job is that you just have zero job security you could wake up overnight have your whole channel deleted even if you followed all the rules whether it be demonetization an algorithm change or what happened to me a bot just zapping my channel you're one youtube mistake away from being gone like it's that's the part of this job that sucks this guy brandon on twitter says it best he goes imagine any other place of work doing this just texting you at 5am to fire you and you gotta beg for your job back and they're like oh yeah our bad here's your livelihood back that's pretty accurate for how it feels right now all i can really say is i am glad to be back i'm happy to be making videos for you guys and it makes me even more grateful for what i get to do but if you guys don't mind i mean again again please follow me on twitter and instagram it really helps me keep track of you i don't just want to lose everything that we've built together thanks to the community for sticking up for me a lot of people on youtube including roberto blake patty galloway uh james johnny david fuller so many people came to support me and even more people that i'm not even mentioning right now and i'm grateful for that and uh yeah i mean here's hoping it doesn't happen again either way guys i'll be back tomorrow hopefully with another video appreciate y'all see you next this ain't time it seems nothing but a trick trying to sell me on a dream but that was where you lost me wake up and smell the coffee
