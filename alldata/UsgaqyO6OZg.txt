ladies and gentlemen chess is hard but you know what makes it easier and more fun learning some really exciting chess openings that can win you games quickly that's the purpose of today's video I have been doing some digging and I discovered or rather am going to present to you an opening that many of you don't know about and this will absolutely change your perspective this will help you win a lot more games with the black pieces this video is split into three parts in the first part I will show you the opening and I've put those moves in the description you can copy them paste them into any analysis board and then I'm playing two Blitz Games I play one against a 1000 and then against an 1800 so we're covering a lot of the target audience for the opponents that you're going to be playing let's jump in and let's take a look at the absolutely venomous Rousseau Gambit so you're the Gotham subscriber the ultra Giga Chad Grandmaster 9000 rated and your opponent opens with E4 and after just three moves the Gambit begins it starts with E5 completely symmetrical stuff no Knight to F3 Knight to C6 and your opponent plays Bishop C4 now if you'd like to add this same kind of weapon and Gambit to the Spanish you can because on the third move after Bishop C4 you lash out with the move f 5 a couple of things about this move what essentially you're doing is you are giving up a pawn to try to take Central space with first E4 and then with D5 that in in and of itself is the Gambit now seasoned Veterans of Chess and those of you who play the Vienna opening will realize this is a Vienna with black and what I mean by that is just give me a moment just give me a moment if you play your kingspawn and your Queen's Knight you are playing the same type of Gambit with a knight here as you are in this opening it's essentially the same thing it is more dangerous to play this Gambit with the black pieces but that doesn't mean that it's like losing I mean it's a little more dangerous oh stockfish has some moves but that's the whole point of a game but though high risk High reward and there is a lot of risk here for white first of all if they take your Pawn you shove the pawn forward to E4 here's already a way that white can get into a terrible position they can move their Knight to any of these squares and it gets taken okay so many people here will just go back so now you play Knight to F6 you play Knight to F6 because if you play D5 right away you might get hit with this move and that's a bit scary but you're not even losing you're not even losing you have to go here and then come here but you're not even worse even if that happens but I think personally it's you know much more reasonable to do this than D5 and you have three pieces out you have three pieces out you have a better position immediately your Bishop comes out next your queen comes out somewhere and you Castle you just have a fantastic position like this so taking the pawn on F5 is no good and if your opponent plays Queen E2 trying to pin you you just do the exact same thing this this doesn't help the position for White Knight G1 Knight F6 D5 coming or Knight into D4 by the way attacking the queen and threatening oop threatening the fork so they cannot take on F5 it's not a good idea for them to take on F5 it's also not a good idea for them to play a move like Knight C3 it's a relatively rare move that move loses on the spot to takes takes and a fork GG game over the the moves that I think you're going to face the most besides taking are actually the moves that you're going to see in the practice games uh and they are D3 and D4 I think it's very human here for most players to just defend their Center because that's what they think they're supposed to do now you just develop like this a couple of things about this position um there are various ways that white will try to get in with Knight G5 to try to play like this and Knight to F7 don't be so worried about that uh I have a variation here for you you have to play D5 when they take I actually would like you to play this very aggressive move B5 very tricky stuff here of course if they do this very simple you take if we have this exchange they have triple pawns which is very funny you can capture you can kick their Night Out develop and get just a very very powerful position and then hunt these pawns down you have to do that you don't have to play D5 B5 you can just play like Knight A5 and try to grab the bishop but B5 is a very very tricky line and if they take like this you get your queen out you're hitting everything it's a very very dangerous position for white to find themselves in Knight G5 you might face uh but don't be worried you have D5 and that move is in the description for you and generally the plan here is something like this bishop C5 D6 holding this Pawn here notice how we are not taking we're holding the pawn there and something like Bishop G5 you can go here and just grab the bishop and uh when you grab that Bishop you will be able to Castle the major problem here is that you are not able to Castle but you will just grab that Bishop with Knight A5 and take it this is the setup that you want at times your dark squared Bishop will go to B4 so let's say this now I recommend pitting the Knight like if you can pin the knight in trade I like that this is the structure that you want the two knights like this the pawns like this and then we're gonna take care of business later you may face Bishop G5 um and then against this I just think attacking is very reasonable I think this is just very simple take take develop you're in good shape uh D3 is is certainly a move but it's really not a scary one you play Knight F6 if at any point they do this D5 is very nice and you have a very pleasant position the move you do need need to memorize after F5 is the move d4 this is the engine's preference it's like I'm gonna blow up the center of the board and there's a couple of ways of handling the situation here I recommend this one take on e4 the difference between taking now on e4 and in the other version is that the pawn is free so you take on e4 you attack the Knight they go here oh apologies that's not you have this uh if they take this which is the best move now you will play D5 and we actually do see this in a practice game a little bit later there is a trap here if they try to come in so quickly G6 is simply winning for black why is it winning Knight G6 oh my God that looks absolutely horrifying because you don't have to take you have Knight F6 attacking the queen and then after Queen goes back to H4 you have Knight takes D4 and black is actually winning in this position because if your opponent takes your Rook you take this and this is still hanging that's the thing this is still hanging and suddenly queensy what is mate just out of nowhere so they can't play Queen H5 which I think a lot of people are gonna play against you thinking oh and I'm gonna get to their King and if they do Bishop B5 you just have to defend your knight so defend your knight like this just defend your knight with Queen to D6 and life is good you'll attack the bishop if necessary uh and many people here will capture like this and for instance white can play Bishop F4 that's a very aggressive and scary move but after just simple A6 take take they can't really move their Knight anywhere if they move their Knight here you take and you even have this very clever trap there's this very very exotic way of playing the position if you'd like Knight G6 you can play take this and G5 and actually defending this position for white is like shockingly tricky like you don't have to play like this to sacrifice the queen for two pieces but you can and I got news for you this is not an easy position to play at all like at all there is a way that you can absolutely just obliterate white here and for instance let's say King H1 you have a long castle and mate I'm just saying like this position is super tricky to handle with the white pieces so Bishop F4 you have this you can go like this uh and you can also just slide the queen out of the way like you don't you don't even need to deal with any of that you can play Knight F6 here and Castle so what's the opening nutshell you have f moving the d-pawn one or two squares is what you'll probably face the most learn how to play Pawn takes pawn and go demolish people this opening is spectacular now let's take a look at a couple of practice games all right so for the first Blitz game so for these Blitz Games I made the time control a bit faster uh because I wanted to include two in a video and I didn't want the video to be too long the first player is going to be rated a thousand shout out to Oliveira uh for playing against me uh and uh the second player will be a little bit higher rated just so I can show you how this works at various levels so we're going to be playing our normal stuff here and uh we're only thing that I know about my opponents is that they like to play the Italian with white right so I haven't told them what I'm gonna do I'm gonna play F5 and we're gonna see what happens all right like we're gonna see how people who may have never faced this opening in their lives react so my opponent responds with D3 which is a very natural move it doesn't mean that my opponent is extremely well versed in the opening uh but uh it could mean that my opponent is just responding with the natural move now we know from the intro Knight G5 we have this D5 B5 combo that we can go for uh we know that at any moment if they take we are just going D5 and we okay Bishop G5 yeah I mean Bishop G5 is also a very reasonable move um against Bishop G5 to be honest there are many options that are okay uh even the immediate attack on the bishop uh for you know for all intents and purposes is probably completely reasonable uh you can also Play Bishop E7 to block the pin it it's really just like a matter of uh of taste it's interesting that Bishop G5 is uh is what my opponent chose to uh to pin me uh I think I think I will attack the bishop I mean it's I think it's a it's quite a natural move so now we of course have to take with the queen couple of things now so D5 now is probably not going to be possible because our Queen has lost the support here if the Knight comes to D5 that is a little bit unpleasant for sure I decided to go D6 my opponent went C3 we will look after I think Knight C3 Knight D5 was definitely quite critical and looked pretty annoying so now we're going to use our space Advantage here uh to try to create an attack and castling kingside is a little bit difficult because of the bishop uh so I mean you can even start an attack as early as now and the reason is you're still going to be able to develop and your king is relatively safe sir sorry for the cut there I I had to step away from the monitor for a second uh not for you know illegal reasons and receiving uh assistance during my game I promise um Bishop G5 is it it's it's definitely an interesting one it's not the most popular move but I can understand why it is after D3 because you just moved your pawn and you want to uh you want to pin the Knight uh to the queen uh but I I actually surprisingly I don't think it's going to be the move that you face the most uh this is actually what's called a hook so it's a pawn near a castled king that can be used as a Target so we have created a pawn trade and now we will be kicking the night out and uh we have a we still have a very strong attack here we we can leave our King honestly like the position is so strong for black that I think we don't even need to budge over here of course I can play Bishop D7 and put my Kings to Safety First there's really nothing wrong with that but I think the way we're playing this is really really nice if there was no H Pawn we would just be winning because we would put our Queen and Rook together now if my opponent tries to play F3 that's probably the most logical move to try to at least get a little bit of fight going here but F3 I'll just slide in over here and when that opens up we've got a devastating attack on the file so this is a really nice example of how in 10 moves this opening just shows you you know its power D4 is a really interesting move because it does lose a pawn but it can open up the position uh I think I'm gonna take I mean it is a free Pawn like take take yeah and then I I can take with the Knight or the queen I think I'm just gonna take with the Knights now I have one upon however I am opening up the center and right like lines to my king are going to be a bit more open but I think just blocking the check here is fine um and uh I have a really interesting Checkmate combo that could happen with my knight and queen the only thing is that I need the bishop to skedaddle somehow how am I going to do that how am I going to get the bishop to like for instance I can Fork but then in comes the queen right when the queen comes here there is this what if I play B5 I'm really hoping my opponent goes here and then I have Knight E2 check and queen H4 mate they might go here though Bishop D3 is a pretty natural defensive move though uh but we'll see oh they didn't do either of those things they just moved their Bishop now I'd like to take this but oh but but now that check is covered yeah so I should probably just take the bishop okay I mean I've won a bishop and remember we're gaining time I'm not in any danger of losing on the clock because uh I'm playing three plus two but and that now I'll I'll probably speed it up a little bit okay Queen takes B7 or rather not Queen takes B7 but just Queen B7 is played a lot of good moves here I'm gonna try to speed up because I don't have a lot of time on the clock Knight D5 now would attack my queen but it would blunder Knight E2 check um let's go here attacking the Knight and we have like various we can just finish off the attack and style very soon so um yeah so now Here Comes This Knight E2 I've been looking to land this for a while and of course danger levels the king is under attack while the queen is under attack and now no matter where my opponents goes Queen H4 is uh simply Checkmate so that was that was nice that was a nice example of handling the opening um and now as we boot this up uh yeah H6 takes takes was completely fine and then in this position uh yeah playing D6 is reasonable and if if my opponent had played Knight C3 this was the most critical way and kind of the most annoying way to defend here I had a couple of different ideas first of all I thought about just putting the bishop here uh and the logic is that when the Knight arrives I can at least you know I can I can take the Knight and I don't need to worry about it bothering me uh and I'm not really worried about moving my knight and then I would Castle definitely Knight C3 to D5 is is is a thorn but when my opponent played C3 like in the game um yeah I mean I just launched this attack and already on move eight nine it's it's a it's nearly a minus two Advantage for black in fact it is a minus two Advantage for black right like you let the engine think so it just shows you like this opening is is really really venomous Bishop G5 is uh is not a very popular move but if you just deal with this bishop it's just a welcome sight for you and you don't get your D5 stuff but you can still play D6 and uh and then create this attack I mean that's the most critical thing that you have to worry about but you just play D6 Bishop E6 and your position is uh is completely fine so that was a nice game and let's play another one game two we now go up to 1800 shout out to uh chicken nuggies uh this person is uh obviously very very strong and I don't know if they play the Italian but they asked me if they want to play the M if they're allowed to play the Evans Gambit but they have no idea that I'm okay that was uh very very very quick response so my opponent plays D4 uh I'm now going to take on e4 they are going to probably take this Pawn right so now we have D5 attacking the bishop and there's Bishop B5 right so far played very very quickly uh my opponent is uh is is playing every move that you are supposed to play which again I don't know sometimes when I select volunteers for YouTube videos they watch me play someone else and they're like oh he's gonna play this Gambit and then they they quickly learn a stockfish variation when they're watching my game hopefully they're not learning the stock was variation while they're playing the game It's Tricky Like It's tricky to select folks to play because you you never know like people are camping and preparing stuff but normally you're going to be playing against people who don't know that you're playing this this opening right so it's a kind of a nice you know it's a nice benefit to have when people know that they don't know that an opening is coming uh in any case I think my opponent has played relatively reasonably thus far uh now I need to decide what to do after a short Castle I want to play Knight F6 I don't see anything wrong with this move let's just develop and uh of course Bishop F4 here is a very natural move to set up very bad intentions against uh against my queen okay F3 also seems reasonable I really like the concept of attacking like this to try to Target the rook and kind of make it shift off its Square so let's do that let's play Bishop A6 that just straight up attacks the rook and we're not really hoping that our opponent blunders The Rook although that is very reasonable we mostly just want the Rook off of the f file and now I would like to play something like Bishop E7 and just castle like again my king is a little bit suspicious through the opening so this is kind of the the best option for me don't take with the Knight because well actually it doesn't even look that bad to take with the Knight I was thinking you know why don't I take with the Knight I'm trying to be a little a little risky here yeah let's do it night takes maybe a bit too dangerous but it's okay we're gonna try to play with our open up file yeah now I actually think I don't even need to take what if I just play castles and if take take Rook takes I have Rook F1 at the end so look look at how powerful this Gambit is whoa my opponent blenders Rook F1 Oh What A Move look at my Bishop I think my opponent's playing a little fast I think they're playing a little too quickly uh and they just uh they did not really respect my my position that much they probably should have because I have a very strong position all right let's bring the Rook with check it's not over I have a queen for a rook and a bishop um rook in the Knight but uh it's it's close to over especially because the queen is just such a powerful piece it can Target everything and the way you win with the queen against such a array of pieces is you need to make sure they don't get into the game so I'm gonna continue to create threats and post problems for my opponent before they are able to get their other pieces involved for instance I would love to get my queen to the back rank right and the way to do that would be to break through this somehow uh that's a good start Queen takes D4 right so now oh oh oh oh it's it's over actually it's over because when the king slides over here I have a very very very famous idea which is a back rank checkmate and I can take the Knight I can play Queen takes that's a very nice idea and now it's yeah it's just totally over again within 20 moves against a very very good player this is an eight this is an 1800 all right this is this player might be higher rated than like most of most of the folks watching all right um I guess what can I mean we have many many good moves here uh uh let's oh I'm like spoiled for Choice okay Queen here um I think Rook D1 will be played Queen D6 was not a great move but it was it's okay uh but it's just over I mean we just have a queen for a rook no questions asked um I'm gonna go here I guess attacking the rook and of course if I can trade the queen for both Rooks easy win because I just have right I'm just left with a massive massive piece I think I can even sacrifice probably sacrificing is the way to go here to open up the position uh which I guess I will do the ads is not really necessary but the king is so open that it should be sufficient but it is a little it could backfire it could backfire if I don't win right away I have check I have check I have check I also am threatening to play Rook F2 like this is this is probably the most clinical way to do this but it's not completely required uh it's not completely required to play like this but anyway this goes to show you like this opening is you know seriously no joke uh it it's uh it's a really really powerful weapon how do I do this let's give a check I almost don't want to trade the Rooks let's give a check how do I ah I figured it out I might have another way but I have this and I can Fork The Rook in the bishop like this there you go I am I'm using my queen I had other ways probably I could have probably checked but yeah it's uh now it's just I can even by the way just fully fully instructional I can't even do this and it's three on three but I have two pass pawns over here so it's just over I'm just gonna bring my king uh very instructional how to just simplify and uh these two pawns will just survive white cannot come and take me so now I will go over there and this is of course no longer the Russo Gambit but it's just showing you the power of the opening uh and how to get a totally winning position and um convert it of course I do not need to worry about the pawn C3 C2 and if this one gets taken I'm not really concerned just don't stalemate by far the easiest way to win here is to give a check and to make two queens and even something like this just cutting the king off in a box just don't stalemate cutting the king off in a box making the Box quite small and my opponent resigns because Checkmate will be delivered promptly uh thank you for the game that was a that was a nice game and my opponent actually both of my opponents in today's video played the best move I mean they played D3 or D4 my opponent played this and then Bishop B5 but here they were they were unaware of you know the kind of critical approach or what have you and they played takes takes and then just castled and yeah I mean after Knight F6 I just got what looked like a relatively you know good position I mean Bishop A6 might have been a little bit provocative but still got them to go here and it seemed like I had just a very very pleasant position from the early opening uh that resulted in this and I mean I I was already very happy I was already very happy with the Rook I was very happy with this and like everything in these practice games goes to show you that even if players play what's what's the best move according to the engine they're not guaranteed an easy game at all they can blunder very very quickly uh and yeah I mean F5 is F5 is potent and I mean this is what I'm saying uh this Gambit may may serve you very well may get you a lot of very interesting games and a lot of very interesting wins and the app moves are in the description for you to play around with uh yeah all the best good luck now get out of here
