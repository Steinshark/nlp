rarely do we witness a fall from grace so quick so complete that someone goes from being beloved to a con man in the eyes of the public overnight and from the outside looking in it's strange because every single thing that person has ever said or done is suddenly cast in a new much more Sinister light the only comparison I can really think of is Jared Fogle from Subway I mean all those times he took his pants off and paraded them in front of the children how did we not see this as a sign it's like looking at one of those white and gold dress optical illusions suddenly you see it as you know black and blue and you wonder with this like sudden shift it's so quick that you're like how did I ever see it any differently and that's what we're talking about today but with a scam artist Alex machinski because he's not in trouble for the same reasons Jared Fogle was but he did screw over a lot of people he shouldn't now you may know Alex machinski because we've talked about him on this program he's the former CEO of Celsius and I'm not going to cover everything he did because we we already have talked about it extensively however there's a lot of new news to cover for one Alex machinski stepped down as the CEO for two we found out they owed billions of dollars more than we thought they did three we know the customer funds are still frozen but the real new evidence coming out that in my view takes Alex machinski from being a slick salesman who you know basically over promised to being a full-blown Criminal Who should be in jail it just recently happened although I need to make a disclaimer that this is of course my opinion that he's a criminal he has not been formally charged although I think a lot of you will share my view once I get through explaining this here's how it happened four days ago we got a report from the financial times a scoop that Alex machinski may have withdrawn 10 million dollars off Celsius ahead of freezing customer accounts and ahead of the bankruptcy this obviously would be very significant and very suspicious but of course I wanted to wait until this was confirmed by formal bankruptcy documents and it was in bankruptcy court Celsius was required to disclose what their Executives did leading up to bankruptcy and what we found is that in the month of May the month before they froze withdrawals and declared bankruptcy Alex machinski and other key Executives in Celsius withdrew nearly 17 million dollars from this platform Alex himself withdrew 10 million dollars of that Chrissy his wife withdrew two million dollars remember she's the one who said unbankrupt yourself and sold shirts to that effect which is a level of irony that I simply do not have the time to unpack right now but suffice to say other Executives also withdrew another five million dollars now okay why is this criminal why can't they withdraw all this money from their own platform well think about it celsius's whole problem was that it was suffering from a bank run too many people were withdrawing too fast and instead of acting as the captain going down with the ship Alex machinski instead basically did the analogy equivalent of of jumping in a Lifeboat but what's worse he actually did this well deliberately lying to the people on the boat and told them that everything's fine in order to ensure his own safety and ensure that he had a Lifeboat to even get on because as the analogy goes lifeboats were in short supply they didn't have the money but let's dig deeper than that because if we look at the bankruptcy filings we can get an entire history of Alex machinsky's transactions which is important to prove motive after all if he was always withdrawing funds it wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary but as you can see on this fourth column which is type incoming or outgoing from Celsius machinski's pattern was that he only really sent money to Celsius and did keep most of his money there on platform which is consistent through 2021 and early 2022 until March 17th when mashinski starts his first outgoing withdrawals from the platform now at first it's only a hundred thousand dollars however this pattern drastically changes once again in May after the Luna crash when the markets are in turmoil and Celsius realizes they're insolvent now to understand the true scumbaggery of this whole thing let me show you what Alex was saying publicly before I show you what he was doing privately and I continued to huddle it's not like I've changed my position I didn't sell my Bitcoin I didn't sell my ethereum it's not like one of us is smarter than everybody else and they're sitting on the sidelines while the rest of us are taking a beating now look there is a lot here to unpack from the phone number on screen 1-866 hoddle now to his shirt saying that banks are not your friends uh to his incredibly strong claim that he's not secretly sell it you know in fact he's bi he's bullish right you should be bullish to all of this to a reasonable investor conveys the idea that we're all in this together this is some choppy water but we're gonna get through it right don't head for the life rafts it's fine there's no Iceberg ahead now with that in mind I want you to now look at what he was doing a day after this on May 14th he was privately withdrawing nearly all his crypto from the platform 10 million dollars in Bitcoin usdc and ethereum he jumped on the Lifeboat and left this honestly Border Lines on this Psychopathic are sociopathic I do not know how you can sit on stage and speak to a community of your investors of your customers and just dead lie to them and do the opposite behind the scenes but maybe some of you think well that was a day later maybe he changed his mind just 24 hours later but there's actually proof that no that's not true he was deliberately lying because we're going to look at what Alex said only a few days after Jumping Ship right so we're looking at before he jumped ship and after this is from May 20th and it is staggering uh keep thinking that okay we we say one thing and we do something else we're all we all still have most of our coins right we didn't uh we didn't sell we didn't bail out we didn't go and look for another job we're in it for the long term as Nook said we've done several of these Winters and we're still gonna be here in in in several years from now I don't know what to say I'm Blown Away Alex machinski is saying in black and white that you know we're not we're not saying one thing and doing another uh we're we're doing exactly what we want you to do we're hodling right we're not bailing out even though that's exactly what he actually did this man is a master of lying through his teeth and what this all shows is that there is strong evidence that Alex knew Celsius wasn't going to be around in several years even though he said he thought it was because if you thought your company was going to be around in seven years or several years the last thing you would do is withdraw because celsius's entire problem remember is immediate liquidity they didn't have enough money on hand so if Alex truly thought and believed what he said he did which is that it was going to last several years the last thing you would do is withdraw critical funds exactly when you need them so this fact that he was secretly withdrawing means that he knew he was applying to investors and the company was about to go under for good and he was trying to save himself I mean pretty sure he didn't even call one eight six six huddle now uh okay that's bad joke but on a serious note um this just made me so angry that I decided I wanted to help and I wanted to use these exact transactions and transfers in order to try to correlate them to on-chain transfers and figure out where the money went in hopes that we could maybe salvage some of it and I'll tell you even though I was unable to find Alex machinski's specific wallets I do have some good news which is that I found his wife Chrissy machinski's wallets let me explain I cross-referenced Chrissy machinski's May 31st withdrawal of 2.4 million Celsius tokens against all of Celsius hot wallets and found that on that day there's only one similar transaction within 10 Celsius tokens if you trace where this went it goes to a wallet which already is associated with Alex machinski machinski literally funded it with ethereum initially and this is where 2.7 million dollars worth of Celsius tokens went bear in mind it's important this is only days before they froze withdrawals showing that they wanted to get money off platform and although it hasn't been sold yet it can be sold at any time and the reason I'm sharing this wallet publicly is I want to recommend that this is basically claimed by the bankruptcy court or seized because it's very likely that it will be sold by the machinski's with upcoming pressure increasing now I will link this wallet in the description so it can be publicly watched and tracked by law enforcement or just anyone who's interested I will also add the machinski wallets that I've publicly labeled along with several others I wish nothing but the best for the victims out there if you enjoy High effort investigations like this please understand uh I put a lot of my time into this so pumping the stock is very much appreciated if you want to catch up with the whole Celsius Saga you can do so here but either way thanks for watching and all the best to all of you except for Alex and Chrissy mashinsky
